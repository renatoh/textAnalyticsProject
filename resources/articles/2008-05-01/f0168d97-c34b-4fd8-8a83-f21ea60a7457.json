In the most inconvenient manner, Makelele's normally exquisite timing - which so often leaves opponents wondering where the ball has gone - had let him down. For a man who has made a career out of clearing up problems caused by his colleagues' errors, and whose sheer neatness so often takes the eye, this was both bizarrely out of character and prejudicial to his reputation as a players' player. It was Zinedine Zidane who posed the rhetorical question, when Real Madrid let Makelele go to Chelsea in order to buy David Beckham from Manchester United in the summer of 2003, \"Why put another layer of gold paint on the Bentley when you are losing the engine?\" When the Frenchman arrived at Stamford Bridge, Zidane's words made at least one of his new team-mates sit up and take notice. \"I didn't know Maka when he was at Real Madrid,\" Lampard said yesterday, \"but when I heard Zidane say that I was interested to know what he meant. In the last five years, I've found out. He's an absolute dream to play with, especially if you're an attacking midfield player. He's one of the greatest midfield players in the world, he has been for a long time, and all of us players know exactly why.\" It was Zidane who, at Real Madrid eight years ago, persuaded Makelele to adapt the way he approached the game. Previously an attacking midfielder, the new arrival from Celta Vigo dropped back to become, in effect, Zidane's bodyguard. Now the ability to read the game learned first from his father, a Zaire international, and then gathered from his own 16-year professional career with clubs in France, Spain and England will be a key element of Chelsea's attempt to turn defence into attack in Moscow tonight. His importance to Avram Grant can be seen from the season's statistics, which show that although he has made only 18 league appearances, three of them as a substitute, and played barely 100 minutes of a six-match League Cup campaign, he has started all but one of the club's 12 Champions League fixtures - the exception being the final group match against Valencia, when qualification was assured and he came on at half-time. In each of the other matches he played the full 90 minutes. This is the competition for which his 35-year-old legs have been saved. In the entire history of English football, Makelele is probably the only man to have a position named after him, even though, in world terms, he was not its inventor. England had always nurtured tough defensive wing-halves but was slow to recognise the significance of the role in modern football of the centrally positioned holding midfielder. And to English eyes, at least, no one has refined the demands of the job to such a pitch of perfection as the little man who was born in Kinshasa and moved to a Paris suburb at the age of four. Makelele left home in his early teens to join Brest's centre de formation. At the age of 18 he signed with Nantes, where he came under the influence of Jean-Claude Suaudeau, the coach who had supervised the early careers of Marcel Desailly and Didier Deschamps. There he won the French championship in 1995 and a year later reached the Champions League semi-final. A season with Marseille and two with Celta Vigo led, in 2000, to Madrid. Two years later he was in the team that beat Bayer Leverkusen at Hampden Park, but at the end of the following season, when Vicente del Bosque was being ejected to make way for the arrival of Carlos Queiroz from Manchester United, he was sold to Chelsea for a fee of \u00a316.6m. The dressing room was appalled by the willingness of the president, Florentino P\u00e9rez, to jettison so valuable a player. \"We will not miss Makelele,\" P\u00e9rez said, vainly attempting to justify one of the worst decisions in the game's history. \"His technique is average, he lacks the speed and skill to take the ball past opponents, and 90% of his distribution either goes backwards or sideways.\" Makelele's impact at Stamford Bridge was not immediate, but by the time of Jose Mourinho's arrival in 2004 he had become a vital figure. Now, living in Wimbledon with his wife, the model No\u00e9mie Lenoir, and their three-year-old son, he has two years left on his Chelsea contract and employs a shrewd economy of movement to get him through matches. Those three-metre passes so unwisely derided by P\u00e9rez are the oil in the gearbox of a team who, with one possible exception after last night's incident, know exactly how much they owe to his discreet mastery."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
