In a strapline across the page, the Mirror denounces the \u201cRace for No 10 shambles\u201d. The Metro has the same \u201cCarrie on\u201d pun in its main headline while the i has; \u201cJohnson breaks his silence but refuses to discuss his \u2018loved ones\u2019\u201d. The Telegraph is more sympathetic to its star columnist and leads with a headline saying: \u201cBoris tries to keep the show on the road\u201d. However, it also splashes the lovers picture on its front page and says that while the \u201cpicture paints a thousand words\u201d it \u201craises many more questions\u201d. Not every paper uses the picture but they still report on the Tory leadership dramas. The Guardian has: \u201cJohnson plans media blitz as Hunt calls him a \u2018bottler\u2019\u201d and the Times says \u201c\u2018Cowardly\u2019 Johnson launches fightback\u201d. The Express calls in arch-Brexiter Jacob Rees-Mogg to rally to Johnson\u2019s defence with a splash saying: \u201cTime to stop the war on Boris\u201d. The Mail features the picture of Johnson and Symonds and a deeply unimpressed headline: \u201cBoris and the Mills &amp; Boon scene that takes us all for fools\u201d, though its main story is \u201cYour \u00a32.4m bill to do up Meghan and Harry\u2019s cottage\u201d. As is the Sun\u2019s: \u201cHarry\u2019s $2.4m home Megover\u201d. The FT also has a front-page stry on the Tory leadership frontrunner, but it is about what he might do if he reaches No 10. It says: \u201cJohnson\u2019s tax plans would cost \u00a320bn and risk prlonging austerity, says IFS.\u201d It\u2019s main story, however, is about events in the Middle East: \u201cTrump raises stakes with fresh sanctions on Iran\u2019s supreme leader.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
