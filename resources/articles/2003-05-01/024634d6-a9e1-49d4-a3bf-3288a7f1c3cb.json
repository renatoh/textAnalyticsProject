Simon Schama's televisual way of describing, re-enacting and reassessing the history of Britain went down famously with critics and viewers recently, though I sometimes wished he'd spare us the scenery and get on with the story. Eureka! This is Schama the consummate storyteller spinning yarns about the key players and events of our past and giving us a coherent picture with all the dots joined up - from the seaside villages of prehistoric Orcadians circa 5,000BC to the crowds thronging London for the funeral of Princess Diana. Historians are as individual as chefs. Churchill's History of the English Speaking Peoples is as weighty as the author. Norman Davies's Europe: A History has so many inserts and footnotes that I lost the plot. Schama concentrates on characters: he's the master of the thumbnail sketch. Here's the turbulent priest: \"Becket was the first Londoner to make a serious mark... with an instinctive flair for... display and costume, the getting and spending of money, theatre and even though his stomach was delicate, fine food and drink. He was street smart and book smart, a big league performer.\" And Lord Curzon: \"Someone described him as having the complexion of a milkmaid and the stature of Apollo. The viceroy's bearing was conspicuously erect, the ramrod posture only partly the effect of the steel and leather back-brace he had been forced to wear since adolescence. Every day he composed himself into an expression of stoic indifference to discomfort. It was the perfect pose of paramountcy - the burden that weighed but did not crush.\" Schama wisely declined to read the book himself; his voice is too light and chatty for an epic. Timothy West's - clear, measured and intelligent - hits the spot exactly. Selections from the Diary of Samuel Pepys, (4hrs, Naxos, \u00a311.99) With all the praise heaped on Clare Tomalin's recent biography, it's easy to forget that the masterpiece is the diary itself. These delightful excerpts will whet your appetite for the complete work. Pepys reveals himself as ambitious, gregarious, libidinous, sentimental and, above all, honest. Michael Mallone's reading encompasses it all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
