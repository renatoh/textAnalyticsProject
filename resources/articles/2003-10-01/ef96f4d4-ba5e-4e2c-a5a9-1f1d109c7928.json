Pardew introduced himself to the players in the dressing room before the game. He then took a seat in the stands with his family, leaving Trevor Brooking in charge of the team for one last time. The players introduced themselves with a typically enigmatic performance - they should have scored a dozen but could easily have lost. Brooking correctly pointed out that Pardew will have to be a strong character \"to handle a club like West Ham.\" Chance after chance went begging, mostly because Jermaine Defoe's outstanding approach play was spoiled by his ordinary finishing, while his team-mates were thwarted by an inspired display from Brian Jensen in the Burnley goal. The West Ham defence wobbled whenever Burnley broke and twice collapsed to give the visitors a point. It was the sort of performance that must make it a relief for Brooking to be handing over the reins to a new manager. He said: \"It was great for Alan to see some of the frailties we have. Dropping four points this week is a general reality check that we're certainly not the finished article.\" The boos that rang around the ground at the final whistle are another reminder of the task Pardew faces, but Brooking hopes that the Upton Park faithful will give him their full support. \"It's important for the fans to realise that Alan has got a job on and he is not just going to come here and march up [the league],\" he said. \"He has to make changes and improve the team. I'm sure he will but everyone needs to get behind him and give him time because there is work to be done.\" Time is a luxury Pardew does not have in abundance. West Ham have four games in the next 13 days which means it may be well into November before he can make an impact. By that time he will hope to have eradicated the errors that cost the Hammers two of the three points. David Connolly's goal after 20 minutes should have opened the floodgates but lax concentration presented goals to Delroy Facey and Ian Moore. Only a late volley by the substitute Don Hutchison prevented Burnley from entirely ruining both Brooking's send-off and Pardew's arrival. Man of the Match : Brian Jensen (Burnley)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
