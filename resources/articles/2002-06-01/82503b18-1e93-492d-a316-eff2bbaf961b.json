Bits of data, scattered across websites, mobile phone records, ISPs, credit card companies and email services. Whatever I do these days seems to leave a vast data trail. Shopping at Amazon, sending an email or text, reading the news on the web or that daily delve into a search engine - data mushrooms around me. It's a byproduct of the electronic lives we are all living, and to be frank it's generally pretty banal stuff: the time I logged on, email trivia, a shopping list, World Cup scores, music downloads. But it's my banal stuff and I like it that way. Hardly the stuff of spy novels. I get to choose who I share it with and if I have an issue with privacy then data protection laws give me more than enough muscle to fight back. At least they did until now, because this has been a bad month for privacy. Very bad. It's also been a very different month because while the privacy debate is usually dominated by commercial use of data, it's now government use that has emerged as the real concern. Civil liberties have clashed with security and lost. Political pressure has suddenly driven us at a racing pace along the road to Orwell's vision. We have been powerless passengers as four waves of legislation remove privacy and freedoms on an almost unthinkable scale. The journey began two years ago with the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIP). It was a watershed, giving government agencies access to your personal \"traffic data\" - the phone numbers you call, the addresses you email, the location of your mobile phone - and it did so without the need for a judicial warrant. That set heavyweight precedents and marked a complete break with all the safeguards in place for the same monitoring activities in the physical world. It may have held back from allowing access to the internal content of a given message, but the traffic data itself can often reveal just as much. As the explosion of personal data continues, and data profiling tools themselves grow, traffic data will be easily translated into detailed personal profiles. Then came the UK's anti-terrorism crime and security bill introducing emergency legislation following the terrorist attacks of September 11, giving police sweeping powers and opening the door to retention of data that security agencies could then access in the future. For the next part of the journey, travel to Brussels. A growing split appeared in this year's debates at the European parliament in the run-up to last month's electronic communication vote. On the one hand MEPs were wrestling with how to take the protection of consumer data such as email addresses and anonymous internet cookies to even greater heights, stubbornly ignoring that the balance of power had shifted towards the consumer anyway. As individuals, we are the ones in the driving seat now. If a company abuses email addresses it will lose customers and its business. Indeed by the time the debate on cookies reached a vote, most internet browsers had a whole privacy toolbox putting web users firmly in control when it came to deciding what cookies to accept. Again, no need for regulation. Yet in the very same directive the European parliament laid down a blueprint for the deepest and most extensive Orwellian tracking ever conceived. The data retention articles create a framework for surveillance but instead of one big brother, thousands of \"baby brothers\" would record tiny slices of our digital lives unlocked by a single key. Millions of data banks of emails, mobile phone calls, websites, all searchable without much justification. It's no wonder so many people are enraged. And this month the journey went back to the RIP act. Libertarians' arguments that any system would be open to abuse and extension were once readily brushed aside as alarmist and paranoid. But the past few weeks brought vindication, though no one is celebrating. The new draft order being debated by MPs threatens to hand the keys to this data to just about any junior manager from the health service to a local authority or even the post office and still requires no judicial approval. While each shopping list and mobile phone call may be trivial, collectively this data is the shadow of our lives. It covers everything we do, say and think, and increasingly will form a perfect picture of who we are. Before it was fragmented, often destroyed quickly and its very use was restricted by data protection law and judicial approval. These four initiatives change everything: all data will be retained, its search will be easier, more people will have access, controls will be weaker, uses much wider, and with time the whole process is bound to become more routine. \u00b7 Danny Meadows-Klue is chairman and chief executive of the Interactive Advertising Bureau, www.iabuk.net"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
