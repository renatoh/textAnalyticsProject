They said our sights were set too high. They said this country was too divided, too disillusioned to ever come together around a common purpose. But on this January night, at this defining moment in history, you have done what the cynics said we couldn't do. Years from now, you'll look back and you'll say that this was the moment, this was the place where America remembered what it means to hope. ' Barack Obama 'What is most important now is that, as we go on with this contest, that we keep focused on the two big issues. How will we win in November 2008? By nominating a candidate who will be able to go the distance. And who will be the best president on day one? I am ready for that contest. We have a long way to go, but I am confident and optimistic.' Hillary Clinton 'You know ... you win the silver in one event, it doesn't mean you are not going to come back and win the gold in the final event. That is what we are going to do.' Mitt Romney 'The status quo is yesterday and change is tomorrow. I am not the candidate of money, I am not the candidate of glitz, I am not the candidate of glamour. I am the candidate who will fight with every fibre of my being for you, for your children and for your grandchildren.' John Edwards 'Tonight we proved that American politics is still in the hands of ordinary folks like you. A new day is needed in American politics, just like a new day is needed in American government. It starts here, but it doesn't end here.'
