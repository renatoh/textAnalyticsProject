The Portuguese midfielder is making positive progress, according to his manager Harry Redknapp. \"He's feeling a lot better,\" Redknapp told BBC Radio Five Live yesterday. \"He's had the scans and all the tests and it doesn't look too bad.\" Mendes's club-mate Richard Hughes has been reminded of his responsibilities by the Football Association after it emerged that he bet last December on Redknapp returning to Fratton Park as manager. An FA spokesman said: \"There is no suggestion Richard Hughes had inside information and passed it on to others, but he was reminded of his responsibilities with regard to the rules about players betting.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
