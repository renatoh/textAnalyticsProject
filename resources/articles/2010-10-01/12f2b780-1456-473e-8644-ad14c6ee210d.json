Adam Johnson, 2010", "bodyText": "Click to enlarge, and debate the strip below the line. Keith Hackett's verdict 1) No \u2013 unless one of their players first puts on the yellow jersey and identifies himself as their goalkeeper. He can play outfield if he likes, but a team must always have an identified goalkeeper \u2013 the only player allowed to handle the ball inside their penalty area. Thanks to Brianna Glynn for the question. 2) Award the goal. Because of your assistant's positioning, the ball did not go out \u2013 and as you and your assistants are considered part of the game, play continues. You should remind him to run behind the line, though, to avoid incidents like this. Thanks to Petri Somerkari. 3) Technically you could dismiss both defenders for denying an obvious goalscoring opportunity \u2013 at which point you would have to abandon the game as their team would have fewer than seven players. But in practice, referees are advised in these circumstances to make a call on which offence occurred a fraction before the other \u2013 very rarely do two offences happen at precisely the same time. So make your decision, send one player off, and restart with a penalty. Only if the offences had involved any degree of violence would you dismiss both players and call the game off.
