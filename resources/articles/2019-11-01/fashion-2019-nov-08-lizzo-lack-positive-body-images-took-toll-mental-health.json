We were just selling ourselves and selling ourselves on the idea \u2013 selling ourselves on ourselves.\u201d Interviewed in the latest edition of British Vogue, the classically trained singer also reveals the anxiety that fuels her turbo-charged performances. \u201cWhen I get really, really anxious before a show, I just go harder and harder and harder when I\u2019m performing and I just go crazy,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but my anxiety sometimes fuels who I am as a performer and who I am as an artist. I don\u2019t know if my body just, like, out of a desperate need to find a place for my anxiety or find a use for it, takes it and puts it there.\u201d The December issue of Vogue, which features Lizzo wearing a black bustier dress by Versace, an Adrienne Landau feather boa and Chopard earrings on the cover, marks the two-year anniversary of Edward Enninful\u2019s editorship. It has two cover stars, the other being the actor Emma Watson, but the choice of Lizzo underlines Enninful\u2019s commitment to championing diversity: His first cover featured the Ghanaian-British model Adwoa Aboah, while later cover stars have included Jourdan Dunn, Naomi Campbell and Zo\u00eb Kravitz. \u201cSeeing such a positive force for good on our cover in all her glory makes me realise how far we have come. I\u2019m so pleased that inclusivity remains at the core of British Vogue,\u201d Enninful wrote on Instagram. He added: \u201cSeeing someone as amazing as Lizzo on a magazine cover has at last begun to feel normal. How incredible is that?\u201d Earlier this year, Lizzo\u2019s song Truth Hurts went to number one on the US Billboard charts, making her the first solo black female singer to achieve the feat since Rihanna in 2012."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
