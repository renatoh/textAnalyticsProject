Everton's defence and midfield were pulled about far more than they'd have wanted and Steven Gerrard had much better passing angles. With El-Hadji Diouf wide right, Harry Kewell wide left and Vladimir Smicer getting forward from central midfield, Houllier put out the most adventurous line-up I have seen during his time at Anfield. Kewell drifted infield cleverly at times and, while there wasn't a stream of crosses from him and Diouf, they drew opponents out wide, pulled people about and created space for Gerrard, Smicer, Michael Owen and Milan Baros. When Liverpool play narrow, teams can basically defend just the width of the penalty area and keep things very compact at the back and in midfield. Then it's hard for Liverpool to break them down. Their forward players are tightly marked and Gerrard ends up playing little poky balls which teams can scramble out. They end up relying on a bit of magic, a lucky bounce or a defensive mistake. With the wide players, Everton couldn't stay so compact and Gerrard had far better passing options. Typically, he would move the ball wide to Diouf, who was very effective early on. Straight away Gary Naysmith got drawn out and so did David Unsworth as cover because Diouf had the beating of Naysmith. Diouf then had options - he could take on his markers and try to get a cross in, look to pick out Baros, who now has a lot more space, or sweep a pass back for Gerrard to change the play. Picking out Gerrard might seem negative but that's not the case. He could look to find Smicer or Baros or knock a pass to Kewell on the other flank, which would have Everton stretched again. If Liverpool play a better team than Everton, particularly one with an explosive central midfielder, they might not be able to go with Smicer and two wide players because a more solid citizen might be needed alongside Gerrard. But we saw on Saturday what width can offer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
