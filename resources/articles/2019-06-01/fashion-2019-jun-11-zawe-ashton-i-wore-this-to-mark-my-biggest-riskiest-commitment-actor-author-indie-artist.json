It seemed to vibrate all the things that I wanted to vibrate; I still felt like myself, but also like the elevated author character that I was having to play. It\u2019s a trouser suit by Roksanda with wide culotte trousers. It has a silk scarf that goes through the suit and trails out the bottom, which felt very sophisticated and \u201cfrom another time\u201d. This look is very me \u2013 quirky details follow me through the more elevated moments of my everyday wardrobe. I like clothes that feel fresh and surprising. It has taken a long time for me to really dress as the artist that I am: I\u2019m an indie girl, I like experimental, I like things to be subverted. Details are the fun part. My best friend stayed over the night before the launch, and she said: \u201cWhy do I feel like I\u2019m on my way to your wedding?\u201d Right now, that suit does feel like my wedding dress, because it\u2019s what I wore to mark the biggest, riskiest commitment of my life. Nowadays, I\u2019ve got more of a signature style on the red carpet, as well as more of a sense of the trends that I feel good in and where I like to shop. The characters I have played are often called out for their style, especially Vod [from Fresh Meat]. She became a bit of a cultural style icon, which was incredible, but people don\u2019t expect me to turn up looking like her now \u2013 I don\u2019t have a shaved head, for a start. What a character wears and how it affects their mood and their movements has always been very important to me. A character\u2019s clothes, if they\u2019re truthful, can make audiences feel something. The same can be said when it comes to makeup. I have spoken before about the need for the beauty industry to become more inclusive and wearable \u2013 some brands have come a long way, but there is always more progress to be made. It\u2019s wonderful that newer brands such as Fenty are making clear statements about being for all skin tones. Character Breakdown by Zawe Ashton is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (\u00a316.99).
