One was Jack Rodwell, right, spoiling his debut with the mistake that led to Southampton's second goal after a \u00a315m transfer from Everton. The other was not technically foreign to this parish: Carlos Tevez 2.0, who is promising to be all the good things, and none of the bad, that any \u00a3250,000-a-week forward should be. His first half in particular here illustrated how and why. Five minutes after Sergio Ag\u00fcero was carried off with a knee injury \u2013 he requires tests to assess its gravity \u2013 Tevez twisted beyond Jos Hooiveld and the former Celtic stopper dragged him down. Howard Webb pointed to the spot and David Silva failed to convert. A strong suspicion is that Tevez would not have done so. In the closing moments of the first half the 28-year-old showed Silva how to finish. The only question mark here over Tevez, as Samir Nasri deftly played a pass along the inside-right plane, consisted of whether the forward was offside. The officials ruled no \u2013 replays suggested otherwise \u2013 and after the ball bounced he pulled the trigger to beat Kelvin Davis. The celebration consisted of Tevez revealing a T-shirt with the legend \"Lugano 1 v 2\", perhaps in reference to the Villa Lugano barrio in his native Buenos Aires. With more than four minutes into the time added due to Ag\u00fcero's injury, Tevez was still careering at Southampton, the striker making a couple of forays along the right that had Nigel Adkins' band scrambling. According to Tevez and Roberto Mancini, this season will feature the second coming of El Apache. Gone will be the shenanigans of the turbulent years that ran from 2010 to early 2012 and featured transfer requests, homesickness and last September's falling out with Mancini that made the idea of him appearing again for City seem nonsensical. After Tevez's public and personal apology, to the manager and his team-mates, and a full pre-season, a newfound stability is being trumpeted. The Argentinian's family all now live here and his children have been enrolled at local schools, while Tevez is leaner than he has been since entering English football at West Ham United six years ago. A few days after scoring a superb 20-yarder in City's 3-2 Community Shield win over Chelsea Tevez said: \"I am feeling very good, I did all the pre-season and the truth is I am feeling great at the moment. The pre-season games went very well, I was pleased with how I played and I am looking forward to the start of the Premier League and to start playing. \"This is the best I have ever felt ahead of a new season because for the first time in four or five years I have had a full month of pre-season training. This has not happened in previous years because of national team commitments, so I am feeling in very good shape.\" Before this 3-2 win for City, Mancini's take in his programme notes on the new Tevez was: \"Lots of people have been talking about Carlos Tevez this summer and he had worked very well. His form is better than last year. \"He wants to play football. He is now 100% fit. This is the first time in four years we have had him this fit. I am very happy because Carlos this year has worked very well in pre-season and his form is better. He scored a fantastic goal in the Community Shield. I expect him to be a very important player.\" Mancini had been rather less effusive about the signing of Rodwell. On 67 minutes the midfielder suggested why the Italian has been keen to state that he has much to learn. From an attacking position just outside the Southampton area, Rodwell misplaced a regulation pass to Adam Lallana, who ran the length of the field before setting up Steve Davis's goal. As he shook his head at this schoolboy error Rodwell could no doubt hear the Mancini soundtrack that has accompanied his arrival, which he repeated again in the programme notes: \"We welcome Jack Rodwell to our squad. He is a good player and a versatile player who is just 21 years old. He is an England international with great potential and did well at Everton but he knows that he has improvements to make and hard work in front of him over the next few years.\" Rodwell will have other, better days for Manchester City in the future. For the moment Tevez is City's present, as his standing ovation when departing near the end showed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
