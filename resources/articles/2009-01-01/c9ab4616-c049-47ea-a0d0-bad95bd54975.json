Tottenham followed up their interest in Downing by proposing a deal of an initial \u00a311m, rising to a possible \u00a313m. But Boro, who received a transfer request from the 24-year-old today, said they would not allow him to leave him at any price. \"We received a written transfer request from Stewart this morning. It was considered before being rejected,\" said the chief executive, Keith Lamb. \"Prior to receiving the request we received an improved offer for Stewart from Tottenham. We immediately rejected this offer and informed Tottenham that Stewart Downing is not for sale and any further interest they have in the player will not be entertained.\" Downing asked for a transfer when he heard that Steve Gibson, Boro's chairman, had on Saturday rejected the second of three Tottenham bids for him and told the chairman, Daniel Levy, that he would not countenance a transfer this month. The latest offer has been described as \"fantastic\" by Harry Redknapp, Tottenham's manager. Regardless of a potential financial windfall, Boro are reluctant to sell their best player to another club fighting against relegation. For all their public protestations about wanting to keep Downing, they may be privately delighted if a third party enters the equation with a bid to trump anything Spurs can match. Southgate and Gibson are infuriated by what they regard as deliberate attempts to unsettle the England international on Tottenham's part. The winger's father, Stewart Sr, who acts as his representative, said: \"Stewart has been frustrated since the summer. When he signed his new contract he was assured there would be significant investment in the squad. He feels as though the club have not matched those expectations. He is also frustrated that the team is once again struggling in the Premier League. \"Obviously, as a Middlesbrough lad he has thought long and hard about the decision to hand in a transfer request and he also hopes that the fans will understand his reasons for doing so.\" Downing's father is a fairly formidable figure who once squared up to Boro's former manager Steve McClaren. Gibson and Southgate are unlikely to find him easy to placate, particularly as it is understood Downing was led to believe Boro would be mounting a viable campaign for Uefa Cup qualification this season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
