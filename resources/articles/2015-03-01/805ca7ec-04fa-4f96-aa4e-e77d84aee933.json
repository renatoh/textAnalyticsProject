Howard joined other Coalition leaders, including former NSW premiers Nick Greiner and John Fahey, and former deputy prime minister Tim Fischer in endorsing Mike Baird for a second term. \u201cIn Australia today elections are volatile. Look at Queensland and the federal Senate,\u201d the statement said, referring to the one-term Queensland government led by Campbell Newman which was defeated in January. \u201cA learner like Luke Foley fluking an election win with local protest votes after just one term out of office would bring NSW to a screeching halt.\u201d The group urged voters against lodging preferences, telling them to \u201cjust vote 1\u201d for the local \u201cBaird Liberal\u201d. The statement was released by the Liberal party NSW campaign headquarters overnight on Tuesday night. Baird has a clear lead in the polls over Foley who was installed as Labor\u2019s leaders in January. The statement said the NSW economy was growing, employment was growing, crime was down, new roads and rail lines were being built, and health services and schools were improving. \u201cProgress is not an accident,\u201d it said. \u201cBut it can end by accident.\u201d Foley was travelling to the central coast on Wednesday after spending the beginning of the week in northern NSW and was expected to continue touring regions towards the end of the week while Baird was likely to focus on marginal seats in Sydney."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
