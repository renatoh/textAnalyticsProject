Tony Blair made a controversial intervention last night. In a statement released by the SDP he described Mr Schr\u00f6der as \"prudent and at the same time a statesman with strong leadership qualities.\" British diplomats who had expected a Merkel victory are now bracing themselves for another possibility: that Germany, Europe's largest country and biggest economy, could be sliding towards months of political instability and drift. With six days to go until Germans vote, Mrs Merkel's Christian Democratic party (CDU) is still ahead with 40.5%. But Mr Schr\u00f6der's Social Democrats have gone up to 34.5% after an unexpected comeback in the final stages of the campaign. Together, Germany's left parties now have 49.5% of the vote, compared with 47.7% for Mrs Merkel's coalition, according to the Emnid institute poll. The gap is enough to stop Mrs Merkel forming a centre-right government with the CDU's Bavarian sister party, the CSU, and junior coalition partner the FDP. She is still likely to become Germany's chancellor next week. But her initial lead in the polls started to ebb away following a row over her appointment of Paul Kirchhof as shadow finance minister. The SPD launched a brutally effective campaign against Mr Kirchhof, a former constitutional judge, portraying his plans for a 25% flat tax as unjust and a gift to the rich. The FDP last night joined the critics of Mr Kirchhof's plans. FDP chairman Guido Westerwelle told a party rally that tax cuts would do not help reduce Germany's high unemployment rate. The two main parties offer starkly different policies on taxation and reform of Germany's labour market, although on home affairs and the fight against terrorism they are in broad agreement Increasingly jittery conservative politicians warned yesterday that a left-right coalition - last tried in Germany in the late 1960s with mixed results - would be a disaster. \"Such a coalition would be bad for the economy, and for democracy and the parties,\" Christian Wulff, the CDU's influential minister president in the state of Lower Saxony, told the newspaper Welt am Sonntag. \"It would strengthen the extreme left and the extreme right. We can't want that.\" Until last week, there seemed little doubt that Mrs Merkel would romp home to become Germany's first woman chancellor, and the first to have grown up in the communist east. Mr Schr\u00f6der, who came from behind to win Germany's last election in 2002, has none of Mrs Merkel's analytical rigour, but has again shown an instinct for attacking his enemy's weakest point. One leading SPD politician, Sigmar Gabriel, said yesterday the SPD could form an alliance with the Greens and the FDP, with Mr Schr\u00f6der gaining a historic third term. Another possibility is an SPD-Green alliance with the new Left party, something Mr Schr\u00f6der has ruled out. Most experts instead expect the SPD to enter a \"grand coalition\" with Mrs Merkel, and for Peer Steinbr\u00fcck, the SPD's recently defeated premier in North Rhine-Westphalia, to become her deputy. \"I find him very credible. He's intelligent and competent,\" Ulrike Merten, an SPD MP, said yesterday. But she admitted: \"A grand coalition would put us in a very difficult situation.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
