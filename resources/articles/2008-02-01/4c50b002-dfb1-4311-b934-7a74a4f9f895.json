The Paisley outfit, who held Celtic to a draw at Parkhead in December, appeared well on course to aid Rangers' bid to wrestle the championship from across the city once again; that the hosts did not claim a point here is due in full to a highly dubious, 87th minute decision by Eddie Smith, the referee, and the individual brilliance of Shunsuke Nakamura. St Mirren, like every club in Scotland and several across Europe, are all-too aware of the talent Nakamura possesses from dead-ball situations so a collective intake of breath from the home support was natural as Smith controversially deemed that Gary Mason had illegally challenged the Japan midfielder, 25 yards from goal. Nakamura's fall to the ground was not on the same level of his team-mate, Georgios Samaras, whose collapse under the faintest of touches from Carles Puyol four days earlier could have been an Oscar winner, but the 29-year-old still embellished the situation. Nakamura duly supplied the latest in a substantial line of wonderful set-plays, curling the ball beyond a helpless Mark Howard to prompt scenes from a visiting support which mirrored 1986, the year Celtic trounced St Mirren at this venue on the final day of the season to clinch the Premier League title. The victory was scarcely deserved, Howard a spectator for the vast majority of the match, and St Mirren's manager Gus MacPherson fought bravely to control his anger afterwards, if only to avoid what would be an inevitable fine from the authorities if he had voiced his real opinion. \"I wouldn't even approach the referee for an explanation,\" said MacPherson. \"There is no point; I would just get a bog-standard answer about his angle or his position. \"We [managers] are not allowed to have an opinion. Anybody watching the incident would have the same opinion as I do, but there is no point speaking about it because I would only get myself into trouble.\" Mason's assertion that he \"hardly touched\" Nakamura was correct. \"I read him and got my body in front of him,\" added the St Mirren player. It is unfortunate that such controversy will overshadow a superb St Mirren showing, the SPL's 10th-placed team dominating for long spells. Artur Boruc had produced fine saves in either half, from David Van Zanten and Billy Mehmet, to maintain parity with the Celtic goalkeeper's opposite number, Howard, not called upon at all until 50 minutes into proceedings. With Celtic's frustrations growing, Nakamura, left among the substitutes from the outset after an ineffectual showing against Barcelona last midweek, was called upon to provide much-needed creativity. Stephen McManus, the visiting captain, had earlier limped off with a hamstring injury which may yet rule him out of the second leg against Barca on March 3. Yet it was St Mirren, driven on from midfield by the outstanding Andy Dorman, who appeared more likely to clinch what would have been their first victory over either half of the Old Firm since 1991 before Nakamura's late and decisive intervention. \"If I was St Mirren, I'd be aggrieved as well,\" conceded the Celtic coach Tommy Burns, whose team remain within four points of Rangers after the Light Blues 4-2 defeat of Gretna. \"Sometimes things go for you, sometimes they don't.\" They were perhaps unhappy with on-field matters, but the antics of the Celtic following should not pass without condemnation. The champions' support chanted gleefully about the current predicament of Paul Gascoigne, the former Rangers midfielder who is undergoing treatment for mental illness, during the opening half; amid a period when the Scottish game has moved forward on so many fronts, it remains disheartening that sizeable moronic elements in the stands are unwilling to do likewise.
