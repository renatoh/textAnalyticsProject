Hussain leads England into their first World Cup match today a disillusioned man, angry with nearly everyone around him but his players. Yesterday all his nightmares came together in the space of a few hours. Not long after it was confirmed in Johannesburg that the International Cricket Council had ruled England should forfeit a possible four points for failing to play in Harare last Thursday, Hussain was forced to deny in East London that he had sworn at and physically intimidated the chief executive of the ICC, Malcolm Speed, in Cape Town nine days ago. It had been whispered all week - with little dissuasion from off-the-record ICC briefings - that Hussain poked Speed in the chest and swore at him when the ICC boss came late to an emotional team meeting that was examining new evidence of death threats against the players and their families. Hussain says he committed no such excess and was furious that the impression was abroad that the England and Wales Cricket Board had formally apologised for the heated exchange on his behalf. Estimates vary, but the argument two Fridays ago lasted at least 10 minutes. As Speed left the room, slightly shaken, the ECB's chief executive, Tim Lamb, took him aside and expressed his regret 'that the atmosphere at the meeting had been somewhat animated'. Speed yesterday conceded that he had been 'in the wrong place and the wrong time'. He added that he had interpreted Lamb's approach as an apology. But Hussain was in no mood to toe the party line, whatever the strength of Lamb's assertion that 'Nasser Hussain, as captain of England, has the total support of the ECB'. The captain said: 'I firmly believe I have nothing to apologise for. At no stage did I swear at Speed, at no stage was I rude. I let the head of the ICC know they had let us down.' Lamb insisted later yesterday that phone conversations between himself and Hussain in the morning, before their respective press conferences, had been cordial. But whether or not Hussain was aware of the nature of the informal apology by Lamb and the new ECB chairman, David Morgan, he was determined to express his feelings about officials of every stamp. 'I am upset with the way they have handled the whole situation. The players have been let down by the ICC. I hope the Board feel they have nothing to apologise for. I am annoyed. This leaves me in isolation again. My trust in authorities is... very low. 'It is only the players and the cricket that keep me going. I am going to have to throw myself into cricket. If I have to think about the authorities I will go round in circles. 'They should have seen this six months or a year ago. For goodness sake, two players in Zimbabwe [Andy Flower and Henry Olonga] have had to make a statement.' Asked about his future, he said he would 'most definitely' consider resigning after the tournament. It was a declaration of frustration and anger - one which he might yet reverse - and it has cast a pall over the England team, whose already fanciful quest for the World Cup looks daily more unlikely. They should beat Holland in East London today but will probably have to defeat two of India, Pakistan and Australia to progress. It is asking a lot, but you can be sure that Hussain, who played in every match of England's tortuous campaign in Australia, has stomach for the fight. After learning of the ICC's decision Hussain said: 'Obviously as a team we are very disappointed. There are issues at stake here much more important than four points. It's up to me and the coach to pick them up. We have to view it as a cup run. We've seen that with the exception of Australia every side can be beaten in this tournament. It's definitely given me some fight and if we can throw ourselves into cricket we have a chance.' Since they left home in November lumbered with too many half-fit players and high expectations, it was clear England's resolve would be tested to the limit. The ECB have admitted privately that they were at fault in not appointing a tour manager, a role that would have eased the burden on the players. They are expected to address this problem before next winter's tour. Hussain, with only one or two slips, has handled the pressure admirably. He was the first player to voice moral objections to playing in Zimbabwe against a backdrop of starving and repressed people, when nearly everyone else connected with the team preferred to hide behind more comfortable arguments of player safety. Aware of his responsibilities, he expressed loyalty to the Board and pleaded that decisions of a boycott should reside with those paid to make them. When it became obvious that the ICC and the ECB were nervous about reneging on contracts, he asked them to look again at 'the wider picture'. They did so, reluctantly, but in the end resolved the issue along cold, legal lines. Even then, Hussain was prepared to accept whatever judgment was handed down; he was paid to play cricket and would go where they sent him. He has looked increasingly haggard in recent weeks. After the toughest of Ashes tours, he came to South Africa for the World Cup only to be confronted with these daily arguments over Zimbabwe. He could see the frustrations in his players, many of whom had no previous knowledge of the troubles of Zimbabwe or the complexities of international politics. At his insistence, they soon learned. And, even with the objections of the few pragmatists within the team, they came to the conclusion that it was not right to go. Even so, the legal wrangles continued. England have few options left now. They will go into arbitration after the tournament to determine how much they must pay the ICC in compensation for not fulfilling the Harare fixture. The Observer understands it will be a minimum of \u00a31million - perhaps less than their legal fees. Hussain had said in Sydney last month that, but for victory over Australia in the Fifth Test, England's solitary success of note all winter, he would have had to reassess his commitment to carry on as captain for another season. Tough as he is, Hussain yesterday looked like a man abandoned in the desert, a long, long way from home. Hussain, who has done well to control his legendary temper since assuming the captaincy, grows more candid by the day, indicating he is prepared to walk away from the captaincy as soon as is practicable. It had been thought he would stay on for the summer while selectors groomed a successor. That is less likely now."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
