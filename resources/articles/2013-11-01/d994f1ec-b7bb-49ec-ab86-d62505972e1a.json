Don't read on if you haven't seen episode seven \u2013 and if you've seen later episodes, please do not leave spoilers. Click here for Sarah Hughes's episode six recap 'I've always felt different from other women \u2013 most women want love when they sleep with a man but I've always been able to separate sex from love' One of the key themes in Masters of Sex is that in any relationship, there's always one person who's on top. Take Ethan, for example. After spending the past seven weeks in thrall to Virginia, he finally appeared to move on, buying bed linen to impress Vivian Scully and taking their relationship up a level. While I think he cares for Vivian more than he loves her, the key to her appeal is that she puts him in the driving seat. Meanwhile Vivian's parents were making adjustments to their own relationship. For years Barton has been the dominant person in the Scully marriage, leaving Margaret despairing and alone. The pendulum swung briefly in her favour this week as she ordered her husband to his room while her young lover lay in her bed. By the episode's end, however, Barton had found a way of squaring his conscience with his desire, while Margaret may well have lost Austin after making the mistake of telling him how she really felt. The week's most important relationship, however, was between Masters, Virginia and Libby. Virginia's decision to take her bra off appears to have escalated events rather quickly and our favourite research duo spent much of the episode attaching wires to each other, having sex and delving into their sexual histories. Much of this was very funny \u2013 Lizzy Caplan and Michael Sheen are experts at delivering rapidfire dialogue with a straight face and some of the encounters between them played like a 1930s screwball comedy \u2013 but away from the laughter there was also an interesting power struggle going on. I believed Virginia when she made her great proclamation about being different to other women and it was obvious that she didn't find Masters attractive, in the early stages at least. However, it's been well established that Virginia's achilles heel is her ambition \u2013 which can lead her to rush into situations \u2013 and I think she found Masters more compelling once he redrew the boundaries and went home to Libby. Certainly she ended the episode looking more piqued than I would expect a woman doing this purely for science to look. As for Masters \u2013 in the early half of the episode his obvious desire for Virginia made him the lesser partner and he spent much of the episode on the back foot, but by the end he seemed to have compartmentalised the two women in his life so successfully that it's arguable he now holds the balance of power. 'I know you're angry Ethan but you're saving my life' There was also great deal of life-saving going on in this episode. Libby convinced Ethan to break ethical rules (and put his own career at risk) by using Masters' sperm without his permission. Ethan, meanwhile, looked to Vivian to transform his life. Margaret told a clearly underwhelmed Austin that he had saved her life \u2013 I was sad to see Austin revealed as little more than a callow boy, but Allison Janney hit it out of the park once again, perfectly capturing Margaret's late sexual awakening, her desire to mother her young lover and her desperate desire to keep this affair alive \u2013 and Barton had his life saved, literally, when Dale stepped in to save him from a homophobic attack. The subsequent scenes between Barton and Margaret, from his arriving home to catch her \"entertaining\" to their awful conversation the next morning, were heartbreaking. I believed Barton when he told a devastated Margaret, \"I can't imagine life without you, everything I have that matters to me I have because of you.\" The trouble is, I also believed him when he reached out to Dale at the episode's end, telling him that he loved his wife but making it clear that his feelings for his young boyfriend remained strong. This show is very adept at showing the many different ways in which people love and desire. Barton and Margaret care for both each other and the young lovers they've taken. If the Scully marriage had been shown to be completely empty this would have been a different, less interesting story \u2013 what makes it work is that they do clearly love each other. It's just that sometimes even love isn't going to be enough. 'Vivian Scully \u2013 you are my future' Ethan's trajectory from utter idiot to self-aware occasional idiot has been very well done. When he turned up at the car park to help Virginia I worried that the show was going to take the easy route and depict him as a stalker. Instead they gave us a believable plotline where he finally realised that a relationship even as friends was never going to work and resigned himself to Vivian. I'm not condoning his behaviour here \u2013 and he's probably mistaken if he thinks Vivian is a straightforward choice \u2013 but it made sense in the context of the show. The key line came when he and Virginia discussed losing their virginity, and she remarked of her teenage beau, \"He was destined to be a farmer and I was destined to be \u2026 something else.\" Ethan now recognises Virginia's ambition, and from the moment he saw her and Masters walk out of the room together I think he knew he was beaten. The only question remains will he tell or has he made the decision to truly move on? Notes and observations \u2022 Nice contrast between Masters and Johnson's clinical dissection of their sex lives and Ethan and Virginia's warm-hearted remembrance of flings past. \u2022 I was fascinated to see that Ethan's brother is an even bigger jackass than him. Family get-togethers must be quite something. \u2022 Talking of jackasses, I love Austin's therapy sessions. I'm amused by how very unwilling he is to delving into his subconscious mind. \u2022 Hurrah for Jane's promotion. Let's have a spin-off in which Jane just goes around casually enlightening herself and being generally more grounded than everyone else on this show. Quote of the week \"Dr Masters, so nice to be working with you again, this time with my clothes on.\" Ladies and gentlemen, this is why Jane is my favourite character. Sexual advice of the week \"My sister swears that's the key, frequency and position \u2026 she spent a summer in India and came back with two things \u2013 dengue fever and a copy of the Kama Sutra.\" Masters gets an education from two of his patients. So what did you think? Is Virginia beginning to feel more aroused by Masters? What about Masters' feelings towards the two women in his life? Can Ethan really be happy with Vivian? And which was sadder \u2013 Barton's closeted despair or the probable end of Margaret's brief flowering?
