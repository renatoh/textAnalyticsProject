To tell people about my brother, Johnny; how wonderful he was and the awful thing that happened to him. [Johnny Delaney, 15, a member of an Irish Traveller family, was kicked to death by teenagers in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, in May 2003.] What will you be doing on January 27, Holocaust Memorial Day? I will be reading some of the poems I have written about Johnny, at Liverpool Philharmonic Hall. It has been arranged by Liverpool's Traveller Education Service, to remember the Gypsy community's experience of the Holocaust. What are you doing to help the Holocaust Memorial Trust's education project? I've written a letter explaining about the death of Johnny, and the terrible effect it has had on our family. It is part of a pack sent out to all schools in Britain. What type of reaction are you getting from school children? I have received lots of letters from children from all over Britain. It touched our hearts to read what they said. Why is this type of education important? Because Johnny didn't get justice. My dad was fighting to get justice for him, and then he died. I feel like I am continuing my dad's work and that I am helping to stop bullying and racism. Have you experienced a lot of discrimination living as a Traveller? Yes, sometimes when we go to the town centre people make jokes about us. There are still shops with signs saying \"No Gypsies allowed\". Once, I had to go to court to give evidence against a boy who had been racist against us. He was threatening and abusive and smashed a window. How has the death of your brother affected your life? I miss him a lot; he was lots of fun. It feels like we are not a complete family any more. What message do you want to give to people through your campaigning? To tell young people to keep safe and to look after each other. To say no to bullying. It doesn't matter what background you are from - we are all the same."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
