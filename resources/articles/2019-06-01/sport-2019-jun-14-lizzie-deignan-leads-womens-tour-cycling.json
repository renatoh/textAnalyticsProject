The Briton proved too strong in a sprint for Kasia Niewiadoma, with Deignan\u2019s Trek-Segafredo teammate Elisa Longo Borghini coming home third. The trio escaped on the day\u2019s final serious climb, but it was Deignan who took the win. She now heads Niewiadoma, winner of stage four, by a second in the overall classification. The race concludes on Saturday with a 126km run to Pembrey Country Park from Carmarthen. For Deignan it was a first professional victory since she returned from maternity leave after the birth of her daughter Orla in September last year. \u201cThe win was emotional,\u201d said Deignan, who was in tears after crossing the line, in a tweet from her team. \u201cIt\u2019s a comeback after becoming a mom; finding my feet again in cycling has been difficult. Obviously, there\u2019s always been questions whether I made the right decision, but today was massive validation. \u201cMy husband has been my rock, and I thought of him when I crossed the line.\u201d Chris Froome will, meanwhile, be sidelined from cycling for a minimum of two months \u2013 and almost certainly much longer \u2013 having undergone surgery following the crash on Wednesday that ruled him out this year\u2019s Tour de France. Froome had to be airlifted to hospital in Saint-\u00c9tienne after losing consciousness and suffering a fractured right femur, a broken hip, a fractured elbow and fractured ribs in the incident, which took place during a practice ride before stage four of the Crit\u00e9rium de Dauphin\u00e9. The 34-year-old came off his bike and hit a wall at 37mph having taken his hands off the handlebars to blow his nose. The subsequent operation lasted six hours and was described as a success by the Team Ineos doctor Richard Usher but, according to the chief surgeon who carried it out, Remi Philippot, Froome\u2019s rehabilitation process will be a long one. \u201cProfessional sports people are very good mentally and want to win, but maybe I think I have to slow him down because he\u2019s very quick and wants to go fast but bone healing needs at least two months. So we have to be patient,\u201d he told BBC Sport. \u201cMaybe we will need to do other things. Maybe the rehabilitation will not be as we want.\u201d Adam Yates clung on to his overall lead in the Dauphin\u00e9 after finishing safely in the peloton at the end of stage six to Saint Michel de Maurienne on Friday. The Briton, racing for Michelton-Scott, will take a slender four-second advantage over Belgium\u2019s Dylan Teuns into the weekend\u2019s decisive mountain stages, with other big names limbering up for the fight ahead. Julian Alaphilippe won a sprint finish over Bora-Hansgrohe\u2019s Gregor M\u00fchlberger to win the stage after a strong attacking performance which also saw Alessandro De Marchi (CCC Team) cross the line in third. The trio had escaped the pack towards the end of the stage and the jostle for victory proved too much for De Marchi, who dropped back while the Frenchman claimed the win on a photo finish. Wout Poels of Team Ineos finished at the front of a peloton which contained Yates, but it proved a costly day for former stage winner Wout Van Aert (Jumbo-Visma), who finished over 15 minutes off the pace."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
