Both Jason Roy and Jofra Archer were docked 15% of their match fees as Eoin Morgan\u2019s side collectively lost their cool and delivered a ragged fielding display at Trent Bridge. Roy was punished for an \u201caudible obscenity\u201d after a misfield in the 14th over, while Archer\u2019s sanction resulted from the fast bowler showing dissent in the 27th over when a short ball was given as a wide by the square-leg umpire. Both incidents were relatively minor \u2013 Roy\u2019s drop off Mohammad Hafeez on 14, before he went on to top-score for Pakistan with 84, was far more costly \u2013 but they still summed up England\u2019s frustrations on the day. Morgan bemoaned his side\u2019s attitude while Woakes, relatively faultless himself after holding an English record four catches, believes the only remedy is to train harder before they take on Bangladesh in Cardiff on Saturday. \u201cYou get back on the field, put in a hard shift and practise some of the things you didn\u2019t get right,\u201d said Woakes, who also claimed three for 71 with the ball. \u201cBy no means was it a car crash but [fielding] was the difference. \u201cYou doff your cap because Pakistan had a tough game against the West Indies. But the way they played against us showed why they won the Champions Trophy in 2017.\u201d Despite a slightly withering appraisal after the match, Morgan rejected the suggestion that the vocal Pakistani support in the ground affected his players. Woakes put a finger to his mouth in the direction of one supporter after his first catch but claimed it was merely in jest. He said: \u201cIt was just a bit of banter really. I was copping a bit of abuse, as you do from the opposition. It was quite friendly. A little \u2018shhh\u2019 is just a bit of banter. I always do it with a smile on my face.\u201d While Morgan went unpunished for England\u2019s over-rate \u2013 they finished the first innings 19 minutes after the cut-off but saw this fall within the allowances \u2013 Pakistan did receive a sanction, with Sarfaraz Ahmed docked 20% of his match fee and 10% for his players after being deemed one over short."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
