Declan Hill, the academic and author of The Fix, an influential investigation into corruption in sport, told Digger that Arsenal's tour of Malaysia and China puts them at the heart of a region where match-fixing is a problem, running big risks for their own reputation. \"China, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand are match-fixing capitals,\" said Hill. \"If I were the head of Arsenal security I would want to keep a very close eye on any of my players meeting gamblers or fixers there. The players will not know what is going on, but the gamblers and fixers will approach them and try anything they can do to befriend the players.\" The fixture takes place in the weeks following a number of arrests and court appearances of Malaysian clubs' coaching staff and bookmakers who are alleged to have paid bribes to influence the outcome of matches in a nation where the unregulated sports-betting industry is estimated to be worth \u00a34.2bn a year. In China, where Arsenal head after Malaysia, the arrests of players and officials now exceed 100. Even the Chinese premier, Hu Jintao, calls Chinese football a national embarrassment. There is no suggestion that the result or any individual outcome in Arsenal's matches will be fixed or compromised. But the Gunners' decision to head to a region in the grip of a match-fixing storm exposes them to risk. An Arsenal spokesman said: \"The game is being used as trial run for a World Cup qualifier Malaysia are playing. We are working to the highest standards of integrity.\" The tour has been organised by ProEvent, a local company that in the past has arranged overseas tours for Liverpool and Manchester United. The 41-year-old Mohd Yusof Bin Mat Karim, a Malaysian on the Fifa international referees' match list, will officiate the match. Arsenal must hope there are no mishaps. For in that event, the \u00a315m Arsenal expect to generate from the trip would be far outweighed by the damage to the club's reputation. Heavy hand forces Reds So Liverpool are inching away from their favoured stadium policy of refurbishing Anfield, and it looks like a heavy political hand has forced them. For although the local council has displayed baffling insouciance about Liverpool's delayed development plans, it turns out that three days before a story in this column about it last Thursday the housing minister, Grant Shapps, had some harsh words on the matter. According to Building Magazine, Shapps told the communities select committee that Liverpool needed \"urgently\" to come to a decision because delay \"holds back regeneration\". Speaking under parliamentary privilege, Shapps also criticised the council leader, Joe Anderson, for having \"simply said, 'When's the next cheque coming?'\" As the club finally rouse themselves towards a decision, one element of deliberation was perhaps made easier for Liverpool: Shapps could not have been clearer that the government will give no financial assistance to the stadium development. Fifa's scheme goes flat The World Cup bidding race at Fifa is apparently not the only area of its operations that is contaminated: the World Cup legacy is also said to be a toxifying influence. According to Alive &amp; Kicking, a sports-and-education charitable enterprise that focuses on Africa, the programme set up by Fifa and its sponsor Hyundai to donate 1m footballs to Africa is wrong from every point of view. \"On a practical level the balls being distributed are made of plastic, which will soon deteriorate in the dry African conditions,\" said Alive &amp; Kicking. \"Apart from leaving millions of children with a useless burst ball within days, Alive &amp; Kicking [estimate] the environmental impact of 1m plastic footballs being dumped on the continent ... will amount to 450 tons of plastic littering the landscape.\" And there is more. \"From a development perspective, the ball dump does nothing to encourage local enterprise and actually undermines efforts to boost hard-hit sub-Saharan economies,\" it said. Fifa did not respond to a request for comment. Plymouth's player power Plymouth Argyle players and staff could hold the key to the success or failure of Peter Ridsdale and Kevin Heaney's bid to take over the club and its property assets respectively. The Football League joins the Premier League in court, probably in November, in an attempt to defend against a challenge from HM Revenue &amp; Customs their controversial football creditors rule (FCR), which protects 100% of failed clubs' debts to players, staff and other clubs. At Argyle, Ridsdale is asking staff and players to accept reduced dividends from the insolvency process. If agreements are reached on a consensual basis, the League will consider its FCR inviolate. However, in the event of dispute, the League could step in and block the Ridsdale-Heaney bid. The difficulty hard-pressed staff have is that rival bidders are unlikely to offer any more than Ridsdale or Heaney."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
