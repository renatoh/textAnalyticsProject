Liverpool have made only one signing because of the uncertainty caused by Covid-19, buying Kostas Tsimikas from Olympiakos for \u00a311.7m, and Klopp has said the Premier League champions are different from other clubs because they are \u201cnot owned by countries or an oligarch\u201d. The pandemic has not affected Chelsea\u2019s budget and their owner, Roman Abramovich, has given Lampard more than \u00a3200m to spend. Yet Lampard, who clashed with Klopp at the end of last season, brushed off the comments. He defended Chelsea\u2019s aggressive approach following the end of their transfer ban and said Liverpool had spent heavily in previous summers. \u201cI found it slightly amusing because when you talk about the owners of clubs, I don\u2019t think it matters what line of business they come from,\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager said. \u201cWe are talking about some very rich owners in the Premier League. With Liverpool\u2019s story, I referenced it a lot last year. They\u2019ve managed to get recruitment right to a really high level. The reality is \u2013 other than maybe Leicester \u2013 most clubs that win the league in the modern day have recruited at quite a high level money-wise. \u201cYou can go through the Liverpool players \u2013 [Virgil] van Dijk, Alisson, Fabinho, [Naby] Ke\u00efta, [Sadio] Man\u00e9, [Mohamed] Salah. Incredible players that came at a very high price. Liverpool have done it over a period of time. What we have done is come off the back of a ban and try to address the situation ourselves. It\u2019s par for the course. There\u2019s no point doing the maths. \u201cWe know that Liverpool have spent at a high level. We know they have an incredible coach. We know they have incredible players. The really smart thing Liverpool have done is believe in their coach and system for a number of years. It\u2019s a great story but it\u2019s a story where they\u2019ve spent money. This summer we\u2019ve spent money and now the hard work has to come.\u201d Lampard, who has signed Thiago Silva on a free and paid big fees to secure Ben Chilwell, Timo Werner, Hakim Ziyech and Kai Havertz, accepted Chelsea will have a target on their back. \u201cThose are the rules,\u201d he said. \u201cI would probably mention the transfer ban quite a lot last year. Maybe I felt that was some of the reason we were 30 points behind the top two teams \u2026 I feel we\u2019ve done it this summer with a view on bringing in young players of very high talent, with the exception of Thiago Silva and his age.\u201d Lampard said Klopp was right about his signings needing time to gel. Chelsea, who are close to signing the Rennes goalkeeper Edouard Mendy, were inconsistent last season and Lampard refused to promise they would challenge for the title before Monday\u2019s trip to Brighton. \u201cWhen you carry on reading what Klopp said he made the point that bringing in a group of players is not going to be easy for us. We are talking about some younger players from different leagues, so I think he was talking about it in a fair context.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
