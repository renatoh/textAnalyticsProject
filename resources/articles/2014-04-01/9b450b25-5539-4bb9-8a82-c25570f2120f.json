The Tory MP has revealed he considered suicide during his 11-month ordeal between his arrest and the moment a jury found him not guilty on nine charges last week. In an interview with the Mail on Sunday, he said he would now campaign for a time limit on bringing sex assault allegations, after a series of high-profile cases in which celebrities including Michael Le Vell and William Roache have been acquitted. He says he also wants the CPS to have a higher threshold of evidence before bringing such cases and to stop \"bundling\" a number of lesser allegations to create the impression of a stronger overall case. The CPS has been under pressure to justify the prosecution after a number of senior Tory MPs called for a review of the recent historic sex assault cases against celebrities and suggested defendants should get anonymity like complainants. The attorney general will press for an explanation of the failed prosecutions at a meeting with Alison Saunders, the director of public prosecutions. Keith Vaz, the chairman of the home affairs committee, is considering holding a separate inquiry. Evans has been caught out on costs because of cuts brought in by the Conservative-led coalition under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act. From 2012, acquitted defendants can only claim from \"central funds\" what they paid for employing a private lawyer up to the amount they could have got under legal aid."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
