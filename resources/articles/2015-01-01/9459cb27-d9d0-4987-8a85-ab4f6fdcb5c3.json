The 33-year-old was omitted from Everton\u2019s FA Cup third-round replay defeat at West Ham United on Tuesday having received offers from several clubs, including a lucrative deal from the Middle East. Eto\u2019o\u2019s agent has claimed Santos of Brazil are also interested but that the striker favours a move to Sampdoria to be closer to his family in Milan. Everton\u2019s willingness to bank a nominal fee for the three-times Champions League winner marks a swift deterioration in the striker\u2019s standing at Goodison Park. Eto\u2019o becomes contracted for a second season at Everton once he makes 15 starts \u2013 he has made 12 so far \u2013 but Mart\u00ednez has rebutted suggestions that finance, or a negative influence on the dressing room, has pushed the striker towards the exit. \u201cWe have heard a lot of stories but there is nothing sinister with Samuel,\u201d the Everton manager said. \u201cIt is very natural. January was always going to be a moment where a player like Samuel was going to consider all his options. If the option he decides is to stay at Everton until the end of the season, we will welcome that. But there is nothing strange, nothing has happened. Samuel has a terrific relationship with everybody and has been a big influence with most of the young players.\u201d Claudio Vigorelli, Eto\u2019o\u2019s agent, claims that the former Internazionale striker has decided to return to Italy with Sampdoria and that a deal is in place. \u201cHe\u2019s chosen Genoa and he\u2019s really motivated,\u201d said Vigorelli. \u201cAn offer has arrived from Santos which was greater from a financial viewpoint but he isn\u2019t interested in it. His family lives in Milan and he dreams of playing in such a passionate place like Genoa to finish his career.\u201d Eto\u2019o is understood to have held talks with the Middle East club Al Gharafa from Qatar earlier in the week. Mart\u00ednez meanwhile has admitted he would not select the striker until \u201chis mind-set is right\u201d. The manager explained: \u201cI have said many times that I don\u2019t like the window being open when you have official games. In the window you can have the footballer and the human being who is thinking about the next move. How can they challenge for a 50-50 ball in the same manner if they are thinking of the next move?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
