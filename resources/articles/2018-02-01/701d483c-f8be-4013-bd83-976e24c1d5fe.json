I know more than I ever wanted to know about Australian deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce\u2019s, but still couldn\u2019t stop reading. And less reluctantly I read everything I could \u2013 spurred by Quincy Jones\u2019s remarkable interview \u2013 about Marlon Brando\u2019s and Richard Pryor\u2019s, and which one would have sex with a letterbox and which one with a radiator. \u201cBrando used to go cha-cha dancing with us. He could dance his ass off. He was the most charming motherfucker you ever met. He\u2019d fuck anything. Anything! He\u2019d fuck a mailbox. James Baldwin. Richard Pryor. Marvin Gaye,\u201d Jones said. It seems a miracle that two of the most famous men of the 1970s were able to have sex with each other under the radar. That and the Joyce interview got me thinking about privacy. Joyce\u2019s plea this week on the ABC\u2019s 7.30 program that his affair with Vikki Campion was a \u201cdeeply private matter\u201d \u2013 didn\u2019t gain much traction. There are considerations, other than sex, that ensured it didn\u2019t \u2013 including his use of a rent-free house and Campion being given staffer jobs. Joyce\u2019s campaigning for family values \u2013 and against same-sex marriage \u2013 exposed him to a charge of hypocrisy too. But I wonder if Campion, Joyce and his family are victims of the drifts of time, and our changing notion of privacy. Privacy now is becoming as much of a relic as doing the cha-cha. The super-rich buy it and guard it \u2013 they have the funds to enforce their rights under defamation laws, they employ people to manage their social media or leave it, if it starts to annoy them. Unlike us mortals, they do not need to be constantly breaching their own privacy \u2013 sharing more and more of themselves in order to build up a brand or keep relevant or up-to-date in their professions. But, for the average person, participation in the digital age has resulted in bathroom mirror and bed hair selfies and constant status updates. The bedroom door that used be shut to the world is now wide open. The digital age has also meant the relinquishment of data that situates us not just in time and space (such location tracking data) but monitors our consumer habits, our desires and ideology (including targeted political ads on Facebook). On television we watch, without comment or concern now, programs that constantly film and monitor participants \u2013 an always-on eye trained to contestants as they shower, eat and sleep, hoping to catch an intimate or unguarded moment that will move the narrative forward until the next night. Then there\u2019s the state\u2019s and corporations\u2019 disregard for privacy \u2013 with their industrial appetite for CCTV, data scraping and legislation that chips away at civil liberties. All this we know, and most of us are unmoved. But there\u2019s another major factor at play \u2013 society\u2019s shift away from liberalism and towards so-called identity politics \u2013 which posits privacy itself as suspect, as a shield for potential hypocrisy. Identity politics requires you dismantle the Chinese walls in your life. Who you sleep with, your vote, how you celebrate public holidays (such as Australia Day), what products you consume \u2013 all signal your political identity. Support Indigenous rights by posting on Facebook memes of an Invasion Day march but still go for piss-up and barbecue for Australia Day? These days that seems a bit \u2026 off, the duality unsupportable. The personal is political again. This week in New York magazine \u2013 referencing not Brando and Barnaby but #MeToo, campus politics and the comedian Aziz Ansari \u2013 columnist Andrew Sullivan called time on liberalism and the enlightenment project. He argued that social justice politics, intersectionality and identity politics have trumped liberal values that included the right to a private life and instead the \u201ccore truth of our society is a system of interlocking and oppressive power structures based around immutable characteristics like race or sex or sexual orientation\u201d. The piece lamented this shift and the consequences for privacy. Liberalism making way for identity politics is not necessarily a cause for hand-wringing \u2013 after all, identity politics seeks to redress the deeper structural issues that cause inequality, things that liberalism hasn\u2019t had enough muscle to shift. Like men, women and the whole power dynamics around consent. Like the whole the Ansari thing, in a nutshell, where a woman who went on a date with him accused him of sexual assault, which he said he believed was consensual. Sullivan believes Ansari\u2019s privacy was violated. After what was reported, can Ansari go back to a third season of Master of None portraying himself as a woke dude? Or will his character\u2019s storyline become something darker but more real? But in his lament, Sullivan has also hit upon a point. There are consequences when you erode privacy. It affects everything from those who run for public office (do these new standards and transparency mean that anyone with a \u201cpast\u201d will be put off?) to demanding a standard of purity and consistency that is in fact inconsistent with being human. I offer myself as a case in point \u2013 I support the right to privacy, as I support transparency and consistency, as I have also gobbled up all the juicy sex scandals of the past week (each day I read the Daily Telegraph! Go Sharri!). I\u2019m only human. It\u2019s not hypocrisy, but an acknowledgment of our simultaneous multiple selves, like two or more scripts running at once, but not overriding each other.
