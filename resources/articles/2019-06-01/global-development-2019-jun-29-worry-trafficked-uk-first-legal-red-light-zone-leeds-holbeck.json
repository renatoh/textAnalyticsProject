Perched on the southern edge of Leeds city centre, it backs on to residential streets peppered with betting shops, newsagents and takeaways. Yet at night this industrial zone becomes something very different. It transforms into the UK\u2019s first designated red light zone where, between the hours of 8pm-6am, street prostitution operates openly with neither the women nor the sex buyers facing prosecution. Prostitution is not illegal in the UK but related activities, such as soliciting in a public place, pimping and kerb crawling, are unlawful. By suspending these laws and creating a wholly decriminalised market for prostitution, this radical approach \u2013 known as the \u201cmanaged zone\u201d \u2013 has transformed a banal square mile of industrial buildings and scrubland into an ideological battleground, revealing the bitter divisions over the response to prostitution in the UK. Five years on, as Leeds city council faces a firestorm of opposition and an inquiry is opened into the future of the zone, I went back to Leeds to see how the managed zone has affected the lives of those who live and work around Holbeck. For the women who work in the zone at night, the biggest change is that they no longer face the prospect of arrest. Sarah* worked the streets of Holbeck \u201cthree or four times a week\u201d until last December to fund her and her boyfriend\u2019s heroin and crack cocaine use. She says that before the managed approach was introduced, things were awful. Now she doesn\u2019t have to worry about the police. \u201cI was constantly looking over my shoulder, worried about getting picked up by police,\u201d she says. \u201cI was arrested something like 20 times in the five years I was doing it, and I could never pay the fine, so they would come looking for me and I\u2019d sometimes get arrested again.\u201d The managed approach was launched by Leeds city council in 2014 after research found that efforts to reduce prostitution weren\u2019t working. Those who support the managed zone passionately believe that what is happening in Holbeck is an opportunity to make life safer for the women working there. Equally fierce opponents \u2013 of which I am one \u2013 believe it has created an open street market for sex buyers and promotes trafficking and exploitation in one of the UK\u2019s biggest cities. I ask Sarah if she feels safer working in the zone as opposed to outside of it. \u201cI don\u2019t know about safe, but I hate being arrested. It makes me feel like dirt,\u201d she says. \u201cThe punters are just the same, they\u2019re pretty horrible, but I don\u2019t see any other way it can be done. I don\u2019t want to get arrested, and a lot of the girls say that the police used to pick on them because they just thought they were scum. To be honest, I don\u2019t think the zone can really do anything other than keep it contained for a while.\u201d Basis Sex Work, a pro-sex work NGO receiving funding from the city council to provide services to women on the zone, believes the approach has helped women report violent punters to the police. One report claims that since the launch of the zone, women are now six times more likely to report violent crime than they were in 2013. Its chief executive, Gemma Scir\u00e9, says that the zone has made a crucial difference to their work, helping them reach women who are in desperate need of essential services and support. \u201cWe give out alarms, we take crime reports and make sure when it\u2019s cold or hot that they have the basic human necessities of food, drink, warm clothes,\u201d she says. \u201cWe help them navigate the legal system.\u201d Scir\u00e9 and I fundamentally disagree on what is happening in the zone. She doesn\u2019t consider the work that the women are doing to be exploitation and insists that from their experience those in the zone are working freely and without coercion. Yet she demurs when I ask her whether the managed zone is working out the way she thought it would. \u201cI can\u2019t give you a yes or no,\u201d she says. \u201cIt works in some ways, but it needs more work.\u201d Others who were involved in designing and launching the zone are less circumspect. Mark Dobson works for Leeds city council and was one of the main architects and champions of the zone when it launched. But now he\u2019s changed his mind. He was badly shaken by the murder of Daria Pionko, a Polish woman working in the zone who was battered to death by a sex buyer just a few months after the zone became operational. He says he is dismayed by what he has seen unfold on the streets of Holbeck since, including reports of increased sexual assaults and rapes. \u201cPeople told me that we were supporting the women, and moving away from a very draconian system where the women were being punished by the police,\u201d says Dobson. \u201cIn fact, what\u2019s happened is the amnesty has clearly been there for the men, but I can\u2019t see anything tangible that\u2019s been done on the other side of the equation to take women out of prostitution.\u201d Leeds city council has also failed to stem the rising tide of local anger towards the zone. Ian Staines set up a flooring business 1993, in the heart of what would become the managed zone. When I visit him at his place of work, he says that the impact of the zone on him and other residents has been traumatic. He says after a local woman was raped in 2018 on her way home from work by a group of men who assumed she was soliciting, many don\u2019t consider their community a safe place to live. \u201cMurder, serious assault, and rapes have all taken place on the zone. We see condoms and needles all over the place, and even human faeces,\u201d he says. There have been no arrests or investigations for sex trafficking or pimping since the zone opened. Yet despite this, Staines says that he, like many other locals, are worried about what might be happening to the women working there at night. One woman who used to work in the zone told me that she saw busloads of Romanian women brought into the zone at night and picked up in the morning. Nigel Perry, another Holbeck resident who has lived in the community 50 years in a small terrace house a quarter of a mile from the zone, is also alarmed by what he is seeing. \u201cNext door to me there are two or three young Romanian women. I have only ever seen one of them leave the house in months, and she was accompanied by a man. I worry that they are trafficked. Men come to the house all hours of the day and night. I don\u2019t think the women can speak any English.\u201d Supporters of the zone point to the lack of arrests of pimps or traffickers as evidence that no criminality is occurring in the zone. But Kevin Hyland, the former anti-slavery commissioner who headed up the Metropolitan Police anti-trafficking unit, says this doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not going on. According to an all-party parliamentary group on prostitution and the global sex trade in 2018, sex trafficking is happening on an \u201cindustrial scale\u201d across the UK, going undetected by police officers and ignored by punters. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of evidence \u2013 I\u2019ve seen it firsthand myself \u2013 that taking a hands-off approach, and effectively removing law enforcement increases the flow of trafficking,\u201d he says. \u201cIf demand is not challenged, then sexual exploitation will continue and will increase.\u201d I ask Gemma Scir\u00e9 about rumours of trafficking. She calls it a \u201cvery difficult term\u201d and says that in their experience, the majority of women working in the zone are doing so of their own free will. Scir\u00e9 says there are \u201cmigrant sex workers\u201d in the zone who come from countries such as Romania and Poland and says they don\u2019t have much contact with them because \u201cclearly they are fearful of authorities because of previous experience in their own countries\u201d. For Basis, the benefits of the zone are that women are no longer being arrested and stigmatised, has better access to its services, and can be helped to find alternatives to prostitution. But what about the punters? On a street just outside of the zone, a lone man sits in his car, hazard lights on. I asked if he would be happy to talk to me about coming to the zone to pay for sex. I explained I was a journalist, and he agreed to talk. \u201cI get lonely,\u201d says Henry*, \u201cbut I\u2019m too selfish to put up with somebody 24-hours a day. I like female company so this is a good arrangement. They get money for their drugs or whatever, and I can release some frustration. Mind you, some of the girls don\u2019t make any effort at all.\u201d I asked Henry if any of the women have pimps. \u201cMost have a pimp or a boyfriend who\u2019s sending her out for his drugs,\u201d he says. He tells me that he has witnessed a lot of violence on the zone from \u201cangry, drunken blokes\u201d. I asked if he often sees police in the area, and he tells me \u201cno\u201d. \u201cThey ride around sometimes just so they are seen, but other than that, we can do what we like. That\u2019s how it should be, it\u2019s a free country.\u201d Does it work, I ask Henry? \u201cIt works for me,\u201d he says. *Names have been changed to protect identities"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
