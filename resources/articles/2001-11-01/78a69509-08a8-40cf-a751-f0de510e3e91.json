But amid the gamesmanship that surrounds Fifa it appears that England have not found the ladder they needed in order to join the elite club of nations who will be revealed today as the eight teams seeded for next June's World Cup finals. \"Basically, England have no chance,\" said a senior Fifa source here yesterday. It left little room for flexibility. England, along with the Republic of Ireland, will be in the second group, which is expected to be all-European, in Saturday morning's draw. \"There are a number of possibilities,\" the Fifa representative added of the final eight top seeds. \"Seven of them are beyond contention and the eighth will be the subject of discussion. There are differing possibilities depending on what method is used to make the choice. It can be done purely on world rankings, or previous World Cups, or simply on how countries performed in the last World Cup.\" Given that England went out to Argentina in the second round four years ago in France, having failed to qualify for USA '94 under Graham Taylor, the spokesman said England's co-efficient rating was low when compared with Italy's, Spain's or Belgium's and, of course, Germany's. \"They did get to the semi- finals in Italia '90,\" the source said of England, \"but that is the least relevant of the last three tournaments.\" Thus, despite the 5-1 win in Munich in August, the Germans' far greater consistency of achievement in World Cups means that they will join the hosts South Korea and Japan, France, Brazil, Argentina and Italy in pool one. Spain, although they went out before England at France 98, are considered the most likely team to make up the top group of seeds. The benefits of inclusion in that company will be known fully only on Saturday, but with Fifa trying to orchestrate the draw on geographic lines, England's placing on the second tier makes it no more or less likely that they will draw a non-European top seed. Pool four will almost certainly consist of the five African qualifiers and the three Concacaf teams, said the source. The third pool will be made up of the rest from Europe, South America, the only Arab nation, Saudi Arabia, and, it is thought, China. It is the first time the Chinese will have been at a World Cup and their arrival may give Fifa a political problem. China are believed to be keen to play their matches in Korea rather than in Japan. Fifa is long used to such machinations and the 2002 organising committee is becoming familiar with non-football agendas as well. It was suggested that England might be given a top seed in order for the hooligan element to be tightly controlled and directed, but Moon Dong-hoo, general secretary of the South Korean committee, Kowoc, raised a broader issue of security after the events of September 11. The United States are due to play a friendly here against South Korea on Sunday week. \"We have had talks with the CIA about the game,\" Moon said. \"We will do the same with the security services in Britain before England come to the World Cup.\" He said that could mean discussions with MI6. \"We already had measures in place but have now decided to put even more strict security on around the England and America teams,\" said Moon. \"That will mean extra security around the hotels where they are staying with extra officers on 24-hour alert.\" In trying to eliminate terrorism the authorities are also planning to re-route flights away from stadiums on matchdays. Hooliganism will be even less welcome in such a climate and Moon had intolerant words for any potential English trouble-makers. \"I will expect them to be identified and not allowed to leave England,\" he said. \"If they come here we will attempt to distinguish them from proper fans and our intelligence services have the power to prevent entry into the country. \"But if they are on the streets we will deploy riot police or the army task force carrying guns. If there are any scenes similar to Charleroi or Marseille then the hooligans will be arrested and brought to a full trial. If they have caused personal injury the sentence is seven years in jail. If an object such as a broken bottle has been used then the sentence is 10 years. \"If you are sentenced to 10 years by a Korean court then you serve that sentence. I think it is fair to say you would not want to spend 10 years in a Korean jail.\" Fifa ranking Japan 35 South Korea 43 France 1 Brazil 3 Argentina 2 Germany 11 Italy 6 Spain 7"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
