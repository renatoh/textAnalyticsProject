Behind her, the house in Telford, Shropshire, where her mother, aunt and grandparents lived was on fire and would soon be totally gutted. Her 16-year-old mother, Lucy, who was pregnant again, her 17-year-old aunt, Sarah, and their mother, Linda, were killed; Lowe\u2019s grandfather, George, managed to escape. The following year, 2001, Lowe\u2019s father, Azhar Ali Mehmood, was convicted of three charges of murder and one of attempted murder. Eighteen years on, he is seeking parole, with a hearing likely to take place in the next couple of weeks. The case \u2013 and Lowe\u2019s attempts to understand why her father committed such a crime \u2013 is now the subject of three powerful BBC Three films. Made over more than a year, the series follows Lowe as she uncovers the horrific truth about her parents\u2019 \u201crelationship\u201d. We meet at her flat in Telford. Lowe is small and slight and looks younger than 20. But when she speaks, she is so articulate and independent that she seems older. There is a tiny hint of a burn scar just above her cheekbone. Doing the documentary, she says, \u201cdid take a toll on my mental health because [I had] to take in so much information, and process it \u2026 Now I can look back on what I learned and understand it better.\u201d She smiles. \u201cBut at the time it was terrible.\u201d Last year, Lowe was contacted by the Mirror journalist Geraldine McKelvie, who was investigating child sexual exploitation (CSE) rings operating in Telford at the time Lowe\u2019s family were killed. Lowe\u2019s mother\u2019s case seemed to fit the pattern \u2013 she was 13 when she met Mehmood, a taxi driver nearly 10 years older than her, and 14 when she became pregnant. Chillingly, other girls in Telford had told McKelvie that, at the time, Lucy\u2019s murder was used as a threat against speaking out. This was all new to Lowe. That story led to this BBC documentary. Making it, she says, \u201cwas good, because I wanted to know everything I possibly could about the case. But at times, there were things that I couldn\u2019t \u2026\u201d She pauses. \u201cCertain things I still can\u2019t get over.\u201d She means details about the relationship between her parents. Miraculously, during the filming, the police handed back Lucy\u2019s diaries \u2013 Lowe had not known they existed. In them, Lucy had written about going to a place notoriously used by grooming rings and performing sex acts on older men. Yet there was also some comfort in the new information. Lowe was raised by her grandfather (although she also lived with other family members and was in foster care for a few years as a teenager). This was a man who had lost his wife and both daughters, who suddenly had a baby to look after. \u201cMy granddad tried his best,\u201d she says and \u201cgrowing up with him was really good, but I didn\u2019t really understand why he was always unhappy. If you met him, you can tell that he\u2019s had a lot of hurt in his life. So it was interesting learning about what type of person he was [before], with his family, being so bubbly and happy. I feel like it\u2019s brought me and him closer.\u201d Lowe was too young to remember anything of her mum. All she had while she was growing up were a few photos, a bit burnt and crumbling. There was just one of the mother and daughter together. She doesn\u2019t remember ever being told what had happened, but she grew up with some knowledge of the facts \u2013 that her father had killed her mother, aunt and grandmother. \u201cAll I remember was that my mum was in heaven and my dad was far away. And that my dad wasn\u2019t a nice person.\u201d She knew people had said that her parents\u2019 relationship \u201cwas a bit iffy\u201d but she never gave their age gap much thought. \u201cBut obviously as I\u2019ve got to understand CSE [child sexual exploitation] better, I\u2019ve understood that there is a big difference. I was told a completely different story \u2013 I was taught that they were in a relationship and they were not.\u201d How did that feel? \u201cWe still don\u2019t know everything that went on,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat we do know is pretty terrible, so it\u2019s been hard.\u201d She talks in the film about the pain of knowing she was conceived within an abusive relationship: \u201cI have a bad feeling towards myself \u2026 and it\u2019s really not nice thinking of yourself like that.\u201d There is a powerful moment in the film when Lowe challenges her grandfather about why he didn\u2019t try to do more to stop Lucy seeing Mehmood. She is torn, she says. \u201cI get really angry about it,\u201d but \u201cI don\u2019t want him to feel any worse than he already does. I didn\u2019t want to seem like the bad person, but at the same time I really needed him to realise what he did wrong. To acknowledge it. I think he has.\u201d Does she still feel angry? \u201cNo,\u201d she says. In 2000, people didn\u2019t really understand CSE or grooming, she says. And he was far from the only one whose lack of action seems astonishing in hindsight. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t right with how Linda was or how the police were, or social services or Lucy\u2019s school or anyone. I think he\u2019s learned and the rest of society have learned and hopefully now we can improve on how we tackle it.\u201d Lucy, she says, was failed in the way that thousands of girls who were victims of child-grooming gangs were with such catastrophic results. \u201cPeople knew what was happening, but they just didn\u2019t care enough or they just pass the blame on. So it\u2019s upsetting, not just the fact that I\u2019ve lost my mum, and my granddad\u2019s lost his daughters and his wife and the whole life that he used to have, it\u2019s also upsetting because this is just one case out of thousands.\u201d Unsurprisingly, she says: \u201cI had a lot of distrust in systems and authorities because of this.\u201d At secondary school, people started to find out what had happened to Lowe\u2019s family, forcing her to confront other people\u2019s vehement reactions to her personal tragedy. She did have close friends who were supportive, but \u201cpretty much all my friends have a set view on my dad or my mum, so there\u2019s a lot of strong opinions.\u201d These days, she says with a small laugh, when people ask about her family: \u201cI\u2019m just like \u2018Google me.\u2019\u201d Growing up, she had some contact with Mehmood\u2019s family. \u201cThere was a time in my life where I wanted to understand that side of my family, my culture and my dad\u2019s religion and things.\u201d When she met them, they rarely talked about Mehmood, and never about his crime. \u201cThey\u2019d tell me things about the Qur\u2019an and about my grandparents, my aunties and uncles and my cousins, and my distant family members that were in Pakistan.\u201d Astonishingly, when Lowe was 16, she went to visit her father in prison \u2013 the first time she had any contact with him. Why did she want to meet him? \u201cCuriosity,\u201d she says. \u201cI wanted to form [my own] opinions, to do with the situation but also separate from that. Because, I could have \u2026\u201d She pauses and says it is not likely to happen at the moment, \u201cbut I could have had a relationship with him, if I got to know him as a person. So that\u2019s why I wanted to meet him \u2013 to see if we could move past it.\u201d Did she get what she wanted? \u201cNot really. You know when politicians answer questions, they don\u2019t really answer it \u2013 it was like that.\u201d I find it difficult to comprehend how she could consider building a relationship, but unless you are the child born into an abusive relationship it must be impossible to understand the complexity. \u201cI\u2019ll always be a bit confused. Because, like, biologically I\u2019m supposed to feel a certain way, so it\u2019s quite difficult \u2026 And the fact that I don\u2019t have my mum with me, so I\u2019ve only got him and my granddad, essentially.\u201d She says she grew up feeling angry at her father, then adds \u201cbut not really angry. I know what my dad did was wrong and terrible. But for a person to do that type of thing \u2013 the sex abuse, the murder, all of that \u2013 there\u2019s got to be a reason why he\u2019s doing that. But for other people around at the time that could see all these things happening before the arson attack, they really could have done something a lot sooner.\u201d Early last year, Lowe\u2019s family found out that Mehmood would be eligible for parole. \u201cMy family would not like him to get parole. But if he does, they don\u2019t want him to be in Telford. And they\u2019ve also requested for him to \u2026 it\u2019s kind of like a restraining order. If he contacts me or my granddad or certain family members, then he will go back into prison.\u201d Is that how she feels? \u201cI think it\u2019s best that he doesn\u2019t contact my granddad and family members,\u201d she says, ambiguously. How does she feel about the possibility of him being released? She believes they should review his case and look into whether he should be charged with sex-related crimes. In the documentary, a superintendent from West Mercia police says this is unlikely to happen. Lowe would like her mother\u2019s case to be part of the ongoing inquiry into CSE in Telford. Lucy hasn\u2019t had justice, she says. \u201cI think ultimately to have justice, you need to be accountable for all the crimes committed. But if that does not happen and he gets released, I don\u2019t know.\u201d She pauses. \u201cI\u2019m not going to wish bad on anyone. Do you know what I mean?\u201d Not really, I say. I think that\u2019s incredibly generous. I don\u2019t know how she\u2019s come through relatively \u2013 to my eyes \u2013 unscathed. \u201cI\u2019ve had loads of counselling,\u201d she says with a smile. She has become a resilient woman with a life \u2013 she is a support worker for adults with learning disabilities \u2013 friends, a boyfriend, beyond all of this. When Lowe was finally given Lucy\u2019s diaries \u2013 which neither she nor her grandfather had known about \u2013 she found a letter her mother had written to her as a baby. \u201cI love you so much,\u201d she wrote. It must have been overwhelming to read that. \u201cYeah,\u201d says Lowe, quietly. \u201cReading the diaries is like her being here.\u201d Why Dad Killed Mum: My Family\u2019s Secret will be available on BBC Three on iPlayer at 10am on 13 November and BBC1 at 10.45pm the same day"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
