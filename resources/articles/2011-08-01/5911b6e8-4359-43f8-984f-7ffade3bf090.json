The girl's Turkish boyfriend has confessed to killing Marion Graham and her friend, Kathy Dinsmore. Before flying out from Northern Ireland, the girl's father, Raymond McGuinness, recalled his unease over his daughter Shannon's relationship with Recep Cetin, a 17-year-old waiter, which began last summer. McGuinness described Cetin as \"controlling\" and a \"gold-digger\" and claimed that he had been keen on acquiring the property the McGuinness family owned on the Turkish Aegean. Graham, McGuinness's former wife, and her friend, had been killed after being lured to a forest near the city of Izmir. Their bodies were discovered by police 20 yards apart from each other in woodland. The two women had multiple stab wounds and their throats had been slashed. It appears they had been persuaded to come to the city on the promise of a tour by Cetin, who was reported to have been enraged that Graham, 53, was planning to prevent her daughter from marrying him. The women's bodies will be held in Turkey until further inquiries are carried out and their remains are not expected to be flown back to Northern Ireland until the end of this week. McGuinness said \"there was always something that was not quite right\" with Cetin, who worked in a restaurant in the resort of Kusadasi. Shannon's father owns an apartment in the holiday town where his former wife, daughter and friends had been staying throughout the summer. Cetin confessed to the killings after a concocted story about all three of them being kidnapped fell apart. He appeared at a preliminary hearing in Izmir on Friday night and was expected to be formally charged. It has emerged that this is the second major tragedy to strike the Graham family in recent years. Marion's half-sister, Belinda Hart, was shot dead at her home in Newry in 1997 by her estranged partner. She was three months pregnant at the time. Until her father arrived, Shannon was being comforted by an Irish hotel owner based in Kusadassi and also an official from Ireland's department of foreign affairs. The mother of Kathy Dinsmore, 53, the other murdered woman, died just four weeks ago. Members of the Dinsmore family are expected to travel to Turkey. The Sinn F\u00e9in assembly member for Newry, Mickey Brady, said he had been in touch with both the Graham and Dinsmore families, who were \"deeply shocked and saddened\". \"I have also made contact with the department of foreign affairs in Dublin. They are now looking after Shannon and they have told me she is bearing up quite well given the circumstances,\" Brady added. Connarie McGreevy, an SDLP councillor from Rostrevor, where Kathy Dinsmore lived, said: \"The people of Newry and Mourne are in deep shock. They cannot believe that such a tragedy could happen to more families from the north of Ireland who go abroad on holiday and are brutally murdered.\" At Marion Graham's home in Newry the blinds were drawn and the property locked up. Members of the Dinsmore family are expected to travel to Turkey next week. The Catholic bishop of Dromore, John McAreavey, said: \"I wish to offer my deepest sympathies to the families of the deceased at this difficult time. I ask the people of the diocese to remember Marion and Kathy in their prayers at masses this weekend.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
