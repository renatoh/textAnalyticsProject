Stability is why Sir Alex Ferguson was able to choose his own retirement date at Manchester United after two decades of unprecedented achievement. Stability is why Arsenal are Champions League regulars and were thus in a position to attract a player of Mesut \u00d6zil's calibre to transform their title prospects. The case has been proven, the benefits are clear. Managers need time. If stability is what everyone is looking for, however, statistics suggest it is remarkably elusive. In the 21-year history of the Premier League alone, getting on for 150 managers have been sacked or nudged more politely towards the exit door. The exact number is difficult to pin down, since of 278 managerial departures since the 1992-93 season many have been assistants or caretakers, some have left voluntarily or resigned through ill health, and each of those categories is open to interpretation. But a conservative figure for the number of frontline managers whose contracts have been terminated over the course of the Premier League \u2013 excluding the likes of Steve Kean and Owen Coyle who were sacked as Championship managers \u2013 would be 140. That is a lot, if stability is the aim, and there are signs that the trend is accelerating. A dozen Premier League managers lost their jobs in 2013, and eight the year before. In the early years of the Premier League the numbers were sometimes lower \u2013 just five in 1997, say, and only three in 1999 \u2013 though it is not the case that chairmen and owners used to be more patient. Ten departures in 2004 show that double digits for annual dismissals is nothing new, and eight managers lost their job in 1998. What is new, and more alarming, is the level of churn at present. Twenty casualties in the past two years have resulted in a situation where only three Premier League managers have been in their present positions for more than two seasons. One of those is Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, of course, but as another is Sam Allardyce the statistic could soon become even starker. Not that the third member of the trio, Alan Pardew \u2014 \"I've been vulnerable from day one here and I'm still vulnerable\" \u2014 regards himself the fixture at Newcastle the length of his contract would suggest. Shortly after becoming the last Englishman to win the league title, Howard Wilkinson was made the FA's technical director and in that capacity said England could learn lessons from the continental system, whereby directors of football took responsibility for sourcing players and spending money, leaving coaches free to change clubs every three or four years when their squads got sick of their voices or their training routines. Whereas in England a manager with four or five big clubs on his CV would be regarded as slightly dubious, in Italy or Spain it was normal. Over the years that policy was gradually adopted, to the extent that not only were directors of football appointed but clubs began hiring managers on deliberately short contracts. Yet surely the wheel has turned too far when 17 out of 20 clubs have changed managers in the past two years. Wenger has been in his present position longer than all the other Premier League managers put together, and Arsenal have watched fascinated as the rest of the Premier League has paid out an estimated \u00a3450m in compensation. Roberto Mart\u00ednez, who might never have won the FA Cup with Wigan but for the unusual patience shown by a somewhat old-fashioned chairman, believes copying the continental model might have been a mistake in the first place. \"The British game was always very different, unique in fact,\" the Everton manager says. \"There was a tradition that the manager decided the philosophy of the team and that is how he should be judged, not on one or two bad results. I think everyone else in Europe was a bit jealous of what we had in this country but in the past two years or so we have become a bit more trigger happy. \"We have been treating managers as head coaches instead of the part of the British game that is unique, and I hope that we can change it round again. As a manager, if you are going to be a manager and not a head coach, you need time to put your ideas across, to manage your budget, to develop players for the short and long term. We shouldn't be copying other leagues, we should be preserving the British tradition.\" As David Moyes is proving at Manchester United, that is easier said than done. Ferguson tried to bequeath him time, tradition and stability, yet it is still going horribly wrong. The bottom line appears to be that stability needs to be preceded by some form of success. Wenger never looked back after winning the Double in his first full season in England. Ferguson famously took longer to deliver but once the trophies began to arrive they were soon piling up. Mart\u00ednez's own switch between clubs was undoubtedly made smoother by the kudos of an FA Cup win and, unless Moyes can get his hands on something tangible quite soon, it appears all the patience and goodwill in the world will not help him. Stability may be the key to success but success is also necessary to buy time for stability. Even Ferguson said so. And success is not something the Premier League is in the habit of sharing around. Most clubs are destined to finish most seasons without a trophy and, if even gaining promotion and remaining outside the bottom three is no longer enough to please some chairmen, what the LMA terms a \"drastic turnover of managers\" seems bound to continue. \"It would benefit everyone in the game to step back and actually define success,\" says Bevan, the LMA chief executive. He would say that, though, wouldn't he? Defining success is the easy part. It is the stepping back that would be a Premier League first."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
