After being urged for months to run, Mr Miliband has settled for a two-stage strategy: Brown for leader, followed by an election wipe-out. He answered only one question. Junior ministers handled lesser issues, such as dead fish and tubercular badgers. He himself spoke about \"eco-debt\", which appears to mean the extra amount of the world's resources that we use per person compared with poorer countries. Mr Miliband is concerned not with the future of himself, nor of the Labour party, nor even of the country. The entire globe is his brief. \"We have given great prominence to the ideas of 'one-planet' living, which refers to the fact that if all citizens of the world lived as we do, we would need three planets to support us.\" How will we cope? Well, \"Defra is currently researching ways of calculating the embedded carbon in imported goods.\" That seems pretty feeble stuff. What is \"embedded carbon\"? Is it like those condoms full of drugs that some people swallow to get through customs? Does Keith Richard snort carbon, along with cocaine and his dad? In the days of old, confident Tony Blair, he would have got MI6 to find two more planets, accused them of plotting to use a flying-saucer mounted death ray against us, and led an invasion. Not now. But then much of the environmental debate is about small-scale gestures. Take the Tooting bananas. According to the local MP, Wandsworth, the relevant council, refuses to make Tooting a \"Fairtrade zone\". The notion is that people would be nagged into buying not horrid, bland, multinational Fyffes bananas, but delicious, flavoursome bananas from growers on tiny islands who live under one or two trees in their backyard. Julie Kirkbride, a Tory, got exasperated. Lots of supermarkets now sell only Fairtrade bananas, because that is what their customers want. Why should they have their choice imposed on them? The minister, Barry Gardiner, said that Fairtrade status was \"symbolic\" and would \"galvanise the people of Tooting\" into buying the right bananas. Meanwhile, those 30,000 Chinese mines continue to pour out filthy coal, entirely wiping out the fact that the entire Defra team walked the five minutes to the Commons yesterday - a fact of which they are immensely proud."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
