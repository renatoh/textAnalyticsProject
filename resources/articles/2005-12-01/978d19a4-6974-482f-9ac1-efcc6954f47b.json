After sustaining the injury during his side's recent Champions League clash at home to Real Betis, the 29-year-old will now fly to Colorado for an operation on Wednesday and see renowned football specialist Doctor Richard Steadman. \"Unfortunately, it is unlikely that 'Bolo' will play again this season,\" said a club spokesman. The Dutchman moved to Anfield in the summer from Middlesbrough, but his career with the European champions has already been hampered by injury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
