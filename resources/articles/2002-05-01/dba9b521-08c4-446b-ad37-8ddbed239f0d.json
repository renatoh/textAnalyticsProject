Last month he became Britain's most successful clay-court player for a quarter of a century. Yesterday he missed an opportunity to climb to No1 in the ATP Champions Race by contriving to lose in the second round of a Masters series event - to a qualifier. He is just as likely next week to turn the world on its head. Marvel one minute, limp mystery the next. Henman had only 36 points to make up on the race leader, the Australian Open champion Thomas Johansson, and all he needed was to equal his Monte Carlo achievement of reaching the semi-finals. That made it doubly disappointing that he should lose 7-6, 2-6, 6-4 to Adrian Voinea, a player outside the top 50 whom Henman had crunched in both their previous meetings. This time, however, the skies were like slate, the balls were leaden and falling mercury made conditions too slow for Henman easily to reach the haven of the net. He was frequently caged behind the baseline, struggling to escape amid long rallying sequences in which the Romanian was at least his equal. But Henman could, and should, still have won. He had Voinea at deuce on four of the service games on which he failed to break in a tortuously long first set, and after fighting back calmly and well in the second, advanced to lead by a break and 2-0 in the decider and still let it slip. Voinea hits flatter than is usual for a top-spinning clay-court exponent, making him less vulnerable to low bouncing slice and helping him pin Henman back more deeply. \"The problem is, you want to play positive and aggressive tennis but in these sort of conditions where the balls are so slow it becomes risky,\" Henman said. But he allowed frustrated aggression to become fretfulness, and that tipped the scales fractionally but crucially against him. Towards the end he argued lengthily when the umpire ordered a replayed point, rushed and missed a couple of attacks on Voinea's second serve, and gambled on a fateful rush to the net at 30-30 in his last service game. The pass which Voinea slid down the line prised open the door to victory A further reward for the expected Henman victory would have been a repeat encounter with Roger Federer, the Wimbledon giantkiller whom he so memorably beat in last year's quarter-finals at SW19. The Swiss has been anxious about his form since coming close to beating Andre Agassi in the Miami final six weeks ago, but now he injected some fire into an ashen day by seeing off Bohdan Ulihrach, the Czech Davis Cup player, in less than three-quarters of an hour. Heat of a very different kind was generated when, in the same half of the draw, Carlos Moya lost. The Spaniard has recently been playing closer than at any time in the past three years to the standard that once made him world No1, but now, as his fluency was eroded by the staccato attacks of the bounding Belarussian Max Mirnyi, he belted a ball in high fury to the furthest tiers of the stadium and received a code violation warning. Mirnyi had been treating one of the slowest surfaces in the world as though it was one of the fastest, charging scornfully to the net at every opportunity. Against one of the best passers in the business it should have been a suicide charge. But when with a mixture of gambling, good luck and great volleying he got away with it, by snatching victory in two tie-break sets, it was all too much for Moya. \u00b7 Martina Hingis is almost certain to miss the French Open, which starts on Monday week, with a persistent foot injury - and if her doctor's pessimistic prognosis is proved correct that may be the least of her worries, writes Eleanor Preston in Rome. Reports coming from Zurich, where Hingis is being treated, suggest the 21-year-old's career may now be hanging in the balance. According to her doctor Dr Heinz Buhlmann, Hingis has pain in her left foot, left hip and left knee and may have irreversible damage to her joints. \"We have to see how far the inflammation has led to arthrosis,\" he said. \"We cannot yet say how sensible it would be for her to continue her career or whether to end [it].\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
