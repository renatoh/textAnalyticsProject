He vowed that his budget officials \"will go through our federal budget \u2013 page by page, line by line \u2013 eliminating those programmes we don't need, and insisting that those we do operate in a sensible cost-effective way\". The ubiquitous food and drug administration, which is demoralised and dysfunctional from two decades of mismanagement and adherence to flawed policies and programmes, would be a good place to begin. Trimming, revising or eliminating programmes that are ill-conceived and counterproductive would both free up resources for essential functions and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of FDA regulation. Here are a few specific suggestions: \u2022The Drug Watch programme has more to do with public relations than public health. According to the FDA, it makes \"emerging safety information\" publicly available before the agency has \"fully determined its significance\". Drug Watch is \"not intended to be a list of drugs that are particularly risky or dangerous for use; listing of a drug on Drug Watch should not be construed as a statement by FDA that the drug is dangerous or that it is inappropriate for use\". Then-FDA deputy commissioner Scott Gottlieb conceded that the data that would appear on Drug Watch was \"still unscrubbed by scientific rigour\". That is to say, it's worthless \u2013 except perhaps for plaintiffs' attorneys trolling for business. This programme should be scrapped. \u2022Last year, the FDA announced a plan to perform a comprehensive assessment of the safety of some new drugs within 18 months after their introduction and to issue a report card on their performance. Although this may sound plausible, it is inconsistent with data showing that, in fact, newer drugs confer an advantage over older ones in reducing mortality. This plan is another candidate for elimination, or perhaps it should be limited to encompass only very widely prescribed drugs whose clinical trials raised a safety signal(s). \u2022The FDA plans to require that every new genetic construction in an animal that employs gene-splicing technology undergo evaluation under the same procedures and regulations as those for drugs used to treat animal diseases. In other words, the genetically altered animal would be treated as though it were a new drug. A far more apposite model for gene-spliced animals would be the agency's oversight of traditional foods and food additives of \"natural mutants\" and of livestock clones or identical twins, which the FDA has decided are safe to eat. This approach would ensure food safety but would be far less labour and time intensive for FDA personnel, and it would be far less anti-innovative and punitive to an emerging industry. \u2022Many FDA evaluations take far longer than they should. These include approvals of new drugs, vaccines, medical devices (such as artificial joints) and food additives, as well as affirmations that new food ingredients are \"generally recognised as safe\". There is minimal accountability for dilatory performance. Greater accountability, more expeditious decision-making and improved risk-benefit balancing would expend existing and additional resources more efficiently. \u2022Most day-to-day evaluations and approvals of drugs, medical devices and food products are performed quite autonomously within the FDA's various decentralised units, and yet there are massive, largely superfluous bureaucracies that serve the commissioner and a horde of deputy commissioners, associate commissioners and assistant commissioners. These should be trimmed drastically, freeing resources for the agency's essential programmes. \u2022Better management and greater discipline would result in higher morale and productivity. The current FDA leadership has permitted self-styled whistleblowers to flout the FDA's ethics rules by publicly contradicting agency policy and disparaging drugs and drug companies that they dislike. \u2022A recent memorandum of agreement between two groups within the FDA's Centre for Drug Evaluation and Research will systematically slow drug development and increase its costs. Under the accord, the drug review and drug safety offices will have equal responsibility for \"significant safety issues\" pertaining to medicines that are under review or have already been approved for marketing. Officials in the latter group are focused so narrowly on \"safety\" that they ignore the fact that because all drugs have side-effects, safety cannot be evaluated in a vacuum. Instead, it must be part of a cost-benefit judgment. Their motto might be: \"If you don't approve any new drugs, you don't have safety problems with any of them.\" These drug safety zealots should be returned to a purely advisory role. Obama's approach to governance sounds promising. \"This isn't about big government or small government,\" he said. \"It's about building a smarter government that focuses on what works.\" But translating the rhetoric into reality will test the new administration's mettle, because it will require taking on legislators bent on expanding the nanny-state and committed to the impossible goal of zero risk in consumer products and services. I'm hoping for the best, but I'm betting on business as usual."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
