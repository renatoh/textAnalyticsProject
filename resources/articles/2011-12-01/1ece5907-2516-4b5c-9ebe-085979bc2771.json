So he did, in holiday camps he named after himself. Their story is told in The Butlin's Story (ITV1). It's a good story. Well, a good story needs one of the following: knobbly knees, women in swimsuits, donkeys or Ringo Starr. The Butlin's story has all four. The knobbly knees came in competitions to find the knobbliest \u2013 which was what the men did while the women were being judged in swimsuits. The donkeys meanwhile were being ridden by children, who then fell off and were run over by the donkeys behind; it's brilliant and hilarious and makes you realise just how evil health and safety is. And Ringo was playing in a band at Butlin's when he got the call to come and join the Beatles. Just imagine how good the Beatles could have been if he had said: no, you're all right, I think I'll stay here with Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. But it's normal people \u2013 the punters, plus the odd redcoat \u2013 who this story is all about. People such as David, who was one of the first ever campers at the first ever camps at Skegness in 1936. And Valerie, a redcoat at Filey, who got to broadcast the morning wake-up call: good morning, campers. And Jill and Roy, a glamorous couple who didn't always appreciate that call, and maybe brought wire cutters on holiday with them, to snip the wires to the speakers inside the chalet. That \u2013 the constant announcements \u2013 was about all that was wrong with Butlin's, you'd think, watching this film. Otherwise it was paradise. Or possibly they've got a rose-tinted filter on the camera. Well, it is a 75th birthday celebration, you don't want to be saying anything bad ... That would be my one real criticism of the programme, that's it's all very on-message and positive. Oh, and maybe that it was nearly all about the past, and that there was very little about Butlin's today. Yes, it's still going. There may be only three left \u2013 at Bognor, Minehead and Skegness \u2013 but between them they still attract more than a million holiday makers a year. I was one of them, recently, as it happens. I went on a themed Big Weekend called 90s Reloaded, in Skeg. There were around 4,000 of us, reloading the 90s. You get even more at an 80s Big Weekend apparently. Mostly we marauded in large predatory single-sex packs, lots of stags and hens. The hens tottered through puddles in their heels, shrieking and trying to hold down tiny skirts as what felt like Rory Storm and all the Hurricanes whipped off the North Sea. The stags nudged each other and nodded approvingly. We drank all day \u2013 lager and sambuca shots \u2013 and watched football. And at night, at Red's nightclub, we dressed up \u2013 as Spice Girls (mostly Ginger) and Teletubbies (mostly Tinky Winky), the Baywatch cast (mostly CJ, obviously), Dame Edna, the Pope, Jedward ... hang on, isn't this supposed to be the 90s? Three members of S Club 7 \u2013 Jo (the Big Brother bully, remember?) and the two boys \u2013 came on stage, and we sang along. I've got you and you've got me, so reach for the stars, climb every mountain higher, reach for the stars \u2026 I did always have a soft spot for S Club 7. Thankfully, they've done away with the speakers in the rooms. So there's no need for wire cutters any more. Mainly we kept each other awake at night by staggering around looking for our chalets \u2013 rows and rows of them all look the same, especially when you've been alternating between beer and sambuca all day. Some of us never found them, and ended up sleeping in the hedge, I think. It wasn't a bad time, though I'm not sure I'd go again. My biggest problem was that the spiked fence all around the perimeter, along with the long, regimented rows of one- and two-storey buildings inside, said prison camp as much as holiday camp, and throughout my stay I was never entirely able to shake off the feeling I was an inmate, rather than a guest. But then that was Billy Butlin's original idea 75 years ago \u2013 to shut the holidaymakers in. Rev (BBC2) ended, as the first series did, on a high. Tom Hollander's drunken bad-singing, bad-dancing Christmas sermon/rant/mini breakdown is a thing of joy and beauty. Lovely, like the show."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
