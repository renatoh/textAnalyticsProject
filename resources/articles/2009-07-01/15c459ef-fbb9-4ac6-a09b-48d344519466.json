He phoned to ask when he would receive the money but was told he would not get the bonus because he had an account with Cahoot which, like A&amp;L, is a Santander company. I have found mention that having another A&amp;L or Abbey bank account excludes you from the bonus but can find nothing about Cahoot. JW, Leeds Your boyfriend should get the bonus. When he applied, the computer identified his Cahoot account as an Abbey National plc account because Cahoot is a division of Abbey. The operator he spoke to simply read that information from the screen without questioning it. A&amp;L later identified the problem and made a note to pay your boyfriend \u00a3100 provided he pays in \u00a3500 from a non-A&amp;L account within 11 weeks of opening. Because you were given wrong information, A&amp;L is sending you some wine and flowers to apologise. This bonus scheme is no longer available. \u2022 Email Margaret Dibben at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Margaret Dibben, Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU and include a telephone number.
