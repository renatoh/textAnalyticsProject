The court sitting in Brisbane quashed convictions that Pell sexually assaulted two choirboys in the 1990s, allowing the 78-year-old former Vatican economy minister to walk free from jail, ending the most high-profile case of alleged historical sex abuse to rock the Roman Catholic church. At the start of mass, celebrated at his lodgings at Santa Marta on Tuesday morning and livestreamed, Pope Francis said: \u201cI would like to pray today for all those people who suffer unjust sentences resulting from intransigence [against them].\u201d The Vatican also welcomed the acquittal, praising Pell in its first official statement for having \u201cwaited for the truth to be ascertained\u201d. The Vatican said it had always had confidence in Australian judicial authorities and reaffirmed the Holy See\u2019s \u201ccommitment to preventing and pursuing all cases of abuse against minors\u201d. Francis did not mention Pell by name at mass, but compared the suffering of those inflicted with \u201cunjust sentences\u201d to the way Jewish community elders persecuted Jesus with \u201cobstinacy and rage even though he was innocent\u201d. Each morning at the mass, Francis chooses an intention for the service, such as remembering the poor, the homeless or the sick. In recent weeks, the pope\u2019s intentions for nearly all of his daily masses have been related to the coronavirus pandemic. The pope also tweeted about the persecution of Jesus, without making specific reference to Pell. \u201cIn these days of Lent, we\u2019ve been witnessing the persecution that Jesus underwent and how He was judged ferociously, even though He was innocent. \u201cLet us pray together today for all those persons who suffer due to an unjust sentence because someone had it in for them.\u201d Pell was number three in the Vatican hierarchy, in charge of the Holy See\u2019s finances and of rooting out corruption. His five-year term as Vatican treasurer expired just days before he was sentenced in February last year. Pope Francis had removed him from his inner council of advisers two months earlier. The Vatican said last year that it would wait for the judicial process to be exhausted before taking any further action. Pell is three years past the age at which bishops and Vatican officials normally hand in their resignation, is not expected to return to a Holy See job. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith \u2013 the Vatican\u2019s disciplinary department \u2013 is expected now to consider the accusations against Pell and could order a canonical trial. But it would be an extraordinary turn of events if the outcome was different to the ruling of the appeal court. Anne Barrett Doyle, co-director of advocacy group BishopAccountability.org, said the court\u2019s decision had been widely expected. \u201cThough distressing to many survivors, the decision doesn\u2019t change the fact that the trial of the powerful cardinal was a watershed,\u201d she said. Of the 78 Catholic bishops worldwide who have been publicly accused of child sexual abuse, very few have faced criminal charges, and fewer than 10 have been tried in a secular courtroom, she said. \u201cYet that is where all of these cases belong. While messy and painful, a judicial process in a democratic society is immeasurably better than that of a Vatican tribunal, which keeps its proceedings secret,\u201d she added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
