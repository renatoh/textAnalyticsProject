Balotelli is on a season\u2019s loan at Milan but does not feature in J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s plans at Liverpool and will be offloaded on a permanent basis this summer providing a taker can be found. The striker\u2019s agent, Mino Raiola, has started sounding out potential suitors for the talented but troubled Italy international and clubs in China and Turkey have expressed interest. Liverpool paid \u00a316m to sign the 25-year-old from Milan in 2014 and he remains under contract at Anfield until 2017, with the club having an option to extend the deal by a year. That is not on the agenda following his minimal contribution under Brendan Rodgers, who ultimately froze out Balotelli from first-team training, and the accepted panic signing continues to cost Liverpool money. The club contribute to the forward\u2019s basic \u00a380,000 weekly wage at Milan. The financial hit they are taking on Balotelli, however, would be softened significantly should a permanent transfer to China materialise this summer. The Chinese Super League outspent the Premier League in January and that expenditure, following a declaration by the president, Xi Jingping, that China should become a football powerhouse, has prompted agents such as Raiola and Pini Zahavi to explore further deals for the summer. Raiola this week denied there were problems between Balotelli, Milan and Sinisa Mihajlovic after the coach indicated the striker would not play for the club again. \u201cThose who don\u2019t sacrifice themselves for the team to the 94th minute will no longer set foot on the field,\u201d Mihajlovic said after a 2-1 win over Genoa. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Balotelli \u2013 there were another two or three as well as him. They know who I\u2019m talking about.\u201d The player\u2019s agent said: \u201cThere are no difficulties at Milan for Mario.\u201d Of more importance to Liverpool\u2019s long-term financial future is a lucrative deal for Anfield\u2019s new \u00a3120m main stand. Billy Hogan, Liverpool\u2019s chief commercial officer, has been in Asia this week to negotiate with three interested companies and the club are seeking a naming-rights partner for a 10-year commitment worth \u00a37m-9m per season. There remains the possibility of negotiations concluding with more than that, with a sponsorship package involving other aspects of the club being agreed. Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool\u2019s owner, has confirmed in the past that it would consider outside investment, albeit while insisting it is not actively pursuing such a deal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
