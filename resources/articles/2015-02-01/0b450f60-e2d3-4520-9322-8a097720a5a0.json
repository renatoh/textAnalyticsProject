The billboard announced the release of the 24-year-old singer-songwriter\u2019s debut album, Chaos and the Calm, on 23 March. But the timing and the placement of the ad must also have been strategic: it was pasted up a couple of days before his gig down the road at Koko, the biggest show of his life so far. Many fans would have seen it as they travelled to the venue; perhaps even Bay himself as he came in from his flat in north London. When I meet Bay on the morning after the gig \u2013 a happening notable for a) the crowd knowing word-for-word songs from an album that hasn\u2019t even come out yet and b) a lot of people wearing fedoras, Bay\u2019s trademark, like an Indiana Jones convention \u2013 I ask if he had driven past the poster on the way to Koko. \u201cI still haven\u2019t seen it, but someone sent me a photo and I\u2019m buzzing,\u201d he replies. \u201cWow! Oh, mad! Crazy! It\u2019s a big moment for me, man. We\u2019ve all grown up seeing things like that and it will be so cool to go up to it in person.\u201d Bay pauses, thinks. \u201cI want to see someone draw a cock on my face,\u201d he decides. \u201cI want to see that. Great, because it means that it\u2019s real. You\u2019re never too big to have a pair of balls drawn on your chin. Nobody in the world. To have the eyes scratched out of a picture. Nobody.\u201d If Bay is incredulous, it is easy to understand why. Six months ago, he was unknown; scarcely more than a year ago, he was still working in pubs in his hometown of Hitchin, Hertfordshire. A break of sorts came when Lana Del Rey was a no-show for Fearne Cotton\u2019s Live Lounge on Radio 1 last September; Bay stepped in, played his 2014 single \u201cLet It Go\u201d and began trending on Twitter. He was runner-up in the BBC\u2019s Sound of 2015 and then went one better, winning the 2015 Brits Critics\u2019 Choice award. Few prizes are such a dependable guarantee of future megastardom: Adele, Florence &amp; the Machine, Ellie Goulding, Jessie J, Emeli Sand\u00e9, Tom Odell and Sam Smith are all past winners. Bay seems to have admirers in high places, from the fashion designer Christopher Bailey, who asked him to play live at the Burberry Prorsum show in last autumn\u2019s London Fashion Week, to Taylor Swift, who has seen him perform twice. After the first gig in Nashville, Swift launched into a detailed dissection of \u201cLet It Go\u201d, a tiny bit awkward since Bay didn\u2019t know any of her songs to return the compliment. (He\u2019s more of a Feist man.) \u201cShe\u2019s not one of my favourites, but God, that\u2019s OK,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s all right that I don\u2019t know her back catalogue.\u201d On the second occasion, an industry showcase in Los Angeles before last month\u2019s Grammy Awards, Swift suggested that Bay open for her during her European tour this summer. \u201cI\u2019m hugely grateful for the invite,\u201d says Bay. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019d be coming at me if she didn\u2019t like the music. And those are going to be enormous venues, so it gives me a taste of that scale. Why not be young and naive and hope that I\u2019ll get to that level at some stage?\u201d Much of Bay\u2019s life right now is glamorous \u2013 but not today. We are sitting in a pub in High Barnet, perusing a never-ending menu while builders down a lunchtime pint. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go beef burger and chips, cheese, no bacon,\u201d declares Bay, with an endearing enthusiasm he might not have had if he\u2019d seen, as I had, the chef standing catatonic alone in the kitchen. \u201cOr should it be fish and chips? Oh my God, scampi!\u201d And to drink? \u201cApple juice or orange juice. Apple juice first then orange juice.\u201d Looking out of the window, while \u201cGolden Brown\u201d by the Stranglers warbles out of tinny speakers, Bay knows this kind of establishment and its environs well. \u201cMid-level,\u201d he says. \u201cAll right. Livable. Not the most exciting thing in the world, but great. Easy to grow up in, which is what Hitchin was. Comfortable.\u201d Chaos and the Calm \u2013 as the title hints \u2013 deals with the dramatic life changes that Bay has been dealing with in recent times. But even though he is now in the rarefied position of being sent by his label to write in LA, and the album was recorded in Nashville\u2019s storied Blackbird Studio, Bay isn\u2019t keen to ditch his upbringing entirely. The guitarist in his band, Tom, has been his best friend since primary school; he\u2019s been with his girlfriend since they were teenagers in Hitchin. His biggest hit to date, \u201cHold Back the River\u201d, laments gradually losing touch with loved ones. \u201cYou hear all these stories about pop stars who say, \u2018I grew up in this small town and I had to break out and find the big city.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t like that as a little kid. I\u2019m very close in age to my older brother and we had a field at the end of the road where we could run around, climb trees, play football. I couldn\u2019t stand London.\u201d In fact, when Bay was sent to Los Angeles to finish working on the album, he found he couldn\u2019t write a line. Back home, the final tracks came easily. \u201cI\u2019ll always get dragged back to places like this,\u201d says Bay, as our lunch arrives, suspiciously quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s part of that age-old thing: never forget your roots. Well, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d He picks up a piece of scampi and pops it in his mouth. A month before, in mid-January, I\u2019d met Bay at ITV\u2019s South Bank studios as he prepared to record a song for a show called The Brits Are Coming!, broadcast later the same night. His award, voted for by music journalists and \u201cindustry experts\u201d, was announced ahead of time and he was a couple of hours from playing in front of a television audience of millions. Arriving at the studios, he was confronted for the first time by a wall of paparazzi. Someone from the label called ahead and instructed him to get out of the left-hand side of the car. Bay smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s all very new still. For a second every time, it\u2019s a bit like, \u2018This is fun!\u2019\u201d He appeared unfazed, but bristled when I said as much. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make it seem like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not Mr Fucking Big Balls. I\u2019m really not. I\u2019m not all confidence.\u201d The point he was making was that this wasn\u2019t some overnight success. After school, Bay went to the Brighton Institute of Modern Music (Bimm) partly because his girlfriend was already studying in the city but mostly because he looked on the website and liked a photograph of a wall covered in guitars. He\u2019d started playing his uncle\u2019s classic Spanish guitar with nylon strings when he was 11 and had been in bands through his teens, often in some configuration with his brother and Tom. At Bimm, Bay was in the same intake as the singer-songwriter Tom Odell. His course mostly taught him how cutthroat the music industry would be: \u201cIt\u2019s dog eat dog. If you want it, you\u2019ve got to want it more than the next guy, even if he\u2019s your best friend.\u201d Bay developed his sound at local open mics. Growing up, he was obsessed with Bruce Springsteen and Michael Jackson, and even now his tunes oscillate between growly anthems and delicate ballads that soar up into the falsetto register. Perhaps Bay\u2019s greatest discovery in Brighton, however, was Mad Hatters, a headwear emporium in North Laine. He\u2019d been listening to the American bluesman Eric Bibb, who is rarely seen without a panama, and Bay thinks there might be some entrenched memories of Bob Dylan and Robbie Robertson from the Band. Aged 20, he put on a dark fedora, decided he liked how it looked, and it has pretty much stayed there since. He\u2019s on to his second one now, bought in Nashville, and is seriously considering investing in a hat box with all the transatlantic travelling he\u2019s doing these days. The hat remains staunchly in place during our two meetings, but Bay plans to take it off one day. \u201cI might shave my head,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope to have a long career and I don\u2019t want to be defined by things that aren\u2019t the music.\u201d For now, though, it feels like a uniform: he puts it on and he\u2019s ready for work. \u201cIt\u2019s my suit. There should be an element of mystique between the fans and the artist. That bit between the stage and the audience. I think that\u2019s necessary. I used to dress up like Michael Jackson. I didn\u2019t have the glove, but I had a red jacket like in Thriller.\u201d Bay has to GO. A car is picking him up at the pub, off to Dublin via Heathrow. After that: Amsterdam, home, New York for a sold-out show at the Bowery Ballroom, home, the South by Southwest festival in Texas, then home again for the album release and two weeks of UK dates. Bay is an easy target for some critics: too handsome, too palatable, too much like the posse of soulful British and Irish male balladeers such as George Ezra and Hozier, who\u2019ve already made it. His response is to work relentlessly, as though he can silence the doubters one live show at a time. \u201cIs it that they go, \u2018He\u2019s got a look and that\u2019s why he\u2019s where he\u2019s at?\u2019\u201d Bay clicks his tongue, shakes his head. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame. I understand that, because it\u2019s the world we live in, but I\u2019m more than pleased to show them I can play. Just sit down and have a listen and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d Chaos and the Calm is out on 23 March Follow the Observer Magazine on Twitter @ObsMagazine"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
