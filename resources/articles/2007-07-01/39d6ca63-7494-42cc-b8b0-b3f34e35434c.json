He called for the civil servant who pulped the papers to be identified and, if still alive, to give evidence to the inquiry into the deaths of more than 1,700 haemophilia patients exposed to the viruses in contaminated blood. A surviving health department document he found shows officials knew in February 1976 that imported blood products came with a higher hepatitis risk.
