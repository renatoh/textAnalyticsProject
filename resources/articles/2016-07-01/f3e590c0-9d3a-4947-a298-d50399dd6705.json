So-called \u201csignature strikes\u201d, targeting people whose behavior is assessed to be similar enough to those of terrorists to mark them for death, will continue, according to senior US officials. Human-rights groups have long denounced the practice \u2013 whose criteria can be as vague as killing \u201cmilitary-aged males\u201d in regions where terrorists operate \u2013 as anonymous killing. Speaking with reporters on Friday after the US released a long-awaited tally of deaths caused by its drone strikes since 2009, senior administration officials indicated they believed contingencies exist which necessitate the retention of signature strikes. \u201cWe continue to reserve the right to take action not just against individual terrorist targets but when we believe we have, for instance, a force protection issue or information to suggest a continued imminent threat,\u201d said a senior official, who would not be quoted by name, when the Guardian asked about the future of signature strikes. A different senior US official said the US would presume that unknown persons are \u201cnoncombatants until proved otherwise.\u201d Nor will US conclude that \u201canyone killed in a particular strike within X-many feet of a known combatant is therefore a combatant.\u201d Determining someone is a member of a terrorist group involves looking at \u201ca variety of signatures, from the information and intelligence that in some ways is unique to the US government, for example, to the extent the individual performs functions to the benefit of a particular terrorist group, or to the extent an individual\u2019s activities are analogous to those traditionally performed by a military\u201d. If such a person is \u201cseen to be giving out orders,\u201d the official continued, or is armed, or \u201chas undertaken actions that connote integration into the terrorist group, al-Qaida and/or one of its designated affiliates,\u201d the US reserves the right to kill them. The official did not list knowing the person\u2019s name as a threshold for marking them for execution. \u201cThis is a process of analysis. It is based on all the information, including sensitive intelligence, available to us,\u201d the official said. Drone strikes, synonymous with Obama in many parts of the world, are a legacy issue for the administration. An executive order issued on Friday required increased training, technological innovation and other \u201cfeasible precautions\u201d to reduce civilian casualties from future drone strikes, as well as mandating the annual public release of an updated death toll from counterterrorism operations. The order wrapped drone strikes, which can target individuals who have not attacked the US, in the mantle of \u201cthe Nation\u2019s inherent right of self-defense\u201d. Although an executive order is not a law, senior officials briefing reporters said they considered their measures binding on the next president, either Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton, as Obama\u2019s successor would need to formally overturn it. \u201cIt is in some ways to institutionalize these practices,\u201d a senior administration official said, to include \u201cthe care with which we undertake these lethal operations. So this is a very deliberate attempt to ensure that the architecture we put in place is durable, sustainable and lasting well beyond the next seven months or so.\u201d That intended durability caused human-rights campaigners to question the wisdom of retaining the signature strikes. \u201cThe problems with signature strikes are the way over time they assimilate into the norm a process of killing people without knowing who exactly they are,\u201d said Naureen Shah, a counterterrorism expert with Amnesty International. (Disclosure: this reporter is married to a senior Amnesty communications official.) Shah questioned whether the US government was \u201cfeeding itself good news and reprocessing its own logic without querying whether or not it\u2019s actually killing the people it says it is.\u201d Administration officials defended the rigor of their internal review, and pointed to the executive order\u2019s requirements to investigate the strikes, incorporating information acquired by the non-governmental organizations that attempt tracking the drone strikes despite the twin fogs of war and official secrecy. \u201cWe have a vantage point on these strikes that is unique and that others don\u2019t have, and we acknowledge that others have a vantage point that is also unique and we may not have. The purpose here is not to dispute the assessment of conscientious people who have done field interviews and looked at this question from different vantage points. It\u2019s simply to be transparent about the information that we have,\u201d said a third senior official who also would not agree to be quoted by name. Yet a chorus of human-rights campaigners denounced the White House drone disclosures as insufficient or dubious. Many noted the wide discrepancy between the official count of dead civilians \u2013 a range between 64 and 116 people over seven years \u2013 and the hundreds of civilians tallied as dead from drone strikes by outside groups. Jameel Jaffer, the deputy legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said key terms in the claimed authorities for US counterterrorism strikes, to include the \u201cimminence\u201d of a threat, were \u201cvague and malleable\u201d, leaving outsiders in the dark as to how the administration interprets them in practice. A group focused on protecting civilians in conflict zones, Civic, urged the administration to take additional steps, including conditioning weapons sales to foreign partner militaries on enhancing civilian protections and creating a permanent compensation fund for families of civilians killed. \u201cWithout swift and effective action, this executive order will end up as empty rhetoric,\u201d said Federico Borello, Civic\u2019s executive director, in a Friday statement. Hina Shamsi, the director of the ACLU\u2019s national-security project, said that the dangers of signature strikes were more acute for attacks on shadowy terrorist groups than for \u201cactual armed conflict\u201d. Shamsi continued: \u201cOutside of actual armed conflict, when the government often has faulty intelligence as the basis for those strikes, the likelihood of wrongful killings increase.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
