These two sides, runners-up in their respective competitions in 2015, needed extra time to be separated 12 months ago in the inaugural series, but Wayne Bennett\u2019s Brisbane were out of sight by half-time this year as the ugly gulf in class between rugby league\u2019s top two competitions became even more apparent. This was expected to be the closest of all three games this weekend but, after Sydney\u2019s demolition of St Helens, Wigan were second best throughout \u2013 with their cause not helped by a serious-looking injury to their hooker, Michael McIlorum. Initial fears are that the 28-year-old has broken his ankle following a first-half tackle \u2013 but even with their talismanic hooker on the field you feel Wigan still couldn\u2019t have competed with Brisbane. Brisbane scored the first of their seven tries when Corey Oates touched down in the corner despite looking like he was in touch. But that was a rare bone of contention on a night of one-way traffic. McIlorum was taken off on a stretcher soon after and, shortly following that, Brisbane doubled their lead when the half-back Kodi Nikorima touched down. Corey Parker\u2019s conversions rolled on and although a superb pass from Liam Farrell allowed Dan Sarginson to reduce the deficit soon after, they were 24-6 down at half-time after Nikorima fired a superb short ball for Matt Gillett to dive over, before Jarrod Wallace struck a telling blow with Brisbane\u2019s fourth try just before the hooter. Wigan failed to make a lengthy spell in possession count at the beginning of the second half and the ruthlessness of Brisbane was shown when a break from the former Hull KR full-back Greg Eden was finished in the opposite corner by Oates. The procession continued when Nikorima scored his second, before Eden got the try his performance merited late on by running the length of the field. The hosts kept fighting and George Williams did at least register a Wigan consolation try late on, but it meant little. The Wigan coach, Shaun Wane, said: \u201cObviously there\u2019s a big gap between Super League and the NRL. We gave it a decent shot but we weren\u2019t good enough, so you have to hold your hands up. We didn\u2019t turn up at all.\u201d Sydney Roosters\u2019 38-12 rout of St Helens on Friday means the Australian clubs are 2-0 up in the three-match series. Brisbane\u2019s coach Wayne Bennett, the newly-appointed England coach, admitted his side\u2019s victory came easier than he expected. \u201cI\u2019m happy with our performance, particularly with the intent and the way they went out to play game,\u201d he said. \u201cWe expected a pretty tough game and it certainly was tough at certain stages and then the score got away which took the pressure off.\u201d Bennett added: \u201cI thought St Helens tried extremely hard last night and I thought Wigan tried extremely hard as well tonight. But St Helens probably didn\u2019t have those quality players that the Roosters have and maybe that was the case here as well tonight.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
