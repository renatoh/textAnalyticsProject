It's just odd that the publisher has packaged the book so softly, with its rather girly title scrawled softly across ivory pink and topped by an airbrushed feather. We all judge a book by its cover - so why label this one \"men keep out\"? All right, like every book ever written it is in part a love story, but it is far more about hunger. It is about the hunger for a home of one's own, and if possible a warm resting place in someone else's soul. It is about the hole ripped out of a child's heart by parental failure, and the raging hunger for affection and validation that remains. It is about the unforgivable hunger of the Irish potato famine and its related mass evictions, and the ghastly genocide-shaped crater left in the heart of modern Ireland. Kathleen de Burca is a 49-year-old travel writer who has spent her life on the surface of things: describing the world through tourist's eyes, enjoying lacklustre flings with boring businessmen in foreign hotels. Thirty years ago she became a voluntary, angry exile from Ireland, but now she is going back, ready for something real: a profound story to tell, a concrete past, a tangible future. Maybe a resolution with her remaining family. Maybe even some decent, meaningful sex. Kathleen's initial plan is to investigate a (true) 19th-century scandal involving an Anglo-Irish landlord's English wife and his Irish groom (and the book's \"novel within a novel\" does a beautiful, redemptive job of commemorating this unproven passion). She also researches the famine, which was taking place at the time, but the travel writer in her is ill-prepared for the heart-wrenching reality of it. And indeed, it is hard to credit the descriptions O'Faolain unleashes on us, both in her own words and in interwoven eye-witness texts. Yet Kathleen, still in recovery from her love-starved childhood, has after all returned to a modern republic, growing in wealth and confidence and, like her, often silent about the past, sometimes angry, mostly just keen to deal with the issues and move on. The friends she makes will replace the friend whose death first drove her home; the new history she creates for herself will not exactly mend the past, but will supersede it; new loves may come and go but at last she is safe enough to grow some roots of her own. This is a novel about hunger, but perhaps even more a novel about healing - the sort of healing that becomes possible when victims stop suffering in silence, take control of their own history and tell it their way. Although this is O'Faolain's fictional debut, in the mid-1990s her autobiography, Are You Somebody? , dominated bestseller lists the world over. It was a powerful, moving account of a childhood ruined by her mother's depression and father's coldness, and had Frank McCourt wistfully wishing that Ireland had some kind of Booker or Pulitzer Prize of its own to offer her. Well, if she carries on like this, it's definitely worth considering."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
