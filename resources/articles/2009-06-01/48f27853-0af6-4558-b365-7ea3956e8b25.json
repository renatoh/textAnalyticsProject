These days we see reporters sitting bleary-eyed and po-faced, hunched in awkward posture over their laptops, a piece of temperamental equipment that I have so far done my best to resist. Technology is inexorably taking over, with journalists having increasingly to work for the internet as well as the printed page. As someone who still remains at times cussedly loyal to an old manual typewriter, I recoil from such modern and impersonal traits. My happiest days were in the 1940s and 50s when the pink 'uns and green 'uns continued to circulate around the country, providing a cherished Saturday tea-time ritual, this symbol of post-war's insatiable hunger for sporting news. The evening paper I worked for miraculously got its bundles of pink 'uns into the vans or on to the streets within 20 minutes of the final whistle. It was an extraordinary achievement and in the days when I was still a schoolboy buying a copy in such eager expectation, I even imagined the papers were hot to the touch. The print used to come off on my fingers, a badge of fulfilment. Later it was my turn to come up with the words, too. Nothing was more journalistically pulsating \u2013 more dramatic in its way than the murder trials and the police chases that had once filled our notebooks. But this was different; it actually recorded in graphic detail the build-up to the winning goal at Ashton Gate. The football public, many of whom had already watched the match \u2013 beer now on their breaths, boyish thrills in their veins \u2013 were back again, in the pavement queue, ready to live the 90 minutes all over again. Remember those were days before television's sprawling interest and radio's blanket coverage. Fanatical fans jammed the newsagents, loose change jangling in back pockets. They exchanged their trite opinions with their mates as they waited: the missed chances, the penalty save, the blind referee. Nowadays, you can hear it all, shallow, repetitive, biased, on the radio phone-ins. But surely it was much more fun when the supporters had to make do with just those austerely enunciated BBC results and then the sporting prints hot off the presses. Up in the frequently minuscule press boxes, whether in my case at Eastville or Halifax's Shay, where once I saw pram wheels protruding through the concrete of the terracing, I regularly gabbled away as I dictated in strict chronological order nearly 2,000 words of endeavour from 22 players of markedly varying talent. The writer's job was always to give the game rather more gloss than it deserved. There was no time to write so we merely talked into the phone. Back in our offices, a skilled copytaker typed our words for the compositor. It was frantic stuff. Literals got into our reports because there was no time to correct them. Nor was there time for long words or pretentious prose. The discipline served us well. Sports editors would look for the fastest typist they could find. At times those duties in our office were entrusted to a fiery, likeable, talented Scottish reporter called Charlie, even if he resented being pulled away from his favoured Saturday afternoon residency at the Artichoke pub. It should be added that he liked a drink and was on this occasion more garrulous than usual with his waspish verbal running commentary. Towards the end of the report of my finest purple prose, it was the custom to offer a few paragraphs of judgment on the game. It carried the sub-heading \"David Foot comments\". Charlie suddenly saw scope for a literary liberty and typed \"David Foot belly-aches\". The saucy observation wasn't spotted and got into the paper. I mention it only because the improvising copytaker was Charles Wilson, later to become editor of The Times. Maybe on reflection he had some sympathy for me. In any case, he once offered me a job in Fleet Street. I stayed contentedly to churn out my affectionate clich\u00e9s on Shadow Williams and Jantzen Derrick instead. The pink 'uns and green 'uns gradually receded and most of them disappeared for good. They became an uneconomic commercial indulgence while the street-corner vendors, with their distinctively throaty entreaties, saw no future in competing with the garages and supermarkets. And what was the point, anyway, in producing a newspaper whose contents had already been superseded by the radio reports and interviews? Some of us much regret their passing. Apart from the sheer throbbing professional enthusiasm and the aim to get the sports papers on the street when some of the players were still pulling off their mud-caked boots, there was a sweaty romance that will never be recaptured in the computer age. My old pink 'un, cluttered as it was with typographical lapses, was not fashioned for literary awards. But it was fun \u2013 and it was exciting. And where else would I have got the editor of The Times to work for me?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
