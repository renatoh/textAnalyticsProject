But still invited God, 10 May). As an Anglican priest I have frequently taken funerals of people whose relation to church was at best nominal. He rightly recognises the need for meaningful actions, not just on the personal but on the national level. Something that allows space for people of all faiths and none to recognise that our lives are about more than the acquisition of wealth and bigger than the sometimes compartmentalised lives we live. Part of my role is as a co-ordinating chaplain of a university in London where I want to seek ways of enabling a diverse population to come together to recognise a common sense of mourning, of injustice, and of celebration. Of course we can light candles, read poetry, share silence, and all of these are good and valuable things to do. However, until we have a national language and a pattern for doing these things that all can relate to, it is simply not going to meet a very human desire for ritual action that all can take part in. It sounds as if Canter did his sister proud \u2013 it is indeed a privilege to enable people to say goodbye to someone they love. I would contest only one thing: if there was not laughter as well as tears at a funeral, then probably I had not done my job as well as I ought. Rev Adele Rees London \u2022\u2008Jon Canter rather gives the game away when he complains about the CofE vicar who \"tries to celebrate\" the life of an \"unknown\" deceased person whose funeral service he or she is, nevertheless, legally obliged to conduct. A funeral service is neither a \"time for thanksgiving\" nor \"the celebration of a life\", even though that certainly seems to be what many mourners nowadays think they have to have, thereby hurrying past the all-important grieving stages. But the principal focus of the rite is the dignified and appropriate disposal of a corpse, with all the words and music (or not) that Canter, too, is happy to call on. As to whether or not God is present, I very much doubt that it depends on the deceased's beliefs; even so, one would assume that at a \"Dawkinsian\" atheist's funeral God can be relied upon to stay out of sight \u2013 if not out of mind \u2013 of those who are left behind! Fr Alec Mitchell Manchester \u2022 Thanks to Jon Canter for his perceptiveness about the difficulties of devising a thoroughgoingly secular funeral. Three really good things he provided for his sister \u2013 a tribute by a family member, humour and applause \u2013 can work wonderfully in a Christian funeral, as they all did in Southwark Cathedral's service late last year for their much-mourned dean, Colin Slee (Obituary, 25 November). But he touches on an even deeper matter: that excluding language about God limits what you can say about the richness and depth of human life.
