Nadal, who leapfrogged Djokovic to No 1 in the world despite pulling out of the semi-finals in Paris last week with an abdominal injury in a season of many highs and lows, is the most vulnerable. The 33-year-old has withdrawn seven times in 15 visits to the ATP Tour Finals, the game\u2019s season-ending showcase, and has not played the event for the past three years, although he was obliged to sound upbeat about reaching the starting line against the defending champion, Alexander Zverev, on Monday night. \u201cI\u2019m confident I can be competitive but in this tournament you need to be 100% ready from the beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cI started [practising again] yesterday, very slow. For me the main goal is to be healthy for Monday.\u201d Nadal denied his participation in the Davis Cup finals in Madrid the following week would influence his decision about playing in London. \u201cNo, this is such a big event,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Davis Cup is another big event. I\u2019m doing what the doctors tell me to do. I\u2019m trying to be ready for everything. I just try to do my calendar, to do the things that work best for me. Playing here is always very special. I\u2019m excited to be in London. Davis Cup? We\u2019ll look at that after here.\u201d Federer \u2013 who opens against the world No 5, Dominic Thiem, on Sunday night \u2013 also has to prioritise events in his schedule at 38, and defended his decision to withdraw \u201cfor family reasons\u201d from the inaugural ATP Team Cup, which starts in Australia on 3 January. Instead, he will play several lucrative exhibition tournaments this month in South America as well as in China before the Australian Open, followed by a non-Tour match against Nadal immediately afterwards in South Africa on 7 February. \u201cWhen we had to sign up for the ATP Cup it was shortly after Wimbledon and it was logical to play the first week [of 2020],\u201d he said. \u201cThe South America exhibition tour was a long time in scheduling. I couldn\u2019t do it because of my knee, because of the children \u2026 it was going to be too much. South America was a priority for me. Then, when I realised Stan [Wawrinka, his Swiss teammate] wasn\u2019t going to play [in the ATP Team Cup, against Great Britain in Sydney], I decided I\u2019d rather stay with my family and make the Australian Open a priority. \u201cI\u2019ve got a dream match with Rafa, and have been trying to get that date for the last two years. Something had to give. That was the ATP Cup. It wasn\u2019t that level of importance for me. My decision was also connected to announcing I would play in the Olympics [in Tokyo in July]. We try to come up with a schedule for the kids. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s contradictory at all.\u201d Perhaps not \u2013 although those fans who were persuaded to buy tickets to see Federer play in a rare visit to Sydney in January might see it differently. Djokovic, meanwhile, remains committed to regaining the No 1 ranking and opens the tournament on Sunday afternoon against Matteo Berrettini, the first Italian to make the finals. \u201cThat serves as a great motivation,\u201d said the five-times winner of this title. \u201cWe all work very hard in the longest season of all sports to qualify for the season\u2019s finale. Historically, I\u2019ve played well in the indoor season.\u201d Berrettini, eighth in the world, said: \u201cI didn\u2019t expect to be here at the beginning of the season or even a few months ago. The US Open [where he reached the semi-finals, losing to Nadal] changed it.\u201d Djokovic and Berrettini are in the Bjorn Borg Group with Federer and Thiem, while Nadal and Zverev compete in the Andre Agassi quartet alongside the sensationally in-form Daniil Medvedev and Stefanos Tsitsipas. The challenge for the Big Three once was to conquer each other; now it is to survive until the final weekend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
