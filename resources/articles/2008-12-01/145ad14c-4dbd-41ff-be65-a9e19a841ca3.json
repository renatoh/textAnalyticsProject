But I really cannot join in with the tributes paid to Conor Cruise O'Brien since his death on Thursday at the age of 91. To call him a man of contradictions, as several obituarists have done, is to excuse the effects of his contrariety. We learn from current Irish politicians that the Cruiser was \"an intellectual giant\", with a \"towering intellect\", who was \u2013 according to Ireland's foreign minister, Miche\u00e1l Martin \u2013 \"a man of undoubted courage and brilliance\". Excuse me if I dissent from this hagiographic outpouring. The truth is that, on the greatest question facing his native Ireland during his lifetime \u2013 its partition \u2013 he changed his mind at crucial moments and, given his status as one of his country's most prominent intellectuals and human rights campaigners, helped to undermine the forces opposed to partition. Worse than that, far worse, this man who had the temerity to complain about the absence of free speech in Nkrumah's Ghana and elsewhere in the world, used his political position in Ireland to stifle free speech. As a minister in the Cosgrave government, he inherited a notorious censorship law that banned proscribed organisations from the airwaves, thus preventing Sinn F\u00e9in and IRA members from access to the media. Not only did he defend the law, he strengthened it. The republican point of view was therefore marginalised and, in so doing, I would argue that it helped to delay the peace process. It certainly bolstered Margaret Thatcher's argument when her government imposed censorship in 1988 to deny Sinn F\u00e9in \"the oxygen of publicity\". What both bans denied was the possibility of a political and intellectual debate. To get a sense of O'Brien's flipflopping record on partition, consider this. In the late 1940s, he was passionately agin it. In the 1970s, he worked tirelessly to undermine those who opposed partition. Throughout the 1980s, he wrote and made speeches defending the existence of a separate state in the north of Ireland. In 1996, he went so far as to join UK Unionist party, a reactionary grouping hostile to the Belfast Agreement that underpinned the peace process. He even managed to get elected to the Northern Ireland forum. But, just four years later, he wrote a book in which he disavowed the very unionist viewpoints he had been prosyletising for the best part of 30 years, by calling on unionists to consider the benefits of a united Ireland. By then, of course, he was undone by history and by his own inconsistencies. When he counted, as a D\u00e1il minister, he had come up short. When he no longer carried any political weight, he appeared to have seen the light. I noted the reference in Simon Hoggart's Saturday column to O'Brien having spoken to him of the \"corrosive effect of Irish national mythology on the politics of the present day\". But O'Brien was guilty of myth-making too. He not only misrepresented the republican standpoint, he suppressed those who sought to explain his distortions. Oh yes, and while I'm about it, let me quash one further myth about O'Brien: he was not \u2013 repeat, not \u2013 the editor of the Observer. For something less than two years from 1979, he was the paper's \"editor-in-chief\" and exercised very little editorial power. But his single interference \u2013 criticising the work of Mary Holland for what he regarded as her sympathy for Irish nationalism \u2013 proved significant. It led to her departure after 15 years of brilliant reporting. Great guy, eh?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
