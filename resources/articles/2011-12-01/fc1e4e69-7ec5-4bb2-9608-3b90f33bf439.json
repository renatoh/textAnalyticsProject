With O2 Lease, users can get their mitts on the latest Apple handset for \u00a355 a month. Crucially, there is no upfront fee. At the end of the lease, simply hand it back and walk away, or upgrade to the latest model. The lease option is slightly more expensive per month than a traditional two-year contract but it only runs for 12 months. It will particularly appeal to those who enjoy having the very latest handsets, and switch each year. O2 says: \"This is the first time a UK mobile operator has adopted a leasing model, and this is the smallest thing you can lease in the UK. We know that customers and small businesses are used to leasing everyday items, from cars and washing machines to photocopiers and office space. We have simply taken this idea and applied it to the smartphone market.\" The company says the service will initially be offered through O2 stores and over the phone. Those leasing the 16GB iPhone 4S will pay \u00a355 a month. The deal will include insurance \u2013 worth around \u00a312 a month. If you want the 32GB, the lease is \u00a365 per month. The deal includes 750 call-time minutes per month and unlimited texts, plus a relatively small 500MB of data downloads, and unlimited UK Wi-Fi. Until now, those unable to raise a big upfront fee have had to take out a two-year contract, typically paying around \u00a346 a month for two years, although the main advantage of a contract over leasing is that at the end, the handset belongs to you. If you want an iPhone 4S on a 12-month, \u00a351-a-month contract, you currently have to pay around \u00a3139 for the handset. Sally Cowdry, marketing director for O2 UK, says potential customers can walk into one of its shops to do the deal, while existing users can phone and lease there and then. Small businesses will also be able to take advantage of the offer. You can expect to be credit-referenced. \"O2 has had to build entirely new systems for handling everything from credit agreements to managing device returns, and, increasingly, our recycling commitment at the end of the contracts. We believe the result is a new model that will challenge the industry and its customers to look at the UK's mobile landscape with fresh eyes,\" says Cowdry. Before you rush out and sign up, there are a few downsides. As with car leases, you will have to return the handset without any damage, and if you break it, and can't claim on the insurance, you will be charged for repairs. Normal wear and tear will be acceptable, and there will be some disputes over what this constitutes. The insurance carries a first claim excess of \u00a360, and \u00a3120 for any subsequent claims. O2 recommends customers protect the device with a case. If a customer loses or damages it badly, they will need to claim, and replace it before the plan ends. Should the phone remain unreturned, is damaged or is not working when handed back, O2 will raise a charge, it warns."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
