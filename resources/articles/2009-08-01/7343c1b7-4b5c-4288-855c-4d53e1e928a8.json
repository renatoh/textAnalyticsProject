The England captain played down suggestions that his own relationship with Flintoff had suffered after the all-rounder was left out of the fourth Test but warned that this match \u2013 the biggest England have played since Australia visited south London four years ago \u2013 is about far more than one man. \"For a big game like this it's a massive plus to have Flintoff in the side,\" said Strauss. \"It's kind of the perfect storm: his last game, so he's going to be completely motivated to go out on a high, a must-win Ashes Test match at home, a full house \u2013 the script's written perfectly. \"I think he can lift the others with his performances, but we won't win the game with just that alone. We need all 11 to stand up and be counted.\" Asked about the tension caused by the decision to leave Flintoff out at Leeds because of concerns over his right knee, Strauss said: \"I'd totally disagree with that. I talked with Fred after the Headingley Test. We both know where we stood. Some of the stuff that has been said has been a long way off the mark.\" Strauss did his best to delve beneath the inevitable headlines by calling for England to beware of \"Fredmania\" and strive for a cool brand of \"emotionless\" cricket. \"We've got to guard against emotion taking over for all of us,\" he said. \"It's an important game, so there's an element of nerves and excitement, but you play your best cricket when you're emotionless. It's a case of your head ruling your heart most of the time, and maybe we didn't do that so well at Headingley.\" Strauss admitted that his players would risk defeat in pursuit of victory as they aim to become the first England side since 1953 to triumph in a must-win Ashes encounter at The Oval, then quickly added: \"But you don't start the game like that. You go out there trying to gain the advantage over the first three days and then push for victory on the final two days. It's important we realise that and we need to play smart cricket in the first half of the game.\" Whether England are able to play smart cricket with a batting line-up that has produced one century all series and was blown away twice at Headingley is another matter, but Strauss defended the decision to go in with a middle order of Ian Bell, Paul Collingwood and Jonathan Trott, and talked up the chances of Steve Harmison playing at a venue that has brought him 22 Test wickets at 26 apiece. \"There's usually a bit of pace and bounce so he's definitely one of the guys we're looking at.\" That could mean bad news for Harmison's Durham colleague Graham Onions, and would then leave the management needing to decide whether to play two spinners. Monty Panesar has been in miserable form all summer, both with England and Northamptonshire, but a dry Oval surface could yet earn him a recall at the expense of Stuart Broad. Australia's captain Ricky Ponting said there would be big expectations for Flintoff and Trott to deal with at The Oval. \"I think there will be huge pressure on Trott,\" he said. \"It's always hard making your Test debut against an Australian team, let alone it being such a big game. \"We have had a good chance to have a look at how he plays and spoken to a few Australian guys around the circuit about how he plays as well, and have got some footage from the Twenty20 and the one-day stuff earlier this season. It is up to us to keep the pressure on and not to give him any cheap early runs.\" On Flintoff, he remarked: \"He does add something to the England team. Whenever he comes on to bowl or comes out to bat the whole crowd certainly gets behind him. But I guess there will be extra pressure on him as well playing his last game and knowing that it is such an important game for the England team.\" Asked about how his side planned to celebrate in case of victory, Ponting pointed out Australia will take the train north to Edinburgh the next morning. \"Is it an open-top train?\" he asked. \"Even when we have won World Cups most times I think we have maybe gone back and had a small reception somewhere in Australia and then get back down to playing cricket. If we do win I'm sure we will celebrate accordingly, but as you know we are jumping on a train and going up to Scotland.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
