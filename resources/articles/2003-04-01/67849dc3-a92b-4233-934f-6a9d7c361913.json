The Irish trainer Christy Roche warned on Monday that he would withdraw his well-backed horse from Saturday's big race at Aintree if the ground was too fast, but 6mm of rain changed the going to good to soft, good in places. \"The rain was just what we needed and there's a chance of showers tomorrow,\" said clerk of the course Andrew Tulloch. The going on the Mildmay course remains good. Tulloch added: \"We will continue to monitor the situation as far as watering is concerned and look again tomorrow.\" On the betting front, Killusty was the subject of the biggest move yesterday with Coral reporting money flooding in on Charlie Egerton's charge. The firm cut the odds about Killusty to 16-1 from 25-1."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
