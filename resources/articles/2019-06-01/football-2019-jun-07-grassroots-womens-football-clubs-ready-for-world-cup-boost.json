But as the club has grown from a handful of players in 2015 to more than 150 now, Simpson\u2019s administrative responsibilities can no longer be described as mundane. Pitch space limits the number who can train to 60, and the list often fills up within seconds. \u201cI get so stressed because I have to put it on at the exact right time,\u201d the 25-year-old says. When one player realised what time it was, she jumped off a train and tried to get signal so she could sign up. \u201cIt\u2019s like getting tickets for Glastonbury.\u201d Simpson believes the club\u2019s growth is evidence that when women are given a welcoming space in which to play football, they will come and play. Goal Diggers, which is open to women and non-binary players, is one of a handful of new grassroots football clubs that prioritises accessibility over ability. The club\u2019s founder, Fleur Cousens, says: \u201cI founded the team because I was basically fed up of being told that football is a man\u2019s game.\u201d At training, excitement about the upcoming Women\u2019s World Cup is palpable. \u201cI\u2019m going to France three weekends in a row. I\u2019m going by ferry, train and plane. I can\u2019t wait,\u201d says Gaia Laidler, 24. But Cousens says more needs to be done to raise the profile of professional and grassroots women\u2019s football. \u201cAt the women\u2019s Euros we had to hunt down places and plead for them to put the football on,\u201d she says. The Women\u2019s World Cup will be a landmark moment for the sport. Fifa expects 1 billion people will tune in to watch the tournament, and in the UK the BBC will broadcast every game. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of excitement, awareness and anticipation that I\u2019ve never felt before,\u201d said Kelly Simmons, the FA\u2019s director of women\u2019s football. While Goal Diggers players welcome the increased coverage and sponsorship, they believe community events stressing inclusion and diversity are key to shifting perceptions. They want to ensure the increased interest in women\u2019s football is sustained long after the World Cup ends. The club has partnered with bars, brands, and nonprofits to create the Festival of Football. As well as film screenings, panel talks and photography exhibitions, the festival will have football taster days for beginners and women over 40. \u201cThe more people see women\u2019s football being screened in pubs and bars, the more people think that\u2019s something they can do. The more spaces there are for women to play football, the more they are inclined to watch it,\u201d said the festival\u2019s founder, Hannah Wright. Jenna al-Ansari, who runs cultural events at the Book Club, a bar in east London, said the decision to screen every match was a no-brainer. \u201cThe Women\u2019s World Cup didn\u2019t really have a home. There isn\u2019t a particular bar or a particular pub that had embraced the World Cup and we thought we\u2019d be perfect for that.\u201d She said women\u2019s football was no longer a \u201cniche interest that can be brushed under the carpet\u201d and it was important fans had a place to go where there would be an atmosphere. Cousens first started playing football in primary school. \u201cI played in a mixed team and got pushed out because I was a girl, though I was one of the best in the team. I was about nine and at that age that rejection meant I stopped playing. I thought it wasn\u2019t a sport for me,\u201d she says. It\u2019s a story that resonated with other players at Goal Diggers. Amy Lester, who is training to be a coach, says the club\u2019s greatest achievements are not matches won but the growing number of women and non-binary people who become more confident and skilled. The club is struggling to find a council willing to provide a larger pitch space. Cousens says it isn\u2019t good enough for local authorities committed to gender equality to say bookings are on a first come, first served basis, allowing a handful of guys to block-book pitches months in advance. Angela Murdock, whose 13-year-old daughter Ruby plays for Crystal Palace under-15s, says it requires a great deal of time and effort from parents to nurture their child\u2019s interest in the sport. \u201cIt\u2019s a hell of a lot of driving to get them to games and training,\u201d she says, adding that more clubs and opportunities would be welcomed. As for Ruby, she says it never crossed her mind that football wasn\u2019t for girls. \u201cI\u2019ve grown up with really good female players and I\u2019ve always thought girls could play,\u201d she says. When she was school, some boys initially didn\u2019t to pass to her, but that didn\u2019t last long. \u201cThey all started to pass to me when they realised I could play.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
