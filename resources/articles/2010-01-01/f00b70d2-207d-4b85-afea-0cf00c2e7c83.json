Pots and pans gleam, silver fish are carried on a stick, and sacks are passed through the auditorium on to the stage by the squealing young audience. Its carnival time, and a beaky devil grins and makes mischief. Like almost all productions at this beautiful little puppet theatre, there are moments of delicate magic in this show, inspired by Igor Stravinsky's ballet music, and puppets are placed side by side with human actors. The puppets, however, always come off best. The sinister Puppet Master sets up his stage to show off his puppets \u2013 a graceful ballerina in a red dress, a circus performer, and the cheeky Petrushka \u2013 to the people of St Petersburg. \"My puppets act more human,\" he says, \"than the whole human race.\" They do indeed. The Puppet Master may think he has control over his creations, but his puppets have secret lives of their own. The consequences are inevitably tragic in this eternal love triangle, pitting the underdog Petrushka against the circus performer as both vie for the love of the lady in red. It's a touching tale, and one often only told in its ballet version. So it's a pity that the story line isn't more streamlined and easier to follow: the introduction of the composer Stravinsky is a complication too far that dilutes the essence of the story. The puppets are brilliantly expressive and the piece is charmingly old-fashioned, but the lack of fluidity and the leisurely pace conspire to make this show feel far dustier than it should."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
