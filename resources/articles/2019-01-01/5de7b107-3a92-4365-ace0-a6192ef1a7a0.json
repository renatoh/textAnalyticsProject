The French president hopes the nationwide public consultation will take the sting out of the widespread public anger behind the rise of the gilets jaunes (yellow vests) movement and the civil unrest across France. In the letter, Macron said he was open to ideas and suggestions but insisted the government would not go back on previous reforms or key measures in his 2017 election campaign. \u201cNo questions are banned,\u201d Macron writes. \u201cWe won\u2019t agree on everything, that\u2019s normal, that\u2019s democracy. But at least we\u2019ll show that we are a people who are not afraid to speak, to exchange views and debate. And perhaps we\u2019ll discover that we might even agree, despite our different persuasions, more often than we think.\u201d Macron has been rocked by the ferocity of almost two months of angry protests by gilets jaunes. On Saturday a ninth weekend of demonstrations took place across France. The letter, to be published in French newspapers on Monday, marks the start of a nationwide consultation in which citizens are invited to give their views on four central themes: taxation; the organisation of the state and its public administration; ecological transition; and citizenship and democracy. Macron\u2019s missive asks a number of questions, including: what taxes should be reduced?; what spending cuts might be a priority?; is there too much administration?; how can the people be given a greater say in running the country? Macron said the proposals collected during the debate would build a new \u201ccontract for the nation\u201d, influence political policymaking and establish France\u2019s stance on national, European and international issues. \u201cThis is how I intend, with you, to transform anger into solutions,\u201d he wrote. Accepting that everyone wanted taxes that were \u201cfairer and more efficient\u201d, he warned against unrealistic expectations, adding there could be no drop in taxation without cuts in public spending. Macron and his centrist administration have been under intense pressure since November when public anger over an eco-tax on petrol and diesel sparked the gilets jaunes movement. Although the tax was dropped, protests have widened to adopt a wide range of anti-government grievances. Outside the cities, gilets jaunes continue to picket roundabouts around the country with ad hoc protests calling for a drop in taxes on food and essential goods, lower social charges and increased spending power. On Saturday there were further clashes between police and protesters in many French cities, with accusations of violence from both sides. In the letter, Macron wrote that he would accept \u201cno form of violence\u201d including \u201cpressure and insults\u201d against \u201celected representatives, media journalists, state institutions or public servants\u201d. \u201cIf everyone is being aggressive to everyone else, society falls apart,\u201d he wrote. Macron wrote that he would give his conclusions within a month of the end of the consultation process on 15 March. The letter ends: \u201cIn confidence. Emmanuel Macron\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
