Shares in Ottakar's tumbled 25p to 303p as it revealed it had received a renewed indicative cash offer from HMV at a price \"materially below\" its current market level. The terms were not specified but are believed to have been around 285p a share, a substantial reduction on HMV's 440p-a-share offer last year, which valued Ottakar's at \u00a396.4m. Those terms were agreed by the Ottakar's board but the bid lapsed when the Competition Commission was called in to investigate the deal. HMV was given approval to bid again last week and still has more than a fortnight to make a formal offer. Trading at Ottakar's has deteriorated significantly since HMV's original approach, hence the reduced terms. HMV, which owns the Waterstone's books chain, has also suffered a further slowdown in its own sales in recent months. Both sides are keen to tie up a deal and said yesterday that talks are continuing. The Ottakar's board warned: \"At this stage there can be no certainty that agreement will be reached on terms of a recommended offer.\" There have been widespread rumours that WH Smith is planning a rival bid for Ottakar's, though hopes of a bid battle are fading. Richard Ratner of Seymour Pierce said: \"Whilst we believe that there is still a chance that WH Smith could enter the fray, the situation looks much less promising than before.\" He added: \"Whilst HMV needs Ottakar's, Ottakar's also needs a bid or else it will be a long, slow journey to rebuilding shareholder value.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
