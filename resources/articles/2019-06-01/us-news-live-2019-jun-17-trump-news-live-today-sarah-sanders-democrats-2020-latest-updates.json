The Trump administration will cut hundreds of millions in aid to to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. President Trump had blasted these three countries because thousands of their citizens had sought asylum at the US border. Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Kamala Harris closed out the Poor People\u2019s Campaign Presidential Forum. The New York Times is reporting that the Justice Department has intervened to keep former Trump adviser Paul Manafort out of the notorious Rikers Island jail complex. Manafort was set to be transferred to Rikers this month to await trial on a separate state case, according to the New York Times. But then Manhattan prosecutors received a letter from Jeffrey Rosen, the top deputy for attorney general William Barr, that indicated that \u201che was monitoring where Mr. Manafort would be held in New York\u201d. And then, on Monday, federal prison officials weighed in, telling the Manhattan district attorney\u2019s office that Mr. Manafort, 70, would not be going to Rikers. Instead, he will await his trial at a federal lockup in Manhattan or at the Pennsylvania federal prison where he is serving a seven-and-a-half-year sentence for wide-ranging financial schemes, according to people with knowledge of the matter. A senior Justice Department official said that the department believed Mr. Manafort\u2019s treatment was appropriate, but several former and current prosecutors said the decision was highly unusual. Most federal inmates facing state charges are held on Rikers Island. The intervention of Mr. Rosen was just the latest twist in the case of Mr. Manafort, whose campaign work for Mr. Trump and political consulting in Ukraine put him in the cross hairs of a two-year investigation into Russian influence in the 2016 election. He was convicted of financial fraud in two separate federal cases that came out of the investigation, which was led by the former special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. While that might have been the end of his criminal problems, in March, he was indicted on 16 New York state felonies, including mortgage fraud and falsifying records to obtain millions of dollars in loans. The charges, which are based on some of the same actions in the federal cases, were brought by the office of the Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus R. Vance Jr. Mr. Manafort is expected to be arraigned next week in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. Speaking of acting defense secretary Pat Shanahan, it appears his confirmation hearing has been delayed: From the article: Despite informally announcing more than a month ago acting Defense Secretary Pat Shanahan as his pick to get the Pentagon job on a permanent basis, President Donald Trump has yet to formally nominate Shanahan, forcing the Senate Armed Services Committee to postpone a confirmation hearing it had tentatively scheduled for Tuesday June 18. Senators were told that the postponement was because the committee had yet to receive documents from the FBI\u2019s background check, according to a staffer for a committee member. With Shanahan\u2019s confirmation on hold, press reports have questioned his relationship with the president, and the Pentagon has been fielding press queries about his personal life, including a messy divorce that involved an accusation of domestic violence from his ex-wife. Shanahan did not respond to multiple requests for comment on this story. The Pentagon declined to comment. The Department of Defense authorized the deployment of an additional 1,000 troops to the Middle East, the acting defense secretary announced today, in response to last week\u2019s attacks on oil tankers last week, which the US believed Iran was behind. Here are some comments from acting defense secretary Pat Shanahan: My, the difference a few months can make: Just for some context, the latest Quinnipiac poll has former vice president Joe Biden leading at 30%, Senator Bernie Sanders at 19%, Senator Elizabeth Warren at 15%, Mayor Pete Buttigieg (who was virtually unknown in December 2018) at 8% and Senator Kamala Harris also at 7%. Beto O\u2019Rourke trials at 3%, with Senator Cory Booker and Senator Amy Klobuchar tied at 1%. Senator Kamala Harris has now taken the stage at the Poor People\u2019s Campaign. Here\u2019s more on the 1,000 additional troops that the US is sending to the Middle East: Senator Bernie Sanders is now on stage at the Poor People\u2019s Campaign. Looks like we have more details on the additional troops the US is sending to the Middle East: Reuters is reporting that the US is preparing to send more troops to the Middle East in response to mounting concerns over Iran, which Washington blames for attacks on oil tankers last week. Further details, such as how many troops and when they will be deployed, were not disclosed. The Trump administration will cut hundreds of millions in aid to to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras after President Trump blasted the three countries because their citizens had sought asylum at the US border, Reuters is reporting. The administration reportedly told congressional aides that it would reallocate $370m in aid that Congress approved for fiscal 2018, and suspend $180m approved for fiscal 2017. The administration said in March it would cut aid to the three countries after Trump expressed unhappiness with the their immigration policies. No funds will be provided until the administration is satisfied the countries are reducing the number of migrants reaching the U.S. border, State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus told reporters. \u201cThis is consistent with the president\u2019s direction and with the recognition that it is critical that there be sufficient political will in these countries to address the problem at its source,\u201d she said. Without elaborating, she added: \u201cWorking with Congress, we will reprogram those funds to other priorities as appropriate.\u201d Hey all, Vivian Ho taking over for Jessica Glenza. Let\u2019s see where the day takes us. The Poor People\u2019s Campaign in Washington DC honed 2020 Democratic candidates\u2019 positions on progressive issues, including single-payer healthcare, universal childcare and a tax on America\u2019s wealthiest. Warren had a receptive audience, talking about progressive issues central to her campaign. Biden said he would make poverty a focus. Trump supporters are already lining up at a stadium in Orlando, Florida in preparation for a rally tomorrow, and a Democratic super PAC is spending heavily on digital ads in the Sunshine state. Vice President Mike Pence and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with rightwing populist Matteo Salvini. The US Supreme Court issued a significant legal victory to Democrats in Virginia, and a defeat to a lesbian couple in Oregon who were denied a cake because they are gay. Sen. Michael Bennett of Colorado is speaking now at the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Sen. Kamala Harris of California. MSNBC\u2019s Joy Reid asked Warren how she would win: Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s communications director will become the Vice President for communications at Lockheed Martin, one of the largest defense contractors in the US. The crowd at Poor People\u2019s Campaign is reacting to Warren\u2019s message. Senator Elizabeth Warren is on a roll on matters that are core to her platform \u2013 a tax on people earning more than $50m, free universal childcare, free pre-kindergarten, canceling student loans and $100bn over 10 years for the opioid crisis. \u201cAsking those at the very top to put in 2 cents is enough to be able to help all of our children build a future, not just some of our children, but all of our children,\u201d said Warren. US Sen. Elizabeth Warren is now stepping on stage at the Poor People\u2019s Campaign. Earlier today, as the US Supreme Court released its decisions, Justice Clarence Thomas took a noteworthy stand: he said the court should \u201cnot follow\u201d precedent he viewed as \u201cdemonstrably erroneous\u201d. The legal concept of stare decisis, a Latin phrase pronounced meaning \u201cstand by things decided,\u201d is a foundational principal for the court. It means, in general, once the court has spoken on an issue it is unlikely to take up a similar case. It also one of the ways law is made \u2013 lower courts must abide by precedent. That made his comments in a concurring opinion on a double jeopardy case today remarkable. For most legal analysts, the remarks called to mind one decision in particlar: Roe v Wade. Thomas says legal questions have objectively correct answers, and judges should find them regardless of whether their colleagues or predecessors found different answers,\u201d Jonathan Entin, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, told Reuters. \u201cEveryone is concerned about this because they\u2019re thinking about Roe v. Wade.\u201d The landmark 1973 US Supreme Court decision legalized abortion, and provided women with a constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy. That right has been under continuous attack from state legislatures this year, which have passed clearly unconstitutional laws in an effort to get the issue before the court again. When faced with a demonstrably erroneous precedent, my rule is simple: We should not follow it,\u201d wrote Thomas, who has long expressed a greater willingness than his colleagues to overrule precedents. The US Department of State just provided this statement about Secretary of State Mike Pompeo\u2019s meeting with Italian Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini, a rightwing populist politician. Here is the statement from spokesperson Morgan Ortagus:\u200e Secretary Michael R. Pompeo met today in Washington with Italian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Interior Matteo Salvini. They reiterated the value of the United States\u2019 longstanding relationship with Italy, including as NATO Allies and members of the G7. They also discussed confronting regional security risks from Russia and Iran, the threat posed by China\u2019s predatory investments in key infrastructure and technology in Italy and Europe, and the need for strengthened U.S.-Italy defense cooperation. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who is expected to appear on the Poor People\u2019s Campaign presidential forum today, also spoke with The American Prospect today. Here is what she had to say about monopolies: We\u2019ve had a government that has kissed up to every giant corporation for decades. It has weakened antitrust enforcement, looked the other way on mergers, passed on deals that everyone knew were anti-competitive and would be bad for the economy and bad for competition but good for the bottom line of the companies that wanted it... The problem is not an overreaching government, the problem is a government that won\u2019t get in the fight on the side of the people. She focused in particular about tech platforms. So I have a plan to break up the big platforms. If a platform is doing more than a billion dollars in business, the platform has to be broken off from all of the ancillary businesses. And there\u2019s just\u2014We shouldn\u2019t have to litigate it. Just make it happen. It\u2019s too much concentration of power. Reverend William Barber is now working the crowd. MSNBC\u2019s Joy Reid asks him to respond to people who say caring for people in poverty should be the job of charities. Respond he said \u2013 \u201cWithout cursing?\u201d He goes on to say: \u201cWe have to say to folks \u2013 you\u2019re wrong.\u201d ... \u201cTo say all you need is charity to address 143 million people in poverty... It\u2019s like saying well all you need to do is fix slavery is have church in the slave quarters, or all you need to do to fix women not having the vote is to pray with them.\u201d ... \u201cPoverty is intentional and strategic and this nation needs to be intentional and strategic about it.\u201d Just want to return briefly to one of the Biden\u2019s more striking answers to MSNBC\u2019s Joy Reid at the Poor People\u2019s Campaign. The Poor People\u2019s Campaign is back and now discussing a striking figure often cited \u2013 that 140 million people in the United States are low-income or living in poverty. Here is Reverend William Barber talking about the number: The people impacted... must cry loud. We cannot wait for the system to be loud about the crisis, we have to be loud about the crisis.\u201d That figure \u2013 140 million people living in poverty \u2013 comes from what is known as the federal Supplemental Poverty Measure. That takes into account measures such as costs for food, clothing, housing as well as federal assistance. Here is the full report that describes the underpinnings of the campaign. As Trump gets ready to head to Florida tomorrow, here\u2019s a bit of perspective on the Sunshine State\u2019s importance in presidential politics. Democratic candidates, including early front-runner Joe Biden, have visited the state to tap donors and connect with voters, and will come to Miami later this month for their first round of debates. Trump returns on Tuesday for his latest reelection announcement. In anticipation, a Democratic super political action committee, Priorities USA, is beginning a six-figure digital advertising effort to \u201chelp cut through his noise and give voters a look at the truth about Trump\u2019s policies.\u201d The attention is a recognition that, despite its expensive media markets and polarized politics, neither party can ignore Florida. For Trump, there are few ways for him to remain in the White House without keeping Florida\u2019s 29 electoral votes. For Democrats, a win here would validate the party\u2019s emphasis on building diverse coalitions, not to mention all but obliterate Trump\u2019s reelection prospects. Florida Democrats say it\u2019s wrong to interpret recent election results as the state slipping away. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re red. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re purple. I think we\u2019re simply unorganized,\u201d said former Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, the 2018 Democratic nominee for governor who lost by fewer than 33,000 votes. Gillum\u2019s race was one of several in recent years decided by a tiny sliver of the electorate, leaving the state a veritable graveyard of broken Democratic dreams. Earlier this year, he launched Forward Florida, a political group meant to help Democrats retake the state in 2020, to keep Florida from being left by the wayside as Democrats try to sort out how the Trump-era political realignment has remade the presidential map. While both parties seem convinced of the importance of the upper Midwest, fresh questions are being raised over whether the path to the White House must still run through other long-standing battlegrounds and whether others might be emerging. The Democratic super PAC Priorities USA revealed last month that its polling shows Ohio, an erstwhile swing state, now appears safer for Trump than deep-red Texas. Next candidate up in the forum is Andrew Yang, a Silicon Valley and New York entrepreneur. He starts by talking about how the most common jobs will be \u201cautomated away\u201d. We need a guaranteed minimum income in the United States of America... If you know anything about me you know this \u2013 there\u2019s an Asian man running for president and he wants to give everyone $1,000 a month.\u201d Reverend William Barber asks former Vice President Joe Biden whether he will have a full debate on poverty in his campaign. Reverend that\u2019s why I\u2019m here,\u201d said Biden. He continued, \u201cIt\u2019s not only systemic it is incredibly debilitating, it is the one thing that can bring this country down.\u201d We are now live-streaming the Poor People\u2019s Campaign Presidential Forum, where former Vice President Joe Biden is speaking now. To clarify, this blog earlier stated the wrong time for this forum. It is happening now, not this evening. A Democratic super PAC is launching ads in Florida, ahead of Trump\u2019s planned rally there on Tuesday (for which people are already lining up). The six-figure digital ad blitz is part of a larger $100m effort across four key states, also including Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan. \u201cDonald Trump wants to come to Orlando and kick off his 2020 campaign by deceiving voters about his record on health care and the economy. But the truth is, Trump\u2019s policies haven\u2019t helped many Floridians \u2013 billionaires and big corporations are thriving while the middle class foots the bill. These ads will show Floridians how out of touch Trump and his policies are with the concerns of Floridan families,\u201d said Guy Cecil, Chairman of Priorities USA. \u201cFlorida is a must-win state for Trump and he hopes to have the news to himself this week. These ads will help cut through his noise and give voters a look at the truth about Trump\u2019s policies.\u201d Here is an example of one of the ads. Today is the fourth anniversary of the shooting at Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina. In 2015, a white supremacist entered the historically black church, and shot and killed nine people during the final prayer at a Bible study. Harvard has rescinded the acceptance of Kyle Kashuv, a survivor of the school shooting at Majorie Stoneman Douglas high school in Parkland, Florida, and a pro-gun activist. Most of Kashuv\u2019s classmates pushed for stricter gun control laws. Kashuv said on Twitter his acceptance was rescinded because of \u201ctexts and comments made nearly two years ago\u201d. The Tampa Bay Times reported Harvard\u2019s move came after reports Kashuv used racial slurs in shared documents. More from the Times here: Kashuv, who graduated from Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School earlier this summer, has been embraced by conservatives and the National Rifle Association in his rapid arc to fame since the Feb. 14, 2018 mass shooting that left 17 students and faculty dead and 17 other people injured at the Broward County school). Kashuv, who told us last year that his parents are from Israel, has also been castigated by those on the left for his conservative views and unwavering support of President Donald Trump. Here is an account from the Atlantic from this April, of how these lunches have gone in the past: For decades, presidents and vice presidents have held regular one-on-one lunches with no aides present. The ritual helps build trust and, because only two people are at the table, prevents leaks, veterans of past White Houses said. Trump ditched that tradition. Instead he has invited to the lunches both his and Pence\u2019s top aides. At the meals in the small dining room off the Oval Office, Trump keeps a big-screen TV tuned to cable news. Aides who have walked in have seen Trump yelling at the TV as he sits with Pence and their deputies over plates of chicken and cheeseburgers. When he sees something on the screen that he dislikes, Trump on occasion will interrupt the lunch and summon aides to discuss a response, people familiar with the lunches said. Here\u2019s a little more about the couple who were denied a cake by an Oregon bakery, and what happened after they filed a case. This week\u2019s New Yorker celebrates Pride Month. From the artist, Milan, Italy-based Olimpia Zagnoli: My job is to interpret what I see and translate it into images that evoke not only the subject but also the culture around it. Drawing two women kissing as colorful, strong, unapologetic, and free individuals is my way of contributing to a more honest representation of people, in the media. The US Supreme Court sent the case of an Oregon baker who refused to make cakes for gay people back to the lower court to be reconsidered. From the Association Press: The justices\u2019 action Monday keeps the high-profile case off the court\u2019s election-year calendar and orders state judges to take a new look at the dispute between the lesbian couple and the owners of a now-closed bakery in the Portland area. The high court\u2019s brief order directs appellate judges in Oregon to consider last term\u2019s Supreme Court ruling in favor of a baker from Colorado who would not make a cake for a same-sex wedding. The court ruled that baker Jack Phillips was subjected to anti-religious bias in the Colorado Civil Rights Commission\u2019s determination that he violated state anti-discrimination in refusing to bake the couple\u2019s wedding cake. The Oregon appellate ruling came before the court\u2019s decision in Phillips\u2019 case. The larger issue weighing the rights of LGBT people against the religious objections of merchants remains unresolved. Another dispute involving a florist from Washington state who would not create flower arrangements for a same-sex wedding is headed to the Supreme Court. The Oregon case had been in Supreme Court limbo for months, sometimes signaling behind-the-scenes negotiation over what to do. The case involves bakers Melissa and Aaron Klein, who paid a $135,000 judgment to the couple for declining to create a cake for them in 2013. The dispute began when Rachel Bowman-Cryer went to the bakery with her mother in January 2013. They met with Aaron Klein, who asked for the date of the ceremony and the names of the bride and groom. When told there was no groom, Klein said he was sorry but the bakery did not make cakes for same-sex weddings. According to documents from the case, Rachel and her mother left the shop, but returned a short time later. As Rachel remained in the car, in tears, her mother went in to speak with Klein. The mother told Klein she had once thought like him, but her \u201ctruth had changed\u201d when she had two gay children. Klein responded by quoting Leviticus: \u201cYou shall not lie with a male as one lies with a female; it is an abomination.\u201d The justices already have agreed to decide in their election-year session whether federal civil rights law protects people from job discrimination because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. Meanwhile in Orlando, Florida, supporters of President Trump have started lining up in hopes of getting into a rally announcing his re-election bid Tuesday at 8pm in the Amway Center. Supporters are lining up because a ticket does not necessarily guarantee entry to the rally. The Amway Center holds 20,000 people, but the president has already said far more ticket requests have been made. Trump has a history of lying about crowd sizes. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be a bunch of people, and it\u2019s going to be pretty intense,\u201d Gary Beck, a Trump supporter from Panama City, Florida, according to local news outlet Click Orlando. \u201cThe electricity is going to be high. It\u2019s time for America to get back on its feet and be made better than it\u2019s ever been before.\u201d \u201cNobody ever recovers.\u201d More on Mulvaney being ushered out of room for coughing, during Trump\u2019s interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos. The US Supreme Court\u2019s decision in racial gerrymandering in Virginia came with an interesting mix of justices in the majority. Trump-nominee Justice Neil Gorsuch joined the majority, lead by liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, to rule against Virginia Republicans. Another important case from the US Supreme Court, this one on racial gerrymandering in Virginia. The court ruled state Republicans did not have the standing to sue in the case. The decision leaves intact a lower court\u2019s ruling that 11 districts were drawn to diminish the clout of black voters \u2013 and are therefore invalid. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote he decision for the 5-4 majority. More from Reuters: The state\u2019s House of Delegates \u201clacks authority to displace Virginia\u2019s attorney general as representative of the state,\u201d Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the court\u2019s majority. \u201cIn short, Virginia would rather stop than fight on. One house of its bicameral legislature cannot alone continue the litigation against the will of its partners in the legislative process,\u201d Ginsburg added. The case involved a hot topic for the Supreme Court: a practice called gerrymandering involving the manipulation of electoral district boundaries to marginalize a certain set of voters and increase the influence of others. In this case, the Republican legislators were accused of racial gerrymandering to disadvantage black voters. In two other major cases from Maryland and North Carolina, the justices are considering whether courts can curb gerrymandering aimed at purely partisan advantage. They are due to rule in those cases by the end of this month. At issue in the Virginia case was the state legislative map drawn by Republicans after the 2010 national census. The new map is already being used. Since the Virginia maps that were challenged in the case were drawn, Democrats have made gains in Virginia in both state and federal elections. The White House National Security Council has just said Iran\u2019s plan to enrich more uranium is \u201cnuclear blackmail\u201d which must be met \u201cwith increasing international pressure,\u201d according to Reuters. Tensions are high between Iran and Washington DC after two oil tankers were damaged in the Gulf of Oman, in a critical shipping channel called the Strait of Hormuz. US Central Command released a video last week, which officials claimed to show men in an Iranian Revolutionary Guard Patrol Boat removing a magnetic limpet mine from the hull of one of the ships. Other leaders have contested whether the video alone is enough evidence of Iran\u2019s involvement. We\u2019ve also just got one of the first US Supreme Court rulings of the season, with implications for criminal cases involving Robert Mueller\u2019s probe on Russian meddling in the US election. The Associated Press reports a rule allowing state and federal governments to charge an individual for the same crime was upheld. The court\u2019s 7-2 decision Monday preserves a long-standing rule that provides an exception to the Constitution\u2019s ban on trying someone twice for the same offense. The court ruled against federal prison inmate Terance Gamble. He was prosecuted by Alabama and the federal government for having a gun after an earlier conviction for robbery. The case had been closely watched because a ruling for Gamble might have made it harder for states to pursue criminal charges against defendants in the Russia investigation in the event they are pardoned by President Donald Trump. New York authorities already have indicted Paul Manafort, Trump\u2019s former campaign chairman. A $15 federal minimum wage. Single-payer healthcare. Taxes on America\u2019s 75,000 wealthiest households. Restoring welfare funding. And cutting military spending. These are the proposals called for by the Poor People\u2019s Campaign\u2019s \u201cmoral budget\u201d. The report was released to coincide with the 10-candidate presidential forum tonight at 8pm ET. Here are the key findings, and the full report. We expect the Poor People\u2019s Campaign presidential forum to begin at 8pm ET tonight. Reverend William Barber, the charismatic co-leader from small town Greensboro, North Carolina, spoke to MSNBC on Sunday about what the forum represents. \u201cThis campaign is connected to tens and tens of thousands of people,\u201d Barber told AM Joy on MSNBC. When you look at the interlocking injustices of systemic racism, systemic poverty, ecological devastation, the war economy and the false moral narrative of religious nationalism \u2013 they are very real and impacting 140m people.\u201d ... \u201cWe are in a moral crisis and we cannot have another season of elections where we talk about the wealthy and the middle class and tax cuts and we do not talk specifically what are the agenda items for the poor.\u201d One of the most defining features of American campaigns is their expense. The 2016 presidential race between Hillary Clinton and President Trump cost an estimated $2.4bn, between spending from campaigns and outside advocacy groups. Hence, people are taking note of Pete Buttigieg\u2019s $7m April fundraising total. Of course, that tally is still far behind frontrunner and former Vice President Joe Biden, who raised $6.3m on the first day he announced his candidacy in April. One more note here \u2013 2016\u2019s campaign is also a vivid example that the wealthiest campaign does not always win. Clinton raised almost twice as much money as Trump, and although she received more popular votes, she still could not win the electoral college. Deputy Italian Prime Minister and far right leader Matteo Salvini meets with US Secretary of State and Vice President Mike Pence today. The Italian politician is in Washington DC to attend a wreath-laying ceremony at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery. Salvini has been seeking closer relations with the US since Trump\u2019s election. Salvini took no questions from reporters. Salvini will also meet with the powerful American special interest group Americans for Tax Reform, whose supremely well connected leader is Grover Norquist. In the early 2000s, Norquist successfully got dozens of Republican Congressmen to pledge not to raise taxes at all. Salvini is promoting a flat-tax in Italy. That clip we mentioned of Trump scolding Mick Mulvaney? Here it is. Wait for roughly the 20 second mark. Also, this is a friendly reminder of Mulvaney\u2019s time before he was chief of staff. In 2018, when Mulvaney led the watchdog Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, he tried to gut the agency by firing all 25 members of its advisory committee. Good morning and welcome to the politics liveblog. Today we\u2019re looking ahead to the Poor People\u2019s Campaign Forum, where 10 Democratic candidates will square off. The candidates will answer questions from activists Reverends William Barber and Liz Theoharis and low-income Americans. We\u2019re also keeping an eye on who might replace the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, whose leaving (characteristically) was announced via tweet last week. Finally, we\u2019re all watching a clip of President Trump scolding his chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
