I have jointly commissioned a review, with the SFO director, Robert Wardle, into the SFO's approach to the investigation and prosecution of cases it deals with. We are shortly to announce the review's terms of reference, but disbanding or merging the SFO are not options that have been, or are to be, looked at. In fact, the purpose of the review is to strengthen the Serious Fraud Office, not to disband it. The outcome of the review should provide a firm platform from which the SFO can move forward. We want to bear down on fraud. Those committing serious acts of fraud throw up smoke screens: our intention is to find ways of getting through those smoke screens more effectively and increase our ability to bring those concerned to justice.
