No crime to deal with. Migrants have stopped coming. Prisons empty. In-trays empty. That must be the case, because it seems as if Theresa May and co are having to actually create work for themselves. Last year, in a move questioned by many inside parliament and out, the home secretary decided the deed committed by the protester Trenton Oldfield, who disrupted the Oxford v Cambridge Boat Race in 2012, was so heinous that he really ought to be booted out of the country. This was despite the fact that the Australian activist served a prison sentence for his crime, had a British wife, a child on the way and a record of community contribution. Oldfield appealed, backed by MPs, campaigners, academics. Predictably he won, and just before Christmas we learned that his victory was a sizeable one. Judge Kevin Moore accused the Home Office of a gross overreaction, praised Oldfield's community activism, and suggested that May's officials may in fact have breached their own rules. Crucially, he had little truck with the idea that Oldfield's continuing presence would not be conducive to the public good \u2013 the argument forwarded by the home secretary. \"Even if I was so satisfied, on the evidence before me, such a public interest is outweighed by the appellant's commitment and enduring positive contribution to society, as well as his long residence in the UK for approximately 12 years,\" said the judge. That would be the end of that, it was assumed, and an older, wiser Oldfield would be left to return to community and family life. But the thumbs are a-twiddling at the Home Office. Now we learn the home secretary seeks leave to appeal against Judge Moore's decision. Will she succeed? Unlikely, but nothing is impossible. Only May can say why the outlandish pursuit of Oldfield is worth the bother. \u2022 A deal of tumbleweed blows down the corridors of Whitehall, it would seem. Lost for anything more significant to do, local government and communities secretary Eric Pickles focuses again on bin collections. Over the Christmas break, civil servants sent out the latest diktat telling councils to adopt his red book as their \"bin bible\". For the first time Whitehall is telling councils, in detail, how they should organise the collection of their wet and dry refuse, compost and recyclables. Do it weekly, says Eric. The experts at the Chartered Institution of Wastes Management say Pickles is ignoring the evidence and showing little respect for detailed local knowledge, risking a slide into \"dogma and confrontation\". The problem with genuine localism is that it would leave the minister for bin collections with precious little to do. \u2022 Just possible that he has shared with his cabinet colleague, the home secretary, the fun to be had spending public money on no-hope legal cases. She has the Trenton Oldfield farrago. He has had an expensive, ultimately futile battle with the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS). Pickles wanted to outlaw a longstanding practice that allowed for the collection of union subscriptions through salaries. A judge boxed his ears, ruling the move a breach of contract. He was stuck with his high court costs, and those incurred by the PCS. Thus he spent a sum estimated to have reached \u00a390,000 to challenge a practice that cost \u00a3300 to administer. Still, nothing ventured nothing gained, especially when others pick up the bill. \u2022 Another day, more salacious headlines of the \"love rat\" variety. Who'd be President Hollande? Many male leaders of the western world. Despite the embarrassing nature of it all, a poll finds 77% of French people agreeing that \"the president's private life is no one's business but his own\". We are divided by much more than the English Channel. \u2022 Talking of things English, a bold pitch from one of Westminster's most colourful characters, the Tory MP Michael Fabricant. With all this talk of devolution, we must have a regional parliament, he tells the Birmingham Mail. And where? In the Midlands \u2013 in Lichfield, his constituency. Full marks for trying, Michael.
