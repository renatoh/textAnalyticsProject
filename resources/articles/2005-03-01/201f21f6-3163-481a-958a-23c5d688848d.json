At the end of a one day international meeting in London on the Middle East peace process, the prime minister said the conference had helped to form agreements on key practical measures necessary for such a state. Flanked by the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, Mr Blair said the agreements were a \"significant\" step and covered governance, economic support and security in a new state. Mr Abbas told the representatives of 23 nations he was totally committed to reform and stopping Palestinian militancy. He said: \"We used to believe we were alone in the region. However, other countries are interested as well. We are confident the international community is interested in this cause.\" But there was some tension at the talks in reaction to a draft statement, seen by reporters, which called on the Palestinian Authority (PA) to take \"immediate action\" to arrest militants who organised Friday's suicide bombing in Tel Aviv, which killed five Israelis. That attack, the first of its kind since Mr Abbas took over as Palestinian leader, strained the formal truce declared between the two sides last month. The statement was drafted by the quartet of the EU, the US, the UN and Russia, which support the stalled 2003 road map peace plan, the Reuters and Associated Press news agencies reported. One unnamed Palestinian official at the talks told Reuters: \"We are very upset at the statement ... they [the quartet members] are putting security as the first approach as if they want the occupied Palestinians to give security to their Israeli occupiers.\" Earlier Mr Abbas had told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the Tel Aviv suicide bombing had \"negative, devastating, damaging effects\" on the peace process and he condemned it unequivocally. He insisted that the main Palestinian factions all sought peace. He said there was now a \"consensus from all factions accepting the principle of de-escalation, pacification and reciprocal ceasefire\". Speaking in the Commons, the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, said that \"there cannot be an expectation that there will be no terrorist outrages\" because there were groups that wanted to undermine the PA. Israel's response to the bombing has been restrained relative to other suicide attacks. Analysts believe the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, is committed to giving Mr Abbas a chance to advance the peace process. The draft communique from the talks sets out measures the PA will take to reform itself, including commitments from the UK and the US to play a leading role in reforming the Palestinian security apparatus. The World Bank will also play a \"crucial role\" in Palestinian economic development. In other developments, the US secretary of state, Condoleeza Rice, who also attended the talks, announced that the US general designated to monitor Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts will soon relocate to the region. The monitor, Lieutenant General William Ward, was also at the conference, as was Kofi Annan, the UN secretary general. Mr Blair had originally wanted a full-blown peace summit but the support of the US and Israel, which is not attending, were lacking. British officials characterised the talks as being aimed at helping the Palestinian Authority to prepare for peace negotiations with Israel. A small crowd of demonstrators had greeted the leaders as they arrived for the meeting at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre, holding banners accusing Mr Abbas of being a \"US puppet\". In his opening remarks at the talks, Mr Blair had said the peace process had progressed but that everyone would agree it was a \"fragile enterprise that can so easily be set back as it has been set back on other occasions\". Mr Blair praised the \"courage\" of Mr Sharon for his plan to disengage from Gaza. The Palestinian leader and Mr Sharon are expected to make separate visits to the White House later this year. Officials at the London talks said direct negotiations between the two had been provisionally scheduled for September in Washington. Mr Abbas said the PA was \"confident\" about assuming control of the Gaza Strip and maintaining security on Israel's planned withdrawal in July. Last month Mr Abbas and Mr Sharon agreed upon a formal verbal truce and ceasefire between the two sides at talks at Sharm el-Sheik, in Egypt, following four years of conflict, which have left more than 3,000 people dead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
