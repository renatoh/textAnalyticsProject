Some fans of the most outspoken sports broadcaster in the country wonder why he has not been trampolined from the niche corner of Radio Five Live on to our TV screens. (Indeed, so has he from time to time.) Others are not so sure. \"He really is the worst of the worst,\" blogs one irate critic, SheepdogNo1, \"which, given the competition from Clive Tyldesley and Jonathan Pearce, is no mean feat. \"The orangutans at Blackpool Zoo could give a more insightful commentary than this gonk.\" Whatever a gonk is \u2013 in my youth, it was catapult shaped from wire; some say it is a furry toy \u2013 it is clear Green has upset at least one sheep dog. Or could it be Sir Alex Ferguson in disguise? Their feud is such a central part of our football folklore that any game involving Green's commentary and Manchester United makes for compelling listening. As is fitting for a transparent controversialist, Green strikes the middle ground with the rarity of a hummingbird, and no way was he going to let Sunday's sub-standard FA Cup semi-final between United and Everton at Wembley escape his most diligent scrutiny. \"I don't know how he had the gall to say what he did two days ago and then put in this team-sheet,\" Green said of Sir Alex Ferguson's put-down of Rafa Ben\u00edtez as \"arrogant\", followed by his sending out a side that most clubs would die for but ranked as United's training squad. Green went on to wonder if Sir Alex was telling the whole story about Wayne Rooney's injury, which the commentator reckoned was worse than was thought. \"He hasn't got the best reputation in the world for being entirely honest.\" Now we were getting down to it. It is unlikely Ferguson has the time or inclination to go through the BBC's archive and pick up on the latest Greenism, but that little barb would pierce his prickly Caledonian skin. David Pleat, meanwhile, equivocated. \"It's an intriguing situation. Quite surprising. We are prejudging. Maybe they will give us a wonderful performance.\" So I settled down to see who would get it right: know-all or expert. Green got another dig in before kick-off: \"This ground is not good enough for a national stadium. It has been prostituted to bring the money in.\" Was there nothing on which this man would not opine? He was right, though. The football was not quite as awful as Green had hoped/expected, but was short of engaging. \"Oh, there's someone yawning in the crowd,\" he enthused. \"What a surprise. How long have we got to go in this?\" (It was midway through the first half.) What a pity, though, that Danny Welbeck was not brought down on Green's watch, even though Mike Ingham \u2013 Wise to Green's Morecambe \u2013 captured the moment nicely with his observation that \"Alex Ferguson has gone purple\". When Green returned for extra-time, he was like a bulldog who had been tied up while burglars ransacked the manor and he climbed into United with relish. It was almost as if he enjoyed what he described, in what was clearly sarcasm curdling into understatement, \"an undistinguished semi-final\". And the final score? Give it to Green. We need him. He is intemperate, which gets him into trouble, but he is, in the fine tradition of his province, someone you can't ignore. Quite apart from his ubiquity, there is his raging ego. It matters not the eminence of the former pro chosen to sit beside him at football up and down the country; Alan will make the definitive judgment. And how great is that? He's in the opinion business, after all, and he has plenty of them. Indeed, he probably has them in his sleep. In his waking hours they flow through that abrasive sieve that is his challenging Ulster delivery. No other accent invites an argument with such lack of ambiguity. It is his gift. Tyson's tale could run and run, but with no happy end Be prepared for voyeurism on a grand scale when the much-discussed documentary film, Tyson, goes on general release this Friday. The reviews are in, and they effuse. Tyson did his part when he got on the interview carousel a month ago, charming his questioners in that way familiar to anyone who has given a street hustler a fiver to visit his sick wife in hospital. And, all the while, his minders hovered around the writers, keeping Mike on subject, guarding against too-tough questions \u2013 as if there were many dark corners left to illuminate. The immediate reaction, from this corner, was here we go again, as Iron Mike, victim and puppet, sucks the last cent from his story, directed off-stage by another set of friends. His current new best friend is James Toback, a 66-year-old maverick New York film-maker, a dried-out drinker and rehabbed cocaine addict who grew up in a hotel overlooking Central Park with Jewish intellectual parents and some of America's finest mobsters. Toback told the Wall Street Journal he wanted to maintain the project's integrity by not giving Tyson a direct fee, so he made him an executive producer. You can see Tyson going for this; he is, after all, a man who never knew exactly how many millions he was earning or spending. But he knows now how much he has left: zero. \"Unless the movie is a success, Mike and I will not get anything,\" says Toback. A name-dropper of floor-denting talent, Toback went to private school and university and talks in the mannered way of a clever man living out his life for the cameras. His friendship with Tyson will look to some like Woody Allen hanging out with Godzilla. But to make that judgment would be to misunderstand the American obsession with money, fame and machismo, because these are the gods Tyson and Toback have worshipped with enthusiasm. While Tyson was establishing himself as the most reviled celebrity on earth, Toback was making films about rap, race and violence. It was inevitable there would be common sparks, and they have stayed in contact since they met in 1985. When we spoke in London recently, Toback said of Tyson: \"He calls me sometimes at three or four in the morning, just to talk, for hours.\" Given Tyson's propensity for adventure \u2013 he has contemplated career changes as diverse as male hooker and porn star \u2013 there is plenty of material for a sequel. That's the sad bit of this movie: it doesn't end. Our top sporting heroes, or simply dumb and dumber? Lewis Hamilton (who plainly shares a hairdresser and skin therapist with Theo Walcott) has gone with alarming speed from shiny young knight of the road to grumpy Sunday driver. His media performance at the Chinese grand prix was dumb. The kid with everything wanted nothing to do with reporters who whisper that he played a part in the sacking of McLaren's race director, Dave Ryan. Walcott? He just gets better, although his soundbites remain as unutterably dull as Hamilton's. Arsenal have a \"very big game\", as the flying youth calls it, against Liverpool tonight. Back him to score again, in a draw."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
