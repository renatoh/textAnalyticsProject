And barely six minutes after the 7,899 had settled into their places, Lawrie Dudfield launched a speculative cross that drifted over the former Spurs goalkeeper and found its way in off the back post. \"I can't believe it went in,\" said Mansfield's manager Billy Dearden. \"You don't give a team like Chesterfield a goal start that early.\" Second-placed Brighton lost 3-1 at Cheltenham, for whom the veteran Bob Bloomer and Grant McCann, on loan from West Ham, scored their first ever league goals. They took the points, moreover, despite being down to 10 men for 70 minutes after Lee Howells was dismissed for a second bookable offence barely two minutes after his first. Cardiff remain in third place after beating Scunthorpe 3-0 thanks to two goals from Daniel Gabbidon and another from Josh Low, who scored with his first touch. Hartlepool are two points behind after making it 12 games without defeat, Mark Tinkler getting the goal at managerless Macclesfield. In the Second Division Wigan and Walsall could only manage draws and remain in second and third place respectively, the Latics being held 0-0 at home to fourth-bottom Bristol Rovers while Ray Graydon's team came back from two down at Bournemouth, for whom Jermain Defoe scored his 14th of the season. Oxford, who had Chris Hackett sent off after 20 minutes for violent conduct, stay rooted to the bottom on 14 points after a 3-1 defeat at Bury, their fourth successive loss. Jocky Scott's Notts County overcame Northampton, rivals for a play-off place, at Meadow Lane, where Mark Stallard scored his 19th of the season and Nick Fenton clinched the victory with a volley. In the First Division Huddersfield were beaten at home by Gillingham, their first defeat in 11, and that despite taking the lead through Craig Armstrong. Two goals from Mark Saunders put the Gills in front and though Martin Smith brought Town level from the spot, Marlon King secured the points. Grimsby moved away from the danger area, a goal from China's captain Zhang Enhua doing for Burnley. Crystal Palace and Norwich finished with a point and 10 men apiece after Jamie Pollock and Darel Russell were sent off for violent conduct. Mikael Forssell scored for Palace and Craig Harrison deflected a Russell shot past his own keeper for the visitors. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
