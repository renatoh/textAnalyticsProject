She appeared at a special performance of The Vagina Monologues the other week (I know, how dreadful, but that's not why we should feel sorry for the little lamb), and told her rapt audience that her beauty has been 'a curse', because society is so obsessed with looking good. Rossellini was cursed with being the luminous face of Lanc\u00f4me for 14 years, earning millions of pounds in the process. Then, at 40, she was sacked. Ever since, she has done nothing but moan about her dismissal - how dare they drop me because I've got a few wrinkles! - which sounds a lot less like a feminist's roar and far more like the bitching of a beauty being overtaken by a younger model. Oh, and she's busied herself with launching her own cosmetic range, Manifesto. There's a scent and there was make-up; but the latter has just been discontinued. Not because Isabella has suddenly seen the anti-beauty light, but because you could only get it in Harvey Nichols and the Knightsbridge gels weren't buying. Don't you love the name, though? Manifesto. Clearly, by wearing Isabella's perfume, you make a hardcore statement about your life. But, no matter how much Isabella may puff and protest, it's still just a scent, and so that statement can never be more than: I think this makes me smell better. Same with cosmetics, or even cosmetic surgery. Whether you go for Lanc\u00f4me or liposuction, Bourgois or botox, all this ever says about you is: I think this makes me look better. Real beauty, of course, is far from dull. It's dazzling, amazing, wonderful, life-affirming. But 'beauty' - meaning cosmetics, slimming, tweaking, preening - is boring. It's all just: I think this makes me look better. And as almost every woman over 16 is saying the same thing, you'd think we'd be sick of repeating ourselves. But no. Every woman's mag is filled with the same statement, every newspaper has a section repeating it over and over, every female celebrity is asked about her beauty 'regime', like it's a lot of effort. For some people - actors, models, those whose very living is earned by looking good - perhaps it is. But for most of us, it really isn't. It's five minutes more faffing than your boyfriend. That's it. So far, so familiar. Women's mags have always rattled on about appearance. But recently, beauty has been promoted from in-hairdresser's reading to genuine topic of conversation. How to look good has turned from that which should not be discussed into an all-encompassing cultural esperanto. Lull in conversation? Have you tried talking St Tropez? (That's the fake tan, not the place.) Still stuck? Try the to-lift-or-not-to-lift gambit. Or the collagen-versus-silicone debate. Or compare yoga routines in terms of spare-tyre reduction. Or - this is a neat twist - discuss the way other people look. In Germany, the hot topic is whether Chancellor Schroder dyes his hair. Here, it's either Peter Sissons's tie, or Gwyneth Paltrow's breasts. (Kylie's bum is, like, last month.) I don't want to be left out. So I, too, would like to comment on Miss Paltrow's pillows. And I would like to say: what's wrong with them? If she'd gone the way of most Hollywood flesh, meaning if she'd had them boosted, or lifted, then the world would have wowed. There might have been a few remarks about getting them out at the Oscars, but that would have been it. If her knockers had been knock-out, she'd have been seen as a success. After all, the difference between her dress and Halle Berry's was only a spot of embroidery. But Halle's baps are bouncy, so she passed the test. Gwyneth's cardinal sin was to get 'em out when she hasn't got 'em done. Do you think Gwynnie was making a statement? Perhaps, within body-perfect Hollywood, saying you don't have plastic surgery is as controversial as it gets. But is it as controversial as we get? Haven't we anything better - films, politics, friends, even football - to talk about, to say? Is beauty our manifesto? Is that it? Poor, beautiful Isabella Rossellini reckons she's contentious. She crows, 'I have been asked by Lanc\u00f4me never to talk about these things. But here I am standing up and talking about it.' Clearly, she thinks she's telling secrets. But who doesn't know that cosmetics companies promise the secret of eternal youth? And who doesn't know they're lying? Only Isabella. For 14 years, Ms Rossellini said, silently: I think this makes me look better. And now she's saying, you know what - I was wrong. Some ruddy manifesto that is. Personally, I preferred her before she got chatty. \u00b7 Barbara Ellen returns next week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
