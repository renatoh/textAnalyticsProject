Middlesex were 215 for nine off 41.5 overs when the rains came and play was suspended for two hours. Leicestershire were then set a Duckworth/Lewis-adjusted target of 135 from 20 overs but were bowled out for 117. The Twenty20 Cup winners appeared to have the chase under control at 63 for two, with Brad Hodge continuing where he left off in Saturday's final at Edgbaston, but Melvyn Betts persuaded the Australian, on 24, to smash a long hop straight to point. Then Agarkar captured Darren Stevens, John Sadler and Jeremy Snape to finish with three for 22 from four overs, and Paul Weekes bowled Ottis Gibson with the first ball of the 16th over, whereupon the tail collapsed in a flurry of strokes to Ben Hutton, two for 17, and Glenn McGrath, one for 10. Claude Henderson had finished with four for 45 from nine overs to put the brakes on the Middlesex innings just when they looked like posting a much higher total. Crucially, in his second spell he lured Ed Joyce down the pitch and had him stumped just as the left-hander, with 31 from 41 balls, was starting to look really dangerous. Jamie Dalrymple top-scored for Middlesex with 40, made from 44 balls with three fours, and put on 52 for the fifth wicket with Joyce. Weekes (38) and Hutton (30) made the most of some wayward bowling to put on 58 before Hutton had his middle stump knocked out by Darren Maddy, who gave Leicestershire a modicum of control after others had served up a spate of wides. They conceded 31 in the innings, the worst culprit being Charlie Dagnall, who sent down 11, including eight in a three-over spell. In Chelmsford Essex made 107 without loss against Lancashire before the rain came and at the Rose Bowl, where Hampshire were to face Surrey, no play was possible and it was abandoned as a draw."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
