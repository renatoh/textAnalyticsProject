In his first interview since the beer company went into administration and was then swiftly bought back by him, his associates and his new partner, Molson Coors, the peer said he would personally apologise to unsecured creditors. He said the deal was entered into so that he could raise money to pay them back. The collapse in May had affected his lifestyle, he said. \"I am now earning a fraction of what I was earning before. I had a car and a driver but I no longer have that. Now I drive a 13-year-old Mercedes Coupe that has done over 100,000 miles.\" His words have so far failed to soothe anger felt by some former suppliers who have seen Bilimoria and his fellow investors retain a 49.9% stake in the new business. He will be paid undisclosed consultancy fees and retains the chairmanship. Bilimoria said he was pleased the brand had survived and that he would now settle his debts. \"First and foremost the brand and its future is secure. I genuinely feel absolutely gutted about what has happened. But would my creditors have rather that I'd gone bust completely? Then they would have got nothing, everyone would have been wiped out. \"I've been on the other side of the fence, either paying credit insurance or having somebody not pay me and sometimes expecting me to supply them the next day as well. The 'pre-pack' was the least worst alternative.\" \"Pre-pack\" deals are legal but they between struggling managements and administrators allow companies to dip in and out of administration. They have been criticised for enabling directors to jettison debts and loss-making parts of a business at the expense of creditors. In May, MPs on the business and enterprise select committee said the arrangements were damaging public confidence in the insolvency regime. As chancellor, Gordon Brown appointed Bilimoria, the son of an Indian army general, as \"national champion\" for entrepreneurship. He is president of the UK-India Council, a government-funded trade body. Bilimoria, 47, said he took on an \u00a318m personal loan to bankroll Cobra's expansion last year. \"I don't know anybody else who would put their neck on the line to the tune of \u00a318m. The risk I put in personally is disproportionate to anyone else, and I still have that noose round my neck.\" \"When I've worked out a structure I will be contacting every creditor and apologising and saying I'm really sorry that we're in the position that we're in. \"I want to make sure that my creditors have been settled. They will be paid off over time, but it may not be the full amount. It will be whatever each person is happy with and is settled with.\" Chris Hall, managing director of Pop Displays, which was owed \u00a331,000 when Cobra went into administration, said he had not yet been contacted by Bilimoria. \"I can't see how the whole pre-pack deal benefits anyone apart from him and Molson Coors. Having taken on his debt, it has personally impacted on me and my 100 employees. I've had to take a pay cut, and many of my employees have had to take pay freezes. I have no sympathy whatsoever for him having to give up his driver.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
