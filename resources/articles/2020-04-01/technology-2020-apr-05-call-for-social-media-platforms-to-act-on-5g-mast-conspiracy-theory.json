Broadband engineers have also faced physical and verbal threats by people who believe that radiation from 5G masts causes health risks and lowers people\u2019s immune systems. The mayor of Liverpool, Joe Anderson, revealed he had received threats after he dismissed the theory as \u201cbizarre\u201d. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove branded the conspiracy theories \u201cdangerous nonsense\u201d. And the NHS director, Stephen Powis, added: \u201cThe 5G story is complete and utter rubbish. It is nonsense \u2013 the worst kind of fake news. \u201cThe reality is that the mobile phone networks are absolutely critical to all of us, particularly in a time when we are asking people to stay at home and not see relatives and friends. \u201cBut, in particular, those are also the phone networks used by our emergency services and our health workers and I am absolutely outraged, absolutely disgusted, that people would be taking action against the very infrastructure that we need to respond to this health emergency. \u201cIt is absolute, utter rubbish and I can\u2019t condemn it in terms stronger than that.\u201d Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, is to hold talks with platforms such as Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and Twitter \u201cto hammer this message home\u201d, the source said. Celebrities including the singer Anne-Marie, have helped spread the theory on social media. Amanda Holden, a judge on Britain\u2019s Got Talent, shared a link to an online petition claiming the symptoms of Covid-19 were caused by residing near a 5G mast. The petition has now been removed. Emergency services were called out to deal with blazes at masts in Sparkhill, Birmingham, and on the Antrim Road in north Belfast last Thursday, and at Melling, Merseyside, last Friday. Videos of the arson attacks were posted on social media."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
