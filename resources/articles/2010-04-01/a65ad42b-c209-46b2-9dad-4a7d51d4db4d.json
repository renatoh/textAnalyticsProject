The Villa manager believes that the crushing loss against Chelsea in the Premier League last month, which he described as a \"major blip\" in their season, will be far from his players' minds once the match gets under way. He claimed confidence had returned in the wake of the win at Bolton Wanderers last Saturday and pointed to the 2-1 league victory over Carlo Ancelotti's side at home in October as evidence that Villa are capable of knocking Chelsea out and causing an upset. \"It's because the [Chelsea] game was only played a couple of weeks ago that it continues to be a debating point,\" said O'Neill. \"[But] if you look at our record overall this season, defensively we've been pretty sound. It was obviously a major blip [at Stamford Bridge] and we're just going to have to try and rectify it against a fine side who are capable of scoring some goals. I genuinely believe we can win the game. It's not bravado.\" The Villa manager hopes Richard Dunne will be able to recover from a slight problem with his achilles to take his place at the centre of a defence which will be eager to make amends for the performance at Stamford Bridge. \"It was a heavy defeat at Chelsea but we're still very confident we can win the game,\" said O'Neill. \"We beat them earlier in the season. I know that's a fairly lengthy time ago but we're capable of doing it.\" Villa lost the 2000 final, the last at the old Wembley, to Chelsea and have not won the FA Cup since 1957, and O'Neill believes that ending that barren run this season would play a significant part in the club's development and also give everyone a psychological lift. \"A trophy establishes something first of all,\" O'Neill said. \"From our viewpoint it would have been great to have won against Manchester United [in the Carling Cup final]. You have something tangible to show. \"It's not just getting to the final, it's the winning of it. The effect it has on a football club, I've seen it in the past, as manager and player. The lift it gives players who can consider themselves winners of a competition. The lift it gives the club for future big matches is so important.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
