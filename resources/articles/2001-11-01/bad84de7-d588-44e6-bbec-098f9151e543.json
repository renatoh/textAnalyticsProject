After seven months and nine abject attempts, Stockport County won a league match at home. That this momentous feat coincided with Carlton Palmer's first home game in charge was no coincidence, with the player-manager scoring the decisive second and providing a calm head in a frantic finale. A win would have taken Norwich top but, despite Phil Mulryne's late consolation, defeat against the 10 men here left them jammed in the bottleneck at the top of the division. Palmer had spent his first week in charge wheeling and dealing to lift a down-beat squad that had gained only one point at home all season, scoring only five times in eight games along the way. His task might have been easier had he lured Mark Hughes from Blackburn but the Wales manager preferred the idea of prolonging a bit-part career in the Premiership to a possible starring role in the First Division. A smaller fish arrived in the shape of Aaron Lescott, from Sheffield Wednesday, and the 22-year-old cut a busy figure in midfield while his manager dropped into central defence to counter Iwan Roberts. Palmer was given a rapturous reception and was clearly fired up; Roberts ended the first half with his head wrapped in a bandage. Norwich have maintained their startling progress this season despite a vulnerability outside Norfolk. Roberts did force Lee Jones to save a well struck volley but their soft away-day underbelly was soon exposed again. Ali Gibb, legs a blur, tore down County's right flank and crossed for Glynn Hurst, unmarked in the area, to head down and beyond Green. That was his fourth goal of the season but the first scored by a Stockport player in more than five hours of football, stretching back almost a month. Norwich were rattled but also spurred into riposte and Roberts's low drive fizzed through a crowded area before being touched on to a post by the sprawling Jones. Parity would have been harsh on the home side but they were soon relying more heavily on their goalkeeper to preserve the lead. Despite Scott Taylor rattling the bar with an outrageous volley Jones had to spring to his left to turn Chris Llewellyn's 20-yard volley behind. Seconds later, with Paul McVeigh unmarked in the six-yard box, he somehow claimed his point-blank attempt. Norwich were soon ruing those misses. Peter Clark's looping free-kick to the far post caught Gary Holt in a dither and Palmer calmly placed his shot beyond Green. That sparked a frenzy of Canary attacks, with Gibb stretching to clear Mark Rivers' lob off the line. That proved Gibb's last contribution as a late challenge on Daryl Sutch prompted a second caution within a minute and an early dismissal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
