The BBC's share of listening would plummet overnight from a market-leading 55.4% to just 30.3% and commercial radio would soar to 67.7% (Source: Rajar Q1 2006). With the BBC marginalised, commercial radio, with three FM and two AM national networks plus almost 300 local stations, would be the dominant force in UK radio. So what's to stop the plans - in a European Media Forum (EMF) - report being enacted? For a start the BBC, whose future has been outlined in the white paper. The government has published a draft charter and agreement in which Radios 1 and 2 are listed alongside other BBC services, and privatisation would probably require primary legislation. More surprisingly the commercial radio stations' trade association, the CRCA, has kicked the sale into the long grass. Their official line is that they want the stations to conform to the draft charter, which is another way of saying they should be less competitive with commercial radio. The EMF report makes its case for selling the networks off on the grounds that Radios 1 and 2 are \"largely or entirely similar to those (stations) produced by the private sector\" and that their sale would shave off around \u00a341m from BBC Radio's budget. It also blames the BBC for the \"stunted growth in Britain's radio sector\" saying it has \"badly bruised its private sector rivals\", partially because of \"its unfettered freedom to promote its radio services\" on television and its other media platforms. The report argues that because the stations attract big audiences (Radio 1 has 10 million and Radio 2 13 million listeners) both should prosper in the commercial sector. The CRCA reckons that, if funded by advertising, Radio 1 would generate \u00a366.9m and Radio 2 \u00a373.7m in revenue at today's prices. That would make both very profitable on their current BBC budgets, delivering \"bottom line\" earnings of \u00a328m and \u00a332m respectively, way in excess of the UK's largest commercial station, Classic FM. However, to support both networks and the rest of commercial radio would require advertising to grow overnight by \u00a3140.6m, an increase of around 27%, yet the amount spent on commercial stations in 2005 fell by 5%. Advertising is a conservative business and the growth in budgets to sustain all the stations isn't going to happen overnight, so the likely impact of privatising Radios 1 and 2 would be to destroy the advertising revenue of existing commercial radio stations and drive half or more into the red. It's for this unspoken reason that CRCA is not in favour of the sell-off and is campaigning merely for the networks to boost their public service credentials. The problem is that no one can agree on a definition of public service. It's not as simple as confining the BBC to services that are not provided by the market. Such a policy would ultimately cause the BBC to atrophy. One such definition is the provision of news, weather, travel, what's on information and social action, but the BBC would argue for going further to include the promotion of education and learning, sustaining citizenship and stimulating creativity and cultural excellence. This definition moves the debate on about whether Radios 1 and 2 are distinctive (compared to music-based stations provided by the market), from just being about specific speech content. One of the most frequent criticisms of commercial radio is the narrow range of music and high rotation of songs. With the exception of Saga and a handful of others, monitoring of musical output shows that Radio 1 plays around 1,000 and Radio 2 1,700 unique song titles a week, about double many commercial stations (Source: Intelligent Media). Only Radio 1 and 2 consistently broadcast live music of range, and in quantity, including during daytime peak. Xfm supports new bands, but concentrates these tracks between 11pm and 2am. The CRCA asserts that much of the speech on Radios 1 and 2 makes no contribution to its public purposes and that a large proportion of Radio 2's news and current affairs is dispensed in one weekday programme, the Jeremy Vine show. In defence, the BBC points out that both networks carry large volumes of intelligent speech, accounting for 45% on Radio 1 and 30% of hours on Radio 2 during peak, higher than the off-peak figure. Commercial radio must be kicking itself that BBC charter review has coincided with an advertising recession. In times of plenty, they would have swallowed Radios 1 and 2 in a heartbeat. \u00b7 Paul Robinson is a media consultant"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
