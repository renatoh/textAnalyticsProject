If you fancy keeping in touch, you can find me here and Scott here. See you next time! Mango-ver and out x Yes, thank you to all of you people reading and commenting on this liveblog. Michael and I have been overwhelmed with the nice comments, feedback, jokes and observations (and mango related puns). It has been a pleasure and we hope to see you all very soon. Thank you everyone for following along with our riotous rambles over the past 10 weeks. It\u2019s been a joy sharing those sweet sweet mango highs and those white chocolate lows with you all. Where else could I publicly flirt with Northern Irish contestants and complain about limited challenge instructions? Well, Twitter I suppose. But it just wouldn\u2019t have been the same. Well, I\u2019m blubbing away like a baby. What a lovely little montage, and a thoughtful tribute to Luis, a finalist from the 2014 season who passed away a few weeks ago. This has been a tough year, but all through this crisis I\u2019ve felt that TV can be a thing to keep us going, offering a lift and a distraction from all of this endless monotony. Bake Off has been one of those shows. Despite all of the baking ups and downs these past 10 weeks and the obligatory criticisms, how amazing is it that there was even a Bake Off to begin with?! A thank you must go to the production crew, the hotel staff, the catering and security, the people at Channel 4 as well as the bakers \u2026 all of whom left their homes and loved ones, just so Bake Off could air as normal this year. It must have taken an extraordinary amount of effort, especially when it would have been so easy to cancel the show this year. JEEPERS CREEPERS! He actually did it! In the tensest Bake Off final the show has ever had, Peter just managed to beat Dave with his impressive Bake Off Bubble Showstopper. And what a deserved win it was too. His bakes were impressive, but the thing that shone through most was Peter himself. From tweaking recipes so that his gluten-intolerant brother could enjoy his bakes, to injecting as many Scottish ingredients into his creations as was humanly possible, what became obvious was that Peter always baked with other people in mind. If you wanted an example of how great Peter is, just look at him in the final \u2013 applauding each baker and smiling whenever they got a compliment from the judges. He also gently brought Paul down a peg or two by reminding us that Bake Off has been on for half of his life. Congratulations Peter! The youngest winner we\u2019ve ever seen, and the first from bonnie Scotland (don\u2019t know if you noticed what his heritage was, he didn\u2019t mention it a hundred times). What a sterling effort he\u2019s put in over the weeks \u2013 maintaining a cool demeanour while showing a fabulous flair for flavours. Plus, they didn\u2019t really focus on it but each week at least one if not both of his bakes were gluten-free, which is particularly impressive. I know it\u2019s between Peter and Dave, but I am really proud of Laura for sticking at it, especially when the going got tough. Laughing at Peter not being able to say anything when he\u2019s asked how that went. Between the boys, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess who\u2019s clinched it\u2026 God, this is tense. I think Peter might have just pipped it, but honestly, no idea... Dave\u2019s cake is \u201cdelicious\u201d and \u201cbeautifully light\u201d according to Paul, but his babkas are \u201ctoo tough.\u201d His choux buns are too flat, too. They also have too much of a wet filling (side-eye to camera). Two of his bakes receive glowing reviews \u2013 the other two do not. A bold move from Dave to re-do all of the bakes that he\u2019s struggled with over the course of the series. Looks like it\u2019s paid off, mostly. According to the judges Peter\u2019s bake was a \u201clittle dry,\u201d but the blackberry is \u201cdelicious\u201d and the choux is \u201cnicely baked.\u201d However, his friands (I had to Google these \u2013 no idea) are disappointing and \u201cstodgy.\u201d A \u201cgood effort,\u201d so Dave could clinch it if his bake tastes better. But his one is a risky one. If you\u2019re wondering whether anyone has dropped their bake while transporting it from their table to the judges, it happened once on the Belgian version. As always, Laura\u2019s actual *bake* is really great in terms of textures and flavours. I hope she can see that she\u2019s done herself proud. Laura\u2019s looks like all the bakes stacked together, but visually it looks a bit random ... not gonna lie. Couldn\u2019t agree more. Leave Mr Spoon in 2020. They\u2019re all hugging. Isn\u2019t it funny how in any other year seeing people hug would be normal, but here it means so much more. Never forget Karen who brought crisps. AND YES PETER!!! Managing to move his tower carefully onto his stand in the final moments. That was a tense one. Dave is on a real snack attack isn\u2019t he? Strong Karen-from-2018 vibes. Dave continued his tradition of finishing early. He\u2019s also asking Laura and Peter whether they need any help completing their own. Even in the final. I love this show. The look of abject fear on Silly Billy Peter\u2019s face as he stacks his tower has REALLY made me laugh and I\u2019m not sure why. Dave feels unshakeable. I\u2019m really rooting for Laura to do herself proud. Guests are arriving. Unlike previous years where the picnic consisted of all the previous bakers getting in on the gin, the only guests who are able to make it are the production team and hotel staff ... who are most likely getting in on the gin. I know we saw pictures of these bakes earlier on, but I can\u2019t picture what any of these towers are going to look like. I feel that we have seen nothing but Peter freaking out about battenburg biscuits instead of any other part of his bake for the past ten minutes, which is concerning. SILLY BILLY KLAXON! OKEY COKEY KLAXON! JEEPERS CREEPERS KLAXON! \u201cWhen it grows, it stretches out\u201d. Dave is talking about his craquelin. Why, what did you think he was talking about? \u201cAllowing myself to get a little bit stressed out\u201d. Same, Peter. These dramatic drums are SOMETHING ELSE. Pete seems to be in his element. Oh wait, no he isn\u2019t!! Omg Peter just necked a tea as a salute to Rowan. Matt asks Dave: \u201cAre you going to have a holiday after this is all over?\u201d *stares longingly out of the window* Quite. I\u2019m not sure his definition of \u2018insanity\u2019 is correct, either. Sounds like one of those facts your dad tells you because he read it on a crisp packet. No Christmas tree on Peter\u2019s Instagram, but look what I found in his bio. Dave is baking all of the bakes that haven\u2019t worked for him. That\u2019s \u2026 a risk, isn\u2019t it? It doesn\u2019t bother me. I\u2019ve been listening to Christmas songs since July, and my tree went up this weekend. P.S. If you haven\u2019t already, listen to Jingle Bells by Barbra Streisand. It\u2019s deliciously chaotic. Peter is going to bake a giant Christmas tree as his Showstopper because OF COURSE he is. BRB checking his Instagram to see whether he has put his tree up yet. So the final Showstopper appears to be \u2026 all the other Showstopper challenges? Sure, OK. Top it off with a cake bust \u2013 I DARE you. So basically, a pile of baked stuff. If they include rainbow bagels I will weep harder than Peter\u2019s meringue did. \u201cCan Laura win?\u201d asks Matt. *MASSIVE THUNDERCLAP OUTSIDE* I see your Rubiks Cube and I raise you Elmer the Elephant This virtual Rita Ora Godzilla advert weirds me out every time I see it. I think it\u2019s safe to say that Laura won\u2019t be a winner, but look at where we are now \u2026 the top two seem to have flipped. Now I reckon Dave is leading, with Peter just behind. Here is where we are after the technical. Third: Laura (\u201cit just wasn\u2019t quite ready\u201d), second: Peter (\u201cdidn\u2019t manage to get definition in the swirl\u201d) and first is Dave (\u201cthey were absolutely delicious.\u201d) \u201cLovely crack\u201d. Thank you Prue. This technical feels like the tightest it\u2019s ever been \u2013 they\u2019re all nearly there, just a couple of criticisms between them. It\u2019s also made me very hungry.. Despite being disappointed at his own attempt, Peter is congratulating the others: \u201cThey look insane you guys, well done.\u201d What a man. \ud83d\udc96 Laura\u2019s using \u201ca quick seeding method\u201d. No comment. \u201cThe marshmallows should be covered in a coat of crisp chocolate,\u201d says Matt in the voiceover, \u201cwhich can only be achieved with precise heating and cooling.\u201d *cue Dave whacking his chocolate in the microwave* Peter\u2019s meringue, like all of us in 2020, is weeping. Peter is looking at the instructions: \u201cAssemble. Must have taken her a long time to write that up.\u201d Such dry sass from Peter. I love him. Well, Dave piping little ganache turds will be an image that will stay with me forever. Ohh no Laura! The whisks on the KitchenAids (shock! a branded item!) don\u2019t touch the bottom of the bowls, meaning that small quantities of egg white can\u2019t be whipped up \u2013 hopefully Laura thinks to whip it by hand... Last week Mr Spoon said that he wanted to see Peter naked (no, really). This week Mr Spoon said that every winner has kissed him. Anyone got the number for HR? She has to make a coffee-infused ganache: \u201cI genuinely don\u2019t know how to make coffee,\u201d she says. \u201cHot water?\u201d I know there are other things going on here, but look at the grass outside?! PARCHED. Elsewhere, we have a spin-off emerging: Laura v coffee beans. It\u2019s 35 degrees in the tent. Not that that has put off Peter, whose \u201ctoasty walnuts smell toasty and walnuty.\u201d I now want him to win. Prue wants \u201cwhirly whirlies\u201d. One hopes she is not referring to the Collins dictionary definition of \u201cwhirlies\u201d. Oh, I Googled it. It\u2019s an abbreviation of \u201ctechnique\u201d. This is like when my friend described something as \u201cpeak\u201d which, to my surprise, does not refer to the pinnacle of brilliance but rather something that\u2019s a bit crap. Peter also hopes he has \u201cthe tekkers required\u201d. What does that even mean? Can anyone from 1901 help me? Except they\u2019re calling it a Walnut Whirl, which is entirely separate and distinct from the branded treat. Laura has had \u201ca bad morning\u201d according to Prue, even though her bake tastes delicious. Even though there\u2019s never an *official* ranking after the Signature, from Paul and Prue\u2019s judgements I think it\u2019s fair to say the standings are Peter, then Dave, then Laura. I reckon the issue is more that they couldn\u2019t make any tweaks in between episodes \u2013 plus the gruelling schedule. They\u2019ve baked every single day for six and a half weeks by this point. On camera. In isolation. During a pandemic. Do you think the fact that all of the bakers have practiced less, because of everything, means that there\u2019s more chance of things going wrong? I\u2019d like to put Peter and Dave\u2019s bakes into my stomach immediately. Preferably via the mouth, but I\u2019m not fussy. Noel is now comforting Laura: \u201cYou know Bj\u00f6rn Borg the tennis player? The reason he was such a good champion is that he could forget anything, so the next point was all he would think about.\u201d Who would have expected this part of 2020 to consist of Noel dishing out motivational advice from a Swedish Grand Slam tennis favourite? RELEASE THE CRANACHAN! Has Laura been in the freezer for the whole advert break? She\u2019ll be freezing. Laura responds on twitter: DISASTER! Laura\u2019s custard has not set, falling apart the moment it came out of the tray. And now she\u2019s literally crying in the freezer. Damn these tense violins! Given that we already know Laura cries into her freezer, I\u2019ve got the fear this isn\u2019t going to go well... OKEY KOKEY KLAXON Noel has his head in a cake cloche. I can hear the Ofcom complaints rolling in already, like when he was in the fridge. I like how Mr Spoon has come back for the third week in a row. I think we\u2019re near a full house and it\u2019s not even the first ad-break yet... Oh look, it\u2019s Okey Dokey Peter\u2019s Gluten Free brother! And his mum, who really pronounces the \u201co\u201d in oven. Lovely that Peter is doing a Scottish-themed Signature. All we need is for him to do an Extremely Christmas-in-July Showstopper. I don\u2019t want to talk about it. I DO want to talk about the 400ml of lemon/yuzu juice that Laura\u2019s adding to her custard \u2026 that\u2019s a lot of acid to add to something containing gelatin \u2026 gulp. It also sadly means that we won\u2019t get favourites like Rowan and Lottie getting smashed on gin at two in the afternoon. How drunk did you get last year at the final Michael? For 2020 reasons, none of the previous bakers, or the finalists\u2019 family and friends are able to make it to the final. We also haven\u2019t got the awkward backstory films this year \u2013 instead, awkward video messages! Dave: \u201cYou don\u2019t want to add too much gelatin\u201d Laura: *unfurls a wad of gelatin thicker than my arm* Freezers: tick! Gelatine slices: tick! Who else is holding out for a mention of that sweet, sweet mango? \u201cThe resistance is in the custard\u201d. Paul\u2019s pitching the Star Wars sequel nobody asked for. They have two and a half hours. Paul warns that the custard must be \u201cSET.\u201d He says that the uses of the fridges will be \u201cCRITICAL.\u201d It\u2019s all very dramatic. Rinky Dink Peter is the Bake Off\u2019s youngest ever finalist. He is the same age as the Millennium Dome, the Playstation 2 and the Jim Carrey Grinch film. Going into the final, here\u2019s where we stand. It is the closest Bake Off has been in years. Everyone has won Star Baker once, apart from Peter who has won Star Baker twice. However, like we saw with Hermine\u2019s unexpected exit, all previous weeks are ignored when deciding out the winner is *throws all my charts into the bin* REMEMBER FREDDIE MERCURY THE PRINGLES CAN MAN? What a moment. At one point or another this year, haven\u2019t we all cried into our freezer? I don\u2019t want to watch Laura crying into a freezer. I also hate that we see what happens before it happens. Before we start tonight\u2019s episode, I thought you should know that David Bowie\u2019s son Duncan Jones has finally caught up with the first episode. The earliest mango klaxon of the season? Anyway, now that that\u2019s out of the way, here is last week\u2019s episode as a quick recap: We haven\u2019t got Hermine in the final. A shame I know, considering that her bakes were some of the best this season. But we shouldn\u2019t blame Laura for this outcome. She\u2019s done some fabulous bakes too. Besides, imagine an alternative Bake Off final between Rowan, Hermine, Lottie and Mark. It would consist of Lottie and Mark saying \u201cburger off\u201d to each other, Hermine mentioning that her Showstopper was inspired by something she saw in Slough, while Rowan panic drinks tea and fails to finish his Showstopper on time. Five weeks ago, Linda presented samosas for a cornish pasty challenge, and only four weeks ago my heart was torn from my chest as Northern Irish Mark (of the accent and the hair) was declared the casualty of Japanese Week while Paul celebrated his hundredth episode. Three weeks ago, Head Girl Lottie was presenting a chocolate puddle to the judges, and it was just two weeks ago that Hermine created the showstopper to end all showstoppers\u2026 Which brings us to last week\u2026 Well, well, well. It\u2019s been nine weeks since we met Sura, walking her cat. Eight weeks since we were introduced to mangoes, the most heavily leant on prop in Bake Off history. Seven weeks since Paul declared war on the LGBT community through the medium of bagels, and six weeks since we discovered that 90 minutes wasn\u2019t enough time to make a decent brownie."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
