Titled HouseFyre, the clip features both artists partaking in contemporary national pastimes including exercising at home, wearing ugg boots, running out of toilet paper and envy-streaming Jacinda Ardern\u2019s press conferences. \u201cI\u2019ve been wanting to do something with Briggs for years but couldn\u2019t work out what idea to go to him with,\u201d Minchin said. \u201cThen a few days ago, he sent a track over and asked if I\u2019d wanna write a chorus for it. I think my exact words were \u2018fuck yeah\u2019. So much fun to make, and such a buzz to work with the senator.\u201d Briggs \u2013 or Senator Briggs, for those on Twitter \u2013 said: \u201cCabin fever manifests in strange ways \u2026 black and red together hasn\u2019t looked this good since the \u201993 grand final.\u201d The lyrics cover everything from Morrison\u2019s mid-bushfire trip to Hawaii to his planned mid-Covid-19 trip to the football \u2013 taking in the Ruby Princess debacle, and the prime minister\u2019s megachurch and forced handshakes along the way. Or, to put it in Minchin\u2019s words, \u201cWe\u2019re good little citizens sitting in the bunker just / watching the boss fumble like my befuddled uncle does\u201d. The clip \u2013 which was directed by actor and director Christiaan Van Vuuren (Bondi Hipsters), and features work from street artist Scott Marsh \u2013 was filmed by Briggs and Minchin in their own homes, on smart phones. All proceeds will go towards assisting \u2013 or raising awareness of \u2013 Indigenous Australians affected by the coronavirus crisis, with viewers being encouraged to donate here. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to look smart while pointing out when things are stupid and our current leadership has given us a lot to point at, from Hawaii to sports rorts,\u201d Briggs says. \u201cI don\u2019t feel very smart sitting inside my house, but the Covid-19 outbreak is really serious and the smartest thing we all can do right now is to STAY HEALTHY. Wash our hands, stay safe and practise social distancing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
