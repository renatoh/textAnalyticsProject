The former non-league striker who used to deliver parcels from the back of a van has scored 13 Premier League goals this term, which puts him ahead of Wayne Rooney, Peter Crouch, Jermain Defoe and Emile Heskey. Or, to put it another way, the four strikers that Fabio Capello took to last year's World Cup. Campbell has been a revelation in a Blackpool team who have exceeded all expectations, with their freeflowing football producing a deluge of goals and unlikely victories. They have been a breath of fresh air in the Premier League, and it is a fair bet that the majority of neutrals tuning in to watch Survival Sunday on Sunday afternoon will be hoping that Ian Holloway's side can defy the odds again and pick up the result against Manchester United that spares them relegation. \"It's going to be one of our toughest games of the season no matter what team they put out but we believe we can win there,\" Campbell says. \"People are saying if we get a draw or even if we lose we can stay up, but the manager has been saying all week that we've got to go there and try and win. It's almost do or die \u2013 we've probably got to produce our best performance of the season.\" Campbell smiles when it is pointed out that Blackpool's support will extend well beyond those wearing tangerine shirts. \"I get it all the time, when I see people on the street who tell me that Blackpool are their second team. It's brilliant the way that we have touched everyone. I think a lot of that is down to the gaffer's philosophy. He wants to attack teams and try to score as many goals as we can. You've got to give him huge respect for the way he's set his team out.\" Nobody has benefited more from that expansive approach than Campbell. A team built on the premise that attack is the best form of defence has produced opportunities aplenty for a striker who arrived at Blackpool from Leicester City for \u00a31.25m in August with a point to prove. In Campbell's only other spell in the Premier League, during the second half of the 2005-06 season, he failed to score for a Birmingham City side who were relegated. \"I knew from the last period I had in the Premier League that it's not easy, so that was playing on my mind,\" he says. \"I was thinking: 'Get your first goal, DJ, and things will start from there.' Luckily enough I scored on my Premier League debut for Blackpool against Newcastle and that removed the burden I had on my shoulders. I think that settled down a lot of nerves and got rid of the demons I had from last time in the Premier League.\" Campbell has never looked back since. Blackpool had already played three matches when he signed and he later missed another three games through suspension, yet Darren Bent is the only Englishman who has scored more Premier League goals than him this season. Indeed, it is little wonder that Campbell finds it hard to suppress a smile whenever he looks at the leading goalscorers' list and remembers that six years ago he was working for DHL as a van driver and playing in the Ryman Premier League. \"My missus was telling me about the Darren Bent statistic the other day, and when you hear things like that it does make me proud of what I've achieved this year,\" Campbell says. \"Seeing your name among the top scorers is brilliant, especially when I think of what I used to do and where I have come from to get where I am. I just love playing football and to be up there with these great players is every kid's dream. And I know I'm not a kid anymore, but I still have dreams.\" One of them is playing for England. Ian Wright and Les Ferdinand were among Campbell's role models when he was growing up and he would love to follow in their footsteps by making the leap from non-league football to a full England cap. \"I think I was quite close last time to getting a call-up, which was great,\" Campbell says. \"Fabio came to watch me playing against Tottenham at home, and I managed to score and set up one. It just made me smile to think how far I've come.\" It is a journey that Campbell admits he would never have made without the help of Johnson Hippolyte, his former manager at Yeading. Hippolyte, or Drax as he is known on the non-league circuit, talked Campbell into pulling his boots on again after he quit football for 18 months when things failed to work out as a trainee at Aston Villa. Spells at Chesham and Stevenage followed before Campbell caught Brentford's eye playing for Yeading in the FA Cup against Newcastle in 2005. \"I didn't know how fortunate I was until I left Aston Villa and had to do a nine-to-five job,\" Campbell says. \"That period of time when I stopped playing made me do some soul-searching. Thankfully, Drax got me back into the game, and he made me realise more than anyone what I had and what I was missing. He's a father-figure to me, he always has been and always will be. And he's probably the main reason I am where I am.\" Hippolyte will be among the Blackpool supporters at Old Trafford for a match that Campbell hopes can provide one final flourish from a team that were never supposed to be in with a fighting chance at this stage. \"A lot of people wrote us off before the season started, saying we would only get 10 points, so it's been a great achievement to be where we are,\" Campbell says. \"I feel proud of what we've achieved. And I think we've proved a lot of people wrong.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
