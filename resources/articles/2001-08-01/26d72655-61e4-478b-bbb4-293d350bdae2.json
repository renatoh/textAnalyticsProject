Research out today from the Publican newspaper reveals that lager prices increased by 2% last year, undershooting the economy's underlying inflation rate of 2.2%. Londoners will not be surprised to learn that the priciest pint is in the south-east, where drinkers typically pay \u00a32.14 for mainstream lagers such as Carling, Fosters or Heineken. The best bargains for beer drinkers are in Scotland, Wales and either side of the Pennines, where the same brands cost an average \u00a31.91 a pint. There are signs that the north-south divide in terms of lager prices is closing: while the average price of a pint was up by at least 6p in the north and Midlands, drinkers in the south-east paid only a penny more per pint than in 2000. Mark Hastings, of the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association, said the higher cost of property and wages kept pub prices higher in the south-east. He insisted that drinkers get a better bargain in Britain than on the continent: \"We have some of the cheapest beer in Europe. Compared to France, Spain, Italy and Germany, our prices are low.\" The average price of a pint of draught lager is \u00a32.17 in Germany, \u00a32.51 in France and \u00a34.38 in Sweden. Austria and Holland are among the few European countries that undercut British beer prices. Bob Cartwright of Six Continents Retail, one of Britain's largest managed pub companies, said the increase in prices was the result of spending by the industry on decor, cleanliness and entertainment: \"There's been huge investment going into better levels of comfort in pubs. Expectations among customers have risen.\" The Publican's annual \"market report\" reveals that the average price of a glass of wine has risen 4p to \u00a31.57, a pint of bitter is up 3p to \u00a31.78 and a shot of whisky has increased by 2p to \u00a31.31. The cheapest pint of bitter in the country can be found in the north-west, where the average is \u00a31.63. The cheapest dram of whisky is sold not in Scotland, which averages \u00a31.26 for a single, but in Wales, where the average is a penny less. In a survey of more than 1,000 landlords, 54% said their takings were up this year, against 61% a year ago. The biggest winners are larger operations - 40% of publicans with takings of more than \u00a3400,000 said their trading had improved substantially, a further 33% said business was slightly better. Mr Hastings said: \"Differences in trading can often be an issue of location rather than just size. Smaller pubs are often in rural areas, and the rural economy is under significant pressure.\" The survey also charts the changing face of the pub, away from being the haunt of groups of men to more family-friendly places. Some 70% of landlords say that couples are \"very important\" for their business, while students were rated the same way by only 21% of managers. More than a third of establishments serve meals, while one in four has a restaurant attached. Nearly 40% of pubs have no-smoking areas, and half of all landlords say they will allow children into the bar. On the other hand, a record number of premises - 65% - have contraceptive vending machines, compared with 57% last year. The survey's authors admit to being puzzled by the sudden increase in the number of outlets, but say: \"It has to be a welcome development.\" The pub trade remains a right-wing stronghold: 38% of publicans said they voted Conservative at the election, 19% plumped for Labour, 12% for Liberal Democrats and 24% declined to say. Respondents criticised the government for increased red tape, tighter employment regulations and failure to liberalise licensing hours. Yet the prospect of extended licensing hours does not appear to galvanise many landlords: a third said they would stick to their current opening hours, another third said they would want closing time extended to midnight at the weekends only. Only 1% said they would open 24 hours a day all week if given the opportunity, and just 17% of those surveyed favoured continental-style hours, allowing landlords to close the pub when the last customer staggers home. The large majority wanting little change to drinking hours might be explained by the long hours worked by the average licensee: a third work between 49 and 75 hours a week, another third 76 to 90 hours a week. About 25% say they work more than 91 hours in an average week. The overall average was 76 hours, with the licensees in rural or village pubs serving the longest hours behind the bar. Not surprisingly, 80% of landlords said they would not recommend the pub trade as a career because of the long hours involved. The lack of support for continental drinking habits is mirrored by few signs of enthusiasm for the European single currency: 72% of landlords surveyed are against replacing the pound with the new currency, and only 22% are in favour of Britain's membership."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
