Sunderland are bottom but their manager cannot comprehend why and is adamant his team are not dirty. \u201cI don\u2019t care who\u2019s in charge of the fair play rules, but they\u2019re not fair,\u201d Poyet said. \u201cIt\u2019s an invention. Somebody told me we were bottom but I don\u2019t know how they give the points. I don\u2019t know if they\u2019re from Newcastle. It\u2019s so superficial. \u201cI\u2019ve not seen anything that makes me think we\u2019re dirty so why we\u2019re bottom I don\u2019t know. I\u2019d like someone to explain. But there would be no explanation, just words that don\u2019t make sense. I don\u2019t accept it. I don\u2019t care what they say, it\u2019s not true.\u201d The Fair Play table is assessed on six factors \u2013 red and yellow cards, positive play, respect for opponents, respect towards the referee, behaviour of team officials and supporter behaviour. No one in the division has accrued as many as Sunderland\u2019s 85 yellow cards and they have scored badly in other spheres, particularly the behaviour of Poyet and his assistants in the technical area. \u201cMaybe when I wave my arms about it\u2019s minus one,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe the club will have to tie my arms behind my back. How do they come up with the points? How many points is it for spitting at someone, three million? \u201cYellow cards are part of the game. What about the spitting, stamping, head-butting and elbowing people in the face? Until two months ago we hadn\u2019t had a sending-off, so how can we be bottom? Aston Villa, second bottom of the Fair Play League, visit the Stadium of Light on Saturday in a relegation \u201csix pointer\u201d, with Poyet hoping to secure Sunderland\u2019s first win in five League games at the expense of a side under the management of his old Tottenham team-mate Tim Sherwood. Much as Sunderland\u2019s manager likes Sherwood \u2013 \u201cTim\u2019s a character and you need characters in football, I enjoyed playing with him next to me\u201d \u2013 he has considerable sympathy for his predecessor. \u201cI was sad to see Paul Lambert leave Aston Villa,\u201d he said. \u201cHe always tried to get his players to take care of the ball and to pass it well \u2013 but doing that takes time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
