What is remarkable about the play is its ability to preserve what George Steiner in The Death of Tragedy called \"the exact balance of doom\". Mary Stuart is the prisoner of her regal cousin, Elizabeth, but also the victim of her guilty conscience and of the various plots, led by the impulsive Mortimer and the double-dealing Leicester, to secure her freedom. But, if Mary is physically confined, Elizabeth is metaphysically trapped by the byzantine intrigues of court life and the isolation of monarchy. Schiller's heart may go out to Mary, but his head fully understands the disillusion and despair of Elizabeth. Instead of giving us a battle for supremacy between two star performers, Leipacher has come up with an ensemble production that reminds us that Schiller looks back to Shakespeare and forward to John le Carr\u00e9. Overcoats are fastened over shoulders in the style of period cloaks, and Elizabeth's shifty prevarication over Mary's death evokes the newly crowned Bolingbroke's moral evasiveness over the murder of Richard II. But intelligent use is made of projections to indicate that we are in a recognisable modern world of fluctating alliances and fierce religious opposition. Incriminating documents are flashed on to the screen as they might be at an MI5 briefing and, in an inspired touch, Mary at her execution ascends a sky-reaching ladder, and remains visible throughout the final scene depicting Elizabeth's tormented solitude. Occasionally the production goes over the top, as in Mary's physical assault on her cousin in their unhistorical encounter at Fotheringay. But, in general, Leipacher, using an adaptation by himself and Daniel Millar, reminds us of Schiller's acute understanding of power politics. The actors also play together as a team. Derval Mellett's Mary radiates the right spiritual fervour and simmering rage, and Kate Sawyer's Elizabeth nicely blends vulnerability and imperial hauteur, but they are not allowed to outshine the other performers. Gareth Fordred as the artfully side-swapping Leicester, Tom Radford as the besotted, hot-headed Mortimer and Richard Delaney as the machiavellian Burleigh all make a decisive mark. The same group is playing Twelfth Night and Miss Julie in a seven-week classic rep and, although they may go under the name of Faction, they display a unity that augurs well for their future."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
