On Saturday Arsenal are back in the final, this time against Chelsea, and with Little on the sidelines while Nobbs wears the armband. Nobbs\u2019 injury kept her out of the game for nearly a year, also forcing her to miss last summer\u2019s World Cup, but she has emphatically proved both her fitness and her undiminished ability since returning in August: only three Arsenal players have made more appearances this season and only one has more goals than the 27-year-old midfielder. \u201cThere were really difficult moments,\u201d she said. \u201cYou come through an ACL injury and I think it\u2019s just getting your rhythm back, you feel like you haven\u2019t played football for a really long time. I\u2019ve just had to believe in myself and it took a few words with [Arsenal\u2019s manager] Joe Montemurro to keep me confident and get back into this team. Eventually you\u2019ve just got to look at yourself and start performing. I wasn\u2019t thinking about leading Arsenal into cup finals \u2013 I just wanted to be playing.\u201d Arsenal have won the League Cup five times and reached seven finals \u2013 Nobbs created the only goal for Vivianne Miedema when they last won it in 2018 \u2013 but this will be Chelsea\u2019s first. \u201cIt\u2019s a key game for us. If we\u2019re not winning trophies we\u2019re not in the place we want to be,\u201d Nobbs said. \u201cThe Continental Cup seems to be one we like to win and I\u2019ll be going out there with the same mentality as always. We\u2019ve been a club that has created history and the reason for that is that we want to win and we want to win everything.\u201d Arsenal won last season\u2019s WSL title at a canter but their defence is proving less straightforward. They are third, three points behind Chelsea and four from Manchester City, albeit with a game in hand on the leaders, and having lost to both in the last month. Chelsea have won the teams\u2019 last three meetings and have not lost a domestic match all season. Though Arsenal will be hampered by the absence of the injured trio of Little, Beth Mead and Lia W\u00e4lti, Nobbs sees the final as an opportunity to \u201chopefully knock a bit of confidence out of them\u201d \u2013 but playing such familiar opponents can present a particular set of problems. \u201cSometimes because of the expectation and knowing the opposition, you might not approach it with the detail you\u2019d normally approach someone new,\u201d Montemurro said. \u201cSo it can become tricky, and I think it\u2019s more difficult sometimes to play the same teams and the same scenarios over and over again. But we have to be prepared, we have to expect certain things and we have to make sure we\u2019re in the right mindset to play a team we know well. We know their strengths, we know their weaknesses and we have to make sure we take care of the situation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
