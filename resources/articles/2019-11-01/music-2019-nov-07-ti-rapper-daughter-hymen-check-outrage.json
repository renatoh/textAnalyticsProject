The rapper is a major celebrity in the US, where he has had seven Top Five albums, three of them reaching No 1. He has had roles in films including American Gangster, Entourage and the Marvel movie Ant-Man and its sequel, Ant-Man and the Wasp. He is currently appearing alongside Cardi B and Chance the Rapper in Rhythm + Flow, a talent competition on Netflix. Asked on the Ladies Like Us podcast about sex education for his children, he said: \u201cNot only have we had the conversation, we have yearly trips to the gynaecologist to check her hymen. Yes, I go with her \u2026 I will say, as of her 18th birthday, her hymen is still intact.\u201d He acknowledged a woman\u2019s hymen can be broken outside of sexual activity, but countered by saying: \u201cSo then they come and say, \u2018Well, I just want you to know that there are other ways besides sex that the hymen can be broken like bike riding, athletics, horseback riding and just other forms of athletic physical activity\u2019. So I say, \u2018Look, Doc, she don\u2019t ride no horses, she don\u2019t ride no bike, she don\u2019t play no sports. Just check the hymen, please, and give me back my results expeditiously.\u2019\u201d The comments have since been edited out of the podcast. In 2018, virginity tests like these were condemned by three United Nations agencies: the World Health Organisation (WHO), UN Human Rights and UN Women. A statement read: \u201cThis medically unnecessary, and often times painful, humiliating and traumatic practice must end \u2026 WHO states that there is no evidence that either method can prove whether a woman or girl has had vaginal intercourse or not.\u201d Last month, a spokesperson for the New York State Department of Health described the tests as \u201can assault on young women with no scientific or medical basis\u201d. Among hundreds of disgusted tweets reacting to the rapper\u2019s comments, the sexual health nonprofit organisation Planned Parenthood tweeted: \u201cIdk who needs to hear this but virginity is a made-up social construct, and it has absolutely nothing to do with your hymen \u2026 Some people think you can tell if someone\u2019s had sex before if their hymen is stretched open. But that\u2019s not the case.\u201d TI and Harris have not commented since the podcast was released, though Harris has liked tweets condemning her father, including one that described his behaviour as \u201cdisgusting, possessive and controlling\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
