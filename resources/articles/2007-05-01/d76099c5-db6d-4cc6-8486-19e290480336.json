The Football League's chief operating officer, Andy Williamson, said in a statement that it was \"hugely disappointed\" the 9,000 seats not purchased by Club Wembley members were not being resold to fans of Derby County and West Bromwich Albion. He said he would continue to press Wembley to change its mind. Williamson's statement was doubly contentious because Wembley had wanted to issue a joint press release but the two sides were unable even to agree a common position. Wembley insiders are furious at being held responsible for the empty seats, which will be hugely embarrassing to both the organisers and the sponsor, Coca-Cola. They claim the Football League's greed is ultimately to blame. A month ago the two sides met to negotiate how Club Wembley seats not taken up by members could be sold on. Wembley offered 50-50 but says the Football League walked away after its demand for 72% of all profits was turned down. The league counters that it believed it was in continuing negotiations and the issue of segregation was not mentioned until Monday. \"All we are interested in was getting as many fans in as possible - this was never a commercial issue,\" a league source said. Lane in line for top role The European Tour is searching for a chairman for its tournament committee after Jamie Spence's resignation. Thomas Bjorn, Spence's favoured successor, effectively ruled himself out yesterday because he wants to focus on competing and several other senior members of the committee, including Colin Montgomerie, Paul McGinley and Henrik Stenson, are likely to feel the same. Barry Lane, a popular figure who competes almost exclusively in Europe, may be the man to step up. Many requests but Van de Velde still has cold feet A world-class field has assembled for the PGA Championship at Wentworth this week but Jean Van de Velde, right, is the most sought-after interview. With the Open returning this summer to Carnoustie, scene of his meltdown, the Frenchman has had more than 300 interview requests. So far he has declined them all. Should he fail to return to Carnoustie as a player via the qualifying tournament he will be in demand to join the BBC's Open team. The five swings? The European Tour's decision to adopt an anti-doping policy from next year will do no harm to golf's ambition of gaining a place in the 2016 Olympic Games. The sport missed out when the IOC last voted on the issue, in 2005, but lobbying is set to intensify before a decision in 2009 on the 2016 schedule. Craig Reedie, a member of both the R&amp;A and the IOC, has been influential in shaping golf's drugs policy and has offered informal advice on getting into the Games. \"I'm absolutely delighted the European Tour has taken this step,\" he said. The list of prohibited substances and the penalties are yet to be decided. It remains to be seen if they will meet World Anti-Doping Agency standards. Not a man to cross The spat between Sport England and the international basketball federation, Fiba, may yet have repercussions for London 2012, with the Fiba secretary-general, Patrick Baumann, emerging as a force in world sport. He is set to be elected as a full member of the IOC in the summer and has been appointed to the IOC coordination commission that will monitor London's Olympic progress over the next five years. British sport can ill afford to fall out with him. Fiba has banned English teams from international competition after Sport England commissioned a review from Tony Mallin, the first draft of which says the governing body, England Basketball, is \"not fit for purpose\". paul.kelso@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
