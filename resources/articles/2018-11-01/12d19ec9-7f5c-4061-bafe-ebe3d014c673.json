Namely, use it as the primary battleground in a global turf war for power and influence. The jousting superpowers \u2013 described by Peter O\u2019Neill, Papua New Guinea\u2019s prime minister and Apec host, as the the \u201ctwo big giants\u201d in the room \u2013 managed to turn what is supposed to be a peaceable platform for advancing multilateral cooperation into a noisy reprise of Captain America versus the Evil Empire. This is not what Bob Hawke and Paul Keating had in mind when Apec was launched in Canberra in 1989. On this showing at least, the forum\u2019s 21 members, including Hong Kong and Taiwan, must decide whether they want to play Cold War 2. Several have already taken sides, or are in the process of doing so, possibly without sufficient consideration. By partnering with the US in planning a major military base on Manus island in Papua New Guinea, Australia signalled that it shares the Trump administration\u2019s hawkish view \u2013 frankly insulting to Beijing \u2013 of the need to \u201ccontain\u201d China. Already on the US team is Shinzo Abe\u2019s re-arming Japan. Given Tokyo\u2019s smouldering history of bilateral enmity, periodically rekindled for political purposes by Beijing, where else has it to go? New Zealand can pretend it has its own, independent process, but when the chips are down, it doesn\u2019t. Other, weaker actors worry about China\u2019s behaviour but worry more about offending it. Vietnam, Malaysia and the Philippines fit this category. One remarkable aspect of Xi Jinping\u2019s command performance in Port Moresby was his evident indifference to other leaders\u2019 views. The Global Times, a state mouthpiece, declared it was \u201cno big deal\u201d the summit ended without the customary joint communique. Apparently China objected to a reference in the text to \u201cunfair trade practices\u201d. It shows just how guilty China\u2019s president must feel that he assumed this phrase referred to him. (It did, of course.) Accustomed to having his own way, Xi does appear to have been surprised by the resistance he encountered at the summit. It seems he was anticipating an easy win for Chinese soft power diplomacy and pecuniary influence-peddling, given the absence of both Donald Trump and the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin. Xi arrived early, bearing gifts, including $4bn for PNG roadworks \u2013 this on top of $1.3bn in soft loans previously extended to various Pacific islands. But when officials excluded non-Chinese media from Xi\u2019s private mini-summit with selected leaders, they were taken aback by the ensuing row about freedom of the press \u2013 a concept foreign to Beijing. More serious pushback was to follow, in the compact form of Mike Pence, the US vice-president. Pence had already paraded his boss\u2019s many China grievances at the preceding Asean summit in Singapore. Now he doubled down, publicly demanding China \u201cchange its ways\u201d on trade, intellectual property and human rights, and mocking Xi\u2019s prized \u201cone belt, one road\u201d multinational infrastructure initiative as a \u201cdebt trap\u201d for the unwary. Pence added insult to injury by suggesting Trump could impose yet higher, punitive tariffs on Chinese good in January, and by holding a meeting with Taiwan\u2019s representative \u2013 a very deliberate provocation. All this closely followed inflammatory remarks by the US commander in the Pacific. Speaking in Canada, Admiral Phil Davidson accused China\u2019s military of \u201ca sustained campaign to intimidate other nations in the East and South China Seas\u201d by militarising manmade islands. China, he said, was constructing \u201ca great wall of Sams (surface-to-air missiles)\u201d. But if Xi got more than he bargained for in Port Moresby, he can take solace from the fact that, tough talk aside, the US and its would-be allies as yet lack a coherent, joined-up plan to counter China\u2019s growing sway in the Indo-Pacific. Unlike Barack Obama, who \u201cpivoted\u201d to Asia, it is clearly not a priority for Trump. He snubbed both Asean and Apec, and preferred to go to Paris instead to argue with Emmanuel Macron. America First nationalism, contempt for multilateral alliances and a whimsical, transactional policy approach are not the way to build a winning ideological and geopolitical strategy. Trump and his people appear intent on drawing a line; in Port Moresby they deliberately picked a fight with China. But do they have any real idea what comes next as China pushes ahead anyway, relentless, regardless, step by patient step? Little wonder Xi was not too worried. So far, he\u2019s winning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
