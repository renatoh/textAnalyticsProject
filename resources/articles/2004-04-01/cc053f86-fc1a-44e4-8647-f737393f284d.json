Instead of simply following the doe across crag and forest in plus fours and a hat with two peaks in the usual manner he probably sits in a pub somewhere bombarding her with obscene text messages: \"U R Horny\" and that sort of thing. What I imagine about the beating and ferreting I will keep to myself. Whatever my mate's son gets up to on moor and fell the very presence of somebody who doesn't think The Darkness is a popular nickname for the Labour Party is surely something for which field sports have been crying out. The whole practice of mangling wild animals needs to be dragged into the 21st century (preferably by a pack of large, savage dogs) and the first step in doing so is surely acquiring the sort of \"bad boy\" character that - like Eric Cantona and Dennis Rodman - can cross over and appeal to the disaffected youths in the marketing departments of major sportswear brands around the world. Nowadays every sport on the planet has got wise and produced its own enfant terrible. He is generally recognisable by the way his lips curl into the triumphant sneer of a child who has just vomited after being forced to eat broccoli, his artfully reversed baseball cap and his multi-million-pound deal with Nike. Bowls, for instance, has given us the splendid Griff Sanders, who earned himself a 10-year ban from the Devon Bowling Association for his unseemly predilection for lager, fish and chips and roll-ups and was portrayed on celluloid by Paul Kaye. Meanwhile at Purfleet this week we will be able to cast our eyes once again upon Tony Payne, the one-time \"wild man of US darts\". These days for Payne the snarling confrontations with Phil Taylor of a decade ago are a thing of the past. He has found God and opened up a \"darts ministry\" in which he brings American youngsters to Jesus via the oche. Even golf has its own crazy rebel in the shape of Britain's Ian Poulter. Some may feel that in a game so conservative most of the players make Steve Rider look like Hunter S Thompson, being dubbed a wild man is not that tricky. It is a belief given credence by the fact that one previous holder of the wild man of golf tag, Arnold Palmer, earned it by wearing his socks at a jaunty angle. Poulter though has done his best to freak out the squares - as I believe the argot de nos jours has it - by sporting trousers so alarming even other golfers point at them, and trimming his facial hair into whimsical patterns. It is surely only a matter of time before he moves on to doing some really dangerous stuff like making v-signs at Peter Allis while pretending to scratch his nose. As if all that were not enough, next autumn the film A Quick Roll On The Felt, starring Julie Walters and Celia Imrie, is going to tell the British public more than they might like to know about Eileen \"Mrs\" Patterson, the 67-year-old self-styled \"ancient terrible\" of the North Yorkshire carpet bowls circuit. Expelled from the WI at the tender age of 53 over alleged irregularities in the crimping of the crusts on her bilberry pies (judges claimed she had used her false teeth, a charge Mrs Patterson vehemently denies, saying, \"Absolutely ridiculous, is that. I used our Jim's\") Patterson has blazed a trail of anarchy through village halls from Boosebeck to Pickering. Adapting her trademark flamboyant \"booling\" style from that of her idol, the 70s grappler Masambula the African Warrior, Mrs Patterson shocked opponents and officials alike by wearing a tweed leotard and performing a ceremonial Zulu clog dance before matches. Other misdemeanours included offering to let the match referee experience \"one of my iced yum-yums\" in a manner some listeners considered \"a trifle on the saucy side\", dying her hair an eerie shade of gunmetal blue and discussing her problems with \"the old waterworks\" in a loud voice as opponents prepared to bowl. Things reached a head three years ago when, during a crucial cup-tie in Sleights, Mrs Patterson, apparently high on a lethal cocktail of beetroot wine and pickled eggs, approached her opponent, the 73-year-old retired Methodist minister Donald Harbottle, and announced her intention to \"make you my bitch\". In the fracas that ensued several trestle tables were knocked over. Afterwards an unrepentant Mrs Patterson dismissed the incident by saying it was just \"a ghetto thing\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
