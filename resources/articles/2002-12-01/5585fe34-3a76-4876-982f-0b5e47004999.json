But yesterday Dennis Bergkamp got off more lightly than his manager must have feared, escaping suspension for an alleged stamp. Bergkamp had been charged with violent conduct, which could have carried a three-game ban, but was found guilty of the lesser offence of improper conduct and fined \u00a35,000 for his behaviour in an incident involving Blackburn's Nils-Eric Johansson at Highbury in October. The FA disciplinary commission decided there was no violent intent when Bergkamp's boot made contact with Johansson. It appears they concluded the Dutchman held back and that his action was a yellow rather than a red- card offence. The striker, who had maintained his innocence throughout, was warned about his future conduct. Although Wenger could celebrate the Bergkamp verdict, he will be less pleased that his captain Patrick Vieira is unlikely to recover from a thigh injury in time to play at home to Middlesbrough tomorrow. Birmingham City have been fined \u00a325,000 by the FA after pleading guilty to two misconduct charges relating to the crowd disturbances that marred their 3-0 victory at home to Aston Villa in September. Fans ran on to the pitch to celebrate Birmingham's goals and one supporter was given a prison sentence after coming on to the playing area to confront the Villa goalkeeper Peter Enckelman. Sheffield United have launched an internal inquiry into the crowd trouble that marred Tuesday's 3-1 victory over Crystal Palace. The referee Eddie Wolstenholme has reported that Tommy Black was pelted with objects from an area reserved for home fans as he attempted to take a corner. An assistant referee was also struck on the ear by a coin flung from the stands. The FA has launched its own investigation into the incident, having already fined United \u00a32,000 last month and warned them as to their supporters' future conduct after home fans invaded the pitch in the wake of the 2-1 Worthington Cup defeat of Leeds. The Yorkshire derby with Rotherham was also interrupted by crowd trouble in September. Como, the last-placed team in Serie A, face more trouble after the riot that forced the abandonment of their game against Udinese on Wednesday. The club's president Enrico Preziosi remains unabashed. He blames the referee. The game was called off in the 67th minute when Massimiliano Saccani awarded Udinese their third penalty of the night. As Como supporters tried to break down metal barriers and invade the pitch, Como's Brazilian defender Juarez was hit on the head by a missile thrown by a fan. \"A biased referee is a clear indication of how sick football is,\" Preziosi told Gazzetta dello Sport. Rivaldo has advised Barcelona how they can reverse their slump: by sacking the manager Louis van Gaal. \"If that happens the players and fans will recover their enthusiasm again,\" said the Brazil forward, who left Barcelona for Milan in the summer. \"I am not saying this just to be spiteful. It is simply the case that I do not like the way he works.\" Barcelona have dropped to 13th in the Spanish league. Press reports say Van Gaal will be sacked if they lose at Real Mallorca tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
