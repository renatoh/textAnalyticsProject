The Jules Rimet isn't even the first World Cup to get half-inched. In the early 1900s the millionaire philanthropist Sir Thomas Lipton organised a tournament in Turin to decide the best team in the world, inviting sides from Italy, Germany, Switzerland and Britain to take part. West Auckland FC were Britain's first representatives in 1909 \u2013 just how that came to pass can be found here \u2013 and the team made up mostly of coal miners beat Stuttgart and Switzerland's FC Winterhour to claim the inaugural trophy. In 1911 West Auckland hammered Juventus 6-1 to retain the trophy and as Lipton had decreed that a team winning the trophy twice were entitled to keep it. Sadly, following a colourful eight decades in and out of various hotels and pubs, in January 1994 the Sir Thomas Lipton Trophy was stolen from West Auckland Working Men's Club and has never been recovered. In September 1895, following Aston Villa's victory over West Brom in the final, the original FA Cup was pinched from the window of William Shillcock's football equipment shop in Newtown Row, Birmingham. It was never recovered and Villa were fined the princely sum of \u00a325. The story doesn't end there, though. In 1958 Harry Burge, by then aged 83 but at the time a known petty criminal in the Birmingham area, claimed that he had stolen the trophy and melted it down to make fake coins. And there were also those who pointed out that despite being fined \u00a325, Villa had insured the Cup for \u00a3200 ... To lose one trophy may be regarded as a misfortune. To lose both looks like carelessness. Villa were again the culprits in 1982 after the club won the European Cup after beating Bayern Munich in Rotterdam. \"We used to go out and take the European Cup where we could to show it to the fans and let them have their pictures taken with it,\" said Colin Gibson, who on the fateful night had popped to the Fox Inn near Tamworth with his team-mate Gordon Cowans. \"Gordon and I had had a few drinks, and we were playing a competitive darts match, when someone turned round and said: 'The cup's gone, it's been stolen.' \"At the time you didn't really realise what was happening. All I can remember is dread and trying to block it out as if it didn't really happen.\" The trophy, though, turned up 100 miles away in a police station in Sheffield, where a mysterious Mr Sykes handed it to police officers (who then had an impromptu kickabout by the garages to see who would be the ones to lift the trophy). Last month it came to light that Mr Sykes could well have been \"loveable rogue\" Adrian Reed, who \"spontaneously borrowed\" the trophy before taking it home. The full story can be found here. But the English are not alone in their propensity for trophy larceny. \"From 1903 to 1944 the German champions were awarded the 'Victoria', a statue depicting the Roman goddess of victory,\" writes Stefan M\u00fcller-Ivok. \"Dresdner SC were the last club to lift the trophy, but in 1945 a football fan from Berlin somehow got hold of the trophy, hiding it in his coal cellar when the Soviet army approached the city. There \u2013 in what was to become East Berlin \u2013 Victoria remained until after the wall came down and its owner handed it back.\" And those light-fingered rascals are also at large in South America. The Jakarta Cup was won by Rosario Central in 1975, after the Argentinians beat the Indonesia national team and Benfica and they placed the trophy, all gold and dazzling gems, on display at the club. A rather resourceful \u2013 or perhaps optimistic \u2013 thief nabbed the original but left a fake made of \"glossy paper and glitter\". Whether he hoped no one would notice is unclear. It wasn't until the late 80s that the original was returned, minus a few diamonds. The thief has apparently never been apprehended. Thanks to Gabriel Arrisue\u00f1o for the story and this link. Last of all we go to Holland and prankster Theo Maassen. \"PSV Eindhoven's 1978 Uefa Cup was stolen from their trophy room,\" writes Johan van Slooten. \"It was taken by actor/comedian Maassen while filming a TV series at the Philips Stadium in 2000. A year later Theo suddenly admitted he had stolen the trophy on live TV, handing it to former PSV player Stan Valckx. PSV didn't get the joke and filed a lawsuit against Theo, who got away with a couple of hours of community service.\" EARLE-Y EXITS \"ITV have had a miserable time of it at the World Cup and the sacking of Robbie Earle reminded me of their unfortunate Ron Atkinson association,\" wrote Steve Corbett last week. \"Are there other instances of football punditry mishaps from around the world down the years?\" Robbie's not the first pundit to suffer an Earle-y exit at a World Cup. \"Back in 1994, during the USA World Cup, Germ\u00e1n Legu\u00eda, a minor player for Peru in 1982 and a pretty cool guy, was a pundit for one of our private national TV broadcasters,\" writes Eduardo Villanueva. \"But he was sacked after he criticised a goalkeeper as 'so bad that he couldn't fly even with a joint'. Perhaps a bit of explaining is necessary: goalkeepers in Peru are said to 'fly' when they dive to catch the ball; and a 'vuelo' (flight) is what you get when you get, well, high.\" And in Zimbabwe it doesn't pay to praise the away team. \"A few years back, September 2004 to be precise, in Zimbabwe a dazzling show by Jay-Jay Okocha left commentator Charles Mabika singing Okocha's praises,\" writes Tinashe Shoko. \"The Warriors went on to lose 3-0 to the Super Eagles. In light of the result Mabika's comments were deemed unpatriotic by the Information Minister, Jonathan Moyo, and he was fired. Luckily he was reinstated a few months later and he is now back at ZBC TV.\" MOHAMED SHAWKY: MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN WESLEY SNEIJDER \"Wesley Sneijder has won the treble with his club and nearly the World Cup,\" writes Seb White. \"Has a player ever gone one better and won both?\" No player has ever won the domestic double, a continent's top club competition and then the World Cup in one season, but players from two clubs have followed a club treble with continental success with their national team. In 1988 Guus Hiddink's PSV Eindhoven won the Dutch Eredivisie, the KNVB Cup and the European Cup after a penalty shoot-out win over Benfica. Of that team Hans van Breukelen (who saved the vital spot-kick against the Portuguese side), Ronald Koeman, Berry van Aerle, Wim Kieft and Gerald Vanenburg were all in the Holland squad that lifted the European Championship that summer. In 2006 Al-Ahly won the Egyptian league title, the Egyptian Cup, and the African Champions League and Egypt, as the host nation, won the Africa Cup of Nations. Nine Al-Ahly players were in that Egypt squad: goalkeeper Essam El Hadary; defenders Mohamed Abdelwahab, Ahmed El Sayed and Wael Gomaa; midfielders Mohamed Aboutrika (who scored twice in the Champions League final), Mohamed Barakat, Hassan Mostafa, and Mohamed Shawky (later of Middlesbrough); and striker Emad Moteab. ONE-CLUB RELIANT COUNTRIES (2) Last week we looked at the World Cup teams who have been reliant on one club. Ian Homewood and George Ferzoco write to point out that another team \u2013 in addition to Uruguay in 1970 and the Soviet Union in 1986 \u2013 had nine players from one club on the pitch in a World Cup match: Italy did so against Argentina in 1978. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE Back in 2006 referee Mike Reed's celebration of a Liverpool goal at Anfield had readers sending in tales of inappropriate refereeing conduct: \"I recall seeing footage from the end of the 1971 FA Cup final after Arsenal had beaten Liverpool 2-1 after extra-time,\" says Steve Hewlett. \"When he blew the final whistle, I'm sure referee Norman Burtenshaw fell to his knees, pumping his fists towards the heavens.\" It's tough to get more than anecdotal evidence on this one - they didn't have it on YouTube - but it seems to be true. Burtenshaw claimed afterwards that he was simply celebrating the fact that the game hadn't gone to a replay. That excuse lost what little credence it had when, a few months later, he presided over Arsenal's 6-2 battering of Benfica. Burtenshaw's performance was so bad that he was mobbed by Benfica players, who tried to beat the crap out of him \u2013 a task that would clearly have taken a fairly long time. He'd had a chance to brush up on his self-defence skills a few years earlier, mind. When Aston Villa beat Millwall 2-1 in October 1967, the Den crowd were so incensed they stormed the pitch and surrounded Burtenshaw. He had to be carried from the pitch after being knocked unconscious. The German referee Wolf-Dieter Ahlenfelder, by contrast, was knocked sideways by a few pre-match liveners. \"It was November 8 1975 when, in the Bundesliga, Werder Bremen played against Hannover 96,\" scene-sets Eberhard Spohd. \"The referee Ahlenfelder surprised everyone with some seriously strange decisions \u2013 including blowing for half-time after 29 minutes. A linesman indicated his mistake and Ahlenfelder played 16 minutes' added time. Then, during the half-time interval, he stuck his tongue out at a photographer, and Bremen's president B\u00f6hmert said: 'For this show we could have charged a higher entrance fee.' Ahlenfelder of course denied drinking alcohol, but later he admitted that he had 'several Maltesers' (a schnaps) before the match. And to make things really clear to the layman, he said: 'We are men \u2013 we don't drink Fanta'.\" And our very own James Richardson added: \"In a Napoli-Salernitana local derby in 1945, a referee named Stampacchia lost control of the match and faced a pitch invasion from a large a hostile crowd. At this, Signore Stampacchia wisely pretended to have been shot. A large and concerned crowd gathered around the fallen official's tragically supine form - at which point, tempers having cooled nicely, Stampacchia got back up and continued the game.\" For thousands more questions and answers, take a trip through the Knowledge archive Can you help? \"Just two years after their creation Irish side Sporting Fingal F.C. won the FAI Cup,\" writes Michael Hallinan. \"They are now about to play against Maritimo in the second qualifying round of the Europa League. Has there ever been a team to achieve success so quickly?\" \"Is Fola 'she was a showgirl' Onibuje the player with the highest clubs to appearences ratio,\" wonders Bill Sheppard. \"The poor chap's been shipped around to so many different clubs after barely kicking a ball he must be in with a shout of getting this somewhat dubious honour.\" Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
