By that stage \"Hodgson Out\" was already trending on Twitter and England's knee-jerk brigade had resorted to the default setting. Everyone knows the script by now: it ends in something along the lines of \"this guy's just as useless as the last one\". Except it normally takes a bit longer before the grumpiness starts. In Hodgson's case, the scrutiny has started before a ball has even been kicked in anger. It is certainly easy to pick holes in his Euro 2012 squad and there were times when Hodgson strayed dangerously close to perplexing his audience. At one point he cited the way Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain had troubled Andrea Pirlo in Arsenal's Champions League tie against Milan (Pirlo had left the club the previous summer). Later, the manager explained he had called off next week's training camp in M\u00e1laga partly because Manchester City's players had been celebrating a league triumph and \"would find it hard to be on a plane on Monday\". You looked at him to see if it was a joke and it quickly became apparent it wasn't. All the same, the most relevant issue \u2013 even ignoring, for one moment, the John Terry-Rio Ferdinand issue \u2013 is that these are the moments when you are reminded that Hodgson has a tremendously difficult job on his hands. He is not so much selecting from a shallow pool but something more resembling a puddle and, if that sounds unduly negative, Hodgson himself spoke with great reserve when it came to where England can legitimately aim in eastern Europe next month. Probably the best way to gauge it is to look at the number of players who have made the cut despite not being mandatory first-team picks for their clubs. Hodgson made Andy Carroll sound like a modern-day Alan Shearer but conveniently ignored the fact the striker has never been trusted to play four successive games for Liverpool. Carroll's dismal form for seven eighths of the season forms part of the reason why Kenny Dalglish has been fired. Damien Comolli, the Liverpool director of football, had already been sent to the guillotine before the striker's performance, as a second-half substitute, in the FA Cup final put him in the frame. \"I shouldn't be confronting him with the failures of the early part of the season,\" Hodgson said. \"I should be encouraging him for the successes of the latter part.\" Yet this is not half a season of good form, or even a month; it is one and a half games. The point is that Hodgson cannot be blamed for the fact there are not great alternatives. Jermain Defoe, for instance, is included despite arguably his worst season in Tottenham's colours, with only 11 league starts, and it is a recurring theme throughout the squad. James Milner has been on the edges at Manchester City since the turn of the year and an unused substitute in seven of their last 11 fixtures. For all the excitement Oxlade-Chamberlain generates, this is an 18-year-old with six league starts. Stewart Downing has been preferred to Adam Johnson despite the season's most embarrassing statistic: a \u00a320m winger without a single league goal or assist (no, Dalglish's sacking doesn't count). Johnson is entitled to feel hard done by but there is only so far you can go in support of someone restricted to 10 league starts, and none since 3 March. The simple truth is there is an absence of real quality in abundance, something that was not lost on Hodgson. \"You don't necessarily have to be the best team to win a tournament,\" he said. \"You can get by with good team spirit, and a bit of luck at the right times.\" All of which brought us back to the Terry issue, the effect his inclusion might have on team spirit given Rio Ferdinand's popularity and where it leaves the Manchester United player. The answer, almost certainly, is that his international career is now finished, at the age of 33. Hodgson did his best to say the right things, talking of how difficult it had been to tell him he was not wanted but his explanation did not always wash. For one, Hodgson cited the fact that Ferdinand had played only one England game in the last year and the manager wanted to \"be faithful to those who got us here\". Which was a nice soundbite, except his new captain, Steven Gerrard, has played only 33 minutes for England in 19 months. The official line was that Ferdinand had been left out for \"purely footballing reasons\". In short, what Hodgson was saying was that he rated Terry, Gary Cahill, Joleon Lescott and Phil Jones (one of Ferdinand's understudies at Old Trafford) as better players and, no, there were no politics involved. The questions persisted and Hodgson shifted in his chair. \"Are we ever getting off Rio Ferdinand?\" he asked. \"There are 23 men in the squad, we're preparing for the future, and yet we're concentrating on one man, discussing one man until the the cows come home.\" Whether there is more to it, we may never know for sure. Even if Ferdinand's omission is directly linked to Terry's court case, Hodgson is too shrewd to admit it publicly. \"I can't insult your intelligence and say I wasn't aware of the situation,\" he admitted. After that, all that can be said with certainty is that Ferdinand is convinced he is out because of non-football reasons. The United player is so aggrieved he may go public at some point. The biggest problem, Hodgson argued, was not deciding between Ferdinand and Terry \u2013 it was, he confirmed, an either-or situation \u2013 but choosing the right blend of attackers to compensate for Wayne Rooney's suspension from the first two matches. Danny Welbeck has three goals since the end of January. Carroll has four league goals all season and, in reserve, Daniel Sturridge, has three since Christmas. John Ruddy has been selected as England's third-choice goalkeeper in part because there is nobody else a) English and b) available in the Premier League. The fourth choice is Jack Butland, who has just spent a season on loan from Birmingham City to Cheltenham Town in League Two. Spain's fourth choice is David de Gea of Manchester United. Previously, England managers would swear their squads could stand toe to toe with anyone. Now? \"I'd refer you to the Danes in 1992 and the Greeks in 2004,\" Hodgson said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
