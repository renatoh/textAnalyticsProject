Police were called by London ambulance service at 3.30am on Saturday to reports of a woman in cardiac arrest at a property on Raymead Avenue, Thornton Heath. Officers found Fauvrelle, 26, who was eight months pregnant, with stab injuries. Despite the efforts of paramedics, she died at the scene. Her baby was delivered at the scene before being taken to hospital and remains in a critical condition. A 29-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of murder and was taken to a south London police station where he remains in custody. A 37-year-old male arrested has been released under investigation pending further inquiries. The Metropolitan police said the victim\u2019s next of kin had been informed and a postmortem examination would be held in due course. The Met\u2019s homicide and serious crime command said officers were keeping an open mind on the motive for the stabbing and urged anyone with information to contact police. The London mayor, Sadiq Khan, tweeted: \u201cViolence against women has no place in our city, and horrific murders in the home like this show the scale of the problem we face. \u201cMy heart goes out to this innocent child, and to the mother they have so tragically lost. @MetPoliceUK are investigating \u2013 please help if you can.\u201d Khan added that the City Hall-funded violent crime task force, a specialist force of officers, would be on duty this weekend. He said they had \u201cmade over 5,000 arrests, and removed over 1,500 dangerous weapons from our streets in the last year\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
