A year on and I am rushing between my base school and interviews at other primary schools for positions as an NQT. It's a bewildering experience. As one trainee colleague said when I admitted my head was about to explode: \"It's enough to induce hysteria.\" I don't believe either of us are in danger of becoming hysterical but we are disorientated and under a lot of pressure. As a trainee, I am wildly excited about becoming a classroom teacher in my own right. I have really enjoyed my one-year course but long to get out there and have a \"real\" teaching job. We also look forward to receiving a \"real\" salary. Although an NQT's salary is a joke to most adults and an insult to all teachers, it's more than the \u00a36,000 we get at the moment. Perversely, this is part of the pressure problem. As NQTs in the current school budget fiasco we are very tempting to cash-struck headteachers. Cheap as chips compared with teachers who come with the added expense of experience and management points - and who, unfairly, are losing out in the recruitment process. The issue is not that there are no NQT jobs out there - and I can only write from experience in London boroughs; it's about how you ascertain that you are going for the right job. My colleagues and I stand in good stead because our course is well respected and we are mostly mature students with a lot of previous work/life experience - though there are no cash points for that as an NQT. But which NQT position is right? And which school is best suited to us? How can you know whether something is right when you are taken on a whirlwind tour of an unfamiliar school, have a half an hour's chat with total strangers and are then expected to decide almost immediately? It is important to get a sense of the school atmosphere and ethos, and gauge the attitude of the children as you pass them in the corridors. Do they respond to a greeting? Are they polite and helpful? I'm finding it's always worthwhile making a school visit when the children are there. In a short interview it's important not to be afraid to ask lots of questions, including how they look after NQTs, and what are the biggest issues or difficulties that you might encounter as an NQT in that particular school. I'm finding reading the school's Ofsted report beforehand is a must, so you know its government-perceivedsuccesses and failures. But who knows? I have made six school visits in the last week, all of them different, all with positives and negatives. I am not saying any school would have given me a job, but my fellow trainees and tutors tell me the last question the head asks is: would you take the position if offered? What do you say when you are uncertain and have various other equally unfamiliar schools to see in the following week? The fairest response when you are not 100% sure is to ask for 24 hours to think about it. They might give you that, but a week is unlikely. This is quite unlike other careers, where you know pretty much what to expect from a company when you apply, have various interviews and are given time to mull things over. Teaching is unique in that the jobs all start in September and the vast bulk of recruitment occurs in May. It is a cattle market, where both employers and would-be employees feel under enormous pressure to secure a post immediately. Hence my constant headache. Currently, most of my prospects lie miles from home and I have to consider, in a matter of weeks, whether I should move boroughs. But say we all get good jobs and start as NQTs in September. For those without BEd or graduate teaching experience, the pressure is not off. Exciting and liberating as the prospect is, it will be be strange to have real autonomy for the first time - to have your own class and teach with no one watching or checking up on you. Of course, NQTs are - or should be - supported and under management, but it must be a pretty terrifying responsibility. Your instinct is to keep asking permission to do things like move your classroom around when you are free to make decisions unaided. Current NQTs suggested to me you should never be afraid to ask questions, to maximise your training days and time with your mentor, and to take your responsibilities on board and run with them. PGCE students have two options: sink or swim."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
