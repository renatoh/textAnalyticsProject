A 2003 report by the National Soccer League Task Force \u2013 an \u201cAustralian Soccer Association\u201d brains trust charged with figuring out just what the future A-League should be \u2013 featured several pages on the American version of club football. Around the same time, player-turned-pundit Andy Harper was sent to the US by Football Federation Australia to discover what the Americans were up to first hand. In 2008, another FFA delegation flew across the Pacific to learn more about MLS while, more recently, Mark Falvo \u2013 FFA\u2019s head of international affairs and government relations \u2013 spoke to the league\u2019s New York City headquarters about how to approach proposed expansion. Intriguingly, the interest is not mutual. \u201cIt\u2019s all been pretty much one-way traffic,\u201d says one New York-based sports executive when asked about US-Australia football relations. What exactly can the A-League learn from MLS? Despite some market similarities and familiar challenges \u2013 relatively youthful leagues, powerful rivals like the NFL and AFL, mainstream media attention, and competition from the Champions League and Premier League \u2013 there are stark differences in experience and strategy. Importantly, FFA executives might note the consistent but measured growth of MLS. Ten teams have joined the league in the past 10 years, with a second Los Angeles team \u2013 LAFC \u2013 set to compete next season. Cities are lining up to get into MLS and the league could feasibly grow to 40 teams within 15 years without diluting tough criteria. The licence fee alone for the as yet undecided 25th and 26th team is US$150m. How deep does the game reach into the US sports, business, and entertainment industry? The diverse LAFC ownership group includes Hollywood mogul Peter Guber (a co-owner of NBA\u2019s Golden State Warriors and MLB\u2019s LA Dodgers), basketball hall-of-famer Magic Johnson, comedian Will Ferrell, women\u2019s football great Mia Hamm, YouTube founder Chad Hurley and celebrity businessman Tony Robbins. Over the same decade, the A-League has added two teams \u2013 tellingly in Sydney and Melbourne \u2013 and had to rebrand and relocate its New Zealand-based club. MLS\u2019s biggest expansion error in that time was Chivas USA \u2013 a misjudged franchise of Mexican club Guadalajara that was put out of its misery in 2014. FFA, meanwhile, oversaw controversial misfires with Gold Coast United and North Queensland Fury. Chivas USA aside, the MLS ownership model has provided security for an evolving league that averaged 22,000 fans per game during the 2016 season (Seattle Sounders boasted an average attendance of almost 43,000 last season while, at the other end of the table, FC Dallas pulled in 14,000). A key factor of that ownership model is that MLS is sanctioned but neither owned nor managed by the US Soccer Federation. MLS is effectively a capitalist co-operative run by heavyweight investors (including Anschutz Entertainment Group, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, and former NBA star Steve Nash) who manage and control their respective teams. When David Beckham eventually launches his Miami team he will be buying into the league \u2013 not just a team. The success of a team \u2013 on and off field \u2013 is supposed to benefit the league overall. FFA\u2019s increasingly tense ownership of the A-League, as well as its team licence system, is seen as a major drawback in attracting serious investment to the competition, according to one American-based executive with experience in both countries. \u201cThe Australian clubs are basically renters with a defined term,\u201d he explains, speaking off the record because his current employer did not want to be seen commenting publicly on MLS. \u201cWhy would you invest significantly in the A-League if you can legally be thrown out of the league when your licence is up? In MLS, the owners are the league and this allows for greater and more secure investment. In America, you can sell your licence but it can\u2019t be taken away from you without good reason.\u201d Another significant difference between the leagues: stadia. A 2001 MLS reboot saw team-owned football-specific stadiums become a priority \u2013 rather than teams renting space in NFL venues. In 16 years, MLS teams have built 16 stadiums. More are on the way. It is infrastructure that may seem obvious but is seen as out-of-the-box within the A-League. \u201cHaving our own stadium is fundamental and a key component that our research has taken away from MLS,\u201d says Steve Horvat, a former Socceroo heading Victoria Patriots, a Geelong-based bid for the next round of A-League expansion. \u201cThere is no doubt that when a fan has a sense that it is their own home and not one shared by \u2013 not only other clubs but other codes \u2013 that they can truly feel connected to that club for life. This is a non-negotiable scenario that we will hold firm.\u201d \u201cThe turning point for MLS was having its own stadiums,\u201d agrees the US-based executive. \u201cBut Australia is a very crowded market place and it\u2019s an insight into the challenges for A-League owners when the rich and powerful AFL teams share grounds.\u201d Then there\u2019s cattle. Regulations governing centralised MLS player contracts, the US college system, and how and from where a player can be bought or sold are so complex even some coaches struggle to understand them. Ruud Gullit\u2019s lacklustre spell coaching LA Galaxy in 2007 was highlighted when the Dutchman \u2013 not unreasonably \u2013 failed to understand why MLS rules dictated that a youth team player could not automatically be promoted to the first team. The short version of the sometimes head-exploding MLS roster regulations say squads consist of 20 players who must come under a US$3.8m budget. However, complicated additions and subtractions mean the actual amount that can be spent on a roster is closer to US$5m. Then owners can throw in the big bucks allocated to designated player salaries. The MLS Players Union releases salary figures to the public every year. That\u2019s why we know Kaka is guaranteed US$7.1m playing from Orlando City, US national team captain Michael Bradley earns US$6.5m at Toronto FC, and ex-Cuban international Osvaldo Alonso \u2013 who defected to the US during the 2007 Gold Cup \u2013 makes US$1.1m a season with Seattle Sounders. At the other end of the scale, there are 50 players who make the minimum $53,000 per year. The A-League and Professional Footballers Australia are shy about releasing player salaries but the league salary cap is AU$2.6m with no limit placed on how much a team can spend on two designated players. Which is where Tim Cahill comes in. MLS has attracted big names to its league: David Villa, Kaka, Andrea Pirlo, Beckham, Frank Lampard, Thierry Henry, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Didier Drogba, among others, but importantly also attracted home national team stars like Michael Bradley, Jozy Altidore, Clint Dempsey, and Tim Howard at a time when those players could likely still pick up decent contracts in Europe. Dwight Yorke, Shinji Ono, and Alessandro Del Piero were marquee coups for the A-League \u2013 even if the Del Piero deal only happened when it was realised there was no room for the Italian star at LA Galaxy. However, in contrast to MLS, the A-League\u2019s relationship with its national team players is more complicated. While a number of the famed 2006 Socceroos squad did end their careers at home (some in more dignified circumstances than others), it\u2019s worth noting Cahill\u2019s arrival in Australia came after he was released by New York Red Bulls and after he played for two teams in China. For Cahill, there was still more of the world to see \u2013 and money to be made elsewhere. Still, the potential value to Melbourne City and the A-League was thought to be so great that the-then 36-year-old was offered a reported AU$4m per season \u2013 with FFA contributing AU$750,000 to the deal. \u201cThe football ecosystem has changed over the past few years,\u201d says Horvat of attracting players to Australia. \u201cInvestment in Asia and the Middle East means the A-League is less likely to get those big-name marquees to our shores. However, I believe that if you target the right type of player and sell them the whole experience of life in Australia then we still have a shot. The players that are purely in it for the dollar will always chase that.\u201d Cahill was seen as a bonus to FFA\u2019s TV deal negotiations last year. MLS is three years into an eight-year combined broadcasting deal with ESPN, Fox Sports, and Spanish language broadcaster Univision that totals around US$90m per season. Importantly, this money goes to the league \u2013 the owners and their teams. FFA\u2019s recent AU$50m deal with Fox Sports is impressive by comparison when you consider the size of the media market. But who is in charge of that money? A-League club owners were told about the deal after it had been signed by FFA. What can the A-League learn from MLS? As FFA executive Falvo\u2019s recent discussions with the Americans on expansion strategy demonstrate, MLS can be a good teacher. However, geography and market size (code for \u201cmoney\u201d) are the two dominant factors that make each league unique and operate in vastly different environments. They\u2019re also two factors the A-League cannot change, no matter what it learns from the US. Academic knowledge is great. Putting it in to practice can be another thing entirely."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
