They offer a friendly, relaxed atmosphere for travellers of all ages and the owners often have a wealth of local knowledge. BBH (bbh.co.nz, membership $40) is a well-organised network of independent backpackers which provides a guide to all member hostels and discounted rates for accommodation, excursions, car hire etc. Auckland has many hostels in and around the city centre. My choice would be Bamber House (0064 9 623 4267) in Mount Eden, a leafy suburb with a village-type feel a short bus ride south of the centre. And if you are happy to stay a little further afield, I'd strongly recommend taking the half-hour ferry ride across the Hauraki Gulf to the small island of Waiheke and stay at Hekerua Lodge (waiheke.co.nz/hekerua). There's a fantastic island community with beautiful beaches and it's well worth a couple of days stay to shake off the inevitable jet lag. Christchurch has a couple of wonderful hostels. My favourite is Chester Street (0064 3 377 1897), a small, friendly place with very helpful owners if you want to buy a car or plan a route around the South Island. You will need to book ahead here during the summer months. Cathy Spooner \u00b7 International Youth Hostels in NZ (yha.org.nz) are generally in interesting locations and family friendly. The one in Christchurch is opposite the arts centre in a beautiful clapboard building advance booking essential. Aukland has two IYHs, but also check out Waiheke Island. Rick Hall \u00b7 I travelled around New Zealand with my two children, and the hostels and budget accommodation, especially in Queenstown and Christchurch was great, with mixed crowds of many different ages.
