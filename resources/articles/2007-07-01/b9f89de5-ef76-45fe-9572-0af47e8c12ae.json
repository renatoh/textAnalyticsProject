That sentence has immediately cost me the sympathy of maybe half those addressing this page. But I hope you will forgive the wanton provocation, and read a little further. Support in Europe and the US for foreign military interventions has rarely been lower. Congress now recognises that Iraq is a lost cause, and yesterday we were told that British casualties in Afghanistan are reaching disturbing proportions. George Bush and Tony Blair have created a catastrophe for the Iraqi people, given the Afghans little that is sustainable, and inflicted huge damage on the west's foreign policy interests. If one conviction is fixed in Gordon Brown's mind, it is surely that Britain will participate in no new military adventures on his watch. Yet failure in Iraq does not, and should not, mean that it is mistaken to commit foreign troops anywhere. The tragedy of Bush's policies, as some of us predicted from the outset, is that they have crippled the moral authority and political will of the west for action in places where they might do real good, such as Darfur. Professor Paul Collier, the director of Oxford's centre for the study of African economics, has just published an important book entitled The Bottom Billion, in which he argues that western troops can be indispensable to salvaging a collapsing society. He recognises that, post Iraq, it has become very hard to gain consent for this to happen. But he cites Sierra Leone as an example of a British military intervention which really worked, and won the lasting gratitude of the country's people. Collier explores the plight of some 58 countries, inhabited by the poorest one-sixth of the world's inhabitants - \"stuck in a train that is rolling slowly backward downhill\". He is sceptical about much currently done for them by the outside world. Military intervention can at best, of course, only create a foundation for reconstruction, though without it nothing else may be possible. The efforts of NGOs, he says brutally, often represent populist action of a kind that pleases donors, rather than promises lasting good: \"Popular thinking on development is fogged by lazy images.\" He singles out Christian Aid for special scorn. The character of much state-to-state aid is determined by the commercial ambitions of the givers rather than the best interests of the recipients. Many collapsing societies succumb to civil war, says Collier, not because rebels possess legitimate grievances, but because they fall prey to factional greed and the despair of young men for whom killing becomes the only means of gaining a livelihood. Local armies are far more often a menace to government than a bulwark. Collier is sceptical about the emphasis often placed on rural development, which promotes dependence on primary agricultural products. He argues that lasting prosperity can only come from economic growth, best achieved by promoting local industries that create jobs. At present, by contrast, manufacturing among the bottom billion is declining. Some of Collier's statistics are awesome, but as a former development research director at the World Bank, he deserves to be believed. He suggests that the cost of a failed state is about \u00a330bn, when lost growth and collateral damage to neighbours are assessed. It takes an average of 59 years for such a society to recover. On that basis, almost any sum spent on averting collapse looks modest. Yet it is essential to inject aid at a speed that a society can properly manage. Big infrastructure projects not only distort economies but also become magnets for corruption. Many of the promises made two years ago at Gleneagles, for instance, could simply worsen governance and corruption: \"When aid reaches 16% of GDP, it ceases to be effective.\" If Gleneagles targets are anything like met, he believes they will overtake the ability of most beneficiaries to absorb them usefully. Collier is not anti-aid. He wants to see much more of it, but of a different kind, more effectively spent and monitored. Collier's prescriptions include an international banking agreement, to stop corrupt leaders from harbouring the profits of their stupendous thefts in the west. He argues that we spend too much time worrying about the environmental standards of mineral extraction companies in the developing world, and not nearly enough on addressing their ghastly ethical and governance shortcomings. When we identify local leaders who seem willing and able to manage their own societies honestly, he wants us to throw everything into supporting them: \"help to empower the reformers\". To those of us who want to help but are deeply sceptical about current means, his ideas strike chords. The problem is that much of his agenda would require international agreements that are monumentally difficult to achieve. Who can imagine the Swiss opening their African bank accounts to scrutiny? We are entering an era in which the contest for natural resources will make advanced economies, notably including China's, less scrupulous about gaining access to minerals. But however difficult are cures, it is a good beginning to identify diseases. Collier wants to abolish cheap western guilt: \"Citizens of the rich world are not to blame for most of the problems of the bottom billion; poverty is simply the default option when economies malfunction. The development lobbies themselves, notably the big western NGO charities, often just don't understand trade.\" He is opposed to restrictive trade policies in poor countries, which hinder growth and make customs services a focus of corruption. He wants favoured terms for African exports to the west, against those of the Asian tigers. But the most controversial passages of The Bottom Billion relate to military interventions. Beyond the benefits to local people, Collier claims that bringing stability to centres of anarchy would profit the west, by checking the export of terrorism: \"On balance I think that my children, and everybody else's, will be safer if we respond to the problem of failing states by restoring order, rather than by relying on the myriad of defensive measures that we need if we don't do it.\" The problem that he does not address is that - with the notable exception of Sierra Leone - the west has shown itself shockingly incompetent at managing military interventions, whatever the principled case for them. The US army has an especially poor record as a peacekeeping force. Both the British and Americans are conducting studies on the vital issue of strengthening the civil follow-up to troop commitments abroad. If we have learned one lesson from Iraq and Afghanistan, it is that all military deployments are futile unless what follows is done right. Without law and order, electricity, tax collection, and honest administration of school and hospital budgets, no society can advance out of abject poverty. Collier's hopes for western military intervention are likely to be disappointed, because Iraq has poisoned the turf. But Brown, with his professed eagerness to give more effective aid to the bottom billion, should read this book. Collier belongs neither to political right nor left. He is a pragmatist, who acknowledges the unfashionable truth that military force can possess an honourable utility. comment@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
