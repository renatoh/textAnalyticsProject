County's chastening start to Premier League life has encompassed the concession of a goal in the first three minutes in each of their last two games. It would have been understandable, therefore, if there were signs of relief that they were still level when the fourth minute arrived. Not that this was the side Liverpool can anticipate welcoming on Saturday. Billy Davies had made seven amendments to his team-sheet, as did his Blackpool counterpart, Simon Grayson. David Jones, whose campaign had been limited to 45 minutes at Manchester City, was among those introduced. The midfielder was Derby's major creative force and, but for a Rhys Evans save, he would have provided the opening goal. Evans was wrong-footed, however, when Jones attempted a shot from 35 yards that fractionally evaded his far post. It was an isolated alarm as, with three of the back four escaping Blackpool's rotation policy, Evans was well protected. The visitors succeeded in carving out an inviting chance of their own when Scott Vernon's flick-on was placed precisely for his strike partner Keigan Parker. His half-volley, however, lacked the same accuracy and was gathered by Stephen Bywater. It was an indication of Blackpool's burgeoning confidence, and their positivity was almost rewarded. The combination of Vernon and Parker confounded the Derby defence again and, while their appeals for offside were ignored, the latter advanced unchecked on goal. Bywater's save spared Derby but, one minute later, he was beaten, but Parker hit the post. When Derby's goal arrived, it was in still more unlikely fashion. Mo Camara's evening had been notable for the waywardness of his shooting. Yet, when intending to cross, he baffled Blackpool with a curling ball that nestled in the back of Evans' net. It gave the left-back, operating as a midfielder, his first Derby goal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
