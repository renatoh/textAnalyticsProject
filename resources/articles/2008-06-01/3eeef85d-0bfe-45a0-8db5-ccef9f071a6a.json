What's your immediate reaction? Do you (a) gaze lovingly upon them with a moistening eye? Or (b) scream for the tumbrel and the guillotine? Or (c) strain to pick out Prince Michael of Kent, take careful note of what he's wearing and sigh admiringly, nay covetously, at his unique, effortless personal style. \"I wish I could be more like Prince Michael of Kent\": that's not a sentence you hear every day. But in the enormously unlikely event that you answered (c), don't panic. You're not - as people may have cruelly suggested in the past - in urgent need of some kind of psychiatric evaluation. You're what fashionistas call \"on trend\". In this year's GQ Britain's best-dressed men list, Prince Michael of Kent was at 34. He had a testimonial from hugely influential menswear designer Tom Ford. \"In the future one will be able to say, 'You know, like Prince Michael of Kent' and a very clear picture will emerge... An iconic image within the parameters of classic menswear.\" I have no idea what Ford is going on about: the only time I've ever heard the phrase, \"You know, like Prince Michael of Kent\" it was immediately preceded by the words, \"He's married to an absolutely ghastly woman.\" But if - as the accompanying advice on \"getting the look\" suggested - dressing like HRH involves wearing a Tom Ford suit, you can sign me up. The one I tried on was a thing of such advanced, beautifully tailored gorgeousness that it's a miracle I managed to stop crying long enough to have my picture taken. One drawback: they start - that's start - at \u00a32,000. Anyone looking to get one is thus advised to take a further leaf out of Prince Michael's book and pal around with a few Russian oligarchs in the hope of striking a lucrative business deal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
