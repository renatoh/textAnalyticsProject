The charge comes on the recommendation of the FA's Video Advisory Panel and could mean a three-match ban for the Arsenal defender if subsequently found guilty. Although not originally booked for his reaction, the incident was later referred to the FA. The england defender is already facing a one-game ban for his sending-off against Everton last weekend, and missed the final three games of last season - and the FA Cup Final - due to a ban after an elbowing incident in the 2-2 draw with Manchester United. The 28-year-old was shown his latest red card on Saturday during Arsenal's opening-day 2-1 win over Everton at Highbury, after tripping Thomas Gravesen on the edge of the box. A statement on www.thefa.com read: \"We can confirm that Sol Campbell has been charged with violent conduct following a recommendation from the FA's video advisory panel. This follows an incident during the FA Community Shield on August 10.\" Campbell was charged by the FA over the incident with Djemba-Djemba on the same day as England coach Sven-Goran Eriksson revealed the defender was out of the friendly with Croatia at Ipswich tomorrow. He now has 14 days to respond and if he requests a personal hearing, he will face a three-man independent commission. The matter was referred to the video advisory panel due to the fact that referee Steve Bennett did not see the incident during the course of the game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
