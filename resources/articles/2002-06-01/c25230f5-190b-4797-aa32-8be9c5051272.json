The 1996 winner, who missed Wimbledon last year with a nasty elbow injury, came through 7-6 (7-5), 6-4, 6-2. He will meet the powerful Australian Mark Philippoussis in the next round. Philippoussis outgunned Germany's Nicolas Kiefer with some characteristically massive services. The Aussie, known as \"The Scud\" for his heavy hitting, is returning to form after a troublesome knee problem that had him confined to a wheelchair. The unseeded former quarter-finalist got into his stride in the second set and rode home with a solid 3-6, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2 victory. Second seed Serena Williams beat off a heroic fight from Belgium qualifier Els Callens but the score was a lot closer than the American would have been comfortable with. Callens, 31, pushed hard but was finally defeated 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 (7-2). Williams now faces fellow American Chanda Ruben in the next round. * * * * * * * * * * * * * WHAT THE TABLOIDS ARE SAYING IP, HIP, HOORAY.
