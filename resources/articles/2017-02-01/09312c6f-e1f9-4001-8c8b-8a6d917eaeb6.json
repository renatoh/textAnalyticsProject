Ambitious? Maybe you can believe I am not too interested in that. \u201cChelsea do not look at the moment as if they are going to struggle, but if they do someone could still catch them. What we must do now is to win as many of our games as possible.\u201d Liverpool should find that easier now that Sadio Man\u00e9 is back from the Africa Cup of Nations. The winger was the pick of Liverpool\u2019s attacking midfield against Spurs with two first\u2011half goals in as many minutes. \u201cHe could have had more,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cOf course we missed him in January, anyone would, but that\u2019s only part of the truth. We knew we had to show a reaction today, we knew we had to show fight, and we did, right from the start. \u201cEveryone was waiting for a game like this. Sadio was fantastic, but so were Adam Lallana and Roberto Firmino, still sprinting after 90 minutes. Now we have shown what we can still do, we have to use the rest of the season well and maximise our position.\u201d Mauricio Pochettino could not explain the slow start that left his team two goals down midway through the first half. \u201cWe began badly and we had a very good team in front if us,\u201d the Tottenham manager said. \u201cYou cannot come to a place like this and only start to play when you are two goals down. \u201cWe did have one or two chances at 2-0 but to be honest we didn\u2019t deserve to take too much from the game . We were poor, we lacked aggression. Liverpool deserve all the credit. The truth is they played much better than we did.\u201d Spurs remain second, though Chelsea could open up a 12-point lead with a win at Burnley. \u201cThat gap is already huge, it will be difficult for anyone to catch Chelsea,\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cLiverpool are only a point behind us and now they have a fortnight off to prepare for their next game. We must play in the Europa League and the FA Cup before we get back to the league.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
