In the past three weeks, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has authorised industries including supermarkets, banks, medical suppliers, utilities and oil companies to work together to provide goods and services to the community. Sims told Guardian Australia the authorisations would be revoked once the crisis passed and the ACCC was closely monitoring the situation to ensure smaller players weren\u2019t disadvantaged. He said that if state governments further tightened social distancing rules they shouldn\u2019t close small grocers and butchers because this could hand a permanent advantage to the big supermarkets. And he said the ACCC was following up complaints about the travel industry, including reports some operators had changed their terms and conditions as a result of the crisis and were trying to apply their new rules to bookings made before the changes were made. \u201cThis is like we\u2019re at war,\u201d Sims said. \u201cIf we were at war with whoever, then clearly there\u2019s got to be a whole lot of coordination across the economy to help the war effort. \u201cWe\u2019re basically seeing the pandemic like a war in the sense that we do need increased supply of things and basically most of the behaviour we\u2019re allowing competitors to engage in is maintaining or increasing supply of goods or services on the one hand and hardship policies for those who can\u2019t pay for services like communications or electricity on the other.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re clearly not allowing them to price fix but we are in a mindset where to get Australia through this crisis we need cooperation, we need everybody working to get Australia and yes that means cooperation amongst competitors.\u201d He said the authorisations would be revoked after the crisis passed and things \u201cgo back to normal\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve got people watching each of these industries to see what\u2019s going on while the crisis is on, and also those people can help work out how quickly we remove the authorisation and get back to a situation where competitors start competing again,\u201d he said. He said small retailers such as grocers and butchers have told the regulator they fear being forced to close, but there was no indication state governments were planning to make such orders. \u201cI think it\u2019d be nice if state governments said that so that those businesses can get on plan,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last thing you want is if some jurisdiction does go to stage four, saying that the only businesses that can open are the supermarkets. \u201cThose companies would lose their sources of supply, lose their links, there\u2019d be a permanent increase in supermarket [market] share \u2013 and would those small businesses ever return?\u201d The ACCC head said that in the travel industry most operators were offering a credit rather than a refund, and \u201cthis was probably fine\u201d unless the terms under which the ticket were sold said the customer could get a refund. One big tour company, APT, is now offering a travel credit to customers whose trips have been cancelled because of the pandemic, even though its terms and conditions of sale say customers can get a refund equal to what they paid \u201cless any reasonable losses incurred before cancellation\u201d. An APT spokeswoman said the company was \u201cencouraging a travel credit\u201d. \u201cAny refund requests are being assessed on a case-by-case basis and will be per our terms and conditions,\u201d she said. Airline Virgin Australia is also offering travel credits. But one Virgin Australia customer told Guardian Australia the credits were useless to her because they were valid only after her Australian visa expires. A spokeswoman for the airline said some ticket types did allow refunds and the company was acting in accordance with the Australian consumer law. Speaking generally, Sims said that he was aware some companies had tried to retrospectively change their terms and conditions. \u201cObviously you don\u2019t want to put them out of business where there\u2019s no money for anybody because there\u2019s nobody there any more. \u201cSo it can be a tricky issue but clearly you can\u2019t have companies changing terms and conditions after the event.\u201d He said the ACCC was continuing to investigate allegations by Virgin Australia that Qantas was campaigning against it. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to get hold of documents and information, these things always take time,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously it\u2019s concerning and I made comments about [Qantas chief executive] Alan Joyce\u2019s comments at the time. \u201cWhat we want here is everybody working together to help Australia to get through this rather than people trying to take advantage of the situation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
