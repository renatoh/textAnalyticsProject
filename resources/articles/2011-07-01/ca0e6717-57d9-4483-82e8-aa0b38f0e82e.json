While City are increasingly optimistic of agreeing a \u00a338m deal to extract Ag\u00fcero from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, Tevez is now waiting to hear when City expect him to return for pre-season training. He has been given a fortnight off to recover from the Copa Am\u00e9rica but may be granted more time, meaning he will not be involved in the Community Shield against Manchester United on 7 August. Roberto Mancini must choose whether to replace him as captain with Vincent Kompany or continue to coddle his leading scorer. Kompany was voted the club's player of the year last season and Tevez's popularity within Eastlands has diminished to the point that three senior players approached Mancini in the spring to voice their objections to the Argentinian staying in the role were he still to be at the club next season. Corinthians announced in the early hours of Wednesday that the deal for Tevez had become \"impossible\" and it is a measure of the politics behind the scenes that there are people at City who are increasinglysceptical about whether a deal was ever likely. The feeling is it may have been an elaborate PR exercise or an attempt by agents to accelerate interest from other clubs. If so, it appears to have failed on all counts. City had certainly made considerable allowances in an attemptto help Corinthians facilitate a deal that always looked well out of their price range. The S\u00e3o Paulo club have never spent even \u00a310m on a player but said they could more than double the Brazilian transfer record, as well as offering Tevez a huge salary, because of sponsorship money and other funding. City agreed, dropping their asking price from \u00a350m to \u00a340m, with a further \u00a34m in potential add-ons. They tried to make the deal easier for Corinthians by agreeing to stagger the payments over four years and, when it became apparent that the Brazilians could not even afford an immediate \u00a35m instalment, they accepted a counter proposal to delay it until 28 February next year, with a second payment of the same amount on 28 June. Where City would not budge, however, was their insistence that Corinthians provided bank assurances. They asked for this four times, including three times this week, and the response has left them to consider that this was, in effect, the moment they called Corinthians' bluff. Where this all leaves the man at the centre of the saga is back to square one. Tevez has a contract at City that automatically means he is always the highest-paid player, no matter who else is signed. That salary is just over \u00a3250,000 a week. Add on the transfer and it is clear why so few European clubs have been unable to pay so much for a nomadic and restless 27-year-old who is now looking for his sixth club in seven years. Tevez is at an age where his transfer value will start to depreciate and, if he is to seek another move in one or two years, his next buyer could face a substantial loss. \"I think Carlos is a very calm person,\" his representative, Kia Joorabchian, told Sky Sports News. \"He's neither disappointed nor happy. He's very calm ... Now he'll go on holiday after the Copa Am\u00e9rica and see what happens ... He's still a City player and he will respect that. We will keep it like that until there's something else concrete on the table.\" His only genuine hope now of arranging something else appears to rely on a potential money-plus-player swap dealsomewhere, maybe with Wesley Sneijder of Internazionale. Otherwise, City are not certain whether there are any clubs with the finances and desire to come in for him before the end of the August transfer window. They are encouraged by the fact that, whatever his issues, Tevez's difficulties rarely seem to affect what he contributes on the pitch. The saga of his future is, however, becoming a cloud over City they could do without, dominating the news throughout their pre-season stay in Los Angeles even though he had not been with them since being persuaded, with the threat of a fine, to take part in the club's end\u2011of\u2011season FA Cup trophy parade. Kompany's conduct is in stark contrast, although the Belgium international was unwilling to speculate about the possibility of supplanting Tevez as captain. \"Until there is an actual signature and it is confirmed he [Tevez] is not a Manchester City player any more, I don't have to comment. What I do know is that the group will be stronger next season, with or without him. Whether he stays or goes, it won't change what we want to achieve. The goals remain the same.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
