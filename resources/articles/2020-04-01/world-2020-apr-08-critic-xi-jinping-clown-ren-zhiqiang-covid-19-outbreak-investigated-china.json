The retired property executive, who remains a well-connected and vocal member of the ruling party, went missing last month after writing a critical essay about the outbreak. In mid-March, Ren\u2019s friends told Reuters they had not been able to contact him, and they were \u201cextremely anxious\u201d. Late on Tuesday, party officials said Ren was accused of violations that are widely used as a euphemism for corruption and graft. The short statement posted online said Ren was undergoing disciplinary review and supervision by the Beijing discipline inspection commission, the top anti-graft commission in the country. Ren\u2019s essay took aim at a speech Xi made on 23 February, and said it revealed a \u201ccrisis of governance\u201d in the party. While it did not mention Xi by name, Ren reportedly wrote that he saw \u201cnot an emperor standing their exhibiting his \u2018new clothes\u2019, but a clown stripped naked who insisted on continuing being emperor\u201d. \u201cThe reality shown by this epidemic is that the party defends its own interests, the government officials defend their own interests, and the monarch only defends the status and interests of the core,\u201d a translated version of the essay said. In 2016, Ren was put on probation for a year as punishment for his public criticism of government policy. His social media accounts, which had tens of millions of followers, were shut down. The Chinese government\u2019s early handling of the coronavirus outbreak has been internationally and domestically criticised, after efforts to hide information and punish health workers who sought to warn colleagues emerged. Responding to Ren\u2019s arrest, Human Rights Watch\u2019s China director, Sophie Richardson, said the Chinese government\u2019s propaganda machine was \u201cin overdrive, claiming a positive performance in the Coronavirus crisis\u201d. \u201cAt home, Chinese authorities are silencing critics ranging from doctors like Li Wenliang to citizen journalists like Chen Qiushi to politically connected tycoons like Ren Zhiqiang,\u201d she said. \u201cThat Ren is being held and investigated by the CCDI guarantees one outcome: a total denial of fair trial rights.\u201d US Republican and chair of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, Michael McCall accused Chinese authorities of \u201crepression\u201d and said it \u201cmust end now\u201d. \u201cUnder the Chinese Communist Party, Chinese citizens who speak out against the govt fear they will be detained or disappear as the doctors who first warned about coronavirus did,\u201d he said on Twitter. \u201cRen Zhiqiang is under investigation just for criticising their response to the virus.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
