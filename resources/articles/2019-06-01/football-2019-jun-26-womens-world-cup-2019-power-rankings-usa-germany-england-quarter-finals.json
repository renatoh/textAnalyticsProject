Spain gave them a very tough test, providing a blueprint for others hoping to breach a defence that hadn\u2019t conceded since April. America had a huge helping of luck: watch the incident for Megan Rapinoe\u2019s second penalty over and over and from every angle and it is still hard to tell whether there was contact, or enough contact, with Rose Lavelle to warrant the spot-kick. 2) France The hosts were unlucky to have Val\u00e9rie Gauvin\u2019s first \u2018goal\u2019 ruled out by VAR in their last-16 meeting with Brazil, given that the goalkeeper Barbara did not have the ball under control when Gauvin nodded it beyond her. The forward scored from a great Kadidiatou Diani cross, though. Thaisa\u2019s equaliser showed France remain vulnerable, and Griedge Mbock\u2019s goalline clearance was as magical as Amandine Henry\u2019s winner. Now France face the USA. The winner has to be favourite to lift the trophy. 3) Germany Germany are cruising, and doing so without the talismanic Lyon midfielder Dzsenifer Marozsan, who has a broken toe. They have scored nine and conceded none on their way to a quarter-final with Sweden. The depth of their squad is scary. They had their fair share of VAR help against Nigeria \u2013 the review upholding Alexandra Popp\u2019s header despite an offside Svenja Huth potentially obstructing the view of the keeper Chiamaka Nnadozie. Favourites for the final in the non-USA/France side of the draw. 4) England It was hard to draw conclusions from England\u2019s 3-0 defeat of Cameroon. In the second half Phil Neville\u2019s defence looked particularly chaotic but given the crazy circumstances it is hard to analyse. A bottled penalty call and two possible red-card incidents could have seen the score become more emphatic but a marginal offside also saved England from a goal that would have blown the game open. Not really tested yet, and Norway will be tough. 5) Italy If you have not fallen a little bit in love with the Italians you have not being paying enough attention. Valentina Giacinti and Aurora Galli\u2019s goals against China showed Italy are much more than their rock-solid defence. A 20-year absence from the World Cup has been ended in style. Now they get to test their defence against some of the best forwards in the world when they face the Netherlands in Valenciennes, which will be a sea of orange. Italy, having topped their group above Australia and Brazil, have demonstrated anything is possible. 6) Norway The brilliantly organised Norwegians deserved to progress at the expense of Australia. With Caroline Graham Hansen back after an injury scare, they dominated. Hansen had 11 of Norway\u2019s 27 shots, the most by a player in any game thus far, and Sam Kerr was kept quiet by the Chelsea duo Maren Mjelde and Maria Thorisdottir. Only Elise Kellond-Knight\u2019s clever goal direct from a cornertook the game to extra time and penalties. Norway will have a field day if England\u2019s defence play as they did against Cameroon. 7) Netherlands The European champions took on Asian champions Japan in possibly the most exciting tie of the last 16. A moment of individual magic from Lieke Martens was followed by a superb team goal from Japan. The 2011 winners should have finished off their European rivals as Mana Iwabuchi ran riot but they couldn\u2019t quite make the breakthrough and a cruel handball decision gave the the Netherlands a fortunate 90th-minute penalty. The Dutch look great going forward but remain incredibly fragile at the back. 8) Sweden Former Chelsea goalkeeper Hedvig Lindahl was the star against Canada, pulling off a stunning save to deny Manchester City\u2019s Janine Beckie a late leveller. Sweden had struggled to break down the Canada defence but Stina Blackstenius clipped the ball over Stephanie Labb\u00e9 to ensure passage. Sweden have not really been tested beyond their 2-0 loss to the USA in Group F. Next up, though, are Germany in a rerun of the 2003 final. 9) Japan A cruel exit as the influential Lyon player Saki Kumagai\u2019s limp arm got in the way of Vivianne Miedema\u2019s strike to give the Netherlands a penalty, and victory, in the 90th minute. Japan blooded youth in preparation for a home Olympics next year but having found some rhythm they will be frustrated to not have gone through. Very unlucky. 10) Spain Like Japan, they exit with their heads high. The extremely soft late penalty that gave the USA their win was a harsh blow for a resilient side who kept the Americans from scoring from open play. They exposed a weakness in the USA\u2019s backline: press them hard and they will make mistakes. With La Liga Iberdrola pumping significant investment into the league this team will get better. 11) Brazil It is hard not to put Brazil top for Marta\u2019s impassioned call to arms alone. Playing the hosts was always going to be tough for a side who lost nine consecutive games in the run-up, so to come from behind to force extra-time was impressive. Now though, as Marta said, they need a new generation, with this likely to be her, Cristiane\u2019s and Formiga\u2019s last World Cup. 12) Australia The Matildas continued a poor run against European opposition. A slightly more assured defence helped limit Norway to a single goal but they lacked fluency and service to Sam Kerr was limited. Penalty misses from Kerr and Emily Gielnik stood in stark contrast to Norway\u2019s confident conversions. Never quite met expectations. 13) Canada The big question was why didn\u2019t Christine Sinclair take Canada\u2019s penalty, which could have levelled the score against Sweden, with 20 minutes to play? Having had one saved by Lindahl in a pre-tournament friendly she asked Beckie to oblige. Lindahl saved and Sinclair, Canada\u2019s record goalscorer, will likely always wonder what if. They struggled to score, not having enough support for Sinclair, and their defence could carry them only so far. 14) Nigeria Unlucky to fall behind against Germany to another controversial VAR decision, having had Wendie Renard\u2019s missed penalty for France against them retaken after their keeper stepped marginally off the line. With Barcelona forward Asisat Oshoala injured and Ngozi Ebere and Rita Chikwelu suspended they had an uphill task from the off. Escaping a group with the financial muscle behind France, Norway and South Korea was impressive. 15) China Failed to reach the quarter-finals for the first time and went out having scored one goal. Key striker Wang Shuang, who plays for PSG, failed to find the net. The European teams have caught up and overtaken China and, with participation in the country low, there are no clear signs of a reversal. 16) Cameroon Let\u2019s be clear: Cameroon did not let football down, but they did let themselves down. The elbow to Nikita Parris\u2019s face, the late challenge on Steph Houghton and the tantrums at correct VAR decisions were embarrassing from a team who really impressed in their group."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
