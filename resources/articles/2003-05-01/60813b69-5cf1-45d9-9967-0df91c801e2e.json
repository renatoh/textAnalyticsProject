In fact it's not that modern. Last week the idiosyncratic English arrangements dating back to the middle ages, under which a student at any of the old universities must take any dispute to the Queen or the local bishop or whoever happens to be the visitor, tottered closer to extinction when the case of Aston postgraduate Kevin Wilkinson was referred to the court of appeal. And on a more positive note it emerged that the long-awaited independent adjudicator to hear appeals from students is expected to be taking cases in the next academic year. For Wilkinson, who has been locked in dispute with Aston for six years - by no means unusual for cases involving the visitor - last week's hearing in the high court was a damp squib. Mr Justice Buckley referred the case to the court of appeal without further ado because the issues at stake were so important - and indeed may be argued in the House of Lords before the Wilkinson case is finally settled. \"It is ghastly the way it drags on,\" said Wilkinson, now a lecturer at Anglia Polytechnic University. He had moved his wife and two children from Dubai, where he had a well-paid teaching job, to begin a PhD at Aston University in 1997 - only to find his agreed supervisor was not available. After a long and acrimonious dispute he moved to Norwich, where he completed his doctorate at the University of East Anglia last year. Now a lecturer in English language at Anglia Polytechnic University, he is pleased that the case has become a catalyst in changing the visitor system - like most students he had never heard of the post until he found he was unable to go to court over what he regarded as a straightforward breach of contract. Even if he wins in the Lords, he will only have won the right to present his case for compensation in court. Aston is making no comment on the latest development in the case, but a spokesman said that any supervisor might change jobs. \"It is the duty of the university to find alternative arrangements. Alternative arrangements were offered but as it turned out the student wasn't happy. The fees were returned,\" he said. The case is crucial because it turns on whether a student has the right to take a university to court or whether any complaint must be dealt with by the visitor, in Aston's case the Queen. Not all universities have visitors - students at the former polytechnics can go to court if they cannot get sat isfaction from their university authorities. (Hertfordshire University, however, appointed Lady Archer as its visitor, although she is not one in law.) The old universities and Oxbridge colleges (though not, confusingly, the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge) have a variety of visitors , and the Queen acts either through the lord president of the privy council or the lord chancellor at different institutions. University visitors include the Duke of Edinburgh, the Duke of Kent, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops of Durham, Ely, Exeter, Lincoln, Oxford, St David's and Winchester, the Earl of Pembroke and Montgomery, Lord De L'Isle of Penshurst, Lord Howe, Lady Warnock of Weekes and the Master of the Rolls, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers. Some are elected by their governing bodies, which raises the question of whether they are truly independent, while others are hereditary. There are no ethnic minority visitors . For years judges have refused to interfere in cases involving academic judgment and treated disputes as private matters for the universities to sort out with their visitors. Even with new universities which have no visitors, judges have been wary of getting involved and given academic matters a wide berth. But what Charles B\u00e9ar QC called the \"deferential principle\" has been eroded to some extent as the courts look at whether university procedures have been fair. Aston had successfully had Wilkinson's case struck out as not a matter for the court - last week's hearing in the high court was his appeal against that. But what now promises to change the legal landscape for students is the introduction of the European convention on human rights into English law in 2000. For Wilkinson, Cherie Booth QC argued last week that a decision needed to be based on the 1998 Human Rights Act \"and the system as it is in 2003\", not on the previous assumptions of English law. John Cavanagh QC, an education specialist at 11 King's Bench Walk legal chambers, said last week: \"It is potentially a very important case. The student is saying that the jurisdiction of the visitors in old universities is in breach of article 6 of the Human Rights Act which guarantees a fair hearing when your civil rights are being determined. It is a potential challenge to the exclusiveness of the visitor's jurisdiction and even a challenge to the lawfulness of the visitor's jurisdiction.\" If the idea of a student dissatisfied with his or her degree result petitioning Her Majesty had a certain quaint charm, in practice the system had led to growing criticism and scandalous delays. Talks about reform have got nowhere for years - universities were not keen to make it easier for students to complain. Confusion and uncertainty surround the visitor system in the minds of the visitors themselves, let alone students, according to Dennis Farrington, an education consultant to Lawfords solicitors, who reported to the Department for Education and Skills. (At one unnamed Oxbridge college, the rules setting out the procedure are in Latin.) Farrington's survey of universities found wide discrepancies facing students at different universities if they wanted to take their case to the visitor. Not only does the Queen have two totally different methods of dealing with appeals or complaints, but the bishops and others appeared to be evolving their procedures as they went along. Some, like Sheila Cameron, QC, who acts for the Arch bishop of Canterbury, hold oral hearings, though most do not. Underfunding has led to cases dragging on for years. Neil McDougall, a former postgraduate student, has been in dispute with Bath University for more than a decade, alleging poor supervision, inadequate exam procedures and maladministration. Bath resists his claims. His appeal to the Queen as visitor was handled by the lord chancellor's Department, which took 19 months to consider his case and three years ago apologised for \"misplacing\" his file, but declined to consider his case further. The persistent McDougall's latest shot is to ask guidance from Lord Irvine, the lord chancellor, on how he will ensure compliance with article 6 of the Human Rights Act when he finally presents his case against the university. Farrington argued that an ombudsman would not be used often if universities had adequate internal procedures and considered alternatives such as mediation. The ombudsman option is about to be tried - on a voluntary basis at first and then enacted into law in the government's forthcoming higher education bill. No one knows if the guesstimate of 300 cases a year will be exceeded when students find it is cheap and straightforward to bring a complaint. But both the National Union of Students and the National Postgraduate Commitee have argued that most cases could be headed off if universities responded quickly to complaints, rather than letting them fester. Certainly Wilkinson feels that if his request for compensation for moving to Birmingham had been met initially by Aston, things would not have escalated into a claim of up to \u00a3100,000 for loss of earnings. Instead of finishing his PhD in 2000 as planned, he completed it only last year and has been back in full-time work since January this year. \"It could all have been finished long ago.\" But he does believe he will achieve something. \"My daughter will be at university in five years' time. I would like to think that she won't have to get entramelled in this archaic silly game.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
