The decision came after lengthy consultation that, unusually, seems to have pleased everyone. The chalk down habitat, said Wright, \"is host to hundreds and hundreds of different species, many of which are really rare, incredibly rare. One or two notables are on a list because they are so rare they are on the brink of extinction.\" They include the straw belle moth and the small blue butterfly. The Trust's position was clear. \"We're thrilled to have the Olympic race coming through but there should be no adverse impact to any species or habitat that we care for,\" said Wright, while wrangling an angry goose. He feels that they have succeeded. Notably for that specially protected species the dormouse, who, while the road's verges are cut back, will still be catered for. \"They like to move around in the canopy of trees, so we are leaving aerial walkways formed of trees with branches that touch in the middle,\" he said. Mouse bridges (not entirely unprecedented, in 2010 a bridge was erected for our furry chums at the Ryder Cup, allowing them to cross an access road) then, to go with their new Olympic mouse homes. \"We went to the Olympic Park and got a load of off-cuts from the building of the stadium and the Box Hill school children made them into dormouse boxes,\" he explained. Yet at a very serious environmental level, Wright believes the Olympics will bring a real benefit to the area. \"Locog paid for an ecological survey through 2011, which gave us a snapshot of every species we have in the Zig Zag valley,\" he said. \"Our increased knowledge of the species requirements is actually having a positive effect. We've come out of this winning for nature conservation.\" Drugs: just say 'maybe' Disturbing news for authorities ahead of the Games as a study from Leeds Metropolitan University suggests that more than 2% of athletes take banned performance enhancing substances. More worrying still was that 80 of the mainly, but not exclusively, UK-based 729 people, polled from a range of disciplines and a range of levels, refused to answer the question on banned substances, suggesting a higher figure in reality. A possibility confirmed by David Howman, director general of the World Anti-Doping Agency who said recently: \"Analytical findings suggest about one to two percent, but recent studies suggest double digits.\" But what might cause the most anxiety was how far respondents thought rivals would go in pursuit of victory. More than a third (37%) believed athletes \"would use a drug if it was undetectable and guaranteed winning\". While 9% felt competitors would still do so even \"if the drug would lead to death after five years\". Ready-made village The Olympic Delivery Authority handed over the village to organisers this week, ready to be outfitted to the standard now expected at the Games. There are 2,818 apartments in the village ranging from one-bed flats to four- and five-bed townhouses, for up to 16,000 athletes and officials. Each will feature TV and internet as well as specialist blackout blinds allowing athletes to rest during the day. But with the basics in place the detail must follow, in the form of 64,000 sheets, 21,000 pillows, 9,000 wardrobes, more than 170,000 coat hangers, 5,000 bins and 5,000 toilet brushes. The area will also include the Olympic Village Plaza to ensure the other needs of modern Olympians are also met, including a cafe, general store, bank, entertainment centre and of course, that all-important beauty and grooming salon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
