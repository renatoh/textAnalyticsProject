Allan Russell, once a journeyman striker at clubs from St Mirren to Macclesfield, stands next to Nick Pope and behind Trent Alexander-Arnold, a Scot with the Three Lions badge on his breast pocket. England\u2019s travelling party to Russia is 58 strong, but it is a measure of the esteem in which Gareth Southgate holds the 37-year-old that he joins the assistant manager, Steve Holland, and the goalkeeping coach, Martyn Margetson, in making the cut for the team picture. Russell is a specialist attacking coach, the self-styled \u201csuperior striker\u201d, who has been involved in the set-up for around a year having previously focused his efforts on individual forwards up and down the leagues, or with clubs on an ad-hoc basis. Those included Chelsea, who had Holland on their staff at the time. Russell worked with players such as Andre Gray, Benik Afobe, Alexander Mitrovic and Saido Berahino before linking up with England, with his task now to improve a record which has seen the team score 27 goals in Southgate\u2019s 18 games. The Glaswegian had a nomadic career that took in spells, not all prolific, at five Scottish clubs and three in England\u2019s lower leagues. His playing days ended with a stint in the US, where positional specialist coaches are more commonplace in most sports, at Carolina RailHawks and Orange County Blues. \u201cIn my career I felt there was never enough detail on how strikers should be trained and coached,\u201d said the coach, who has a Uefa A licence. \u201cWhen I was in America I looked at the NFL and the detail that goes into getting an extra 1% out of these guys is incredible. \u201cI took aspects of that into what I am doing now. I could never understand why, as a striker, they are not given specific training which allows them to work on their movement, awareness, timing of the runs and execution of the finish.\u201d Russell was prominently involved in England\u2019s first session at the Spartak Zelenogorsk Stadium, and will hope to work again with Marcus Rashford on Thursday when the Manchester United forward is expected to return from a knock to a knee, sustained before the team\u2019s departure for Russia. Eric Dier, who trained with heavy strapping to his left thigh, has said he is not carrying an injury and is fit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
