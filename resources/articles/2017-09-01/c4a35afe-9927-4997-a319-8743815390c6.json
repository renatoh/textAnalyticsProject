It was unclear what the president meant by \u201crevisit\u201d. The White House did not immediately reply to requests for clarification and the justice department said it would not comment on the tweet. The president\u2019s Tuesday-night tweet about the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) program \u2013 which came just hours after his administration declared the policy legally indefensible \u2013 was the bookend to a morning post imploring Congress to \u201cdo your job \u2013 DACA\u201d. Announcing his decision to terminate the program, Trump called on lawmakers to resolve the status of the 800,000 \u201cDreamers\u201d, the young undocumented immigrants who currently live and work in the US without the threat of deportation, \u201cwith heart and compassion\u201d. He added that he had a \u201cgreat heart\u201d and a \u201cgreat love\u201d for them. \u201cReally we have no choice, we have to be able to do something,\u201d Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Tuesday. On Capitol Hill, what that \u201csomething\u201d was appeared to confound lawmakers returning after the August recess to face a packed legislative agenda. They must raise the US debt limit by 29 September; pass a spending bill by 30 September to avert a shutdown of the federal government; and dispatch billions of dollars to Texas and Louisiana in the wake of Hurricane Harvey. There are also looming deadlines for the reauthorization of critical government programs such as flood insurance and children\u2019s health insurance, as well as Trump\u2019s wish for an overhaul of the nation\u2019s tax code. Trump\u2019s decision to throw the future of Daca recipients to the House and Senate raises the specter of a protracted showdown over immigration, an issue that has haunted Washington for decades. Republicans face \u201ca defining moment\u201d, one top GOP senator said, as they consider the futures of hundreds of thousands of young people. Lindsey Graham, from South Carolina, challenged his colleagues to \u201cmake the case these kids don\u2019t belong here. Because I\u2019m going to make the case they do.\u201d Speaking at a press conference on Capitol Hill, Graham renewed his push for legislation known as the Dream Act that would grant a path to permanent residency for Dreamers. Graham is a co-sponsor of the bill, reintroduced with the Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin. Graham encouraged Dreamers not to lose hope, even as he acknowledged: \u201cThe only thing that stands between you and certainty is Congress. \u201cThat can\u2019t be reassuring.\u201d Previous versions of the Dream Act have succumbed to deep-rooted conservative opposition and Trump\u2019s win in the 2016 election on a hardline immigration platform was viewed by many on the right as vindication for such intransigence. On Tuesday, as the White House ruled out support for a standalone measure to protect Dreamers, the legislative road ahead appeared unclear. A handful of Republicans expressed support for legislation to extend protections to Dreamers. The House speaker, Paul Ryan, called for consensus \u201con a permanent legislative solution that includes ensuring that those who have done nothing wrong can still contribute as a valued part of this great country\u201d. The Arizona senators John McCain and Jeff Flake, who were among the authors of a failed 2013 immigration reform bill, also implored Congress to move quickly. \u201cCongress must act immediately to pass permanent, standalone legislation to lawfully ensure that children who were brought here by their parents, through no fault of their own, are able to stay and finish their education and continue to contribute to society,\u201d said Flake. There are \u201ca lot of innocent kids counting on Congress to do its job\u201d, he said. McCain was much sharper in his criticism of Trump, calling his decision an \u201cunacceptable reversal of the promises and opportunities that have been conferred to these individuals\u201d and questioning the timing of the announcement. Other top Republicans were skeptical. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, chairman of the Senate judiciary committee, told reporters: \u201cThe bottom line of it is, I don\u2019t think Daca as a clean bill can get through the Congress by itself.\u201d In remarks on the Senate floor late on Tuesday, the majority leader, Mitch McConnell, laid out legislative priorities. He made no mention of Trump\u2019s decision on Daca. Democrats were nearly uniform in their support for Dream Act-style legislation. Chuck Schumer, the Senate minority leader, declared in a floor speech: \u201cCongress now has an ability and obligation to act \u2026 Democrats will do everything we can to prevent President Trump\u2019s terribly wrong order from becoming reality.\u201d Senate Republicans on Tuesday broadly agreed with Democrats that Congress must act to protect Dreamers \u2013 but not without concessions. \u201cThere should be some give and take,\u201d said Senator Ron Johnson, a Republican of Wisconsin. He named efforts to bolster border security and disincentivize unlawful immigration as priorities. \u201cIf you take a look at all those things, combined that with something we can do for Dreamers, hopefully there will be some give and take and we can accomplish something,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cMaybe this is the catalyst that will actually get some results and some action.\u201d But asked why he was optimistic that the Senate would pass immigration reform after Republicans failed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Johnson laughed: \u201cHope springs eternal.\u201d A number of Republicans are wary that Congress will be able to act in six months on an issue that has bedeviled lawmakers for years. Flake, one of four Republican co-sponsors of the Dream Act, told reporters he would prefer a standalone bill that carves out protections for the young people brought into the US as children. He added that it would be helpful if the president offered some guidance as to what he would be willing to sign. Trump \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to put a proposal together \u2013 we\u2019ve got that. But it would be helpful if he would say, I\u2019ll sign the \u2018Dream Act\u2019 or I\u2019ll sign the Bridge Act or I\u2019ll sign the Safe Act,\u201d Flake said, listing various immigration proposals. \u201cI want to hear him say what he\u2019ll sign.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
