No longer able to blame inaction on her one-time conservative coalition partner, and possessing an absolute majority, the Labour leader now has a free hand on an issue dear to her heart. She may have labelled climate change her \u201cnuclear-free moment\u201d, referencing the 1980s Labour government\u2019s famous opposition to nuclear weapons, but it is child poverty reduction, not climate change, that she has always taken as her \u201cextra\u201d portfolio. And Ardern has already made modest progress. Data released in February showed that, on seven out of nine key measurements, child poverty had fallen slightly in her first year in office. And that data was collected before her main anti-poverty initiative so far, the Families Package, had fully taken effect. The latest Treasury modelling shows that, pre-coronavirus, Ardern was on track to achieve the 2021 targets in the Child Poverty Reduction Act, which include lowering from 16.5% to 10.5% the proportion of families with less than half the typical (median) household income. This, though, was a little bit like getting to base camp on Everest: no mean feat, but infinitely easier than the task ahead. The coronavirus-induced recession has clearly worsened some forms of poverty \u2013 just look at the food bank queues. The Treasury thinks the number of families in \u201cmaterial hardship\u201d \u2013 those reporting they are unable to afford basic items \u2013 will \u201crise sharply\u201d. Progress on other measures, such as the household incomes one, is likely to stall or partially reverse. Ardern\u2019s long-term targets, meanwhile, are daunting. They require the proportion of households with less than half the typical income to fall to just 5% by 2028, for instance. It is important to stand back and appreciate the scope of this ambition. It would cut the number of children in poverty by two-thirds in a decade, placing New Zealand amongst the world\u2019s best performers and profoundly reducing misery and marginalisation. But ambitious targets require ambitious policy agendas \u2013 all the more so as the hardest challenges are still to be met. The families helped so far will largely be those who were in relatively \u201cshallow\u201d poverty, needing perhaps an extra $50 a week to be lifted over the line. The families Ardern will have to help in later years will be as much as $350 a week under the poverty line, according to the 2018 Welfare Expert Advisory Group (WEAG). And their numbers will have been swollen by coronavirus. For all that she is supposed to be a transformational figure, Ardern has relied largely on the \u201cthird way\u201d policies of her Labour predecessor, Helen Clark, in her fight against child poverty. The Families Package rejigged a familiar array of tax credits and payments, albeit signalling a minor shift to universalism via the best start payment for all newborns. Some more ambitious policies are on the way. The minimum wage will continue its rise towards $20 an hour, while so-called fair pay agreements will ensure that if workers win good pay rates with one employer, those conditions are spread throughout their industry. Beneficiaries will be able to earn significantly more before their benefits are clawed back, some 200,000 children will get free school lunches, and another 8,000 state houses will be built. But most experts believe these policies will be nowhere near enough. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing in place that would give you any confidence that they have the tools to meet the 2028 targets,\u201d says Susan St John, a founding member of the Child Poverty Action Group. At a minimum, she says, the government needs to raise core benefits by nearly 50%, as the WEAG recommended. It should also simplify and increase Working for Families payments, remove sanctions, forgive beneficiaries\u2019 debts and make housing more affordable. Ardern\u2019s innate fiscal and political caution will not help here. Although New Zealand\u2019s coronavirus-induced public debt will, at 55% of GDP, be modest by global standards, she seems reluctant to spend up large on things like solving child poverty. Yet that fight, if it is to be successful, will be expensive, even if it brings immense savings \u2013 in the form of healthier, better-educated children \u2013 in the long run. St John says the government could easily spend $1bn a year \u2013 on a package that includes extending some tax credits to beneficiary families \u2013 just as \u201ca holding position to relieve the depth of poverty\u201d. This starkly illustrates the scale of the challenge Ardern faces. She has made it part way up the mountain: but does she have the strength for the climb ahead?
