Many state-based corruption agencies have the power to hold public inquiries into systemic integrity issues, like the failure of lobbying laws or gaps in the donation disclosure systems. Those investigations are undertaken in public to prevent future corruption from taking place, inform better laws, and improve systems and practices. Right now, for example, the New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption is probing failings in the state\u2019s lobbyist system in an attempt to update lobbying rules and related transparency measures. But Transparency International Australia has warned the Coalition\u2019s proposed Commonwealth Integrity Commission has no such power, despite corruption prevention being a key aim of the body. It would only be able to hold private inquiries into such issues. Transparency International Australia chief executive Serena Lillywhite said holding secret inquiries was pointless, particularly when the aim was to improve public policy or broader systems. \u201cThere seems little point in holding prevention inquiries in private, even if the findings could be released and made public,\u201d she told the Guardian. \u201cIt results in a potentially one-sided inquiry with no scope to stress test what has been heard and fix systemic problems to help prevent them from happening again. It will undermine trust in the inquiry with suspicion spiked as to what is being hidden, what\u2019s not to share and learn from to boost integrity.\u201d An alternative bill, proposed by independent MP Helen Haines, has an entire framework dedicated to corruption prevention and would give the commission a mandate to drive corruption prevention across public service departments and agencies. Haines\u2019 model requires the public sector agencies to have corruption control plans and accept independent auditing, and allows public corruption prevention inquiries. The lack of public corruption prevention inquiries under the government\u2019s proposal is not the only source of concern. Integrity campaigners and experts have also attacked the Cic\u2019s narrow definition of corruption, the high threshold needed to begin an investigation, and its shielding of the public sector from open corruption investigations. It also cannot take tips from the public and is not retrospective. The Centre for Public Integrity director, Geoffrey Watson, a leading barrister, has described the model as a \u201csham\u201d. \u201cThe absence of retrospectivity means Australians will never find out what really happened with the Great Barrier Reef fund, with the so-called sports-rorts program, or with the Murray-Darling water buybacks,\u201d he said. Former Victorian supreme court judge Stephen Charles, who is also with the centre, said the body was designed to \u201cprotect parliamentarians and senior public servants from investigation\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
