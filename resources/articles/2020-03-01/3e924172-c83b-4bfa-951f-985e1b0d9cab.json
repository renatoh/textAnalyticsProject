The prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said that schools and childcare centres are exempt from bans on large gatherings and should remain open in the midst of the pandemic, but many parents have decided to keep their children at home in isolation. The decision could have significant impacts for families accessing childcare subsidies. In Australia, children are allowed up to 42 days, or six weeks, of absences in a financial year before a parent\u2019s access to the childcare subsidy is cut off. Those absences can be taken for any reason, without the need for families to provide documentation. The education department told Guardian Australia that families who exceed that limit because of the coronavirus won\u2019t have their access to the subsidy cut off as long as they have a medical reason for keeping their kids at home and provide proof. \u201cWhere the 42 absence days have been used, additional absences are available due to being ill from Covid-19 or where self-isolation is supported by a medical certificate,\u201d a spokesperson said in a statement. But for a growing number of families that won\u2019t be possible, with many deciding to keep their children home from school or childcare as a precaution to help avoid the spread of the virus. For Kyra Phillips, who lives in Sydney\u2019s eastern suburbs, keeping her three and six-year-old home from childcare and primary school felt like \u201cthe right thing to do\u201d. \u201cOur situation is quite unique because my mum is here and I can\u2019t really keep my kids away from her, I don\u2019t have that choice,\u201d she said. \u201cWe felt like we had to take the strictest precautions right now, not because I think I know better than the government but just by what I understand as a normal citizen is the right thing to do.\u201d Phillips doesn\u2019t rely on the subsidy, which is means-tested, but is part of a growing number of people who feel unable to send their children to school or childcare. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to take it one day at a time at the moment, you can\u2019t really look too far into the future or it\u2019s just too overwhelming. \u201d And while a growing number of private schools have already shut down , childcare centres find themselves in a particularly vulnerable financial position because under the legislation governing subsidies they cannot charge fees unless they are open. It means that when a centre is forced to close because of an outbreak, as happened in Queensland on Wednesday when an educator at a childcare centre in western Brisbane tested positive for the virus, the centre loses its income stream. According to Megan O\u2019Connell, an honorary senior fellow at Melbourne University\u2019s graduate school of education, that could have significant consequences for an industry in which a large number of employees are casual. Many centres also run on low margins. \u201cEven though the government is saying it won\u2019t be shutting down schools and childcare centres for now, which is fantastic, you would expect to see more of them having to close over the next few weeks and months,\u201d O\u2019Connell said. \u201cThat\u2019s obviously going to be extremely financially damaging for those centres and I don\u2019t know how many have significant nest eggs so that they can afford to close. \u201cWe can\u2019t say for certain how long each and every childcare centre can survive without income, but we do know that many are not-for-profits and you\u2019d assume those centres don\u2019t have that much money to put aside for a rainy day.\u201d The department says that unless \u201ca local emergency\u201d has been declared, childcare centres have \u201cno entitlement\u201d to subsidies and \u201cproviders should not charge families for care that has not been provided\u201d. \u201cIf services viability is at risk, such as due to extended closure or a large drop in enrolments, childcare providers can apply for grants through the Community Child Care Special Circumstances Fund to help cover business costs, including wages, to ensure services impacted by Covid-19 can continue to operate,\u201d a spokesperson said. On Thursday, the Greens called for the scrapping of the activity test, one of three factors which account for a parent\u2019s access to the childcare subsidy. The test requires parents to be either in paid or voluntary work, or actively looking for work. \u201cAs workplaces suspend operations and cut shifts, families become unable to meet the activity test and may lose access to subsidised childcare. We must not let this happen,\u201d Greens senator Mehreen Faruqi said. \u201cThe activity test should be scrapped immediately and properly subsidised childcare made available to more families, not fewer. \u201cAcross the board, people in precarious employment are likely to be some of the most harshly impacted by this public health crisis. Those who are currently meeting the activity test through volunteering or education will also lose out in wake of the virus as these opportunities are cancelled.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
