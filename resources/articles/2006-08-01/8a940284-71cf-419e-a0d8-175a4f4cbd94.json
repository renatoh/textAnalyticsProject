Even the late rush of five medals on the final day, which took the total to 11 and beyond even the \"stretch target\" predicted by performance director Dave Collins at the start of the season, will not insulate him from further criticism. It is only one fewer than the number won by the team in Munich four years ago after Dwain Chambers' gold medal had been taken away and is, statistically, a better performance than at the corresponding championships in 1978 when the team included Sebastian Coe and Steve Ovett. But with London due to stage the Olympics in 2012, no one is going to be fooled by a medals table in which Britain lagged behind Belarus and Belgium. \"I'm wholly satisfied that we've performed to spec,\" said Collins. \"We know we're weak, but the main thing is that we've got a plan and we're moving forward. I wish people would get behind the plan and give it a chance to work. \"We deliberately gave young guys an opportunity to come here and they've performed. It's part of the plan and we're moving forward. We have to get better but it's a good start. It's nice for everyone involved in the programme because we've taken a panning over the last few days in the press.\" Collins took over the role 18 months ago with a reputation as someone who listened to other people's opinions and then did what he wanted to anyway. Much of the negative criticism in the press has been because of errors of judgment on his part, such as allowing the teenage sprinter Harry Aikines-Aryeetey to train with Justin Gatlin's coach Trevor Graham, appointing Linford Christie as a mentor, claiming 70 British athletes had missed drugs tests and introducing a system awarding marks to athletes, which upset the team. The one thing Collins can cling to is that many of the medals picked up here were won by up-and-coming youngsters who should be approaching their peak by 2012. Mo Farah is the type of athlete Collins wants to encourage. The 23-year-old, on the verge of making a breakthrough for several years, has recently dedicated himself to training at St Mary's College in Teddington with a group of Kenyans and is reaping the rewards. Farah, a Somalian war refugee who moved to Feltham at the age of nine, ran a positive race yesterday in the 5,000 metres to claim a silver medal and was only narrowly denied gold by Spain's Jes\u00fas Espa\u00f1a who battled past him over the last few metres. It was Britain's first medal in the event since Rob Denmark finished second 12 years ago. \"I wanted to win and it was close,\" said Farah. \"I gave it all I could and saw a gap. I tried but it wasn't enough. I've worked hard and it is paying off slowly - hopefully we'll be back at the top like Brendan Foster and Steve Cram.\" Similarly Sam Ellis evoked memories of Britain's glorious middle-distance heritage when he took a surprise bronze in the 800m. The 24-year-old from Barnsley coped admirably in a physical race which saw his more highly regarded team-mate Michael Rimmer badly balked and finish last. Less than half a second covered the first six with Ellis somehow finding a way through to finish third behind Holland's Bram Som, the winner in 1min 46.64sec, and Luxembourg's David Fiegen. Previous careers to have been launched by winning a bronze medal in the 800m at these championships have included Sir Roger Bannister in 1950 and Coe in 1978. \"I'm over the moon at the moment,\" said Ellis, who is coached by the same primary school teacher who introduced him to the sport as an eight-year-old. \"If the gap had opened up one metre earlier I would have got gold. In the back of my mind I didn't think I would get a medal but with a bit of positive thinking things can happen.\" Collins avoided the unwanted distinction of having overseen Britain's worst performance in the world and European championships in consecutive years along with, in June, relegation for the women from the top division of the European Cup for the second time in three years - thanks to silver medals in the women's 4x100m and the men's 4x400m. Joice Maduaka, whose lottery funding was stopped by Collins this year, anchored the women home, and Tim Benjamin, whose season has been disrupted by injury, fulfilled the same role for the men. \"I was determined to get something from the championships and not to come away empty-handed,\" said Benjamin. Nevertheless it was the first occasion Britain had not won the gold medal in the event since 1982."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
