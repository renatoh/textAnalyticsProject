They're hard to make when you've got a couple of camera-phobic DJs and some high-profile aritists who are far too big and important to show up for a shoot. This certainly proved to be the case with Gifted, by N.A.S.A., featuring Kanye West, Santigold and Lykke Li. The video, by Three Legged Legs, is great. But it looks like they've been trying to create something arty for art's sake, rather than a video that, like, actually goes with the music. Which is all well and good, of course, but not great for literalists. So I thought, as an act of charity, I would have a go at creating music inspired by the art that was inspired by the music. And so I write another song that the video-makers could use (if they wanted to, no pressure). Hello! This is me and Graham, we are going into space I've got a big round hat, and a wiggly face. We've got the tunes pumping 'cos we like a bit of bass. And we've programmed the sat-nav as it's a very big place. Now we've had a little problem, may have been a little rash Should have maybe slept last night instead of going on the lash. That was meant to be a touchdown It was meant to be a park It was supposed to be like landing \u2026 But the landing it went crash. I was feeling pretty good though, Round-hatted face was all a-glow Though my ride was all but toasted and my arse was getting roasted At least I was alive, crawling, happy to survive. Graham? Not so much. Kind of dead, in fact. (Song quickly skips to chorus of unrelated tunefulness by nearest available vocalist a la mode. No, wait, does that mean \"vocalist with ice-cream\"? Whatever.) This is me! I'm on Mars! And my hat is still quite round. And I'm feeling pretty dazed. But not dead, so that's bound To make you cheery, and happy. Though frankly the sound Of Graham's death throes offput me. So off I shall wander in a barren landscape. Bouncing. My outlook to ponder On bouncy thin legs that you'd think would be found Too weedy for a career in astronautonics, but, you know, whatever. [Actually, it should be noted at this point that the real lyrics of the song are ones about how Kanye West wears totally the best tight trousers and thinks it's completely unfair that no one gives him due deference for the invention of a) tightness, b) trousers or c) modern music as we know it. So there might be one small confluence between lyric and art there. That's it, though.] And then, with no warning, things start to look crazy A spaceship appears in the sun, it is quite hazy. Turns out there's not really spaceship, there is rocks, and what is more There are also floating shapes and flashing lights and wobbly floors And then suddenly I'm floating; over stars and shit I'm soaring; And my eyes turn into lasers and they refract off planet cores And prove to be effective treatment for what look like huge cold sores. Which is great, because I've always suffered from those. More \u2026 than is practical or attractive. No matter what round hat I wore. Still, hallucinating more Whole galaxies I explore Oh, and rather more hardcore These laser eyes create, from nowhere, a naked, buxom floating Door. In the shape of a lady. The door is in her tummy. And then it all begins to slide, when, boring of a spacey ride I walk along the boring sands of Mars, or other, when the wide Round hat of Graham can suddenly be seen. This pleases me, and to his side I start to stride, and decide though watched him die in licking flames, I run to him And find (hello!) he's still dead. So there. Now we know If someone dies, and even though you saw them die, And poked their corpse, and smelled them fry, and let them go If you later see your bro in public, looking lively, happy, spry, Just like they'd like to buy you pie \u2013 do not show interest, an ounce of anything. Keep away, fast. Fly. Because they're really dead. And may try to kill you. Why? No idea. But maybe \u2013 and this is just my experience in this song \u2013 it is because the whole hallucination is the product of some astronautritionist types in a lab playing tricks on your impressionable little mind. Because-a baby, baby, that's how we roll; And I'm lovin' your style, and you like it like that. (Sorry, I just didn't know how else to end the song.)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
