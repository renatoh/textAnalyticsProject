The British Medical Association (BMA) and British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (Bapio) said the findings were part of a wider culture of discrimination against black and minority ethnic doctors, which includes job interviews, promotion, disciplinary processes, harassment and bullying. The gap in the pay received by white and BME consultants \u2013 senior hospital doctors \u2013 emerged in research published by the British Medical Journal. Prof John Appleby, the director of research and chief economist at the Nuffield Trust thinktank, said in the study: \u201cThe mean basic pay for white consultants is 4.9% higher than for BME consultants. \u201cThis is equivalent to additional basic pay in December 2017 of \u00a3387 \u2013 or, scaled up, around \u00a34,644 a year \u2013 for white consultants.\u201d In addition, Appleby said: \u201cA more detailed breakdown shows that median basic pay for white consultants is higher than for all other ethnic groups, varying from around 3.5% higher than black/black British consultants to over 6% higher than mixed or dual heritage consultants.\u201d The gap may be partly due to white consultants generally being older, and thus better paid on the basis of their experience, than BME counterparts, Appleby said. But the differentials are so wide that they \u201cwarrant further investigation and explanation\u201d, he added. The BMA, which represents most of Britain's 250,000 doctors, voiced anger at the gap. \u201cThis BMJ study confirms that BME doctors continue to face unacceptable barriers, penalties and discrimination in the NHS. It cannot be right that in 21st-century Britain there are such wide gaps in pay between white and BME doctors in senior posts when, irrespective of their background, they hold positions to deliver the same care to patients,\u201d said Dr Chaand Nagpaul, the BMA chair. \u201cIt unfortunately comes at a time when BME doctors are continuing to suffer from other forms of discrimination, with only 7% of senior managers in the NHS coming from BME backgrounds and staff surveys showing that BME doctors feel they are at greater risk of harassment and bullying.\u201d He urged the government and NHS leaders to tackle all forms of discrimination within the health service. The Bapio went further in its criticism. \u201cThis BME pay gap further reinforces our view that there is widespread racial discrimination at all levels in the NHS,\u201d said Dr JS Bamrah, the association\u2019s chairman. He suggested some of the gap may be due to the fact that many BME consultants \u201chistorically work in unpopular specialities such as psychiatry, geriatrics, rehab medicine and so on, and mostly in rural district general hospitals where white consultants are reluctant to work\u201d. However, he added, BME consultants also feel they are discriminated against in awards of extra pay and clinical excellence awards, disciplinary matters, in job interviews and also in getting senior management jobs in the NHS. \u201cThis is yet more evidence of racial discrimination in the NHS,\u201d he said. Appleby found that for almost all other types of doctors apart from consultants, the pay gap between those of white and BME origin was small. Danny Mortimer, the chief executive of NHS Employers, which represents NHS bodies in pay negotiations, said the salary gap figures were \u201cvery concerning\u201d. \u201cIt is clear that the NHS and the medical profession must address the factors that lie behind this unwarranted and unfair divergence,\u201d he said. An ongoing government-commissioned inquiry into a major gap between male and female doctors in the NHS, which is due to report next year, should identify solutions to that problem that can also be used to close the ethnic pay gap, Mortimer added. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: \u201cThe NHS is celebrated in British society as a beacon of equality and fairness, and we are determined to see hard-working staff from all backgrounds rewarded equally and fairly \u2013 regardless of ethnicity. \u201cThe prime minister launched the race disparity audit last October for this very reason \u2013 to examine how people of different backgrounds are treated across all areas of life, and to tackle the injustices that hold people back. \u201cWe have commissioned our own data on ethnicity pay, to identify where the biggest gaps lie in the workforce, and will shortly announce robust plans to tackle these challenges head on, and as part of our long-term plan for the NHS support the workforce to progress their careers.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 6 September 2018 because an earlier version referred Dr JS Bamrah as the president of the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin. Bamrah is the chair of that organisation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
