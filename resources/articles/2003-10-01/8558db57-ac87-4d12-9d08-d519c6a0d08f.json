This scoreline was deceptive: Rovers, nervous and inadequate, were outplayed here by Charlton last night. A miserable sequence has been extended to a solitary win in 10 games, a campaign that offered real promise already hinting at incomprehensible disaster. Now they gaze up at the visitors. The Londoners - thoroughly professional, supremely impressive - awake this morning in a heady seventh position their manager Alan Curbishley presumably ever more inclined to resist any potential call from Tottenham Hotspur after a trio of league wins. In truth, this was a comfortable success. Such is the fragility gripping this anxious pocket of Lancashire these days that the chill spreading down off the Pennines appeared to have crept unnervingly into the home players' hearts by the interval. By then Charlton led courtesy of their first effort of note, Hermann Hreidarsson escaping Garry Flitcroft's attentions at Paolo di Canio's corner to thump his first goal for the Londoners beyond an exposed Brad Friedel. The fog enveloping the ground thereafter reflected the home side's mood. The grumbling began - same old Rovers, gnashed in frustration. Possession may have been monopolised, the busy Tugay and Barry Ferguson scuttling around at will, but the threat they posed from deep was only sporadic. For too long this was more about clutter than class. With both sides having sacrificed galloping width for the solidity promised by banks of central midfielders, the play was congested awkwardly into a central channel. Amid the massed bodies, most creation was duly suffocated. That much suited the patient visitors but left Rovers floundering in a dearth of inspiration. Only if the eager Steven Reid sprung from the shackles of an unaccustomed right-back berth to penetrate down the flank did Blackburn look truly comfortable, the Irishman offering a throw-back to the not-too-distant days when Damien Duff and Keith Gillespie marauded with glee. When Ferguson, on whom Graeme Souness has staked his managerial reputation, emerged from the muddle to spread play gloriously to the flank, the Irishman's cross narrowly eluded Flitcroft in the centre. Reid forced Dean Kiely to turn aside a 25-yard free-kick, battered with venom, but it was no surprise that the few other opportunities gleaned before half-time were eked out from the sidelines. What little joy they had had down the flanks should have provided Rovers with something of a fillip, with Flitcroft withdrawn at the break for Matt Jansen to provide Cole with more support. Instantly more comfortable, Rovers stirred - Tugay forcing desperate defenders to block his drive, Thompson belting over. The former Liverpool midfielder's looping header from Vratislav Gresko's cross had Kiely saving acrobatically, with the ex-Ireland international bravely blocking at Cole's feet in the ensuing frenzy. That suggested an ascendancy, though parity would certainly have been beyond the home side had Radostin Kishishev not spat a volley marginally over the bar. The chance should have served as a reminder of Charlton's potency on the break, not that Rovers appeared over-eager to heed it. Parker was soon bursting through Thompson's challenge and pummelling at goal for Friedel to tip over, with the increasingly pesky Di Canio tormenting the home side's makeshift rearguard as he loitered with menace on the half-way line."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
