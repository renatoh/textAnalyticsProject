Some key links and updates from the day: Disgraced Alabama Republican Roy Moore has announced he is running for US Senate again in 2020 after failing to win the seat two years ago amid sexual misconduct accusations. Joe Biden continued to deal with the fallout from his latest gaffe in which he discussed his cordial relationship with segregationists early in his career. Trump stopped short of escalating the worsening standoff with Iran in the Persian Gulf, suggesting that the shooting down of a US drone could have been carried out by a \u201cloose and stupid\u201d Iranian officer without authorization from Tehran. The Senate passed a bill that would stop arms sales to the Saudi government over the administration\u2019s objections. A legal team that recently interviewed more than 60 children at a Border Patrol facility in Texas said infants, children and teens have been locked up for up to 27 days without adequate food, water and sanitation. There were a number of new calls for an impeachment inquiry from Democratic members of Congress. The House Judiciary released a transcript of its interview with Hope Hicks, the former Trump confidante, revealing the repeated objections of the White House during her questioning. The National Rifle Association sued its former president, Oliver North. A federal appeals court ruled that new rules from the Trump administration restricting abortion access can take effect while a legal battle over the policy moves forward. Some politics news outside of DC: In Oregon, all 12 Republican state senators literally fled the capitol today to delay a vote on a clean energy bill. The state\u2019s Democratic governor responded by dispatching state troopers to retrieve the Republicans and get the legislative session back on track. The Guardian\u2019s Susie Cagle reports: Senate Republican leader Herman Baertschiger Jr wrote in a statement that the walk-out was \u201cexactly how we should be doing our job\u201d. In a speech on the Senate floor, a visibly frustrated Senate president Peter Courtney begged his colleagues to return. \u201cThis is the saddest day of my legislative life,\u201d he said. If passed into law, the clean energy jobs bill would place a cap on emissions from power, transportation and other industries in the state, and establish a system to auction and trade them. The program would begin in 2021, with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to 45% of 1990 carbon levels by 2035, and 20% of 1990 levels by 2050. Full story here: New rules from the Trump administration restricting abortion access can take effect while a legal battle over the policy moves forward, a federal appeals court ruled today. From AP: The rules ban taxpayer-funded clinics from making abortion referrals and prohibit clinics that receive federal money from sharing office space with abortion providers \u2014 a rule critics said would force many to find new locations, undergo expensive remodels or shut down. More than 20 states and several civil rights and health organizations challenged the rules in cases filed in Oregon, Washington and California. Judges in all three states blocked the rules from taking effect, with Oregon and Washington courts issuing nationwide injunctions. One called the new policy \u201cmadness\u201d and said it was motivated by \u201can arrogant assumption that the government is better suited to direct women\u2019s health care than their providers.\u201d Planned Parenthood said it would ask the federal appeals court to reconsider the decision, which affects Title X, a 1970 law that improved access to family planning services. Here\u2019s the response from Dr Leana Wen, president of the Planned Parenthood: Some background on the original rule here: House Republicans have released a statement on their meeting with Trump and have called for a \u201cmeasured response\u201d to Iran. They said the president and his national security team \u201cremain clear-eyed on the situation and what must be done\u201d: The backstory here: Joe Biden has called Cory Booker to \u201ctry to smooth over tensions\u201d, the New York Times reports: A Booker spokesperson said of the call with Biden: Cory shared directly what he said publicly \u2014 including helping Vice President Biden understand why the word \u2018boy\u2019 is painful to so many. Cory believes that Vice President Biden should take responsibility for what he said and apologize to those who were hurt. It appears Biden has not apologized. The controversy started when Biden spoke at a Wall Street fundraiser about \u201ccivility:\u201d and how he previously worked with segregationists in the Senate even though he disagreed with them. More on the background here: Alabama Senator Doug Jones has released a statement on the news that his previous competitor, disgraced Republican Roy Moore, is running again for Senate: Today, Roy Moore has made what was already going to be a divisive Republican primary even more polarizing and extreme. We don\u2019t need any more of that. Worse, it\u2019s now clear that my opponent will either be an extremist like Roy Moore or someone handpicked by Mitch McConnell to be his Senator, not Alabama\u2019s. The only question left is who will be McConnell\u2019s choice? I want to talk to Alabamians about solutions to improve all of our lives, address very real health care concerns, better education, strengthen our security, both militarily and economically, and help attract more businesses to our state. It comes down to solving problems, not divisive partisanship or extreme ideas that do nothing for Alabama families.\u201d The National Rifle Association\u2019s ongoing internal drama has escalated, this time with a lawsuit against the group\u2019s former president. From the AP: The National Rifle Association has sued its former president, Oliver North, for what it called \u201cconduct harmful to the NRA\u201d. The lawsuit was filed Wednesday in New York. It sought a judge\u2019s declaration that the NRA isn\u2019t required to pay North\u2019s legal bills. North stepped down from the post in April. The lawsuit said he \u201cdeparted office after a widely publicized, failed coup attempt\u201d. The suit also accused top NRA official Chris Cox of conspiring with North to oust the organization\u2019s chief executive, Wayne LaPierre. Some context on the recent NRA troubles: Some initial analysis on the Hope Hicks interview transcript \u2013 it appears the White House intervened to block her from answer questions more than 150 times: Then there was this exchange: The House Judiciary has just released a transcript of the interview with Hope Hicks, the former White House communications director and longtime Trump confidante. Read it here: Here\u2019s a look at how some Republican politicians are responding to the news that disgraced Alabama Republican Roy Moore is running again for Senate. A reminder of the sexual misconduct and abuse allegations that led him to lose the Senate race two years ago: During the 2017 race, six women accused Moore of pursuing romantic or sexual relationships with them when they were teenagers as young as 14 and he was an assistant district attorney in his 30s. Two accused him of assault or molestation. Our full story: There have been a number of new calls for an impeachment inquiry from Democratic members of Congress today: Hello - Sam Levin here in the San Francisco office, taking over our live coverage for the rest of the day. A legal team that recently interviewed more than 60 children at a Border Patrol facility in Texas has described a traumatic and dangerous situation, according to a new AP report: The lawyers said roughly 250 infants, children and teens have been locked up for up to 27 days without adequate food, water and sanitation. Some more disturbing details: A team of attorneys who recently visited the facility near El Paso told the AP that three girls, ages 10 to 15, said they had been taking turns keeping watch over a sick 2-year-old boy because there was no one else to look after him. When the lawyers saw the 2-year-old boy, he wasn\u2019t wearing a diaper and had wet his pants, and his shirt was smeared in mucus. They said at least 15 children at the facility had the flu, and some were kept in medical quarantine. Children told lawyers that they were fed uncooked frozen food or rice and had gone weeks without bathing or a clean change of clothes at the facility in Clint, in the desert scrubland some 25 miles southeast of El Paso. Holly Cooper, an attorney who represents detained youth, said: In my 22 years of doing visits with children in detention I have never heard of this level of inhumanity.\u201d Customs and Border Protection did not immediately respond to the allegations about the conditions, the AP reported. That\u2019s it for me today. Before I pass the blog to my esteemed colleague Sam Levin on the west coast, here\u2019s a quick recap of what you may have missed today. Roy Moore, the hard-right 2017 failed Senate candidate has announced he\u2019s running again in 2020- with no support to be found in the party establishment. Gaffe-prone Democratic frontrunner Joe Biden continues to deal with the fallout from his latest gaffe in which he, voluntarily, and with no prompting from anyone else, brought up his cordial relationship with segregationists early in his career. Trump seemed to downplay any retaliation with Iran for the shooting down of a US drone overnight, suggesting that it may have even been a mistake. The Senate passed a bill that would stop arms sales to the Saudi government over the administration\u2019s objections but does not currently have the votes to overcome a Trump veto, which the president has threatened. Huffington Post reporter Kevin Robillard had some interesting Democratic horserace numbers from the latest Suffolk poll. Unsurprisingly, it contains bad news for NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled on Thursday that he and his allies in the GOP establishment will actively work to oppose Roy Moore\u2019s bid for Alabama\u2019s Senate seat. \u201cHe can do what he wants to, but we\u2019re certainly going to oppose him in every way,\u201d McConnell told the Associated Press shortly before Moore\u2019s announcement. Donald Trump Jr also jumped into the fray, by implying that Moore had jumped into the race contrary to the president\u2019s wishes. Federal prosecutors say that former Trump confidant and current federal defendant Roger Stone violated a gag order with recent social media posts, according to multiple reports. In January the longtime GOP operative was charged with witness tampering, obstructing an official proceeding, and five counts of making false statements. He is currently awaiting trial. Cory Booker announced Thursday, that if elected president he would \u201cimmediately\u201d start the clemency process for some 17,000 federal inmates serving time on drug-related charges. Booker would essentially be using executive power to do what the First Step act, passed last year, declined to do - make sentencing reform retroactive so it applies both to people currently in jail and future criminal defendants. In the last day, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have both come out and offered some level of support for the decriminalization of sex work, reports Vice: Less than 24 hours after Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren said she would be \u201copen\u201d to decriminalizing sex work, the Bernie Sanders campaign told VICE the candidate believes it\u2019s a policy that \u201cshould be considered.\u201d \u201cBernie believes that decriminalization is certainly something that should be considered,\u201d Deputy Communications Director Sarah Ford said in an email Thursday morning. \u201cOther countries have done this and it has shown to make the lives of sex workers safer.\u201d Warren said Wednesday that: I\u2019m open to decriminalization. Sex workers, like all workers, deserve autonomy but they are particularly vulnerable to physical and financial abuse and hardship,\u201d Warren said. \u201cWe need to make sure that we don\u2019t undermine legal protections for the most vulnerable, including the millions of individuals who are victims of human trafficking each year.\u201d Alabama Roy Moore has made his candidacy for the 2020 Senate seat in that state official, announcing moments ago. \u201cYes, I will run for the United States Senate in 2020,\u201d Moore said. \u201cCan I win? Yes, I can win.\u201d His opening remarks make it clear he intends to run as an outsider from his own party, which largely abandoned him after the allegations that dogged his 2017 candidacy emerged. Moore is also blaming the NRSC for Donald Trump\u2019s opposition to his candidacy, reports the Montgomery Advertiser\u2019s Brian Lyman. \u201cI think he\u2019s being pushed by the NRSC. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019s thinking. I can\u2019t speak for him. But I can say I don\u2019t disagree with him in lots of his policies,\u201d Moore said. California Senator and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris penned an op-ed for NBC News Thursday asking Americans generally, and Donald Trump specifically, to watch Ava DuVernay\u2019s new Netflix series on the Central Park Five. The plea comes just a few days after Trump told reporters that he would not apologize to the five Black men he demonized in 1989 after they were accused of a violent rape they did not commit. Trump infamously took out full-page ads in four New York newspapers advocating that the state reinstate capital punishment so that it could execute the boys, who were coerced into admitting their guilt. The five were exonerated in 2002 after another man admitted to committing the crime and DNA evidence corroborated his account. Harris, a former prosecutor writes: DuVernay\u2019s retelling of the case is a masterpiece. Her four-part series tells the stories of Korey Wise, Raymond Santana, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson and Yusef Salaam. In 1989, these five young boys were wrongfully accused of brutally raping a jogger in Central Park. The series chronicles their unjust detainment, illegal interrogation and the dismissal of evidence that pointed to their innocence, further highlighting the flaws in a system that is supposed to be rooted in truth and justice. Systemic biases and racism cost these boys their childhood. Sensationalized media coverage \u2014 including a 1989 full-page ad placed by Trump \u2014 made it almost impossible for them to be treated fairly. And the trial also exposed the dehumanization of Black children and life-threatening consequences \u2014 things that still occur today. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff wants to make it \u201ccrystal clear\u201d that accepting help or \u201cdirt\u201d from a foreign agent is illegal with a new bill proposal. This is something Donald Trump has repeatedly said, most recently in an interview with ABC News, that he would do. A number of high profile celebrities joined together for a video editorial that describes the Mueller report as \u201cthe most damming evidence ever compiled against a sitting US president.\u201d The video, released by Now This News also excoriated AG William Barr for having \u201clie[d] about its contents\u201d and Trump for echoing that \u201cpropaganda.\u201d The stars include: Robert De Niro Martin Sheen Christine Lahti Laurence Fishburne Stephen King Sophia Bush Jonathan Van Ness Rob Reiner George Takei Rosie Perez Kendrick Sampson The Wall Street Journal is reporting that President Trump plans to issue an executive order on Monday to compel the disclosure of prices in health care. According to people familiar with the matter, the order will direct federal agencies to initiate regulations and guidance that could require insurers, doctors, hospitals and others in the industry to provide information about the negotiated and often discounted cost of care. According to the Journal, Advocates say that consumers and employers \u201cwill benefit because pulling back the secrecy around the prices will allow them to shop for lower cost care and benefits.\u201d Industry groups including hospitals and insurers have balked at the idea however, saying \u201cit could cause costs to climb if some businesses learn competitors are getting bigger discounts. They also say consumers really want to know their own out-of-pocket costs and won\u2019t benefit from full disclosure of negotiated prices.\u201d Apple is asking the US government to exclude its products\u2014including the ubiquitous iPhone\u2014 from President Trump\u2019s next round of proposed tariffs on Chinese imports. The Hill reports that in a letter made public on Thursday, \u201cthe tech giant wrote that the tariffs could give an advantage to Apple\u2019s Chinese competitors as well as reduce Apple\u2019s contributions to the US economy.\u201d \u201cU.S. tariffs would also weigh on Apple\u2019s global competitiveness,\u201d Apple wrote to US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer. \u201cThe Chinese producers we compete with in global markets do not have a significant presence in the U.S. market, and so would not be impacted by U.S. tariffs. Neither would our other major non-U.S. competitors.\u201d A US tariff would, therefore, tilt the playing field in favor of our global competitors.\u201d -Apple Politico is reporting that longtime former Trump confidante Hope Hicks broke with President Donald Trump during her interview with the House Judiciary Committee this week, telling lawmakers that offers of foreign assistance in U.S. elections should be \u201crejected and reported to the FBI.\u201d That disclosure comes courtesy of house judiciary chairman Jerry Nadler. The remarks from Hicks stand in contrast to Trump\u2019s statement on ABC news last week about what he would do if a foreign power came to him with opposition research on a political opponent. Trump: I think you might want to listen, there isn\u2019t anything wrong with listening... If somebody called from a country, Norway, [and said] \u2018we have information on your opponent\u2019 -- oh, I think I\u2019d want to hear it.\u201d From Politico: \u201cHicks, sat for nearly eight hours behind closed doors with the committee on Wednesday and fielded questions on several subjects related to her tenure as a senior aide on the Trump campaign, the presidential transition period, and in the White House as communications director.\u201d Alabama Republican Roy Moore, whose unsuccessful 2017 campaign for US Senate was marred by allegations he sexually assaulted or pursued teenage girls while in his 30s, is going to try again. The Democratic candidate, Doug Jones, a former federal prosecutor, defeated Moore by a narrow margin in a special election in December 2017 to fill the seat vacated by Republican Jeff Sessions when he became US attorney general. Jones was the first Democrat in a quarter-century to be elected to the US Senate in Alabama. Moore, a 72-year-old former state chief judge known for staunchly conservative views, could face Jones again if he wins the party primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders hold narrow leads in a theoretical showdown with President Trump in North Carolina ahead of the 2020 presidential race, according to a new Public Policy Polling survey released Thursday. From The Hill: Forty-nine percent of registered voters surveyed said they would back Biden in a match-up against Trump, while 46 percent said they would support the president. Five percent, meanwhile, said they are unsure who they\u2019d back. In a match-up against Sanders, 48 percent of North Carolina voters said they\u2019d back the Vermont senator, compared with 47 percent who said they would vote for Trump; 5 percent said they were unsure of their pick. No other candidate leads Trump in the poll. From Associated Press reporter Jill Colvin: I asked Trump today whether he believes there are members of his administration who are trying to push him into conflict w Iran. His response? \u201cNo, not at all. Not at all. In fact, in many cases, it\u2019s the opposite.\u201d Then talked about campaigning on getting out of endless wars. The Washington Post is reporting that the Senate passed measures to block President Trump from using his emergency authority to complete several arms sales benefiting Saudi Arabia on Thursday. From the Post: A bipartisan group of senators, led by Senator\u2019s Robert Menendez (D-NJ) and Trump booster Lindsey Graham (R-SC), had initially filed 22 resolutions of disapproval against the sales \u2014 one for every contract the administration had expedited by emergency order, effectively sidestepping congressional opposition. But after weeks of negotiations, Senate leaders agreed to hold just three votes, which will encompass the substance of all the blocking resolutions, congressional aides said. The Trump administration sent a letter to the Senate Thursday to let lawmakers know that if the bill made it to Trump\u2019s desk, \u201chis advisors would recommend he veto it.\u201d Trump has cited rising tensions with Iran as justification for using his emergency powers to complete the deals. The Post continued: Republican leaders have repeatedly stated their opposition to the effort and support for the president, making the prospect of securing 67 votes for the resolutions \u2014 a veto-proof majority \u2014 difficult. Once the Senate completes its votes, the resolutions will go to the House, where Democratic leaders have been waiting to see whether the Senate would have any difficulty passing the resolutions before taking their own steps to block Trump\u2019s actions. Meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Trump seems to be striking a conciliatory tone on Iran- suggesting that the shooting down of a US drone may even have been accidental. \u201cI find it hard to believe it was intentional,\u201d Trump said. Trump added: \u201cI imagine someone made a mistake...in shooting down the drone. We didn\u2019t have a man or woman in the drone. It would have made a big, big difference.\u201d But the remarks weren\u2019t without bluster either. Donald Trump continues to conduct foreign diplomacy like the reality TV star he is, essentially encouraging the global citizenry to \u201cstay tuned for next week\u201d when asked if he will authorize a strike against Iran amid growing tensions. The comment follows a tweet earlier in the day in which Trump, again opaquely, suggested \u201cIran made a very big mistake!\u201d in response to word that the nation had shot down a US drone. Nancy Pelosi calls the Trump administration\u2019s eight-year delay of a new $20 US banknote honoring abolitionist Harriet Tubman \u201can insult to the hopes of millions.\u201d \u201cThis unnecessary decision must be reversed,\u201d Pelosi continued in a Tweet. The Treasury Department was expected to release the updated bill in 2020, but announced last month that the project would be postponed for at least eight years. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin implausibly cited \u201ccounterfeiting issues,\u201d as the reason for the delay. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday called for an investigation into Mnuchin\u2019s decision. A group of four high-profile Democratic lawmakers, including presidential candidate Kamala Harris, have introduced legislation to Protect the US Justice Department from that they call \u201cWhite House meddling\u201d. Senators Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Richard Blumenthal (D-CT), and Kamala Harris (D-CA) and Congressman Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) introduced the Security from Political Interference in Justice Act in what they describe as a bid \u201cto increase transparency in the relationship between the U.S. Department of Justice and the White House and prevent political interference in law enforcement decisions.\u201d The lawmakers go on in a release to say that \u201cThe bill would impose important reporting requirements for contacts between the Justice Department and White House pertaining to specific cases or investigations.\u201d Never before have we seen a president so heedless of the Department\u2019s traditions and spirit, and so singularly focused on his own political and personal self-interest at the expense of justice. This bill would protect the Department against the likes of Donald Trump by shining a much-needed light on the channels that have enabled political influence to flow into the Department.\u201d -Senator Sheldon Whitehouse Biden calls the developments in Iran a \u201cself-inflicted disaster\u201d by the Trump administration. Speaking to reporters Thursday morning, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the US has no appetite to go to war with Iran, after Tehran shot down a U.S. military surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz. Pelosi said that a group of 20 lawmakers was preparing to receive a briefing on the \u201cdangerous situation\u201d in Iran shortly thereafter. The top House Democrat also weighed in on Joe Biden\u2019s very bad 48 hours Thursday, saying she had \u201cno criticism\u201d of his remarks. I have no criticism of what he believes is his story to tell the American people, that he will work with anyone to get a good result for the American people.\u201d -Nancy Pelosi \u201cWhat I think is most important for all the candidates is authenticity, they are who they are, they\u2019ve lived a life and they have grown from their experiences, and I think that\u2019s what he\u2019s trying to tell us,\u201d Pelosi told MSNBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell. Democratic candidates Cory Booker and Joe Biden continue to snip back and forth over Biden\u2019s now widely-panned remarks about working with segregationists. Booker chimed in with a third volley last night on CNN. What matters to me is that a guy running to be the head of our party, which is a significantly diverse and wondrous party, doesn\u2019t even understand and can\u2019t even acknowledge that he made a mistake, whether the intention was there or not,\u201d Booker said. \u201cInstead, he\u2019s fallen back into the defensive crouch that often people say, which is \u2018Cory called me a racist\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m not a racist,\u2019 which is not what I said, and not what I\u2019m calling him.\u201d \u201cThis is the problem. He knows better,\u201d he continued. \u201cAt a time when Donald Trump never apologizes for anything and starts to create that toxic sentiment that you never apologize ... I know Joe Biden. He\u2019s better than this.\u201d The controversy began after comments Biden made at a Wall Street fundraiser at New York\u2019s Carlyle Hotel on Monday, intended to highlight his ability to work across diverse viewpoints to get things done. Biden cited segregationists James Eastland of Mississippi and Herman E Talmadge of Georgia, as two senators with whom he disagreed, but still worked with and \u201cgot things done\u201d. I was in a caucus with James O Eastland,\u201d Biden told guests of the event, briefly imitating the senator\u2019s southern drawl, according to the press pool report. \u201cHe never called me \u2018boy\u2019, he always called me \u2018son\u2019,\u201d he said. He went on to describe Talmadge as \u201cone of the meanest guys\u201d he ever knew but said, \u201cAt least there was some civility. We got things done.\u201d Both senators are remembered for their racist views. Booker chimed in initially: \u201cBiden\u2019s relationships with proud segregationists are not the model for how we make America a safer and more inclusive place for black people, and for everyone.\u201d He also called for the former vice-president to issue \u201can immediate apology\u201d. Biden seemed to take the remarks personally, responding to Booker: \u201cCory should apologize...He knows better. There\u2019s not a racist bone in my body. I\u2019ve been involved in civil rights my whole career. Period,\u201d prompting Booker\u2019s second response on CNN last night. The entire kerfuffle came as Black Americans celebrate the emancipation holiday known as Juneteenth, and as lawmakers on the hill held hearings on reparations for the descendants of US slavery and segregation. Ranking House Judiciary member Doug Collins blasted today\u2019s Mueller report hearing in a statement accusing Democrats of \u201ctheater\u201d and trying to \u201credo\u201d the Mueller report. I\u2019m concerned the majority\u2019s witnesses may not be here to discuss Volume II, or to offer \u201cbipartisan perspectives.\u201d I am glad we are allegedly focusing on election security today, but I urge the majority to stop trying to re-do the Mueller investigation and hold a hearing promptly on election security. We don\u2019t need theater. We don\u2019t need John Dean, Part Two. As to the substance, I\u2019d like to remind everyone: Democrats spent two years claiming the president was a Russian asset who conspired with the Kremlin to steal the election. The special counsel spent two years investigating whether the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with Russia. Well, the special counsel finished his investigation and found no Americans, no one on the Trump campaign, conspired or coordinated with Russians. That was great news for America. I thought it would be great news to all Americans. To my surprise, it wasn\u2019t. Democrats were not only disappointed, they were angry. Angry the president was not a Russian asset. Imagine disliking a president so much you wished he were a foreign agent. That\u2019s where Democrats are today. Despite the Mueller report\u2019s conclusion there was no conspiracy, Democrats have spent the past few months trying desperately to revive their Russia conspiracy theory. Democrats spent two years calling Mueller\u2019s team the best of the best, but, since they didn\u2019t like the outcome, Democrats now want to play prosecutor and re-do Mueller\u2019s investigation. Ivanka Trump was accused on Thursday of violating the Hatch Act that bans government workers from speaking out on political campaign issues, over tweets she wrote ahead of her father\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign launch. Influential Washington-based watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew) has filed a complaint against Donald Trump\u2019s daughter and senior aide, who works in the White House as his adviser, albeit unsalaried. She is accused of violating the rule that limits political activity by federal employees. In a letter to the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), part of the Department of Justice, Crew said her tweet, posted on Father\u2019s Day last weekend, just a few days before Trump\u2019s re-election campaign launch in Florida, included his 2016 campaign slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d and claimed \u201cthe best is yet to come\u201d. The complaint comes just a week after the OSC, a US federal watchdog, called on the president to sack Trump Aide Kellyanne Conway over multiple violations of the Hatch Act. Iran has shot down an US drone in the strait of Hormuz, accusing Washington of breaching Iran\u2019s national sovereignty and trying to deepen tensions in the region. Iran\u2019s Revolutionary Guards said on Thursday that they had used a surface to air missile to shoot down what they called a US \u201cspy\u201d drone they claimed was flying in the country\u2019s airspace. US Central Command confirmed that one of its unmanned aircraft had been taken down, but said it was in international airspace. A CentCom spokesman, Capt Bill Urban said it was a US navy Global Hawk surveillance drone, which had been downed by an Iranian surface-to-air missile over the Strait of Hormuz at 11.35pm GMT. \u201cIranian reports that the aircraft was over Iran are false. This was an unprovoked attack on a U.S. surveillance asset in international airspace,\u201d Urban said. Read more In space news, The Navy briefed three senators Wednesday on a number of reported encounters with unidentified aircraft amid growing requests from members of oversight committees. The Hill reports that Virginia Senator Mark Warner\u2019s office confirmed the meeting. \u201cIf pilots at Oceana or elsewhere are reporting flight hazards that interfere with training or put them at risk, then Senator Warner wants answers.
