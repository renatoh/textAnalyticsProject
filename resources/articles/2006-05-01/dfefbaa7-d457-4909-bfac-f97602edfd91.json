A strong rise in prices in May across the capital of 1.2% is likely to be the last until at least the new year after a wobbly week in the stock market and increasing fears of interest rate rises, according to a survey by Hometrack, the housing data provider. Demand is expected to wane, bringing to an end a period of relative buoyancy in sales and prices. The national picture is less clear, with an average rise in prices of 0.6% in May disguising large variations around the country. Hometrack said the growing divide between London and the rest of the country meant it was dangerous to read too much into the headline rate of growth. Richard Donnell, the company's director of research, said: \"The London effect has been flattering the overall picture of a relatively buoyant housing market. \"The reality is that house price growth remains limited across large parts of the country,\" he said. \"This latest survey shows that outside London house prices remained static across two-thirds of all postcode areas.\" He said the prospects for the second half of the year were less rosy in London, though a continued mismatch between supply and demand would prevent any fall in prices. \"The extent of house price growth across the capital is starting to turn down. Turmoil in the equity markets and talk of possible interest rates rises are likely to impact on buyer confidence in the months ahead whilst the World Cup will impact on activity levels over the summer. With affordability levels already stretched, we are likely to see much slower house price growth over the second half of the year. We expect average house prices to rise by just 3% over the whole of 2006.\" The May figures follow a bullish survey from Halifax and the property website Rightmove, which said house prices increased by 2% last month, pushing up the price of the average British home by \u00a34,150 to nearly \u00a3210,000. The companies agreed that property shortages outweighed the effect of affordability constraints. By contrast, Nationwide, which uses a different method for assessing the strength of the housing market, reported that house prices increased by only 0.1% in April. Hometrack's survey for this month showed that house prices rose across 38% of the country with values falling in only 2% of postcodes. Prices increased by 1.2% in London over May and by 0.6% in the south-east and 0.5% in East Anglia. Values remained unchanged in the east Midlands and grew by 0.1% in three regions (Yorkshire and Humberside, the north and the north-west)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
