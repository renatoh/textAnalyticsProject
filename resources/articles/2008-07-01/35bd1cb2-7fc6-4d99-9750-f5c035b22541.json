They weren't quite a folk band, although they included two of the folk world's acoustic guitar heroes, Bert Jansch and John Renbourn. They weren't a jazz band, despite their lengthy improvisations and distinguished jazz rhythm section of Danny Thompson and Terry Cox. They were a classy 1960s curiosity, praised by John Peel and unexpectedly popular with US rock audiences. Now the original lineup are on their first UK tour in 35 years, and on stage at Festival Hall 40 years to the day since they recorded the Sweet Child album here. It was an emotional, at times nervous, evening that was far more than an exercise in nostalgia, both because they are now even finer musicians than before, and because their sophisticated, quirky fusions sound as in tune with the current acoustic scene as with the more chaotic hippy era. But Pentangle are still unpredictable. They ambled on with singer Jacqui McShee, who was clearly suffering stage fright. The opening The Time Has Come and \"our hit\" Light Flight were a disaster, but she rediscovered her cool, unworldly style for the drifting Mirage. The rest of the band sounded as if they had never stopped working together, from the slick interplay between Jansch and Renbourn, even when they swapped guitars for banjo and bluesy sitar, to the edgy duet between McShee and Jansch on the traditional Bruton Town. Even Appalachian songs like Wedding Dress sounded fresh, and the finale of Will the Circle Be Unbroken was an exercise in gently rousing gospel.
