For the longer Nottingham Forest continue to produce such exhilarating displays the more likely that Hart will be a Premiership manager next season with his current employers. And while it may only be a matter of time until Leeds make an approach to their former youth academy director, they may be surprised to find their overtures rejected - as Forest certainly appear to have the brighter future. With such a burgeoning young squad at his disposal, that could almost bring comparisons to a certain Yorkshire club a decade ago, it would surely be a backwards step for Hart to dive into the chaos at Leeds. Typically, Hart kept his cards close to his chest when asked about the constant speculation linking him with his former club. \"It is just speculation as far as I'm concerned,\" he said. \"I've no need to speak to my directors and it hasn't been brought up - and nor will it. All I want is to talk about Nottingham Forest. \"I'm only 18 months into a five-year contract and the Leeds connection is nothing to do with me. I'm the manager of Forest and I'm here to hopefully take them up.\" The chances of Hart achieving that goal took another huge step forward here with a classy performance that almost cer tainly ended Norwich's own play-off aspirations. With Forest's devastating attacking triad of Darren Huckerby, David Johnson and Marlon Harewood in rampant mood, Norwich were ripped apart time and time again with a spineless display that manager Nigel Worthington described as \"disgusting\". Huckerby kick-started the rout in the 11th minute and Harewood nodded in his 19th goal of the season shortly afterwards. Norwich attempted to make a game of it early in the second half but their resistance only irritated the home side. Gareth Williams and Jim Brennan confirmed Forest's superiority with second-half strikes to enhance their promotion prospects - and the reputation of their manager even further.
