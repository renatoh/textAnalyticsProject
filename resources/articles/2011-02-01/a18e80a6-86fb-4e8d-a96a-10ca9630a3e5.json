Be it nutty hippy Titania, pious virgin Isabella or pantomime villainess Lady Macbeth, these heroines \u2013 tragic and otherwise \u2013 displayed grace, gumption and fatal flaws aplenty. It is appropriate, then, that the Globe theatre, where these vivid characters first drew breath, is now set to host the world premiere of a play based on Jade Goody, whose reality show-driven life and all too real death encapsulate a thoroughly modern exegesis of both tragedy and heroism. The God of Soho, by the playwright Chris Hannan, explores contemporary society's obsession with celebrity and takes as inspiration the brief but bright burning of the Big Brother star, who died in 2009 at the age of 27 from cervical cancer. \"The contemporary equivalent of the kings and queens and dukes that Shakespeare puts on stage are these stars,\" said Hannan, announcing the project on Friday. \"We call them our gods and goddesses.\" While there are plenty who might balk at the image of Goody tottering down from Mount Olympus to her native Bermondsey, dolled up like a pre-cancer, post-weight-loss photoshoot for Heat magazine, she still exemplifies the way that those who willingly live out their lives in public can become unintentional vehicles for a host of public anxieties. Her initial vilification as a charmless chav, who insisted that \"east Angular\" was a country, exposed a mean-minded seam of snobbery. Goody's own playground bullying of the Bollywood actress Shilpa Shetty on Celebrity Big Brother prompted much soul-searching about Britain's tolerance of casual racism. She was at once dismissed and over-analysed as \"famous for being famous\", a manufactured creature whose only talent was relentless self-exposure, the dismal product of a country in thrall to the cult of celebrity. Goody's tale likewise refracts the way that the celebrity stratum fits into a class system that remains rigidly stratified. The wealth and social prominence of our new celebrity class may have, on one level, fooled the public into accepting inequality thanks to the trope that we ought all to be able to achieve our heart's desire if only we want it badly enough, work hard enough, and Got Talent. Yet the sneers behind the feting of the latest Wag wedding tell quite a different story. But it was Goody's consciously executed desire to \"die in the public eye\" that brought her redemption. However ambivalent one felt about the relentlessly documented tears, tantrums and terminality, it is unarguable that she prompted many to take action that may prolong their lives, with demand for smear tests among younger women increasing substantially following her diagnosis. Moreover, in a society where few established rituals linger for dealing with death and grief, she was unashamed in showing that illness is as much about weeping in public and grand sentimental gestures as it is about quiet dignity behind closed doors. In her final incarnation, Goody was less contemporary goddess than end-of-the-pier Everywoman. Her fatal flaw, the belief that there was no boundary between public interest and private tragedy, became her saving grace. A play based on this modern parable may lack the grandeur of The Winter's Tale, but the impulse to narrate our world remains the same. We tell ourselves stories to make sense of the complexities of the times we live in. We demand a neat narrative arc, moral clarity, and \u2013 occasionally \u2013 the comfort of a happy ending. Though it should be noted that, in Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare was one of the first playwrights to treat romance as a worthy subject for tragedy. Sometimes an ending is all we are granted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
