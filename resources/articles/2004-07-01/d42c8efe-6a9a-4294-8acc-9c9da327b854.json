With the overall spending totals already set to 2007-08, and the hungry lions of health and education allocated their share of the kill, there were few surprises ... \"But the most important question marks over Mr Brown's plans were unaltered. First, will the economy deliver the growth and tax revenue to fund the spending plans without raising taxes in the future? ... Second, will public service job cuts - updated [on Monday] to a strangely precise 84,150 ... civil service posts - and efficiency gains deliver the increase in output necessary to turn cash into delivery?\" Daily Mirror Editorial, July 13 \"If everything Mr Brown promised comes true, this is going to be a far better country ... But there is always a price to pay. Mr Brown's plan is to find billions extra from civil service job cuts, curbing government contracts and selling state assets ... [But each] job lost means someone without work - and if they are frontline jobs, services will get worse. Selling government assets ... could be another instalment of flogging off the nation's crown jewels.\" Philip Johnston Daily Telegraph, July 13 \"Understandably, there are many public servants who are today feeling decidedly uncomfortable ... But they should comfort themselves with one thought: the civil service has been here before and has proved remarkably resilient at defending its turf from the incursions of successive governments ... \"Mr Brown, relying upon a report from Sir Peter Gershon, wants to cut one sixth of the civil service ... As the ... report acknowledged, while there is potential for up to 70,000 net reductions in central government jobs, 'this is in the context of a planned growth in the public sector of 360,000 between 2003 and 2006'. That is on top of the 344,000 already created since Labour took office ... In this context, a cut of 70,000 jobs ... will seem like a drop in the ocean.\" Anatole Kaletsky Times, July 13 \"Let me begin with good news ... First, the chancellor did not 'get his sums wrong'... Second [if the] plans are fulfilled, the government's share of gross domestic product will remain roughly stable ... Third, there was nothing in his announcements implying an inflationary increase in public borrowing or a swingeing increase in tax ... Fourth, it is not true that Mr Brown's largesse has so far been largely wasted on inefficiency and rising wages ... \"Now for the bad news ... The big question ... is whether hugely increased resources which will have been channelled into the public sector ... can deliver the big improvements in social services which voters feel entitled to expect ... History suggests that without wide-ranging administrative reforms, based on the introduction of competition, the public will in the end be disappointed by public services, however much money is spent.\" Trevor Kavanagh Sun, July 13 \"It would have been an impressive start for a new government bent on tackling a bloated and inefficient civil service. But this was a chancellor who has been in office for seven years and vowed at the outset not to spend a penny without reform. \"Meanwhile, we have seen this government squander \u00a315bn on a rail system that still doesn't work. It scrapped NHS reforms inherited from the Tories, only to reinstate them ... There are good reasons for doubting whether the changes of heart will bear fruit. We won't know if the changes are pie in the sky until after the next election.\" Peter Oborne Daily Mail, July 13 \"It is far from absurd to suggest that Mr Brown's seven years at the Treasury will go down in history ... Throughout [that time] domestic policy has belonged to Mr Brown, with Tony Blair an impotent, uneasy and often baffled spectator. [On Monday], too, the prime minister looked on queasily as his former friend and bitter rival extended his reach over every department of public life ... He demonstrated the astonishing extent of his reach and power ... \"After [Monday's] mes meric, panoramic and audacious command performance, the question rings out louder than ever: what is Tony Blair for?\" Steve Richards Independent, July 13 \"What was different about [Monday's] statement was the noisy din that preceded it. Behind the scenes over the weekend, Blairites were attacking Brownites who were assiduously mounting counter-attacks on Blairites ... This government has ceased to be sensible ... When [it] had few substantial policies to implement early in the first term, it was ruthlessly brilliant at presenting them in the media. Now it is following a more substantial agenda, the internal feuding threatens to divert attention from the policies ... \"[But] the plotters get away with it because ... in policy terms, the government holds most of the cards as Mr Brown demonstrated [on Monday]. The chancellor's most significant achievement has been to find substantial increases in cash for the public services without damaging the economy. The combination gives the Conservatives little political space.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
