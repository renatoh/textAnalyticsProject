The leaders had leant heavily on Diego Costa\u2019s initial splurge of goals, or Cesc F\u00e0bregas\u2019s authority and precision in possession, in establishing their advantage at the summit. Now, though, others in their number are rousing themselves. Aston Villa suffered at that pair\u2019s hands on Saturday, but they were dissected just as emphatically by the eager running of Willian and Oscar\u2019s slippery movement and menace. That pair have laboured at times since returning from the World Cup \u2013 Brazilians who had been sustained by the prolonged adrenaline rush of a tournament on home soil that had promised so much, only to end in deflation and no little humiliation in its cruel final week. There has been a hangover of sorts ever since. The last week suggests the fog is finally lifting. The industrious Oscar followed up his winning goal in midweek against Bolton in the Capital One Cup with a smartly taken opener here, supplied by his compatriot who would go on to cap a comfortable success by prodding in a third from Aly Cissokho\u2019s unwitting assist late on. Oscar painted a glowing picture of his personal state of mind post-match. \u201cI have had time [to readjust],\u201d he said. \u201cMourinho told me that he has a lot of players, so I didn\u2019t play against Manchester City, or Schalke at the start. But I started against Bolton and here, and I played well because I am not tired and am in good condition. I have forgotten the World Cup.\u201d That admission hinted at the psychological effects of that 7-1 mauling by Germany in Belo Horizonte, when a nation\u2019s aspirations were so brutally trodden underfoot. Mourinho is unconvinced. \u201cWe\u2019ve not spoken about the World Cup, and some of the players even make fun of each other about it,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody was really affected like that. It\u2019s physical. Players need holidays, a proper pre-season, and they haven\u2019t had them. Willian didn\u2019t start the season well. Oscar is the same. But now they are getting into the intensity of the game again.\u201d The Chelsea manager foresees arguably worse problems next summer, when there are European Championship qualifiers in June and the Copa Am\u00e9rica scheduled until early July. \u201cFor a World Cup some teams don\u2019t qualify but, for those international fixtures, every player has to go with his national team,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are going to have two weeks\u2019 pre-season. I don\u2019t even speak about the Copa Am\u00e9rica. I\u2019m trying to forget that. If not I sell all the South American players ...\u201d That was said with a smile. This team is thriving around its Latin contingent with the domestic momentum all theirs going into next Sunday\u2019s derby against Arsenal. Chelsea have a tricky contest at Sporting Lisbon before then with Costa, whose header secured an eighth goal in his first six Premier League games, to be assessed in training at Cobham on Monday prior to departure. The state of his left hamstring remains a concern, but it would constitute a surprise if did not travel to Portugal. \u201cThe difference between last season and this is that we have Diego, and Diego is scoring goals,\u201d said Oscar as the striker strode past him in the tunnel post-match. \u201cSo many of them. I have scored two, but I want to score 15 this season.\u201d Villa, so impressive in those early weeks of term, lacked bite of their own on Saturday with Gabriel Agbonlahor isolated and well shackled, and no Christian Benteke or Libor Kozak to lead their line. The Belgian, absent since March with a ruptured Achilles tendon, could play a behind-closed-doors friendly this week and might even be on the bench against City on Saturday. \u201cHe has been training for a couple of weeks and, thankfully, there has been no reaction,\u201d \u201cHe is not too far away,\u201d said Villa manager Paul Lambert. \u201cEveryone in the team will be grateful when he is back and with what he hands us is an attacking force. We\u2019ll see how he feels. \u201cHe\u2019s one of the best No9s I\u2019ve seen, even as a player, and I played with no slouches: three of the best strikers in the world at one time in Karl-Heinz Riedle, St\u00e9phane Chapuisat [at Borussia Dortmund] and Henrik Larsson [at Celtic]. They weren\u2019t bad.\u201d Benteke\u2019s return should soothe some of the pain of successive defeats.
