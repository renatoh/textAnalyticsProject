This means there is a temptation to exaggerate and at times this story has been overblown. Contrary to TV news reports the army are not going to go in and murder every hedgehog on Dartmoor. But there is still a story that the townies don't see. It's one of country girls separated from boyfriends, shepherds watching hungry sheep stripping grass by the roots and broken men facing financial ruin. Here in a country house in the Midlands, I can drive to the village shop, but not walk through the fields. Our own farmland is entirely arable and we don't have stock to worry about. But some of our neighbours do. The usual footpath crosses near a field of sheep and a few miles down the road they are already burning the carcasses that were once the pride and joy of another local farmer. The long wall of white smoke is a grim reminder of what could happen to our neighbour's sheep, or to my brother-in-law's herd of organic longhorns simply if someone who had walked near an infected animal then took a footpath near their stock. Some members of the public have actually insisted on walking closed footpaths and been heard saying that they hate farmers and hope their animals all get foot and mouth. But for the most part people are kind, decent and keen to avoid being responsible for such a thing. It appears that the result is that those who live in the big towns and cities have decided to keep away from the countryside altogether. However, if townsfolk have erred on the side of caution so too have many country people themselves. Some of our local farmers are not sending their children to school. One farmer's widow has forestalled having a memorial service for her husband fearing his friends wouldn't be able to come. Richard, a stock and dairy farmer, saw my husband last night to discuss what the hunt should now do about fallen stock, that is found dead (leave it well alone). His attitude? \"You can socialise if you wash, change your clothes and shoes whenever you go out and don't visit other farms.\" There is a feeling that farmers must be seen to do their bit even if that bit isn't strictly necessary. Ann, a local dairy farmer's wife, tells me that she has stopped exercising her horse on the road: \"I'm conscious of the sacrifice the public are making in keeping off footpaths and although I don't think he'd spread anything I do think people would find it strange, so I lead him round his paddock instead.\" Ann's daughters haven't seen their boyfriends almost since the outbreak. One is imprisoned on an infected farm, while the other isn't allowed to visit. \"You can imagine what the girls are like,\" she says. Business is affected too. Her husband sublets fields in the winter for sheep keep. The animals are usually taken away in February, but this year they must stay put. The shepherd is out all hours lambing them. He puts down hay to compensate for the disappearing grass, but they are now pulling what is left up by the roots. If the sheep leave soon the field will be ploughed. If not it will be too late and the field will be useless for the rest of the year, but the lorry is still coming to collect the milk so Ann does not despair. Despair would come only with the arrival of the foot and mouth itself. \"We wouldn't be able to restock for six months and this business couldn't survive that long. I expect younger people would start up again but we wouldn't,\" she says in a bright tone of voice. As tenants they would lose their home. But it's best to keep cheerful, I expect. As every day passes the little problems mount up. Many farmers don't keep bulls for their dairy cows. Ann and her husband have just one. \"He's very young and he can hardly reach the cows,\" she laughs. \"He's exhausted.\" Meanwhile stock farmers like Richard and my brother-in-law have to contend with a post-BSE rule that cattle must be slaughtered before they are 30 months old. As good quality animals that produce good beef are raised slowly on grass, good farmers keep their animals until the last possible moment. That means there are now a lot of animals over 30 months old who cannot be used for meat, but must be incinerated, their value lost. Should any of this mean a closed countryside or cancelled elections? It seems ridiculous that a 21st-century state can be badly affected by a cattle plague, with doomy pronouncements that it has \"gone airborne\". However, despite the grim reality of the burning pyres, we are all still doing our shopping, watching television, carrying on with our lives."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
