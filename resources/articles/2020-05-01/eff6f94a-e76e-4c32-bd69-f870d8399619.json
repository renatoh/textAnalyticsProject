Age UK delivers almost 19,000 food packages a week to older people and has reported a rise in numbers without food or the support to plan, to cook and eat by themselves. \u201cWe know there are older people living on their own in the community who are running out of food and struggling to replenish their supplies because they are too frightened to go out, confused by the guidance or because their usual support networks have collapsed as a result of a pandemic,\u201d said Caroline Abrahams, the charity director of Age UK. \u201cThese people are not on anyone\u2019s list,\u201d she added. \u201cTypically they are not online. However, the pandemic has pulled the rug out from under them, so that their usual strategies for getting by are no longer working.\u201d The charity said that since the pandemic began there had been an unprecedented number of inquiries to its advice line, peaking at almost double the usual rate of calls. Age UK and the Malnutrition Task Force have reported an increase in contacts about older people being discharged from hospital with no food or support in place, and people struggling to access social care support or manage without the informal help usually available from family and friends. The charities are also hearing of increased stress and anxiety among people with ongoing health and care needs, causing them to reduce their intake of food and drink. Abrahams said she had a conversation recently with an elderly man called Nigel. \u201cHe has no food in his house but he is scared to leave it because of coronavirus,\u201d she said. \u201cNigel isn\u2019t online. He was recently discharged from hospital but no longer gets any support at home. Nigel was told that food parcels would be delivered but has only received one some time ago. He is now out of food and has no family or friends who can help him.\u201d Another Age UK frontline service reported the case of 79-year-old Betty, who relies on her friend to top up her gas meter. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have funds to do it herself and is unable to go out. She has emphysema but is just using a blanket to keep warm,\u201d said Abrahams. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t got any food, only some bread and bacon that a neighbour gave her. She is worried and lonely, with no support. She is unable to contact her GP because she does not have much phone credit or enough money to top it up,\u201d she said. Dianne Jeffrey, the chair of the Malnutrition Task Force, said: \u201cWe are extremely worried that the number of those suffering malnutrition is rising. Many of these people will eventually be admitted to hospital.\u201d A government spokesperson said: \u201cVulnerable individuals can refer themselves to the NHS Volunteer Responders programme by calling 0808 196 3646 to be linked with a volunteer who can shop for them. \u201cThere are also commercial food delivery options available, including food boxes and prepared meals. A list of these has been shared with local authorities and charities, including Age UK. Anyone in urgent need of support should contact their local authority, most of which have dedicated Covid-19 helplines.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
