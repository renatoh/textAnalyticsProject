That was shocking, as two days previously a social worker who had also been at the child's medical examination sat on my sofa and told me she was in great health. \"They never listen. They hear what they want to hear,\" was the doctor's resigned response. \"I can only hope that prospective parents use their initiative to approach me themselves to discuss the prognosis, otherwise they can get some misconstrued version.\" A sleepless night ended with the decision to go ahead with the adoption. But the social workers told me I was no longer deemed a suitable mother. The two-year assessment they'd carried out \u2013 home visits and interviews with family and friends ending in approval by an independent panel \u2013 was not now enough. I hadn't said I wanted a disabled child, so they were worried I \"wasn't quite prepared\". Decisions like this are what prospective adoptive parents have to live with and they do so with resilience, just as they put up with the three to four years it can take to get a child. I am incredibly lucky to have two children, both adopted, and I'd go through the whole process again. But two years later that little girl was still in care. I have no way of knowing what has happened to her since. Statistics from the Department of Education last week showed the number of children being adopted falling \u2013 just 60 babies and a total of 3,050 adoptions last year, down from 150 and 3,330 respectively in 2007. What hasn't changed is the length of time children are left waiting for new families \u2013 on average two years, seven months. That alone seems unequivocal proof that children are being failed. The numbers of children in care is rising \u2013 65,540, up from 59,970. Not all need adoption. For some, foster parents or residential care homes will suit them best. Others will go back home. It is telling that there doesn't seem to be a tally of the total prospective parents out there, already approved and waiting to be matched with a child. Or of those who apply to be adopters but are turned down. Would the supposedly \"adoption crisis\" in Britain be viewed in a different light if that number was known? Anne Marie Carrie, chief executive of Barnardo's, described the barriers to adoption on Radio 4 last week: \"One is that we do not cherish people when they come forward saying they want to be a parent. We treat them with enormous suspicion. We set thresholds that frankly would prevent you and I adopting our own children. \"We're too slow to say that some [natural] parenting is frankly not good enough and is never going to be good enough and we should put the child first. I absolutely accept that we must make sure we take very considered decisions in this. But actually the presumption now is that the dysfunctional parent is given chance after chance and there's a point where we should say the child comes first.\" That is what is not happening. Martin Narey, the government's new adoption adviser, is keen to reduce delays in matching children to parents, due to social workers holding out for exact religious or racial types. It is, he said, \"frankly scandalous that a white child right now in care is three times as likely to be adopted as a black child\". Six years ago a friend of mine applied to adopt siblings she had seen on a website. She was turned down because the children were mixed race and she and her husband were not. She kept on looking, but almost two years on saw the same boy and girl advertised again. After a fight she finally brought her children home \u2013 three and a half years after first applying. \"I felt like the social worker resented me getting the children. It was as if she wanted to hang on to them.\" There's no evidence that exact racial or religious matches benefit children. \"A lot of social workers think they have a checklist, but there is no evidence, no science,\" said Jonathan Pearce, of Adoption UK, a support group. For prospective parents the adoption process is an eye-opener. You witness professional incompetence, incomprehensible delays and irrational decision-making. No one complains for fear of censure. You bide your time and wait for your child to be delivered into your care, when you hope you can go home and work on becoming a family. Professionally, I have met dozens of people involved in adoption and foster care: birth parents, lawyers, social workers, adoptive and foster parents, academic researchers and judges. Everyone has seen poor practice at every level, slow court processes, judges offering abusive parents second chances, despite the fact that the care professionals will have given them dozens before they came near court. Adult rights dominate in an adversarial approach that is often dishonest. Many social workers are fabulous \u2013 overworked and underpaid, yet utterly dedicated to the essential and under-appreciated job they do. But some are inefficient, even incompetent, making illogical decisions weighed down with worry and defensiveness. They allow themselves to be bullied or become stuck in a endless cycle of emotionally draining work with at-risk families. Every decent social worker knows colleagues like this; they may need retraining, support or even new roles. They certainly need managing. Above all, the interests and priorities of the child should be the absolute focus of every aspect of the process. A child entering the care system should be the equivalent of a patient arriving at an A&amp;E department. An instant team is assembled, assigned, and gets to work. No one waits. Reports don't sit on report-laden desks and outside professionals or agencies aren't treated as interlopers, but welcomed as partners. Court-appointed guardians who miss or change appointments too often are relieved of their responsibilities. Judges are given a concise checklist of the work done with a birth parent in court by an independent assessor if necessary, and made to understand not everything in life can be adjourned. No one thinks handling the needs of children in care is easy. But it can be done well. In one of the pockets of excellent practice in adoption in the UK, Harrow council in north London gets children approved for adoption placed in an average of four months. It has a 100% success rate in finding adopters. In 2006, its children's service in chaos, Harrow entered into partnership with children's charity Coram. The authority uses Coram's pool of prospective parents, around 60 at any time, and focuses on early intervention and swift matching. Newborn babies go to foster carers while the birth parents are being assessed. If its decided the baby is not to return, then the fosterers become the adopters, saving the child from being moved around during its key developmental stages. Peter Tolley, placement manager at the council, said: \"It's tough on people. We are open about that. It is hard if the baby goes back to its birth family, but it's not about the adults, it's about the child. \"Coram have the approach that the best match is better than holding out for some ideal family that might never materialise. We have a robust support plan for families to tackle any weaknesses. The children are at the centre of every decision. Initially the staff were suspicious, but over a period of time people realised their experience was respected and that this was a partnership, not a takeover.\" So it can be done. Maybe I am wrong and I wasn't the right mother for that little girl, but I hope she got one in the end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
