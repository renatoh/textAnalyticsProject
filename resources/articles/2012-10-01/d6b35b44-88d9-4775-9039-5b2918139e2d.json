One of his two leading scrum-halfs, Ben Youngs, pulled out before it had started; his elder brother, Tom, suddenly the only hooker in England's senior squad without an injury problem, had some horribly wobbly moments at line-out time; Toby Flood was outshone by Freddie Burns, whom he has kept in the Saxons squad for now, and both had wobbly moments of their own. And the man of the match was James Simpson-Daniel, who is not in any of the squads. To start with Simpson-Daniel, the 30-year-old winger lit up a riveting contest with his speed, intelligence and instinct for space. Even as he turned defenders inside and out, even as far bigger men made physical assaults upon his ever-calculating head, the ball remained in two hands as he calmly assessed his next option. \"He is an international winger,\" said Nigel Davies, Gloucester's director of rugby whose Welsh heart one could practically see bleeding for a man England have steadfastly ignored these past few years. \"Whether he plays international rugby or not is not my call. When you look at your outside-backs, you've got to have x-factor but you've also got to be solid and make good rugby decisions. He does all those things.\" Of Lancaster's other concerns, Youngs Jr's injury seems the least. His withdrawal with a tight hamstring was precautionary. \"If the game had been played a day or two later,\" said Richard Cockerill, Gloucester's director of rugby, \"he would have been fine.\" Cockerill, as a former England hooker, is well-placed to comment on the other Youngs's position in the scheme of things. His praise for the converted hooker's strength of body and character was lavish but he acknowledged his status as a work in progress. \"It's a project [his conversion from centre to hooker], we know that. There'll be some short-term loss for some long-term gain, and you've got to accept that.\" With Dylan Hartley's injury, though, the spotlight is likely to intensify over the coming weeks. Good news was forthcoming in the performance of Ben Morgan, the Gloucester and England No8, who was hard and ubiquitous. There may also be good news of a sort from the performance of another forthright performer in the Gloucester back row. Akapusi Qera had a wonderful match but he will not be playing for Fiji when England open the autumn internationals against them the weekend after next. Davies revealed that Qera has chosen to focus on things down Gloucester way rather than make himself available, the kind of decision that makes the Fiji management and the IRB despair. Of the fly-halves on show Burns won with his haul of 17 points. His little chips for tries one and two, the second collected and dotted down by his good self with panache, were things of beauty but he had plenty of moments he would rather forget. If Flood did not have his best game either, Burns's licence to continue developing in the Saxons squad is probably appropriate for now. Either way the star of the show, for all these little vignettes within, was the game itself, a classic Kingsholm epic. \"That was a fabulous occasion,\" said Davies, having only recently arrived from as raucous a rugby hotbed as Llanelli, where he has lived all his rugby life. \"I've not experienced anything in club rugby quite like the support we had today.\" That may not be much use to Lancaster but English rugby can be proud of days like this.
