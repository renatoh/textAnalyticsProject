The three companies, Foster Wheeler (oil), Parsons-Brinkerhoff (power) and Halcrow (water) are part of consortia that have won \u00a343m worth of contracts, out of a total of \u00a372.3m. British officials have been lobbying hard for UK firms to win a share of lucrative contracts for reconstruction work in Iraq. The minister for trade, investment and foreign affairs, Mike O'Brien, and Tony Blair's trade envoy, Brian Wilson, flew to Washington last month to make the case for British firms. But as the Guardian reported last month, they were told that there would be no special efforts to help UK companies, and it has been slim pickings for them even though the Blair government stood \"shoulder to shoulder\" with the US on the war with Iraq. The most lucrative contracts have gone largely to US construction giant Bechtel, and Halliburton, the oil services firm once led by the country's vice president, Dick Cheney. British firms have had to content themselves with subcontracting work. \"We have said all along that UK firms have the necessary skills and capabilities to make a significant contribution to Iraq's reconstruction. These awards, along with the earlier contracts awarded to UK companies, confirm this,\" Mr O'Brien said of today's successful bids. \"This is only the first stage. The UK has considerable expertise in infrastructure work, which is the focus of the second round of these awards,\" he added. The contracts awarded today cover the management of programmes in six sectors from oil to electricity and are the first in work worth about (\u00a35bn) \u00a32.7bn, the bulk of which are major construction contracts set to be awarded later this month. \"The really big contracts are to come,\" said Scott McLean, a press officer with the UK Trade and Investment Office. \"These were management contracts, the construction ones will be the big ones.\" Contracts for reconstruction have been mired in controversy, particularly during a US presidential election year with Democrats accusing the Bush administration of looking after its friends. Halliburton is subject to a criminal investigation over whether it overcharged for fuel delivered to Iraq and this week told federal investigators it expected a formal Pentagon inquiry into alleged deficiencies in its procurement procedures in Iraq and Kuwait. The company told the securities and exchange commission, the US financial watchdog, that it has credited $36m to the defence department and delayed billing the Pentagon for an additional $141m because of the problem. The defence department has launched a separate, criminal investigation into whether Mr Cheney's former company overcharged by $61m last year for importing petrol from Kuwait to Iraq for subsidised sales to Iraqi civilians."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
