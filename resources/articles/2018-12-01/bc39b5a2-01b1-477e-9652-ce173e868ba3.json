It is the same gift they commemorate in song, sermon and ritual both at this time of year and in the Easter message \u2013 the gift of inclusion. The story of Jesus coming as a baby, born to a working-class family, working a trade and then spending three years as a teacher who touched the socially untouchable, welcomed the outcast and included those the leaders of his religion rejected is, as Christians often say, the story of \u201cGod moving in to the neighbourhood\u201d. His death as a criminal, according to Christian theology, paved the way for all people to be welcomed unconditionally into the life and love of God, removing the barriers between humanity and deity imposed by religious dogma. The church established in the name of Jesus has struggled to fulfil the promise of the new way of life that his example represented. Despite his request that his followers \u201clove others the way I have loved you\u201d and the Apostle Paul\u2019s assertion that there is \u201cno longer male nor female, slave nor free person for all are one in Christ Jesus\u201d, the church has a long history of finding ways to exclude women, divorcees, people of colour and those deemed \u201csinful\u201d from full inclusion in the life and leadership of Christian community and institutions. Apartheid, antisemitism, slavery, the massacre of people of Muslim faith, banning interracial marriage, domestic violence and the subjugation of women, child abuse and the destruction of Indigenous cultures have all found theological justification in various incarnations of the church throughout Christian history across the world. Over the centuries, due to shifts in internal leadership and external social expectations, many denominations have moved to address the obvious discrepancy between the radical inclusion modelled by Jesus and the practice of those of Christian faith. Divorcees can find churches in which they can share in the communion ritual or become leaders. Despite some hold-outs, most denominations now allow female preachers, pastors and priests. Interracial marriage is accepted and racism and colonialism is widely \u2013 though not exclusively \u2013 condemned. Historical precedent demonstrates that theologies that give permission for exclusion are not set in stone. Change is possible and does not threaten the fundamental tenets of Christian faith, even when those who benefit from the power to exclude feel the discomfort of their privilege slowly eroding. The next frontier of the battle for full inclusion is being waged by the LGBTIQ+ community and their allies and is seen by many Christian leaders as an existential threat to orthodox Christianity and the church. Victorious campaigns for marriage equality in nations including Australia, New Zealand, Ireland and the United States have been greeted with proclamations of the destruction of society and the breakdown of the family unit. Calls for increased rights and recognition of transgender people have been met with harmful derision and fear-mongering about the death of traditional gender identities. Christian schools have declared that they will be unable to provide parents with a faith-based education if they aren\u2019t allowed to exclude gay teachers or counsel children experiencing gender dysphoria according to their belief in binary gender norms. More broadly, many churches are proactively and publicly asserting their conviction that same-sex marriage and the affirmation of LGBTIQ+ identity is incompatible with Christian belief and that those who identify as such will never be equally welcome in the life and leadership of the church. This not only harms LGBTIQ+ congregants but spills over into the public area as conservative religious leaders and politicians are given space in the media to evangelise for the cause of inequality and exclusion. Throughout the Christmas season, churches across the world resound with carolling proclaiming the birth of the Christ child as a message of love from God to all people. \u201cThe wonders of his love\u201d will bring \u201cjoy to the world\u201d as \u201cthe son of God, love\u2019s pure light\u201d heralds the dawn of \u201credeeming grace\u201d. It is time for the church to extend the gift of love to LGBTIQ+ people, as much of it has to women and people of colour \u2013 albeit often with great reluctance \u2013 so that they too may experience the \u201cthrill of hope (as) a weary world rejoices\u201d. A world that is weary of division, of hatred, of inequality and exclusion. A world that is weary of a church that looks to the self-sacrificial love of Jesus for guidance and then fights to maintain its cultural privilege and legal right to discriminate against those it is uncomfortable with. This Christmas, may people of Christian faith extend the gift they are thanking God for \u2013 full inclusion and acceptance \u2013 to all those they have long denied it to. A weary world would indeed rejoice. \u2022 Brad Chilcott is the founder and chair of Welcome to Australia"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
