The Brescia forward, who was this week nominated for the European footballer of the year, criticises Lippi in his forthcoming autobiography, due out in Italy next week. \"He asked me to be his spy, but I refused and became the substitute of substitutes. Everything I did was wrong,\" he said. \"He started a war with me at Inter,\" said Baggio. \"He criticised me for everything, even simple dribbles. He used all his power to destroy me, but he didn't succeed. \"He also criticised me because I talked to journalists and complained about his behaviour. But it was all true. Now I want to meet him as soon as possible and explain what I think.\" Lippi refused to respond to Baggio's accusations. \"I don't concern myself with what Roberto Baggio says or writes. That is his style.\" The man dubbed the Divine Ponytail is also scathing about Renzo Ulivieri, who was his coach at Bologna. \"He didn't want me there,\" said Baggio. \"He told president Giuseppe Gazzoni that, with me, Bologna were relegation candidates. He even feigned his resignation to try to stop my arrival. He was only jealous.\" Ulivieri said he wasn't interested in reading what Baggio had to say about him. \"I am not jealous of any players,\" he said. \"Will I read his autobiography? I have no time and prefer other books.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
