About 12,000 people gathered in Westminster on Wednesday to put pressure on politicians, according to the organisers the Climate Coalition and Greener UK, whose members include aid agencies, social groups and conservation organisations. The Time Is Now lobby comes after months of growing environmental protests, from school strikes to actions by members of Extinction Rebellion, and increasing warnings of the need for unprecedented action to tackle the global climate. Gareth Redmond-King, head of climate change at WWF, said: \u201cPublic concern is at its highest level. It is a mainstream issue. There are lots of organisations working hard to raise the profile and focus their MPs\u2019 minds on policies and actions to make sure we take action.\u201d A recent survey showed two-thirds of Britons wanting faster action to tackle climate change. Theresa May, in one of her last acts as prime minister, is signing into law a target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, which was being debated by the Lords on Wednesday. Campaigners, religious leaders and people of various faiths, led by the former archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams proceeded along Whitehall on a \u201cwalk of witness\u201d. Williams said he was proud the UK was taking the climate crisis seriously. \u201cI compare it with the great struggle 200 years ago with ending the slave trade. Parliament took an option that wasn\u2019t easy, it must have felt risky at the time facing massive entrenched global culture \u2013 and things changed,\u201d he said. At least 195 MPs who met campaigners were encouraged to mark their constituency with a pin on a large map of the UK before being taken by rickshaw to speak to their constituents. At 2pm the thousands present rang alarm clocks, mobile phone alarms and sirens, and cheered loudly to symbolise \u201cthe time is now\u201d. Jane Alexander, a primary school headteacher from London, brought five pupils from her school, North Harringay primary, to the lobby. She said: \u201cOur children may be too young to vote but they are not too young to have their voices heard.\u201d Michelle Lowe, from Winchester, said she had joined the mass lobby to speak to her MP because \u201cthe time is now\u201d. She said: \u201cI have children, who are 22, 20 and 16, and I\u2019m worried about their futures.\u201d The Liberal Democrat leadership contender Sir Ed Davey was among MPs who met constituents. He said it was absolutely clear that the British public was telling politicians to get tough on climate change. Benjamin Halfpenny, from Greener UK, said one of the demands made of MPs was for a strong environment bill to tackle air pollution, water quality and declines in wildlife such as hedgehogs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
