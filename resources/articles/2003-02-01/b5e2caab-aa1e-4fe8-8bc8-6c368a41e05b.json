But those who hope that they will be resolved by the reporting season, which kicks off with Barclays' final results on Thursday, will probably be disappointed. The annual profit statements are likely to offer as much ammunition for the sector's fans as for its critics. Take dividends. On the face of it, the only issue for debate is how much Abbey National will cut its payout. Until its house broker, UBS Warburg, predicted the dividend could be halved, the consensus was that it would fall by 40 per cent. The other banks will increase their dividends in line with earnings, accompanied by the usual noises about confidence in the outlook and strength of cash flow. But the real issue is whether these payments are sustainable in the long-term - and the fact that you can earn a better income from buying most banks' shares than you can from opening one of their savings accounts underlines just how sceptical investors are about that. The biggest question mark hangs over Lloyds TSB, whose shares currently boast an eye-popping 9 per cent yield. City analysts have been rushing out research notes to explain why the bank is keeping on paying that dividend. However, the decision is likely to owe less to affordability than to old-fashioned management psychology. This will be chief executive Peter Ellwood's last results presentation before he hands over to successor Eric Daniels. The last thing Ellwood will want is to be remembered for is making the bank's first dividend cut. Daniels, however, is likely to judge that the City likes having its predictions proved right and will see no point in holding on to an unjustifiably high payout. Lloyds TSB's travails are partly because of its life insurance company, Scottish Widows, which like every insurer is being dogged by the impact of collapsing stock markets and plunging sales of lucrative products such as with-profits policies. But the real issue is one facing all banks: how do they grow their business in a climate where too many of them are chasing increasingly cautious customers? And it this concern which is really worrying shareholders. 'The big issue for us is revenue growth,' said Derek Mitchell, a fund manager at ISIS. 'Decent growth in lending to the consumer has not been translated into decent growth in revenues for the banks. That points to significant margin pressure.' The fear is that it could get a lot worse. Lloyds TSB turned up the heat with last week's announcement that it is to pay up to 3.2 per cent interest on current accounts. While some dismissed that as a publicity stunt - only those earning more than \u00a330,000 will qualify, and then only if they bank online - it could be a taste of things to come. HBOS, the merged Halifax and Royal Bank of Scotland group, has won 12 per cent of all current accounts since it started offering generous interest rates two years ago. Investors are waiting for Abbey's results on 26 February to find out the strategy of Luqman Arnold, newly appointed chief executive, but the betting is that he will launch a similar grab for market share. The more successful that is, the more pressure there will be for the others to follow suit. That means margins will be squeezed still further. On the face of it, there is nothing to worry about. All the banks are enjoying good growth in lending - Northern Rock, which announced a 31 per cent rise last week, is likely to be the record but even Lloyds TSB and Barclays are expected to manage around 5 per cent. The problem is that this growth is being driven by the consumer, who is moving or adding a new kitchen to the mortgage, a sofa to the credit card or a car to the personal loan. But already, there are signs that the housing market is cooling and shoppers are becoming less willing to spend. As Brian Moretta of fund managers SVMJ - formerly Scottish Value Management - says: 'We can't go on borrowing at twice the rate of growth in gross domestic product forever.' As our spending spree slows, so does the banks' revenue growth.That is bad enough. The real worry is that our spending spree ends with a crash rather than a gradual slowdown. That is the fear behind the third worry: bad debts. While the City has had plenty of jitters about bad debts, so far the banks have remained remarkably robust. Despite high-profile collapses such as Enron and billion-pound write-offs such as Marconi's, bad debt provisions remain low. James Eden at Commerzbank calculates that, for last year, the banks will write off just 60p for every \u00a3100 they have loaned. At the nadir of the last cycle, provisions were almost three times as high - and they stayed that way for three full years. 'The big difference this time around is that the UK banks are so profitable they can easily absorb a large increase in bad debts,' said Eden. The banks, too, insist that this time it will be different. Their risk assessment procedures are more sophisticated and they no longer make the mistake of keeping it all to themselves. Instead, they pass on a large proportion of their lending to other investors - including insurance companies - so spreading the risk. So far, the bad debt parcel does not seem to have landed on any one bank's lap. But investors are constantly looking for signs that this will change - and in the current climate, they are inclined to see them everywhere."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
