The aim was not just to update the public on the murder of Joanna Yeates but also to help the investigation gain new evidence and develop lines of inquiry. Police have become adept at using the media in high-profile cases, says Tarique Ghaffur, a former head of Scotland Yard's homicide command who went on to establish the specialist crime directorate. Ghaffur says the senior investigating officer sets the parameters of the inquiry, with media messages and press conferences shaped to fit. Past cases have shown that there are three key ways by which media appeals help the police. The first is a straightforward appeal for witnesses. The second is when police want to rule in, or out, of their investigation someone close to the victim. \"If you have a suspect, you can put them before the media and put the person on public view to see if their behaviour seems normal,\" Ghaffur says. \"A psychologist can help you do this. Behavioural science is becoming quite important.\" The third way media appeals help is by monitoring the reaction of a suspect to the release of information by police. Does their reaction seem normal, do they even start to make admissions? Ghaffur says: \"Giving lots of detail adds pressure on a suspect. Avon and Somerset [police] \u2026 have introduced the senior investigating officer, giving more facts about the supermarket receipts and other details. It helps close the net.\" The public often needs reassurance in such high-profile cases, he says, adding: \"There is public anxiety \u2026 in a few days time, daughters will be going to new year parties. The public wants to know that someone is in control, that there is hands-on leadership on the ground.\" Ghaffur says Avon and Somerset police have done well to walk the public through police procedure, explaining why postmortems need time, about identification of the body, and why preserving the scene is so important."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
