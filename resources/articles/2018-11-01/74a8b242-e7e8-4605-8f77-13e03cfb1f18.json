Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s captain believes that a restoration of off-field harmony is essential to the team\u2019s chances of Premier League survival and told supporters that Newcastle\u2019s owner is a \u201cnice guy\u201d, before urging them to \u201cstop the negativity\u201d and eliminate \u201cbad energy\u201d. Lascelles met Ashley for the first time last month, when the businessman treated the squad to an Italian meal. \u201cI know fingers are being pointed at him,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the meal was really positive. He\u2019s a nice guy. I like him. If everyone in Newcastle stopped the negativity and tried to form a unity it would help. It\u2019s important that everyone\u2019s together, especially when we\u2019re down at the bottom of the table.\u201d Ben\u00edtez\u2019s side are without a win and face Watford at home on Saturday against a backdrop of discontent which has seen leading fans\u2019 groups urge a boycott of the televised game against Wolves at St James\u2019 Park in December. \u201cWhen there are problems off the pitch it does affect you as players,\u201d said Lascelles, who has just signed a lucrative six-year contract extension. \u201cIt would help if everyone came together and put all that bad energy into positive energy, helping us get three points. If you\u2019re always hearing negativity and you\u2019ve got the fans against Mike it just creates a big negative mess. It doesn\u2019t help. It affects the chemistry in the changing room.\u201d Supporters are furious about Ashley\u2019s persistent refusal to back Ben\u00edtez in the transfer market and Lascelles accepts there is a clear consensus that the squad needs reinforcing. \u201cI understand the fans\u2019 frustration,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when 52,000 Geordies get behind us, it gives such an uplift. My message is stick with us. The fans are entitled to sing about Mike Ashley but it does impact on us.\u201d Lascelles appears to have been won over by the owner in that Northumberland restaurant. \u201cWe had a couple of drinks and he just seemed like a normal person,\u201d the 24-year-old said. \u201cWe talked about normal stuff, men to men. \u201cThe club feels more united now. Our dressing room\u2019s strong \u2013 it\u2019s not like when I first came here and there was a clique of French lads, a group of Spanish lads, the English lads and another group in the corner \u2013 but we\u2019d be a much better club without all the negativity and bad energy.\u201d The problem is Ben\u00edtez\u2019s understandable unwillingness to extend a contract with six months remaining. Lascelles opted to swerve the topic. \u201cI didn\u2019t know there was uncertainty about him not being here. Us players aren\u2019t aware of that. I don\u2019t really sense that. But, as long as he\u2019s here, this club will keep going up and up.\u201d Lascelles is softly spoken but team-mates testify he can turn feisty in training. \u201cIt\u2019s a man\u2019s sport,\u201d he said. \u201cEven in female sports you\u2019ll get upsets, adrenaline\u2019s flying, one bad tackle or bad decision can get somebody saying something. Someone might have had a bad day at home, someone might be having family problems. \u201cAt training, especially when you\u2019re not winning games, things can spark, but it\u2019s completely normal. It doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t like this person, it doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s anything personal. You might push each other, you might punch each other, you might lash out. I\u2019m not saying it\u2019s a good thing, but it happens. \u201cAsk Alan Shearer, ask any ex-Newcastle players, they\u2019ll have seen it all and been involved in it. It\u2019s really not that big a deal.\u201d Such incidents at least show Lascelles cares. \u201cI love Newcastle to bits,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we were relegated I\u2019d want to be part of the team that gets promoted. But we\u2019re not going to get relegated. It\u2019s not happening.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
