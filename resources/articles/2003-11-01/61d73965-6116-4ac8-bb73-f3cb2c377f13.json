With Leicester six minutes away from a third successive victory through Les Ferdinand's first-ha lf header and the city basking in the reflected glory of Leicester Tigers' England heroes, God was in his heaven and it was blue. Then the devil turned up. Di Canio, once lauded by Fifa for his sportsmanship but punished by the Football Association for pushing a referee, demonstrated the unpredictability that makes him such a handful on and off the pitch. Di Canio tumbled like that referee, Paul Alcock, after Steve Howey laid a hand on his shoulder, then converted the subsequent penalty to extend Charlton's unbeaten record to seven games. The Foxes were incandescent but Di Canio, in keeping with his trademark contrariness, was just as aggrieved. Never mind Two Jags Prescott; the Charlton forward thought this should have been a case of Two Penalties Paolo. \"I'm not angry because they called me a cheat,\" he said. \"That's happened to me many times. What makes me angry is that I should have had two penalties, not just one. There was a case early on when I was taken down and the referee did nothing. \"This time he got it right. I was pushed and I couldn't keep on my feet. The one thing that I wasn't worried about was the reaction of the other players. I can understand that. \"There is passion in the game and people are desperate to win. It doesn't worry me what they think of me.\" Which suggests that the Leicester manager Micky Adams's sarcastic applause that accompanied Di Canio's substitution two minutes from time was futile. Later Adams described the penalty award as a joke but his goalkeeper Ian Walker was more philosophical despite claiming Di Canio had conned the referee Graham Barber. \"I don't think there was enough force behind it to make him fall and I think he went down too easily,\" he said. \"To me he's tricked the referee. \"Perhaps that's him using his experience. His team was in a difficult situation with a few minutes to go and he's won them a point they did not look like getting. If it had been the other way round we'd have all been jumping up and down and celebrating as well. Something like that will probably work in our favour later in the season.\" Man of the match: Paolo di Canio (Charlton Athletic)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
