A British Airways pilot and mother of a young child, Jessica Starmer, took her bid to reduce her working hours to an employment tribunal -and won. This was hailed as a breakthrough, showing that a young mother did not have to choose between her career and the demands of being a parent. She could have the flexible hours that would make both possible. But before anyone rushes out to stake their own claim to an improved work-life balance, it's not as simple as it might appear. Rather than clearing the way for people wanting more flexible hours, in many ways the BA pilot's case highlights the regulatory ambiguities facing would-be part-timers. Although welcoming the symbolic significance of the tribunal verdict, Sarah Veale, the TUC's head of equality and employment rights, says that the reality remains that there is still no clear right to flexible hours. Employees can request a change in their working hours - and this must be considered seriously. But if no agreement is reached, there is nothing to force an employer to offer part-time working, says Ms Veale. \"We want the 'right to request' to be extended to parents with children under six or with disabled children up to 18.\" The TUC wants the process to give more control to employees over their working hours - in a way that hasn't really been achieved yet, despite the ruling backing Jessica Starmer's application. What made Jessica Starmer's case unusual, was she won the claim on the grounds of sex discrimination, arguing that the refusal to reduce her hours was detrimental to female employees. It wasn't setting a precedent, saying that an employee had a right to work part-time. The British Airways defence was that this was an argument about safety rather than hours - pilots had to achieve a certain level of flying hours before they would be allowed this level of part-time working. British Airways is appealing against the decision - and a spokesman said that it was \"fully supportive\" of the principle of allowing staff to work part-time, except where it \"cut across safety standards\". But the Equal Opportunities Commission says that Jessica Starmer's success in pursuing her demand for part-time working, is particularly significant for women trying to balance a career with caring for children. And she says it shows that people who are unable to work full-time, such as women with young children, needn't be pushed into lower-paid part-time jobs. \"Women are hardest hit by the 'penalty' which channels them into low-paid jobs with poor prospects because they take on more of the caring role at home,\" said the commission's chief executive, Caroline Slocock. But the rules on moving from full to part-time leave the employer with the final decision. Setting aside the question of discrimination, if a request for flexible working is turned down, a tribunal cannot make an unwilling employer change its mind. There are wide-ranging legitimate grounds for refusing. This can include extra cost, difficulty in finding replacement staff, a detrimental impact on performance or quality, difficulty in reorganising work among other staff and any problems it might cause for future planned changes. And the trade unions say that such broad-brush exemptions give uncooperative employers the opportunity to block staff wanting flexible hours. Employees can challenge on whether an employer has followed the correct procedure in handling a request and whether the refusal has been made on correct grounds. But the decision on allowing flexible working remains ultimately with the employer. Despite this limitation, the conciliation service ACAS says that relatively few disputes are brought to them over demands for part-time working. But this could be a reflection on the buoyant labour market as much as the success of the regulations. The Institute of Directors says that many employers agree to flexible working, rather than risk losing staff and facing the expense and uncertainty of trying to recruit a suitably-qualified replacement. \"It's a powerful incentive to reach an accommodation,\" says the institute's head of business policy, Richard Wilson. A survey of employers has shown a high level of acceptance already exists, he says, with almost two-thirds offering flexible working. \"Approximately 30% of jobs are part-time - and there's every expectation this will continue,\" he says. \"The labour market is tight and employers are finding it hard to find qualified staff.\" As such, with most employees getting the flexibility they want and employers able to refuse if necessary, Richard Wilson says the regulations are \"bedding in successfully\". The ruling on Jessica Starmer, he describes as \"indicative of which way the wind is blowing\" and a sign that part-time and flexible working is now an established part of the employment landscape. Sarah Veale says that the right to flexible working needs to be protected more formally. \"It's going in the right direction. But until you have something more robust, it's not enough,\" she says. The Department for Productivity, Energy and Industry (DPEI) is carrying out a consultation on widening access to flexible working - and among the questions are whether the right to request should be extended to other carers, such as those looking after elderly relatives or sick partners. The DPEI says that since the right to request flexible working was introduced, the rate of rejections of applications has halved. In its first year, a quarter of eligible parents asked to change their hours - with three-quarters being accepted in full. But if the path to flexible working is being opened up, the DPEI's figures also show that there are some tough decisions ahead in managing the likely growth in demand. At present, the right to request flexible working is limited to 3.7m parents of young children - but if this was extended to those looking after other dependents, it could trigger a much greater demand, particularly with an ageing population. According to the DPEI, there are 5.3m in the working-age population who could be classified as \"carers\", including those looking after adult relatives and partners. If eligibility for flexible working was extended to parents of children up to the age of 17, then another 4.5m people would enter the equation. This raises the prospect of challenges over the rights given to different groups of carers - with very large numbers of workers and employers, not to mention voters, likely to be affected. Why should parents of disabled children be eligible for flexible working and not the partner of a disabled adult? Why should parents of a sick child be allowed to work part-time but not someone who needs to look after a sick parent? The DPEI says changing demographics - longer lives and smaller families - will mean that more of us than ever are set to look after someone else. Already 1.3m employees are carers for an adult relative - with every indication that this will rise. The need for part-time working could become an increasingly full-time question for both employees and employers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
