Goodness, this was France. Where was the fun in unanimity? Even before day one it was obvious that rugby's opportunity to woo those citizens not yet sold on the sport's ability to contain its obviously violent potential within a folkloric framework of universal camaraderie was compromised. Those wishing to seize the moment and supplant football in the nation's affections promoted rugby's values of mutual respect. Meanwhile, from every advertising hoarding there soulfully gazed a French player rather obviously out to make a bob or two. Which would have been fine except that France promptly lost their first match to Argentina and a lot of positive energy was converted into soul-searching. The letter of Guy Moquet, for example. Had it been appropriate to read it to the French players? Mixing sport and business was bad enough; mixing rugby and the farewell letter of a kid about to be shot by the Boche was way over the top. And what about Bernard Laporte? The French coach, after the tournament, was off to join the new conservative government of Nicolas Sarkozy as under-secretary to the minister of sport. And had anyone, by the way, seen the prices of the replica France shirts he was flogging on his website? Overnight, rugby was the laughing stock. But as the public on one side began to sneer, another began to cheer. Not for France, but for the minnows all over France. Stadiums were filled to bursting, despite the eye-watering ticket prices. 'Allez les Bleus,' was customised for whichever underdog was in town. The home team slowly worked their way back into contention. The players were not now the imbeciles; rather it was the people who had allowed it to happen that les vrais Bleus, at their own World Cup, might have to go to Cardiff for a quarter-final against the All Blacks. To whose arrogance was this attributable? And then they only went and beat New Zealand. Cardiff, marvellous Cardiff, for those that went. Back home, on city-centre television screens as gigantic as the advertising hoardings on which the stars had prostituted themselves, France watched in amazement as the same players sold themselves for a cause so much nobler. And the klaxons of a million cars led the night-long party. Atonement. Defeat to England was horrible, but familiar. This was not a philosophy discredited, a spiritual campaign devastated, or a whole World Cup ruined; this was a tactical error. It left certain people in the firing line. Laporte, for example. The coach had managed to oversee two semi-final defeats to England, in Sydney 2003 and Paris 2007. Had learned nothing from the first. Had ordered a conservative kicking game, poorly executed, for the second. And now Laporte is off to join the government, a man with a dodgy website and some business dealings elsewhere that have raised a few eyebrows. Laporte is a lingering source of unease at an otherwise quite marvellous party. The rest of France have done nothing but make these past few weeks utterly gripping and uniquely memorable.
