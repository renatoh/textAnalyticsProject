It's a bit early for that, and Ian McParland, the manager at Notts County, was understandably miffed by reports that Sven-Goran Eriksson's spell \"in charge\" at Meadow Lane had got off to a triumphant start with Saturday's drubbing of palsied Bradford City. It was McParland's team, not Eriksson's, that got off to a flyer \u2013 a point the Scot was quick to emphasise. Funded by their Middle Eastern owners, County have signed nine players during the summer, with more to follow, and every one of them has been identified and recruited by the manager, rather than the club's new director of football. \"I've been here 22 months now and I know what's required\", McParland said. \"I've brought nine in so far, and they are my signings, nobody else's.\" Of Eriksson's input to date, he added: \"Don't listen to all the rubbish about that. Sven is a nice man, a real gentleman, but all he's doing at the moment is coming to the training ground and watching us work. Having him here is a long term plan \u2013 something for the future.\" It was a point taken up by Lee Hughes, the itinerant striker who joined the same day as Eriksson and celebrated yet another debut with a hat-trick. \"I came here for the manager,\" he said. \"Ian McParland got me here, not Sven. It was the manager who sold the club to me. Sven comes to training nearly every day, but just to watch. He doesn't do any coaching. To be honest, it's unreal to see someone like him at a club like this. I saw him in the tunnel just before the game and he asked me for two goals. I got three, so he can't complain.\" He was not about to. The former England manager gladhanded his way out of his new domain wearing that familiar beatific smile. \"Much better than we thought\" was the verdict \u2013 the 'we' referring to his trusty lieutenant, Tord Grip, and his agent, Athole Still, who flanked him in the directors' box. Substantially reinforced, County were impressive in all areas, and might have inflicted an even heavier defeat on a Bradford team widely tipped for promotion. It is McParland, not Eriksson, who deserves the credit, but public and media interest will inevitably focus on the peripatetic Swede, which we can safely assume was the new owners' intention. Like so many of the foreign investors proliferating in English football, the Munto Finance consortium wanted a high profile figurehead to provide their venture with a veneer of gravitas. For a salary that could rise incrementally from a basic \u00a3250,000 to \u00a32m a year, Eriksson was happy to oblige. It was, and remains, an eyebrow-raising appointment. Even Eriksson's friends, David Platt among them, were stunned by his reappearance in the backwoods of League Two. What he can contribute at this level is unclear. His responsibilities are said to include scouting, transfers and player development, which would be logical enough but for his total lack of experience at this level. For the past 30 years he has worked exclusively at the top end of football's pyramid, and his knowledge of the sort of players County need to get out of the basement, and where they are to be found, is negligible. Throughout his club career, Eriksson has bought, expensively, rather than brought on young talent and at 61 he is not about to acquire the alchemist's art. County's target is to establish themselves in the Championship within five years and with that in mind their exemplars should be the likes of Wigan, Peterborough, Cardiff and Doncaster, all of whom ascended from the League's bottom tier by dint of good management by men with a thorough knowledge of the lower divisions. Men like McParland. On Saturday's evidence he is working the oracle without significant input from the man whose sacking by Mexico in April saw fans take to the streets in celebration. Eriksson says: \"I know a lot of people in European football and I'm going to use those contacts as well as I can.\" It is McParland, however, who knows what is required for the foreseeable future and he is doing his shopping not in Italy, Portugal or Scandinavia but at Oldham, Yeovil, Darlington and Kettering. Hughes, still pacy and combative at 33, was too good for a flimsy, error-prone Bradford defence, but the best goal of the lot came from a newcomer at the opposite end of the career spectrum. Brendan Moloney, a 20-year-old on loan from Nottingham Forest, gave a precociously assured performance at right-back, embellished by a mesmeric run and high-class finish of which any Premier League striker would have been proud. Definitely a young man to watch. Bradford? The less said the better. Their manager, Stuart McCall, tendered his resignation at the end of last season, when they blew promotion and finished ninth. The board talked him into staying, but Yorkshire shell-shock was not confined to Headingley on Saturday night. Up in the 1862 Suite (County are proud of their distinction as the Football League's oldest club) there was embarrassment of another kind. \"Are you Sven?\" asked a star-struck 10-year-old. \"Afraid not, son\" said Kevin Pilkington, County's reserve goalkeeper, with which the lad quickly withdrew his autograph book. At least it wasn't McParland. Man of the match Lee Hughes (Notts County)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
