Frozen out and frustrated on the south coast, the central defender has helped to turn around Villa\u2019s season as well as his own, starting more league games in four months than he managed in four years at Bournemouth and becoming a fans\u2019 favourite in the process. He has even worn the captain\u2019s armband. \u201cIt\u2019s been everything that any loan player could want,\u201d Mings says, smiling. Although it is difficult to know just how committed a player will be when he arrives on a temporary basis, Mings has stayed true to the promise that he made immediately after signing. \u201cIn my first interview with the club, they asked me what to expect from Tyrone the player, and I said that I would leave everything on the pitch and play with my heart on my sleeve. I think if you do that, whether you\u2019re on loan or permanent, the fans can really take to that and get behind you. That\u2019s all they want \u2013 a player to play for the shirt and the badge.\u201d Mings had plenty of admirers in January \u2013 Derby County, Nottingham Forest and West Bromwich Albion showed interest \u2013 but everything added up for the former mortgage adviser when he learned that Villa was an option. Dean Smith, the manager, made it clear that he would deploy Mings at centre-back, in his preferred position, and the prospect of playing in front of a big fanbase, with a level of expectation that the 26-year-old thought would bring out the best in him, ticked another box. One of the biggest factors, though, was the presence of John Terry on the coaching staff. \u201cJohn Terry is a fantastic centre-back \u2013 a centre-back that a lot of people would put in their all-time Premier League XI,\u201d Mings says. \u201cSo when I knew that there was a chance that I could come here and learn from someone like that, in my position, it was an opportunity that I couldn\u2019t really turn down.\u201d Mings says Terry uses video clips to analyse every match with him afterwards. \u201cHis overriding comments to me are: \u2018Go through the game without being seen.\u2019 He tells me that a lot. And those little bits of information are obviously great. As much as you want to improve or help the team, as a centre-back your job is to go under the radar and keep the ball out of the net. If you do that and let the strikers get all the adulation and the headlines, then you\u2019re probably doing your job.\u201d Villa, not surprisingly, would like to sign Mings permanently but, realistically, that transfer is likely to go ahead only if they beat Derby in Monday\u2019s Championship play-off final. Whatever happens at Wembley, it is hard to see a long-term future for Mings at Bournemouth, who have just bought Lloyd Kelly, another left-sided central defender, from Bristol City. Mings sounds like someone who needs a fresh start after a difficult time with the Premier League club. Signed from Ipswich in 2015 for a then club-record \u00a39m fee, he endured a nightmare beginning to his Bournemouth career when he snapped a cruciate and medial ligaments six minutes into his first appearance. He also had another lengthy spell on the sidelines last season, although Mings clearly feels that could have been avoided and, talking more generally, is keen to set the record straight when it comes to his fitness. \u201cI have never been injury prone,\u201d he says. \u201cI had a seven-week back injury at Bournemouth and was out for seven months. Read into that what you want. I have never pulled a muscle and I don\u2019t see myself as a person who needs to try and stay fit. I just need to play games and you can never replicate that in training. \u201cI had one serious injury, which was a tackle, and a stress fracture in my back, which was probably from over-training one summer through my off-season. Through different reasons I wasn\u2019t able to come back on to the pitch when I should have. But I don\u2019t see myself as someone who needs to be managed or has to worry about injuries. My knee has never given me another problem, my back has never given me another problem.\u201d After making only two league starts at Bournemouth this season, Mings knew that the time had come to move on when the January window opened. \u201cI needed to come out of Bournemouth if I wasn\u2019t going to get an opportunity there and show people what I could do,\u201d he adds. \u201cI don\u2019t think it has revived my career [here], it has probably just refreshed it. I am on a path at the moment where I am feeling good, in a great place mentally and physically, and hopefully we can all taste some success come the 27th.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
