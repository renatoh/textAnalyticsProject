Proposals in the forthcoming data communications bill show how the Home Office is planning to create a database that would allow officials to monitor all communications traffic. The bill would force internet and telephone companies to keep full details of every movement made by customers, with government agencies across Europe potentially able to access the information. The government's privacy watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office, yesterday said that the prospect was cause for concern. \"This would give us serious concerns and may well be a step too far,\" said the deputy information commissioner, Jonathan Bamford. \"We are not aware of any justification for the state to hold every UK citizen's phone and internet records. We have real doubts that such a measure can be justified, or is proportionate or desirable.\" A report by the ICO last year suggested that Britain was \"sleepwalking\" towards a surveillance society. The Home Office said none of the plans for the bill was finalised, but that new powers were required to help anti-terrorist personnel keep up with new technologies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
