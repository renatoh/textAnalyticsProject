He fails in his statistics-heavy letter to answer the points we raised: about debt burdens of leveraged (borrowed) buyouts, the pressure for quick returns and the impact on working conditions. Nor has he responded to fears, well beyond the unions, of the impact that sour deals could have on the pension funds that are piling in to fund private-equity takeovers. After some progress in forcing publicly listed companies to take corporate social responsibility seriously, the private-equity route also takes us back to the dark ages and ignores public and worker stakeholders. And please don't lump together private-equity buyouts that expensively recycle ownership of established companies with venture capital that backs vital new enterprises. Philip Jennings General secretary, UNI global union, Nyon, Switzerland I seem to be living in the middle of the world's biggest car-boot sale. Anything not nailed down has already been sold. The rest seems up for grabs. The latest news that yet another football club has been sold - to Americans, of all people - and that Sainsbury's could go the same way is utterly depressing. We already have railways, airports, water and electricity companies in foreign ownership. Where will it stop? Is there any way I can just become a European citizen?
