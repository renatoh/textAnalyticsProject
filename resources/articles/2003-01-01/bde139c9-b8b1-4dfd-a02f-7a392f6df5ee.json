But this thorough stayer has all the attributes required to win the 4m1f Miles Gosling Handicap Chase. Timmy Murphy has struck up a good understanding with Sir Frosty (1.40) and the combination bid for their fourth success together. The latest came over four miles at Exeter where Sir Frosty ground out a four-length win. He looks a good bet in receipt of weight from some fairly well exposed opposition. A forecast of heavy overnight rain has led Cheltenham to hold a precautionary inspection this morning. The same applies at Exeter, but today's scheduled Catterick card was called off following the loss of yesterday's meeting. Waterlogging has also claimed tomorrow's Folkestone card and prospects are not good for Friday at Hexham. A 10am inspection will be held today. Sandown's Saturday card is looking doubtful, with an inspection called for 3pm tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
