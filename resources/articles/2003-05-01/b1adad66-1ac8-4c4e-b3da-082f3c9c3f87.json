Slightly surprised at such a flagrant breach of diplomatic protocol, Lamour nevertheless told Caborn that the French government would launch its bid at the end of May - just a week after the cabinet is expected to officially rubber-stamp London's. The prospect of a European city winning the nomination when the International Olympic Committee makes its decision in 2005 could be boosted by the news that Salzburg might have to withdraw from the race for the 2010 winter games. Kitzb\u00fchel, the birthplace of Mozart, is considering withdrawing its facilities as one of the bid's crowning venues. It is put out that the Austrian bid committee has agreed to move the curling away from the Tyrolean resort. If Salzburg were successful it would severely damage the chances of the IOC coming back to Europe for the summer games two years later."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
