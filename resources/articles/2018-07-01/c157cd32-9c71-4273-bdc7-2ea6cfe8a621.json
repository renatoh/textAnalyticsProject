The scale of the excitement will again be visible on Thursday, when a capacity 50,000 crowd attends his first competitive match. The fact it is a Europa League qualifying tie against little-known FK Shkupi of Macedonia does not seem to matter. Gerrard has called on his squad to walk the walk. \u201cWe\u2019re happy that there is an expectation and that there is a positivity but the players have to handle that responsibility and that pressure that is part of this club,\u201d the former Liverpool captain said. \u201cEvery player who comes into this club does an interview and says it\u2019s great to be part of Rangers, one of the most successful clubs in the world and [that] they are at a big club now, but now you have got to go and perform and accept that. \u201cYou have to play under pressure and enjoy that pressure and thrive on it. We can\u2019t have players who are going to sink because that\u2019s when the problems happen.\u201d Rangers do not need to look far for further warnings. A year ago, aggregate defeat by Progr\u00e8s Niederkorn of Luxembourg represented arguably the most embarrassing result in history for a Scottish club in European competition. \u201cI remember it coming across the yellow bar on Sky Sports News,\u201d Gerrard said. \u201cI was like: \u2018Woah, that\u2019s not going to go down well.\u2019 I certainly don\u2019t want to have that surprise on Thursday night, certainly not. \u201cI have got every confidence and belief in the players and the team that they can go out and do the job. The team talk is already done \u2013 someone did that for me 12 months ago. I am not nervous or scared, I can\u2019t wait to walk out there and get the game going and the lads are really ready for it. \u201cI hope it [last year\u2019s result] is in the back of their mind and I hope they are determined, they have to be. A club this size shouldn\u2019t lose games like that. We have to show this team respect and show the competition respect. There are no gimmies, no walkovers. We will approach the game right and show the level of intensity and desire that we have done in the friendly games. If we do, I am sure we won\u2019t have a problem.\u201d The recurring message from Gerrard\u2019s players relates to the intensity and demands placed on them by the new manager. Rangers\u2019 recruitment suggests a robust approach in the coming season, something Gerrard makes no apology for. \u201cI said at the beginning I was hoping to bring in players that would make us tougher and stronger and more aggressive,\u201d he said. Millwall\u2019s centre-back Jake Cooper is believed to be his next target, with Gerrard full of praise for a Rangers board not short on critics. \u201cThey have been superb,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have done exactly what they said they would when we spoke before I got the job. So I\u2019m really happy with the support. We are very close to completing what we want. We feel the squad has improved an awful lot.\u201d Gerrard\u2019s overwhelming emotion is of excitement. \u201cI can\u2019t wait,\u201d he said. \u201cI am very proud and very humble to be the Rangers manager and go out in front of a full house for a Europa League qualifier. I think it shows the level of support and how big this football club is. These fans are incredible. There will be no prouder man than me tomorrow.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
