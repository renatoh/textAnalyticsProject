A number of top sporting personalities, including Dave Bassett and umpire Billy Bowden, had tossed their hats into the frame on the off-chance of a nod, only to find themselves cruelly rejected in favour of some bloke who looks like a cornfed version of Micky Duff. I understand that the sartorially strict Bassett was rejected when he refused to countenance appearing on screen with his bow tie undone, while Bowden missed the cut because of his inability to get through the silhouetted credit sequence without crooking his index finger in an irritating manner - shades of his erstwhile colleague David Shepherd, who was rejected as the lead in The Madness of King George III because every time he saw the title he had to hop about on one leg. The Fifa president Sepp Blatter too had worked ceaselessly to secure the part of OO7 ever since it became clear that Roger Moore could only continue in the role if the producers started using stop-frame animation. To help prove his suitability as the MI5 agent with the licence to kill, Blatter has been wearing a bulletproof corset 24-hours a day, become so sleek he is undetectable to radar, and risen to the coveted level of black cummerbund in the ancient martial art of la soir\u00e9e. Meanwhile, his comments about women players wearing tighter kits and his previous role as president of The Worldwide Friends of Suspenders show that he has the correct sexual attitudes to deliver such lines as: \"I'm just coming into Cockfosters now, Q\", or \"I think it's time we turned out those profiteroles, Miss Abitofhowsyourfather, don't you?\" Perhaps disappointment explains Sepp's recent splenetic outpourings. Some feel that his comments about players are born of envy. Jealousy is not an issue in this case, however. Sepp is a man of simple tastes. Fresh air, clear water, the merry song of the skylark, complimentary toiletries, 24-hour room service and a trouser press are all he requires for utter contentment. Sepp's quest is to bring about the Official Fifa Football Revolution\u2122 and turn soccer into a socialist paradise free from inequality and injustice. He is angered by what he sees as the imbalances in today's game. The \"haves\", he recently observed, compete with \"nuclear warheads\", while the \"have-nots\" must make do with \"spears\". Sepp wants to even things up. But nuclear proliferation is clearly not the answer, because, let's face it, who in their right mind would give weapons of mass destruction to Ken Bates or Dave Whelan? No, Sepp wants to ensure that everybody is fighting with Stone Age weapons. He would take football back to Fifa Year Zero\u2122, re-acquainting bloated modern stars with the game's origins as the rough boys' alternative to shooting arrows into French toffs. A return to the days of 200-a-side matches played on a pitch four miles long and lasting from sunrise to sunset are his waking dream. This is not something that has come to him recently. Since his youth in the foothills of the Matterhorn, Blatter has been a passionate firebrand and a friend to the poor and disenfranchised. Older readers may recall the events of 1968, when, inspired by student leaders, young Sepp led the legendary Lausanne Banking Riots which brought an evening drinks party at Morgan Stanley to a standstill for fully 15 minutes and almost resulted in the overthrow of the cold buffet. Blatter's ringing demands that evening - freedom, equality and more canap\u00e9s, gar\u00e7on - echoed around the world, becoming a rallying call for disaffected senior administrative personnel everywhere. Soon afterwards Sepp's Motorcade Diaries, private journals chronicling a journey from Liechtenstein to Monaco in a fleet of Mercedes limousines, were published. The radical changes Sepp envisages do not happen overnight. The Fifa president has always favoured a softly-softly approach to socialism - the clenched fist in the velvet evening glove. Chairman Mao believed change would come through the barrels of a gun; Sepp believes change will come through the barrels of a fine cognac maker. The only thing currently stopping Sepp from launching the Official Fifa Soccer Revolution\u2122 is that it cannot proceed without corporate sponsorship from globally recognised brands. Sepp wants to change the football world, but we mustn't get impatient. After all, if Lenin had had to persuade MasterCard to become the official partner of the Bolshevik Uprising\u2122 (In association with Snickers, official snack of the International Workers of the World) the angry mob would still be milling round outside the gates of the Winter Palace."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
