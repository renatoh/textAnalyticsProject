Giles will use a speech to Australian Fabians on Wednesday to argue the recent community debate around the medical evacuations bill, and the tone of the federal election, suggests Australians are over the toxic politics of border protection, and are fatigued by the \u201cfalse binaries and unnecessary aggression\u201d from the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton. The Victorian leftwinger will say it was notable that border protection, and the \u201cdemonisation of asylum seekers\u201d did not feature front and centre in the 2019 federal election, which is unusual compared with previous federal contests. \u201cI\u2019m not sure if we can quite characterise this as something to celebrate, but it is a significant development \u2013 something to build upon.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Giles says the \u201cnoise\u201d of the hyper-partisan conflict over border protection policy that has raged in Australia since the Tampa standoff \u201chas crowded out both a reasoned and reasonable exchange of ideas, and the voices of those whose lives are directly affected by the policy choices we make\u201d. \u201cWe have to change this. We have to give Australia\u2019s hopeful side a fair chance to prevail over the politics of fear, and division.\u201d Giles says part of nudging the national debate in a more positive direction \u2013 apart from putting Dutton under more pressure about the management of his portfolio \u2013 would involve situating the conversation within Australia\u2019s commitment to immigration and multiculturalism. \u201cAustralians are rightly proud of our immigration story, and should be concerned at how this government has been undermining its foundations,\u201d Giles says. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to call out the dog-whistling rhetoric, and to expose what lies beneath it.\u201d He will point to the devaluing of immigration and settlement functions within the home affairs structure and \u201cextraordinary delays\u201d in visa processing and citizenship applications. \u201cThey don\u2019t just frustrate the affected individuals, they affect our society at large.\u201d Giles says Labor will continue to oppose a controversial planned privatisation of visa processing and call out instances where particular communities are singled out for abuse. \u201cGovernments should seek to bring people together, that\u2019s been the modern story of settlement in Australia, and of our commitment to multiculturalism,\u201d he will say. \u201cBut there\u2019s an unease which is easy to appreciate, as some communities feel under pressure and under supported. \u201cWhen Jason Wood, the assistant minister for multicultural affairs, can say most migrants when they come here don\u2019t know what it means to be Australian, I\u2019m concerned.\u201d Giles, who has been a vocal advocate within Labor for more humane policies on asylum, moved a motion against boat turnbacks at Labor\u2019s 2015 national conference. But the Victorian has subsequently argued he supports interceptions where it is safe to do so. He references that shift implicitly in the speech. \u201cAs the facts have changed, so have some of my views, but not my values, nor my determination to make a difference for the world\u2019s most vulnerable people\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
