Over the course of that decade, insurance premiums would double, the report said. The analysis came as Donald Trump urged Republicans to move away from a plan to repeal the 2010 healthcare law with a delayed replacement, a move that he had previously supported and one that comes with considerable political risks. The legislation, a revised version of a bill that a majority of Senate Republicans voted for in 2015 and Barack Obama vetoed, was expected to come up for a vote early next week even though it lacked enough support to pass. At least three senators have said it would be irresponsible to repeal major parts of the law without replacing them. The plan would repeal key elements of the healthcare law, including the individual mandate requiring all Americans to have healthcare and the employer mandate requiring businesses of a certain size to offer insurance to employees. It would also roll back Medicaid expansion and stop health insurance subsidies, which allow sicker people to buy insurance at the same rates as other Americans. Enacting the legislation would reportedly reduce the deficit by $473bn over the next decade. Under the plan, the ACA, popularly known as Obamacare, would be repealed after a two-year transition period during which time senators would come up with a compromise plan to replace it, a balance that has been impossible to strike so far. Yet regardless of how the Senate decides to move forward with repealing the ACA, any plan that would repeal major pieces of the healthcare law without an immediate replacement appears doomed to fail. The partial repeal would cause 17 million people to lose insurance in the first year compared to the current law, the budget office said. And in that same period, premiums would rise by 25%. The findings are in line with a January analysis of the 2015 legislation. The estimate also predicts that insurers would leave the market in response to the repeal, leaving large swaths of Americans with no options to buy coverage on the individual market. \u201cUnder this legislation, about half of the nation\u2019s population would live in areas having no insurer participating in the nongroup market in 2020 because of downward pressure on enrollment and upward pressure on premiums,\u201d the report said. \u201cThat share would continue to increase, extending to about three-quarters of the population by 2026.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
