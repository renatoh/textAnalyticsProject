The report by the government's strategy unit highlights the importance that sport plays in fighting crime, increasing health and social inclusion, and improving educational performance. It also notes the importance of staging major sporting events in Britain and details how such events can be secured and Britain's sporting performance improved. After the success of the Commonwealth Games in Manchester, Tessa Jowell, secretary of state for culture, media and sport, and the sports minister Richard Caborn have both been keen to bring other major events to Britain, claiming that they increase interest and participation as well as offering a feel-good factor. London is planning to bid for the 2012 Olympic Games, and football's World Cup and other major events could be placed on the agenda over the next 20 years with government backing. The report says that such bids must be backed and coordinated by the government and that all levels of expertise must be used. \"A 20-year strategy for bidding for mega events will be part of our wider vision for sport over the next two decades,\" the report notes. \"The UK regularly hosts successful major sporting events with little or no government involvement. But mega events such as the Olympic Games or world athletics championships can only succeed if central government is closely engaged from an early stage. \"To do this effectively, government needs to seek out and utilise the expertise that already exists and harness new skills to ensure that costs, benefits and risks are assessed before bidding takes place. We must have strong investment appraisal and project management capacity to ensure that the government is closely involved and able to ensure effective control and monitoring.\" The report was commissioned by the government in an attempt to improve Britain's sporting structure to increase success on the field of play, redefine the government's sporting aims and improve ways of delivering funding. The report notes that British success at major events \"boosts the profile of a sport and increases interest in participation. But experience shows that such interest is rarely sustained as facilities are poor and clubs do not have the capacity to meet new demand. The government has begun to address this\". Sport, the report states, needs to be better organised, with less bureaucracy and organisations, to ensure that funding reaches those groups that really need it. The structure of sport needs to be simplified and there needs to be more transparency and efficiency within sports' governing bodies. The amount of money being spent by sports councils is criticised, with the comment that they need to be streamlined so that more funds can go directly to sports programmes. The report calls for sport to be made more accountable to the government for the way that money is spent. In a detailed examination of the wider importance of sport, the report notes that it plays a crucial role in fighting crime, improving the nation's health and improving the educational performance of schoolchildren. Only 32% of adults in England take 30 minutes of moderate exercise five times a week, as recommended by health professionals. In Finland the rate is 70%. One of the recommendations is for a cross-departmental government team to be formed so that its benefits can be felt in as many areas as possible, such as health, crime and education. It also calls for the formation of a twin-track approach so that participation can be increased at the grassroots level while securing major events and ensuring British success in medals tables. Finland and Australia are the two countries that Britain should aspire to match. After years of complaint from sport's governing bodies that they get insufficient funding and attention from government, the report holds out the hope that if sport can prove it can deliver on the government's social agenda then it could receive substantial amounts of money. \"This government is about delivery and the equation for sport to solve is very simple,\" the report states. \"If sport can deliver on the government's agenda - as well as continuing to be fun - it will begin to unlock some of the huge sums of money that we are investing in delivery.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
