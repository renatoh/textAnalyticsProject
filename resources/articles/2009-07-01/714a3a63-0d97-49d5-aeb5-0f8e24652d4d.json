Having relinquished his grip on the Claret Jug, the 2007 and 2008 champion was asked about his prospects at St Andrews next year. The Irishman claimed that he had never played an Open at the home of golf. Had a forgettable performance from nine years ago just slipped his mind? Not really \u2013 back in 2000, he finished in a creditable tie for 20th. Is gin just the tonic? The greenkeeper at nearby Girvan golf club has been offered a novel new fertiliser. Lesley Gracie, master distiller at Hendrick's Gin, has been experimenting with the juice of the cucumbers she grows as an infusion for her alcohol. The results have been encouraging and she is going to supply her local links. Has she tried feeding gin to her lawns? \"No,\" she said, \"the problem with using gin is that the grass comes up half-cut.\" Tape is Evans-sent Five Live's latest golf reporter, Chris Evans, has been securing a prime parking spot for his canary-yellow Ferrari all week, just yards from the course entrance. However following a long Saturday prowling the fairways he got back to his motor to find that his registration plate had fallen off the front. As the DJ pondered what to do, a passing photographer supplied him with some tape, thus releasing him from a sticky situation. Changing rooms The BBC has been leading players who have finished their rounds to be interviewed in front of a bank of lockers which are luxuriously varnished and monogrammed. But this isn't the Turnberry clubhouse changing room \u2013 Hazel Irvine has been gently probing the pros in the world's most well-appointed prefabricated shack. Judging by the reaction of a red-faced Paul Lawrie on Saturday, it may also be the world's warmest prefab. Boy from the black stuff Darren Clarke prepared for his one-under-par final-round 69 with an unorthodox mode of relaxation. The gregarious Northern Irishman spent his Saturday evening drinking numerous pints of Guinness. Lawrie joins elite list Finally, Paul Lawrie was anything but red-faced after he achieved what is thought to be only the eighth albatross in Open history when he sank a four-iron to the 538-yard 7th in yesterday's final round. The 1999 champion joins the following list of players (complete records not available): 'Young' Tom Morris at Prestwick in 1870, taking three on the par-six 1st hole; Johnny Miller, Muirfield 1980, 5th hole, second round; Bill Rogers, Royal Birkdale 1983, 17th hole, first round; Manny Zerman, St Andrews 2000, 5th hole, second round; Jeff Maggert, Royal Lytham 2001, 6th hole, second round; Greg Owen, Royal Lytham, 2001, 11th hole, third round; Gary Evans, Royal Troon 2004, 4th hole, first round. mikey.stafford@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
