Then again Saido Berahino\u2019s reintegration into the West Bromwich Albion team is no ordinary change. Here he was sprung off the bench less than a fortnight after threatening to go on strike for not being allowed a transfer to Tottenham. The reaction could have been worse and it could have been better, even if West Brom\u2019s manager, Tony Pulis, praised the home support. He reckoned their welcome for Berahino was very positive. In truth, it was a mixture of boos and applause. Now Berahino needs to find the net. That is the best remedy to mend his relationship with supporters, a sentiment shared by his captain, Darren Fletcher, who believed there was an inevitability about the reception. \u201cThe fans are entitled to voice their opinion and that\u2019s fine,\u201d Fletcher said. \u201cBut if Saido scores a goal it will all be forgotten. They are proud of their club and they want players to stay here. \u201cThese things happen and Saido knows that. He knew what to expect and that the reaction could be mixed, but we know what football is like. If he starts working hard and producing for West Brom then he will have the fans back on his side and they will remember what a great player he has been and will continue to be for the club.\u201d Certainly Berahino offers something different to the stodgy combination of Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n and Rickie Lambert, who was replaced having made little impression. Only Newcastle have scored fewer goals thus far, with a game in hand on Monday evening, ensuring Virgil van Dijk enjoyed a simple and impressive start to life in the Southampton defence. The \u00a311.5m signing from Celtic said the leap in tempo from Scottish football was immediately noticeable and he now hopes to nail down a starting spot next to Jos\u00e9 Fonte, but is under pressure from Steven Caulker and Maya Yoshida. \u201cThe tempo is higher of course but I like to play football, so I\u2019m not like your typical Scottish player who likes to play long balls,\u201d Van Dijk said. \u201cThere is competition, definitely, but I\u2019ve been training and playing already at Celtic so I\u2019m fully fit. There are choices the coach needs to make, and I was very happy that I started. I just need to build on this and get to know everyone better.\u201d Van Dijk does not feel under pressure having cost such a significant amount and says playing for Ronald Koeman was a major attraction. \u201cThese days a lot of clubs pay a lot of money for players, it\u2019s the world we live in,\u201d the 24-year-old said. \u201cFor me it\u2019s not extra pressure. I just want to play and want to improve and enjoy as well. Ronald was a big factor. He was an amazing player and I think I can learn a lot off him.\u201d Man of the match Virgil van Dijk (Southampton)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
