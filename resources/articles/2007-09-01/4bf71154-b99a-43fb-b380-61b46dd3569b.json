We appreciated the email and phone call to apologise for the series of Grauniad errors that emerged when it was printed - although in truth we were amused rather than upset. And as we completed the clearing out of Mike's flat, which meant so much to him, our sombre mood was broken and we laughed out loud at the correction about my obituary that you published at the weekend (September 8). Thank you for the correction to that correction (September 11) letting the world know that I'm not dead yet. David Hopson West Wittering, West Sussex If Derek Beaumont (Letters, September 11) makes his cost comparison per page then the Guardian remains good value in real terms from more than 50 years ago. In my paper-round days the popular papers cost 2d for 8 pages, the equivalent to a farthing (\u00a30.0010416) per page, whereas today's colourful tome that is the Guardian of about 100 pages works out at \u00a30.008 per page. John Flowers Neath, West Glamorgan Michael Palin (So near and yet so far, G2, September 11), writes that \"Hungary, Poland, Lithuania and the Czechs [have all had] enlightened empires\". There is no such thing as an enlightened empire. All empires are created by invading other people's land, and we are all living with the consequences today. Huw Roberts Creigiau, Wales Shortly after moving house and long before a myriad of boxes were unpacked, I found the spirit measuring cap from a mixer bottle (Letters, September 10) an adequate, albeit rudimentary, egg cup. Colin Cupples Shrewsbury, Shropshire I use a net bag (Letters, September 11) to store the end bits of soap. When I have about six, the bag and its contents make an excellent shower/bath scrub with better foam than any liquid soap I have used.
