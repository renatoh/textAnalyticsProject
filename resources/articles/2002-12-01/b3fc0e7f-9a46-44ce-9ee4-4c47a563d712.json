Horus had been favourite for tomorrow's big race all week, a position now taken up by stablemate Cyfor Malta, connections of Horus evidently feeling the seven-year-old will be better served by today's longer trip. Tony Martin, who at the start of the week made it clear that Ross Moff was doubtful for the Tripleprint, has also taken up today's option. With a question mark remaining over Horus's jumping technique, Ross Moff looks the better option, though he was on the floor last time. One to beat them both might be Rith Dubh (2.55) , from the in-form Jonjo O'Neill stable. Winner of the four-mile chase at last season's Festival, Rith Dubh is no plodder and he went on to finish fourth in a valuable 3m1f handicap at Punchestown. Rith Dubh is a tricky ride but goes well for Liam Cooper, who can initiate a double on Darapour (1.10) . Back to form with a fluent win at Southwell last week, Darapour is capable of going close in this stronger company. He finished a creditable fourth behind It Takes Time here last season and runs off a 7lb lower mark now. It will be a major surprise if Rhinestone Cowboy (12.00) , one of jumping's most exciting prospects, fails to get O'Neill's day off to a winning start, and on a quality card Martin Pipe sends smart hurdler It Takes Time over fences for the first time in public. Better value could lie with The Villager (12.35) , who impressed with his jumping at Bangor. If he takes to the unique cross-country obstacles, well-handicapped Scotton Green (1.45) should go close and, although Sullys Hope (2.20) has done all his winning at Stratford, he ran well at Newbury last time when reunited with Ruby Walsh, who rode the five-year-old to an impressive victory last term. \u00b7 Trevor Beaumont has resigned as racing director of the British Horseracing Board after just one year in office. Beaumont cited the delay in the restructuring of the BHB board as his reason and stressed that the racing industry would be wrong to use his decision as further ammunition to \"undermine\" BHB chairman Peter Savill."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
