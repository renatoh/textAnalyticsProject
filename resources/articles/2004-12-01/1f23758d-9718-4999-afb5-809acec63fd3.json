In 1992, as the last part of my genealogical study, I went to Ghana to find the slave fort from which my great-great grandfather had been exported to the Caribbean. It was my first time in Africa and I expected to feel something deep in my spirit. I come from the Ga tribe around Accra, and what took me aback was the number of people who looked just like my family. Was Ghana everything you expected? One of the most significant moments was going to Elmina's Castle [a notorious slave fort] in Cape Coast. Because I had buried myself in the world of slavery during my research, I had seen pictures and plans and diagrams of the slaves' cells. I was on the road from Accra to Cape Coast and I started to cry. We turned a corner and there was Cape Coast Castle, one of the slave forts. I got off at the bus stop, walked up to the castle and couldn't stop crying: not because of the castle, although that moved me. It was the sea - the knowledge that millions of people died being transported across the Atlantic from that point. It moved me profoundly. I had no idea that looking at the sea would provoke that kind of reaction - it had never happened before and I'd been to the Caribbean hundreds of times and looked out at the sea. Did that visit inspire your play, Elmina's Kitchen? I wanted to say that part of the problem was that we still carry some of the subconscious inferiority that was put on us in that slave cell; that we haven't fully emancipated ourselves from that mental enslavement. That's why I called it Elmina's Kitchen. The castle was a monument to the dehumanisation of 60 million people under slavery. However, to everyone who lives there it was like a modern Madame Tussauds - it was just there. People were walking around doing their thing, playing music and sitting on the walls. It made me really angry - I wanted it to be treated with solemnity, but I got over that after a few days. Did you travel much in Ghana during your trip? I went up to Kumasi in the north for a few days. It's the homeland of the Ashanti, and I saw the Asantehene [King of the Ashanti tribe] and all these wonderful symbols of Ghanaian culture. Some old women on that bus ride from Cape Coast to Kumasi spoke to me in Ga and Fanti, and I asked why. They said it was because I looked like a Ga. By the time I returned to Accra I felt ready to go into the Ga community. I stayed in Accra for another week and by the time I flew home I had changed my name [from Ian Roberts] to Kwame, which means 'One most ancient', and taken a Ga surname - Kwei-Armah. Do you find travel inspirational? Whenever you land in a new city in a new country, it opens your eyes. When I come back home, it gives me a certain clarity. My parents are from Grenada - I have a house there now - and I remember visiting when I was 21. I saw that people of my social class could do one of two things: work on the beach or in the Coca-Cola factory. In this country, I could go to evening classes and university and school. I could learn and elevate myself. I realised I had no excuse; that trip really made me want to study. I now do a course every year - I've just finished my masters in screenwriting at the University of the Arts, London. That's what travelling does for me. \u00b7 Fix Up by Kwame Kwei-Armah opens at The Cottesloe, London, 16 December.
