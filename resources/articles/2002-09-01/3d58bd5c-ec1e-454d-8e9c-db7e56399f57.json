Forty yards long, its black lettering expressed the bitterness gnawing at the heart of Italian football. \"In a world of whores and opportunists,\" it said, \"we chose the most fitting representative. Goodbye, Ronaldo.\" A few hundred miles to the west, the Brazilian was preparing to welcome his wife to their new appartment near Real Madrid's training ground. Back in Milan, however, Internazionale's supporters, assembling to greet the delayed start of their league season, were still having a hard time overcoming the humiliation inflicted by his departure. \"I hope that's the last we hear of it,\" Massimo Moratti, Inter's president, said afterwards, keener to discuss the 1-0 victory over Torino with which his team had opened the Serie A season. \"It's time to turn the page.\" But there are many pages that will need to be turned if Italian football is to recover from the effects of a traumatic few months in which the perceived injustice of the World Cup disaster came on top of financial uncertainty among many prominent clubs together with a longer-term suspicion that, in strictly football terms, the Italian league no longer looks down on the rest of Europe. The postponement by a fortnight of the start of the Serie A programme, caused by the failure of several clubs to conclude deals with pay-TV stations, was one symbol. Ronaldo's ugly departure to the reigning champions of Europe, following in the footsteps of Zinedine Zidane, was another. After five seasons at Inter, where he spent far more time on the treatment table than on the pitch, Ronaldo's flight to Spain underlined what many have been saying for the past three or four seasons: that Serie A has fallen behind La Liga in terms of beautiful football, and behind the Premiership in terms of raw excitement. In what Marino Bartoletti, the editor of the magazine Calcio 2000, describes as \"the most embarrassing summer in the history of Italian football\", the imperial decline has been accompanied by the sound of the mighty crashing to earth. Fiorentina, the plaything of the movie mogul Vittorio Cecchi Gori, went bust so badly in the spring that they are starting life again under another name in Serie C2B, the equivalent of the Dr Martens League. Angelo Di Livio, the \"little soldier\" who played an important role in Juventus's European Cup exploits of the 90s, has gone down with them, accepting a tenth of his previous salary from the newly constituted Florentia Viola. \"It wasn't a difficult decision,\" he said last week. \"I didn't want to be remembered as the captain of a team that was relegated and a club that went bankrupt. Florence has shown me so much affection and this is a way to repay it.\" Lazio, winners of the league and cup double under Sven-Goran Eriksson only two years ago, are among the more spectacular victims of speculative investment. After counting the cost of Sergio Cragnotti's \u00a3300m investment over 10 years, funded by the Banca di Roma, they were forced to sell their best players - Hernan Crespo to Inter for \u00a328m, Alessandro Nesta to Milan for \u00a323m - on the eve of the season. Two years ago Cragnotti thought he saw the future. \"Television rights are exploding,\" he said, \"and we're only at the start.\" Yet last spring it was discovered that he could not pay his players' inflated salaries, and Lazio's transfer dealings at home and abroad were suspended. A couple of weeks ago their infuriated supporters wreaked \u00a3250,000 worth of damage to offices around the Olympic Stadium in Rome. Rash generosity fuelled by overweening ambition is a familiar recipe for disaster. In less than 20 years, Bartoletti pointed out, players' salaries have increased by a factor of 15. \"Now the clubs give seven, eight, or 10m euros a year to kids who are barely 20. Would it change much if that 10 became three, or that eight became two? Would these boys be less happy? Or would it give them a healthier attitude towards their lives and their profession?\" The postponement of the start of the season provided official confirmation of the turmoil within Italian football. Even the ITV Digital catastrophe did not interrupt the start of the British league programme. But the failure of eight smaller Serie A clubs to secure television deals in Italy's every-man-for-himself system created chaos requiring government intervention - and, eventually, the unprecedented agreement of Juventus, Roma, Lazio, Parma and the two Milan clubs to forfeit about \u00a34m of their own TV income in order to subsidise a collective agreement. This being Italy, what might elsewhere be seen as conflicts of interest are seen as making the world go round. The clubs' delegation to the emergency meeting with the culture minister two weeks ago was headed by the president of the Italian league, Adriano Galliani, who is better known as the highly visible vice-president of Milan. The owner of Milan, of course, is Silvio Berlusconi, prime minister of the republic, whose minister received Galliani's submission. Between them, inevitably, they sorted out a deal enabling the season to commence at the weekend. But although there were 66,000 at the San Siro to acclaim Christian Vieri's winning header for Inter against Torino, and 40,000 in the Stadio delle Alpi yesterday to see Alessandro Del Piero's two goals get Juventus's defence of their championship off to a winning start, plenty of problems remain. This week those two clubs, along with Roma and Milan, return to the Champions League, in which Italy's record has been abysmal by their standards since Juventus's last victory in 1996. Real Madrid's return to pre-eminence, and the renaissance of Spanish league football in general, combined with the increasing confidence of the English and German clubs, seems to have shoved Italian clubs back into a dour, introspective mood all too easily reflected in the functional conservatism that is the default mode of the Italian game. Nor can Italy get over the nature of the national team's departure from the World Cup. Every day the newspapers devote space to the latest news of the career of Byron Moreno, the Ecuadorian referee whose decisions were believed to favour the home team in the fateful match against South Korea. The Italian federation has finally persuaded Fifa to institute an inquiry into his performance in the World Cup, and the news that he has just been suspended for 20 matches by his national federation for letting a league match run more than 10 minutes over time has been greeted with sour amusement. Some are having greater difficulty than others in following Moratti's advice to turn the page. \"Nobody's saying anything about the Argentinian linesman who raised his flag to deny Tommasi the joy of a golden goal,\" a columnist in the Corriere dello Sport grumbled on Saturday morning. \"Maybe he's being protected by the shield of his compatriot [Julio] Grondona, the vice-president of Fifa.\" And in the bookshops of Milan there are piles of a slim volume by the journalist Luigi Garlando, published last week under the title Ronaldo - The Ungrateful King and written in the tone of a jilted lover. \"The day of the final of France 98,\" Garlando writes, \"Ronaldo said, 'I've lost the World Cup, but I've won the cup of life.' Four years later, try turning those words around. Ronaldo has won the World Cup, but lost the cup of life.\" The phenomenon they are calling calciocaos is composed of small events as well as large ones. Eriberto Silva, the Brazilian star of Chievo Verona, last season's Serie A surprise packet, suddenly announced in the summer that he had been playing under a false identity. Luciano Siqueira, as he is now known, is currently suspended, his case under consideration by the league. Equally strange, a 7.5% stake in Juventus taken by El Saadi Gadafy, the Libyan ruler's son, received acknowledgment a couple of weeks ago when the champions played Parma in Tripoli for the Italian Super Cup. At least the sun shone on Italian football throughout the weekend. But Inter were lucky to hang on to their points against opponents reduced to 10 men before half-time, needing a poor offside decision to enable them to send 66,000 fans home happy, while Juve, two goals up after 35 minutes, evidently decided that enough was enough and concentrated on keeping a clean sheet until Salvatore Fresi drove in a third in the last minute. \"Our football has overcome the destruction of a war, tragedies like the Superga air crash, disappointments like the failure to qualify for the 1958 World Cup and the eliminations of 1962 and 1966, and even the scandals of match-fixing and bribery,\" Bartoletti concluded last week. \"Evidently it must be immortal.\" Immortality, however, belongs to the gods. And, as those fans on the Curva Nord have worked out, at the moment there is nothing remotely divine about Italian football. 2002: How the game lost its lustre March Italian clubs fail to make the last eight of the Champions League, as Juventus and Roma are eliminated in the second group stage. Juventus's last home game, against Arsenal, attracts only 8,562 people. April Hopes of an all-Milanese final in the Uefa Cup are dashed when both sides are defeated in their respective semi-finals, Inter against Feyenoord and Milan by Borussia Dortmund. June Italy, one of the favourites to win the World Cup, endure a torrid tournament and are eliminated in the second round after scraping through their group. Accusations against the referee Byron Moreno. July Fiorentina, two-time league champions, but relegated in the 2001-02 season, were demoted from Serie B due to their parlous financial state. The club was placed in administration and then folded. The reborn club, Florentia Viola, must start in lowly Serie C2. August Despite the Milan clubs bucking the financial trend and signing players, Inter lost Ronaldo to Real Madrid. The Brazilian had put his injury nightmare behind him to score eight World Cup goals but signalled his intention to leave soon after. Lazio, who were threatened with exclusion from Serie A, were forced to sell Alessandro Nesta and Hernan Crespo. In response 300 fans went on the rampage causing \u00a3250,000 damage. September League season got off to a late start after a row over TV money. The two-week delay was caused as eight clubs were left without a pay-per-view deal. They backed down after the big clubs agreed to help them out financially."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
