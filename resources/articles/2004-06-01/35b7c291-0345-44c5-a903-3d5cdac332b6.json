And while the hype surrounding Wayne Rooney is hotter than a Saharan bonfire that's been doused in Hai Karate, this is surely going down to the wire. Extra time, anyone? Atmosphere, etc: The England fans are everywhere in the Estadio da Luz. They might even outnumber the Portuguese, you know. Incidentally, there's no Ledley King on England's bench - he's flown home because his girlfriend's gone into labour. 1 min: After both national anthems are lustily belted out, referee Urs Meier peep! peeps! on his whistle and we're off. Incidentally, Meier, is a grocer by trade and speaks four languages: English, French, German and Spanish. But not Portuguese... 2 min: It's a fantastic atmosphere so far, with lots of boozy cries of \"Ing-er-land\" from the England supporters, while the Portuguese are whistling like Sheepdog Trials' champions. Ronaldo tries to go round Gary Neville, but the United defender gets his foot in. 3 min: GOAL! 1 - 0 ENGLAND! Costinha fails to deal with a classic 50-yard England punt down field and lets it skim backwards off his head - straight into Michael's Owen path. In a blur the Liverpool twists his body and flicks the ball over the despairing Richardo. What a goal! What a start! 6 min: Great block Ashley Cole! Ronaldo has a sniff of a chance, eight yards out, but Cole gets slides in and England clear. 8 min: Sean Moore from New York has just had a dream where England won tonight's game 5-1. \"Scary stuff, eh?\" he says, adding: \"Would you like the time each one happens?\" Er, I think I'll pass. 10 min: England might be ahead, but Portugal are - like Arnold Schwarzenegger in his Mr Universe prime - pressing hard. In the space of a minute, Maniche's 20-yard fizzer is tipped over by David James, and Nuno Gomes' flick misses the far post by inches... 12 min: Rooney niftily side-steps Carvalho before being cynically tugged down 25 yards out. Listen to those whistles as David Beckham lines up a free-kick.... 13 min: ... and thuds it into the wall. Still, it falls to Rooney, but from a tight angle Ricardo is able to smother Boy Wonder's shot. Better from England. 16 min: Speaking of Rooney, Matt Stratford has come up with a \"Rooney-worshipping chant\". (To the tune of Chesney Hawkes' I Am The One And Only). \"Rooney/ Call him by his name/ His friends can call him Wayne/ But for England's fans/ He can be saviour\". It drags on for another two verses, but I'll spare you the particularly grizzly third stanza. Needles to say, Matt is a student. 18 min: Portugal are having most of the possession. It won't surprise you that England already have 10 men behind the ball, a la the France game. Yes, after 18 minutes! 19 min: So nearly 2-0! Lampard's perfectly-timed pass falls into the path of Owen, who tries to repeat his twist-n-flick move that brought the first goal. It lofts over Richardo ... but also over the bar. 22 min: [Minute-by-minute reporter dips into his bumper book of football cliches] It really is end-to-end off stuff at the moment. First Costinha's header flashes over, and then, less than 60 seconds later Campbell misses an even easier chance from six yards. 23 min: Incidentally, John Motson commentating on the BBC followed up Campbell's header with this comment: \"There are centre halves, there are giants and then there's Sol Campbell.\" Oh, please. 25 min: Worrying signs this for England. Not only is Wayne Rooney off the pitch with a twisted ankle, but David James has just flapped like a migrating bird at a straightforward cross. Fortunately, as Ronaldo pounced the England keeper grabbed the ball at his third attempt. 27 min: Rooney is back on, but he's hobbling badly. And England sub alert he's just been replaced by Darius Vassell. 29 min: Portugal are starting to dominate, and Ronaldo has just won them a dubious free-kick on the edge of the penalty area. Luis Figo steps up... 30 min: ... and skies it high over the bar. Meanwhile England suddenly fast break, NBA-style, and find Owen - who produces a superb one-handed save from Ricardo. For a change the Liverpool striker is having a decent game. 33 min: Now it's Portugal's turn to attack. But no alarms this time for England as Deco screws his shot well wide of James' far post. \"Rooney, Schmooney. Bring back Heskey,\" opines Matthew Thomas, whom I'm guessing is Welsh (or bonkers). 35 min: Owen, who's currently fizzing like a freshly-opened can of Dr Pepper, comes close again! He drops into Wayne Rooney's support-striker role, before unleashing a shot which is deflected over. 37 min: Deco speeds clear before he's taken out by Gerrard. Yellow card! 38 min: The Portuguese playmaker gets up ... and skies the 30-yard free-kick horribly over. Think Jaap Stam's penalty miss for the Dutch in 2000 and you're getting warm. 41 min: Brilliant tackle Sol Campbell! Scholes loses it in a promising position and Portugal race clear. The ever-impressive Ronaldo exchanges a nifty one-two with Deco before Campbell gets his size 11s stuck in, and England clear. 43 min: Missing the game? Well, think of poor Yvonne Aldridge. \"I am at work, single-handedly running a call-centre for Lloyds TSB in Brighton,\" she sobs. \"I have now missed three England games and am not at all happy. This is because the other two members of my team are, (unlike myself), male, and won't swap their shift with me. Their attitude on this is that girls should stick to kittens, not football.\" Enlightened folk then, Yvonne? 45 min: This is dangerous for England, as Gary Neville hauls down Ronaldo right on the edge of the box. Neville gets a yellow card ... can Figo take advantage? 45 min + 1 Oh bejesus no. The Portuguese captain hits a free-kick that's high and wide. Honestly, my minute-by-minute colleague Barry Glendenning could've done better with his hurling stick... HALF-TIME BANTER ETC \"Hold On! I'm with Yvonne [43 mins] right now... she's doing more checking of the website than running the call centre. And I've got to manage it tonight!\" - James Costello, Outbound 27 Team Leader, Lloyds TSB. \"To Yvonne Aldridge: I am too like you working for Lloyds TSB, but I've got the solution - get yourself a Portable Mini TV. It works wonders. This is the first game I have missed and luckily one of the men I work with brought me a Portable TV! So the men you work with need to wake up and smell the roses GIRLS like football too!\" - Anon. \"I am stuck in California and too cheap (and too poor!) to shell out for pay-per-view. I can't believe ESPN would rather show the World's Strongest Man over Euro 2004. Forgive me for finding the England-Portugal match marginally more interesting than watching some meatwads give themselves hernias trying to pull jumbo jets 20 yards using only their swingers. Hmm... actually, the way I just described it, it does sound more interesting! But it's not, sadly\" - Erika Larson. 46 min: We're off again! As the first half drifted on, England sat further and further back in their uber-defensive formation of which Sven is so fond. It cost them against France - will it do so again? 48 min: Another Figo shot, another horrible skewered effort that flies hopelessly wide. The Portugal captain is having a shocker. But Portugal are looking dangerous... 50 min: Five minutes into the second half, and England still haven't strung two passes together. They looked great for 20 minutes, but since Rooney's departure have been camped on the edge of the penalty box. Worrying signs these. 53 min: [Minute-by-minute reporter dons anorak] Possession stats - England 39%, Portugal 61%. 55 min: It's still all Portugal. They're not looking liking scoring though. \"Rooney injured?\" laughs Cameron X. \"That'll be his stigmata acting up, I suppose. Has a wailing and lamentation arisen in the stands?\" Not yet, Cameron. But if Portugal score then, well... 56 min: Yellow card! Costinha for chopping down the so-far ineffectual Beckham. 57 min: England sub. Just when you thought Sven Goran Houllier couldn't get any more defensive, Phil Neville comes on for Paul Scholes. 60 min: Yet more Portugal pressure. Figo whips in a deep cross, but Ronaldo's header flies over. England still haven't strung more than a couple of passes together this half. But, saying that, James is yet to make a decent save... 62 min: At last! England keep it amongst themselves - one, two, three, four passes! - before the flagging Gerrard gives it cheaply away. Portugal attack again, but Maniche's shot is easily saved by James. 64 min: \"Port-u-gal! Port-u-gal!\" cry the increasingly desperate Portuguese supporters. Meanwhile Big Phil has made a change: Simao on for Costinha. 67 min: So close from Simao, whose 20-yarder flashes past James' post. Surely an equaliser's on the cards? Meanwhile more of your watching woes. \"Our president in Venezuela has been talking on every single TV channel for the past seven hours!\" sobs Gabrielle. \"So we cannot watch the game either.\" And you thought Tony Blair/George W.Bush/delete as appropriate was bad... 69 min: England's 8-0-2 formation is still holding firm - for now - with Cole handling Ronaldo brilliantly, if sometimes illegally. Meanwhile David James has just made an excellent take (yes, really) from Nuno Valente's corner. 72 min: Corner England! [no, not a misprint] Terry's weak header is easily saved though. \"Cometh the hour, Cometh Phil 'Scapegoat extraordinaire' Neville,\" predicts William Jones. \"It's going to happen.\" 74 min: Better from England, who are a) keeping hold of the ball, and b) actually attacking. Can they suckerpunch the Portuguese? Or will they over commit and pay the price? 76 min: Now here's a surprise: Luis Figo off, Helder Postiga on (Yes, the hapless Spurs striker). Figo has a face like thunder as he trots off, straight down the tunnel. He'd just tested James with a scorcher, too. 79 min: Portugal have lost their way a bit here. Like George Foreman in the Rumble in the Jungle, they've have punched themselves out. Meanwhile Big Phil has just rolled his substitution dice for the final time: Rui Costa on for Miguel. 82 min: John Terry, who's again looked off the pace, is turned inside out by Postiga, who lays it back to Rui Costa, who lines up to shoot ... what a block from Sol Campbell! (who BBC co-commentator is now, God help us, comparing to Robocop). 83 min: England sub: Hargreaves on, Gerrard off. 84 min:GOAL! Portugal 1-1 England Would you believe it? Ronaldo's cross finds Helder \"two goals all season\" Postiga who expertly heads it past David James from eight yards. England suddenly look very, very tired... 86 min: Portugal are again pressing when Rui Costa loses it. Suddenly Vassell is scampering like a greyhound out of the blocks before Deco brings him down. Yellow card! 88 min: I've just seen the replay of Postiga's goal - he missed it with his head, and shouldered it in. Amazing. Meanwhile the Portuguese keeper Ricardo has just touched the ball for the first time in about 35 minutes - but only to hoof a backpass clear, mind. 90 min: Disallowed England goal! From a position of no danger, Andrade runs into trouble and Hargreaves robs him before being pulled back. Free kick England! Beckham's inswinger is met by Campbell, whose header CRASHES AGAINST THE BAR! It drops down and Campbell buries the rebound. Look at the England players celebrate! But wait! Terry had his arm round Ricardo's shoulder! Still, I've seen those given... 90+2 min: Now Portugal attack - but Valente's 30-yard speculator flies well over. Seconds later Meier blows on his whistle which means we're going into extra time (and I can pocket the money I had on a draw). 91 min: After lots of sups of Lucozade and massaging of calves (players, not random cows that have just trotted onto the pitch) we're off again. Incidentally we're playing under the silver goal rule - which means it's not sudden death, but if a team's ahead at half time (or full-time come to think of it) the match is over. 93 min: Brilliant from Ronaldo, who takes it round Ashley Cole before being cynically chopped down by Phil Neville. Yellow card! 95 min: It's pretty even so far. Beckham is definitely struggling though. Meanwhile Alex Whitney is an angry American. \"George Bush speaking for seven hours? Honestly, the man can barely last seven minutes. How often would he need to recycle his 350-word vocabulary to fudge his way through that? Every other minute or so?\" You have my apologies, Alex. 97 min: A rare England attack comes to nothing when Vassell essays the first touch of a Heskey. Both sides are looking desperately tired now. 99 min: Surprise, surprise: Portugal are doing all the attacking, although it's very scrappy. Rui Costa chips one over the top and Gary Neville unwisely grabs Nuno Gomes' shoulder. The Portuguese striker goes down, but the referee's having none of it. 101 min: Portugal are playing four - count em! - up front but they still can't work a way through England's obdurate defence. Suddenly England break and Beckham flashes a header just wide. 103 min: Now Portugal storm forward, only for Campbell to desperately block Postiga at the last. \"On behalf of neutral fans everywhere, England thoroughly deserve to lose,\" suggests Charles Bruggman. \"If you want to play the 'catenaccio' like the Italians - you should have the style of the Italians.\" What about Paul Scholes, Charles? 105 min: What drama! Lampard tries desperately to work an opening but Carvalho is there, snapping at his heels, forcing him wide. Both teams are going all out to win this... Half time 106 min: We're off again. \"I'm listening to Ian Dury (may he RIP) and Madness in hope of sending good vibes to England,\" says the brilliantly-monikered Rando Wilson from Ohio. Er, whatever works for you, Rando. 108 min: What a chance for Portugal! Deco feeds in Postiga, who's got half a yard on Terry on the edge of the box, but he swings and misses like a Sunday hacker on the first tee. Poor show. 110 min: Off the line! Simao (I think) should've scored but somehow he allowed Terry to clear. What a let off for England! But wait - Portugal attack again and Rui Costa shrugs off Phil Neville before hitting an absolute humdinger from 20-yards which crashes off the bar - and in! It's been coming, and it's Portugal 2-1 England. 112 min: For the first time in about 85 minutes England are trying to launch a sustained attack, and they're not finding it easy. Lots of long balls are easily mopped up by the Portuguese defence. 114 min: Another close shave for England. Simao expertly cuts inside before driving a piledriver past David James' outstretched fingers ... and past the post. 115 min: ENGLAND EQUALISE!!!! From nowhere, England win a corner. Terry flicks it on and it falls to Lampard, who swivels 180 degrees before blasting it home! England 2 -2 Portugal. 117 min: Attack! Attack! Attack! Neither side is settling for penalties here. Owen nearly nicks in, but Ricardo beats him to him. Then David James comes for a Portugal corner ... and flaps like a ill-fitting tent in a hurricane. Still, no one was there to follow it up. Lucky, lucky England. 119 min: Drama! Vassell charges down the field, twisting this way and that, before he's cynically chopped down by Carvalho. Yellow card! And more crucially, he earns a free-kick exactly in the position that led to Sol Campbell's disallowed goal. David Beckham is going to take it... 120 min: ... but it comes to nothing and Portugal clear. Seconds later, Urs Meier blows up and we're going to penalties. Penalties: Portugal win the toss and elect to go second. David Beckham steps up... and skies it horribly over the ball, Chris Waddle Italia 90 style. In fairness, the penalty spot is full of sand and heaped up like a rugby-style tee - actually, blow fairness: it was a poor penalty and England are already up against it. England 0 - 0 Portugal. Now it's Deco's turn. The England fans whistle menacingly, but the Porto midfielder jogs forward before confidently taps it in to James' right. He certainly didn't have any difficulties with the sandy spot. Perhaps being Brazilian helps? England 0 - 1 Portugal Michael \"50% for Liverpool\" Owen steps up ... and hits a lousy penalty, straight down the middle. Fortunately Ricardo dives out of the way like he's avoiding a grenade, and it nestles into the back of the net. England 1 - 1 Portugal. No problems for Simao - high and to James' left. So far these Portugeezers are making things look easy. England 1 - 2 Portugal. Frank Lampard steps up ... and hits an identikit penalty to Owen's, straight and low down the middle. Again Ricardo dives out of the way, and England are level. England 2 - 2 Portugal. Rui Costa misses! His shot flies wildly over the bar, David Beckham style! England 2 - 2 Portugal. John Terry whacks it high straight down the middle! What a penalty! England 3 - 2 Portugal. No problems for Cristiano Ronaldo, who shows the lack of nerves you'd expect from Peter Stringfellow on his 10,000th date. Great penalty. England 3 - 3 Portugal. Owen Hargreaves steps up ... and neatly side-foots home. Advantage England! England 4 - 3 Portugal. If Maniche misses this Portugal are out. But he doesn't - his low and hard is much to good for James, who hasn't got close to one yet... England 4 - 4 Portugal. Sudden death! Ashley Cole steps up ... and calmly side-foots it in. England 5 - 4 Portugal. Genius from Helder Postiga, who must have cajones of steel. As James dives, he dinks one straight over him, like he's hitting a particularly delicate chip shot. What a penalty! England 5 - 5 Portugal. Darius Vassell steps up ... AND IT'S SAVED! If Portugal score this England are out. England 5 - 5 Portugal. Unbelievable - The Portuguese keeper Ricardo is going to take this! He steps up ... and scores a brilliant penalty! England 5 - 6 Portugal. That's it, it's over England are out!
