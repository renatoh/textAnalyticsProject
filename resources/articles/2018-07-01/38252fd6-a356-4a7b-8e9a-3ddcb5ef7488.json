Nato is both a rip-off and very strong. Theresa May\u2019s Brexit plan is both pathetic and terrific. Trump\u2019s interview with the Sun was both fake news and generally fine. Trump has all the consistency of Katy Perry\u2019s Hot N Cold, except when it comes to two things: immigrants and Vladimir Putin. Immigration is where Trump\u2019s journey begins and ends: the message running all the way through this stick of rock. Trump told the Sun that immigration in Europe was \u201ca shame\u201d. Why such concern? \u201cI think it changed the fabric of Europe and, unless you act very quickly, it\u2019s never going to be what it was and I don\u2019t mean that in a positive way.\u201d Don\u2019t worry, Mr President. We didn\u2019t think you meant it in a positive way. There was a time when politicians like you preferred to use a dog whistle, but those days seem quaint now. There\u2019s something to be said for using a foghorn to blast your racism across the continents. At least we all know what kind of politics you represent. But just in case anyone had any doubts, Trump took his explicit nativism several steps into more sinister territory on Friday while standing next to the British prime minister. When asked about his \u201cfabric of Europe\u201d comments, Trump began by talking about terrorism, before explaining his thinking. \u201cI just think it\u2019s changing the culture. I think it\u2019s a very negative thing for Europe. I think it\u2019s very negative,\u201d he said, as if we didn\u2019t hear him the first time with the foghorn. \u201cAnd I know it\u2019s politically not necessarily correct to say that. But I\u2019ll say it and I\u2019ll say it loud. And I think they better watch themselves because you are changing the culture.\u201d They better watch themselves because you are changing the culture. There\u2019s a polite way to say this, but the time for good manners has long gone. The president of the United States just threatened the safety and security of immigrants the world over. Not just in Europe, he made clear, as he continued to talk about American immigration. \u201cWe have very bad immigration laws and we\u2019re, I mean, we\u2019re doing incredibly well considering the fact that we virtually don\u2019t have immigration laws,\u201d he explained. So now we know. The reason Trump ordered the separation of thousands of immigrant children from their parents \u2013 some never to be reunited again \u2013 was because they better watch themselves. They are changing the culture and it better stop or else they\u2019ll get hurt. Trump has mused before about how good it would be to deport people without judges messing things up. He doesn\u2019t consider his own country\u2019s ample immigration laws to be actual laws that he respects. It\u2019s one short step for a president \u2013 but one long step for democracy \u2013 to go from disrespecting the laws to ignoring them. This is the language and mentality of so many extreme-right and neo-Nazi parties in Europe. So in the Trump spirit of saying it loud, it\u2019s time to drop the euphemisms: Trump is today\u2019s first major government to be led by the racist far right. It\u2019s not some kind of new populist politics; it\u2019s the old National Front. It\u2019s more than \u201cnot normal\u201d \u2013 the media\u2019s favorite phrase for expressing disapproval with the way Trump is blowing up the old norms. Trump personifies the kind of extremist policies that were the wet dreams of the John Birch Society and George Wallace. This shouldn\u2019t be a surprise. This is a president who started with racist conspiracies about the birthplace of America\u2019s first black president, before launching his campaign with a racist rant about Mexican rapists. Once elected, after losing the popular vote, he rushed out his Muslim travel ban and has since unleashed his long-promised deportation force on anyone looking faintly Latino. At this point, there are many previously respectable leaders \u2013 at home and overseas \u2013 as well as administration officials and journalists who have fooled themselves into thinking they are some kind of moderating influence. They have failed. They are a cheap veneer of respectability on an explicitly and punitively racist president. The moral choices that Trump poses to anyone with a conscience or love of country are only made more clear by the ludicrous irony of his own story. The grandson of a German immigrant, Trump has married not one but two immigrants. He knows full well how hard it is to be an immigrant: his family was so ashamed of its German roots through two world wars that Trump continued to pretend he had Swedish roots at the time he put his name to The Art of the Deal. As any TV psychologist might observe, it was a continental-sized giveaway when Trump lied about his immigrant roots to the press after trashing Nato on Thursday. \u201cI have great respect for Germany,\u201d he said, after attacking the German government for months. \u201cMy father is from Germany.\u201d Fred Trump, father to Donald, was born in the Bronx. If you make a herculean effort, you can just about understand what Trump means when he complains that the culture is changing. It\u2019s true: the world is becoming more integrated and diverse right before his eyes. That diversity is not just a source of talent for America and Europe, but has long been the core test of our decency: the standard by which we judge ourselves. America\u2019s founding freedoms were in part to protect religious minorities persecuted elsewhere: the kind of people we\u2019d call asylum seekers today. Or, as Theresa May gamely put it on Friday: \u201cThe UK has a proud history of welcoming people who are fleeing persecution to our country. We have a proud history of welcoming people who want to come to our country to contribute to our economy and contribute to our society. And over the years, overall immigration has been good for the UK.\u201d Even the Brexit-leading prime minister, after an anti-immigrant Brexit campaign, has to admit the obvious. Another foreign leader might recognize those words as a rebuke. But not this president. Trump is the kind of person who digs around the darkest corners of the extreme-right internet to come up with some England First nonsense. \u201cYou don\u2019t hear the word England as much as you should,\u201d he told the Sun, spouting the kind of drivel that gives skinheads a bad name. \u201cI miss the name England,\u201d he said. If he read one of his many unexamined briefing papers, he might know that one of the likely conservative successors to Theresa May is the immigrant-sounding Sajid Javid, born Muslim in the north of England. His family shares a Pakistani heritage with the immigrant-sounding Sadiq Khan, the left-leaning London mayor Trump thinks is a terrorist sympathizer. Perhaps next time Trump visits London, he\u2019ll have to remember whether the bad guy is called Sajid or Sadiq. That\u2019s the problem when the culture changes. You better watch yourself, Donald."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
