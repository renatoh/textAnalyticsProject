In this two-part documentary, former Word presenter Katie Puckrik takes a deeper look at the brand of smooth, soul-inflected pop that evolved in mid-70s LA (think: Michael McDonald, Kenny Loggins, Hall &amp; Oates). A thought-provoking reappraisal of a critically neglected era of music. Mike Bradley Isle of Wight Festival 7pm, Sky Arts Highlights from the first day\u2019s performances at this year\u2019s musical spectacular, where the theme is \u201cpeace, love and the summer of \u201969\u201d: followed by sets from Lily Allen (9pm); the Courteneers (9.55pm); and Noel Gallagher\u2019s High-Flying Birds (11pm). Continues tomorrow and Sunday. MB Celebrity Gogglebox 9pm, Channel 4 Steph and Dom may have gone on to become mini-celebrities in their own lunch hour. Here\u2019s the real deal, though, as the opinionated likes of Rylan Clark-Neal (and mum Linda), Nick Grimshaw (and niece Liv), Gyles Brandreth, Sheila Hancock and Little Mix subject themselves to the show\u2019s benign Orwellian setup. Ali Catterall The Nile: Egypt\u2019s Great River With Bettany Hughes 9pm, Channel 5 Bettany Hughes boards a \u201cdahabiya\u201d to begin a four-part, 900-mile journey up the Nile from Cairo to the border with Sudan. Sandwiched between endless shots of the presenter, we salvage interesting looks at mummies, pyramids and the Rosetta Stone that make it all worthwhile. MB Jamestown 9pm, Sky One The soapy tale of new world power struggles reaches its last ever episode and Opechancanough is asserting his authority with a new plan for the town. Yeardley and Jocelyn go head to head one more time when she gives him a life-changing challenge. Who\u2019ll be the boss? High drama guaranteed. Hannah Verdier Nathan for You 11pm, Comedy Central A veritable Heath Robinson contraption of nonsense as this new series of Nathan Fielder pranks begins. Tonight, Nathan attempts to revitalise a struggling diner in California by way of a Michael \u201cKramer\u201d Richards impersonator, a startup newspaper and much more besides. Utterly ridiculous but very funny. Phil Harrison Film choice Everybody Wants Some!! (Richard Linklater, 2016) 12.55am, Film4 College baseball players chase girls, smoke pot and party like there\u2019s no game tomorrow: it could be horrendous, but Linklater\u2019s loose sequel to his 70s high-school comedy Dazed and Confused is a warm-hearted celebration of youthful high spirits, focused on Blake Jenner\u2019s winning performance as freshman Jake.
