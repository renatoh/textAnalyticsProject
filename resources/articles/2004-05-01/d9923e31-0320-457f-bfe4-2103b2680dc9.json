Relegation has made a fresh round of fire sales inevitable. However, though he is likely to end up at Tottenham, statements yesterday from the Leeds board that \"advanced talks\" were under way were being seen at White Hart Lane as an attempt to flag up Robinson's availability. \"We are in advanced talks but nothing is signed,\" said the Leeds chairman Gerald Krasner. \"Tottenham have put forward a figure but we cannot complete any deal at this stage; we hope to do so next week.\" Leeds would prefer not to have to pay Robinson's \u00a325,000 per week wages beyond the opening of the summer transfer window on May 31. But the board wants to maximise the transfer fee and the unilateral interest from Spurs, who do not wish to spend more than \u00a31.75m, does not assist their plan. Robinson has already agreed personal terms with Spurs as the move was inconclusively set up in January. Leeds wanted him back on loan immediately but Premier League rules outlaw players returning on loan to a club within 12 months of them selling him. Spurs will release Christian Ziege, Gustavo Poyet and Darren Anderton in the close season, while Jamie Redknapp has been offered a one-year extension to his contract. Danny Mills could be reunited with Jonathan Woodgate and Lee Bowyer, his former Leeds colleagues, and even Alan Smith, at Newcastle United next season. Sir Bobby Robson is anxious to sign a new right-back this summer and Mills, on loan all this season at Middlesbrough from Elland Road, fits the bill. Although Steve McClaren, Middlesbrough's manager, wants to sign Mills permanently, he is believed to be more anxious to secure the signature of Bolo Zenden, at present on loan from Chelsea. Crystal Palace's manager Iain Dowie has effectively ruled himself out of managing Leeds by saying he is to stay at Selhurst Park until the end of his contract next summer. Bolton are talking to the defender David Unsworth, 30, who has rejected a new two-deal at Everton."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
