The blog will be back tomorrow, of course. In the meantime, you can follow our rolling international Covid-19 coverage here. Here\u2019s what we learned today: Australia recorded seven new deaths, bringing the national tally to 48. Three were in New South Wales, two in Western Australia, and there was one each in Tasmania and South Australia. The federal government released modelling on the potential spread of Covid-19 in Australia, but it was based on overseas data. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said more modelling based on Australian data will be released \u201cin coming weeks\u201d. The Covid-19 pandemic has forced 70% of businesses in the hospitality sector to reduce the hours of their staff and 43% to either sack workers or place them on unpaid leave, new data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed. All Australian year 12 students will graduate in 2020 despite the interruption of Covid-19, after education ministers ruled out a \u201cyear 13\u201d to complete their studies in 2021. Victoria\u2019s schools will open for term 2 next Wednesday, but the premier, Daniel Andrews, urged students to learn from home if possible. A controversial anti-malaria drug will be given to Australian Covid-19 patients in hospitals outside of clinical trials, the federal government confirmed. Parliament will meet tomorrow, with Anthony Albanese saying Labor will support the jobkeeper payment scheme despite concerns some casual workers will be excluded. The government agreed to Labor\u2019s calls for a Senate select committee into the response to Covid-19. Straight-shooter chief medical officer Brendan Murphy was asked by a reporter Tuesday whether the modelling \u201cindicated anything about the relative effectiveness of different measures\u201d employed in Australia. Murphy replied: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t, unfortunately.\u201d Malcolm Farr on the government\u2019s release of Covid-19 modelling earlier today, which he calls one of the \u201codder moments of the public debate\u201d on the virus. AAP reports that despite the Northern Territory having dodged \u201ca lot of bullets\u201d in avoiding community transmission of Covid-19, the territory\u2019s chief health officer says a short-term lockdown of the affected area might have to occur in the event of an outbreak. There have been 28 cases of Covid-19 in the Territory, all related to international or interstate travel, making it the lowest per capita rate and the only Australian jurisdiction to so far record no deaths or community transmission. However, a cluster of cases in the remote Kimberley region of Western Australia, with a large, vulnerable Indigenous population bordering the NT, spooked government and health officials last week. \u201cWith that outbreak in the Kimberley region last week, we dodged a lot of bullets in that the cases there did not make their way into the Northern Territory,\u201d the NT chief health officer, Dr Hugh Heggie, said. \u201cThey are advising people that they should not be travelling, but it is a reality that people particularly from remote (Indigenous) communities will travel across borders without a visible line. Sometimes it\u2019s a back road and it still has to be acknowledged that there is a risk. \u201cWe have to manage very carefully people who are mixing in other places.\u201d Queensland\u2019s opposition leader, Deb Frecklington, has committed what Nine News is calling \u201ca big virus no-no\u201d \u2013 touching lots of things in a supermarket. She\u2019s been criticised for \u201chandling 20 different supermarket products and placing them all back on shelves\u201d in a video encouraging people to buy local products. All Australian year 12 students will graduate in 2020 despite the interruption of Covid-19, after education ministers ruled out a \u201cyear 13\u201d to complete their studies in 2021. Here\u2019s my colleague Paul Karp\u2019s wrap on the outcome of today\u2019s meeting of education ministers, which agreed that every student will receive an Australian Tertiary Admission Rank in 2020. FluTracking, a national online surveillance system that tracks symptoms of Covid-19 and the flu, has found historically low reporting of respiratory and cold-like symptoms in recent weeks. The system, which has run for the past 14 years, surveys tens of thousands of people in Australia and New Zealand. It\u2019s coordinator, the University of Newcastle public health physician Craig Dalton, said the latest weekly surveys suggested social distancing was having a positive impact not just for the rate of Covid-19 infections but for common flu symptoms such as cough and fever generally. \u201cThe social distancing the community have taken up leads to less opportunities to transmit virus between people, so few people are infected and fewer people get sick. The rapid social distancing by the general community may have averted a public health disaster,\u201d Dalton said. \u201cWe mustn\u2019t relax our vigilance, but these initial findings are early reassuring signs that social distancing is working. We have to continue with strong social distancing measures and aggressive case identification, contact tracing and isolation as well.\u201d The number of people participating in the FluTracking survey has surged during the pandemic. Some 5,000 new people have joined the survey in the last two weeks and more than 60,000 responses are being received in Australia each week. The survey has also found that of those surveyed who had contracted Covid-19, 27% reported a change in their taste or smell. Dalton said that was \u201ca new emerging symptom of Covid-19\u201d which could help alert doctors to the possibility of an infection. The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, remains in intensive care with Covid-19, but without the need for a ventilator. Here\u2019s the latest from the mother country: Greens leader Adam Bandt is unhappy at Labor\u2019s decision to push ahead with a Senate select committee into the government\u2019s response to Covid-19. The Greens had wanted a joint House and Senate oversight committee. The Australian Council of Trade Unions has released a statement about the jobkeeper legislation released by the minister for industrial relations, Christian Porter, on Tuesday. The ACTU reeled off a series of safeguards in the bill, to be debated by parliament and passed with Labor on Wednesday. The bill is: Strictly time-limited Applies only to employers eligible for the jobkeeper payment Protects the rate of pay for workers ensuring they are properly paid for all work undertaken at the legal hourly rate of pay, not artificially capped at the $1,500/fortnight wage subsidy Allows variation in working conditions only after consultation and in many cases requires the agreement of employees; and Allows any dispute to be arbitrated by the Fair Work Commission to ensure reasonableness and fairness The ACTU secretary, Sally McManus, said: We remain opposed to the restrictive eligibility rules which exclude millions of workers, in particular many casuals and visa workers who have lost or face losing their jobs because of the pandemic. \u201cThey should also be eligible to receive the payment as they face no less a financial struggle and should be supported to keep their jobs and connections to employers for when this crisis is over. \u201cWe will continue to campaign to have these workers covered by the jobkeeper payment.\u201d Western Australia recorded two new Covid-19 deaths, bringing the total number of deaths in the state to six. The WA health minister, Roger Cook, has told the media that a man and a woman, both in their 70s, died overnight. The woman died at the Royal Perth hospital. Cook said she had recently returned from overseas and had been staying in a Perth hotel as a part of mandatory quarantine. The man was a passenger on the Artania cruise ship. He died at Joondalup health campus. Six people have now died of the deadly virus in WA hospitals, including two foreign nationals from the Artania. It is the second death in WA related to the Artania cruise ship. We told you earlier that Facebook will now remove posts on its site falsely claiming a link between coronavirus and the rollout of 5G networks across the world. Now, our colleagues in the UK report that Whatsapp, the Facebook-owned messaging app, will impose a strict new limit on message forwarding in an effort to slow the dissemination of fake news on the platform. The prudential regulator has written to banks and insurance companies telling them they need to cut or put off paying dividends to their shareholders due to the coronavirus crisis. Company boards should also \u201cappropriately limit\u201d executive bonuses, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority chairman, Wayne Byres, said in a letter to deposit-taking institutions and insurers, sent on Tuesday. Apra\u2019s decision follows bans or limits on dividend payments overseas. They are banned entirely in New Zealand and most big UK banks have agreed not to pay them after a request from the Bank of England. Byres told banks and insurers Apra had given them room to spend capital on shoring up the economy during the pandemic. \u201cIn this context, Apra expects ADIs [approved deposit-taking institutions] and insurers to limit discretionary capital distributions in the months ahead, to ensure that they instead use buffers and maintain capacity to continue to lend and underwrite insurance,\u201d he said in the letter. \u201cThis includes prudent reductions in dividends, taking into account the uncertain outlook for the operating environment and the need to preserve capacity to prioritise these critical activities. \u201cDuring this period, Apra expects that ADIs and insurers will seriously consider deferring decisions on the appropriate level of dividends until the outlook is clearer.\u201d Dividends should only be paid after \u201crobust stress-testing\u201d, agreed by the regulator, and at \u201ca materially reduced level\u201d, Byres said. You may have seen that earlier today the Australian Bureau of Statistics released new trade figures for February. It doesn\u2019t make for pleasant reading. The data shows exports fell $1.8bn or 5% and imports declined $1.5bn or 4% compared to January. Some industries were hit particularly hard. Australia\u2019s tourism-related exports \u2013 which includes education services \u2013 plunged 15%, a reflection of the early decision to close the border to China. Labor\u2019s shadow minister for trade, Madeleine King, has said it\u2019s likely those figures will continue to fall once March data is released, \u201cgiven the severe interruptions to supply chains and an expected decline in domestic demand\u201d. \u201cBut as I have said previously, Australia\u2019s export sector will be crucial for the economy in the grim weeks and months ahead,\u201d King said. \u201cIt is vital for the economy that our national borders remain open to trade, assuming that we can do so with the highest health protocols in place.\u201d Good evening. Thanks to Ben Doherty, both for his coverage and for his bad Doctor Who jokes. I\u2019ll be with you through the rest of tonight. If you missed it earlier today, the prime minister, Scott Morrison, addressed the media after the latest national cabinet meeting. Morrison told journalists Australia was making \u201csignificant progress\u201d in flattening the spread of Covid-19, but urged vigilance over the upcoming Easter holiday. \u201cWe must keep the tension in the cord,\u201d Morrison said. I\u2019m signing off now, handing over to my colleague, Michael McGowan. Thanks to all for your feedback and comments. Stay safe. Wash hands. Stay home. Meanwhile in the UK \u2026 as ever with Daleks, old mate\u2019s gonna struggle with stairs. How refreshingly straightforward politics is in NZ \u2026 a spade there is a spade, not a \u201csingle-operator manual earth-restructuring implement\u201d (thanks Bill Bryson). Stay at home: save lives. Very simple. A reminder, the Easter Bunny \u2013 and the Tooth Fairy \u2013 are officially considered essential workers in New Zealand (for children who lose a tooth eating chocolate). A final update from the Doherty Institute\u2019s modelling press briefing: Prof James McCaw, professor of mathematical biology and infectious diseases epidemiologist, University of Melbourne, says the team has started new work \u201cin the last few days\u201d to provide Australian governments with short-term outlooks on transmission, future load on the health system, and potential responses. He says it\u2019s like pivoting from long-term climate outlooks to daily weather forecasts. McCaw says there was a lot of talk six weeks ago about whether the nation could go into a four-week lockdown, which he did not see as a realistic long-term solution. \u201cIt\u2019s almost impossible to imagine this virus going extinct globally, which means it\u2019s here to stay.\u201d He says the transition to it not being a huge driver of complete societal change is a very difficult thing to work through. \u201cLuckily in Australia we can talk about that. We\u2019re in a position of calm, not crisis.\u201d The Labor opposition in NSW wants an independent and public inquiry into the disembarkation of passengers from the Ruby Princess. The cruise ship, which docked at Circular Quay in Port Jackson last month, is the original source of more than 660 infections in Australia, and at least 13 deaths. The Ruby Princess is currently docked at Port Kembla, south of Sydney, and NSW police are conducting a criminal investigation into how it was allowed to dock in Sydney and its passengers disembark. Facebook will now remove posts on its site falsely claiming a link between coronavirus and the rollout of 5G networks across the world. The company has already been taking down posts that encouraged users to deface or damage telecommunications masts in response, but now the company is going one step further to remove any post linking the coronavirus pandemic to 5G. Still, 5G misinformation groups are rife on Facebook, generally. Even searching \u201c5G\u2019 on Facebook brings up local opposition to it. YouTube has also been forced to pull down similar content of late, with a video circulating purporting to be from a former executive of a UK telco talking about the (false) link between 5G and coronavirus. Twitter (that bastion of reason and rationality - Eds) lit up with outrage with suggestions NSW Health was no longer going to report the cases associated with the disastrous decision to allow the Ruby Princess to dock in Sydney on 19 March. The speculation of a cover-up was prompted by a comment at Monday\u2019s briefing that because of the police investigation, the department had to be cautious about what it said about the Ruby Princess. The cruise ship has been the largest single source of cases in NSW and over 660 in Australia. But it turns out, we will still get numbers for the Ruby Princess. \u201cCurrent confirmed Covid-19 cases in NSW for passengers on the Ruby Princess, which docked 19 March, is 377 patients, (359 passengers + 18 crew members),\u201d a spokesman for NSW Health said this afternoon. \u201cThe number of people in the community connected to NSW Ruby Princess passengers confirmed as having COVID-19 is currently 12.\u201d \u201cThere have been six deaths reported in NSW from people associated with the Ruby Princess.\u201d He said the department would continue to provide Ruby Princess numbers while cases continued to grow but given the 14-day isolation period for passengers from the Ruby Princess was now complete it was likely case numbers would stabilise unless there was community spread. The spokesman said the department would, however, be cautious about talking about the decision-making around the disembarkation. An update from a modelling briefing from the Doherty Institute: From the Doherty Institute: Doherty Institute researchers have released their work on Covid-19 modelling to the general public. These models have been utilised by the commonwealth government in the public health response to Covid-19. It\u2019s important to note the modelling is based on preparedness scenarios to inform planning, they are not predictions. It informs the actions taken to slow the spread and prepare the health system. From Guardian Australia\u2019s Daniel Hurst: Prof Jodie McVernon, director of Doherty epidemiology, said the work that the Doherty Institute had done for government began with previous research on influenza pandemic. She said those models had been repurposed to inform the Covid-19 response plan. Initially it started with data from Wuhan, but it became clear this disease was well beyond the experience of influenza pandemic. It was later expanded to take in other international data. \u201cThe model is clearly very theoretical,\u201d McVernon said. For example it assumed infections uniformly across the country. \u201cThe purpose was to allow an estimate of the impact of different types of measures.\u201d It was clear early on that unmitigated spread of the virus would be \u201cwell beyond any high-income country\u2019s health system capacity\u201d. The government has emphasised that the measures taken so far had been effective in slowing the spread. More sad news, another landmark event in Australia\u2019s arts calendar, the Melbourne International Film festival, has had to cancel its 2020 edition. On Monday we reported on a plan by Centre Alliance\u2019s Rex Patrick to attempt to force parliament to sit sooner than 11 August by passing a motion that it continue to sit unless the government and opposition agree otherwise. Asked if Labor will vote to schedule more parliamentary sittings, Anthony Albanese said: Well ... we voted for that last time ... we\u2019ve already done that. That remains our position, that that should occur. But the truth is though it\u2019s up to the government at any time if the House of Representatives sits. And the prime minister can write to the speaker at any time to cancel sittings. We think it would\u2019ve been better to keep the parliamentary sitting schedule as it was. And if need be the speaker could be written to and those parliamentary dates not be proceeded with. The manager of opposition business in the Senate, Katy Gallagher, poured cold water on the idea the Senate could sit without the House: I think there are some issues around the House not sitting and the Senate sitting. But there are procedural limitations with regards to the government and their control of the program \u2026 You could quite easily be faced with the Senate sitting without any business coming forward, the government not bringing a program forward, and people raising questions about \u2018well, what good is that?\u2019 So, basically, Labor will keep scrutiny on the government through a Senate select committee on the Covid-19 response, but the idea Labor and the crossbench could team up to force parliament to return has been dismissed as impractical. China has reported zero daily deaths from coronavirus for the first time since January. My colleague Helen Davidson writes that while the milestone is significant, it comes as the nation struggles with ongoing outbreaks, including in the original hotspot, Wuhan, where dozens of residences have been locked down again. Border Force commissioner Michael Outram has responded to Guardian Australia\u2019s report earlier today of legal action that could block the government from evicting cruise ships from Australian waters. APT Touring has brought the federal court lawsuit over a ship it operates, the Caledonian Sky, which is currently moored in Darwin, but if it succeeds it could knock out a determination issued by health minister Greg Hunt on 27 March that ordered all foreign cruise vessels to leave Australian waters as soon as possible. Asked by Guardian Australia\u2019s Malcom Farr if he was aware of the lawsuit, Outram said the ABF was \u201cworking through that\u201d. \u201cBut let me make clear the government\u2019s policy intent here is that all cruise ships that are in Australian waters that are not flagged or registered in Australia are to depart Australian waters and we\u2019re working to achieve that outcome.\u201d Asked whether the case could have wider implications, he said that \u201cevery ship\u2019s individual\u201d. \u201cBut what I would I say is this: all of the ships we\u2019re focused [on] here are either registered in or flagged in another country.\u201d He said he had considered applications by cruise operators who wanted to keep their ships in Australian waters \u2013 and rejected them all. When the determination was made there were 20 cruise ships in Australian waters. \u201cThirteen of those 20 have left, or are in the process of leaving today, Australian ports and seas,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd by Thursday we expect a further four to have departed.\u201d He said this removed about 13,500 workers from Australian waters, who, if they had become sick, would have been \u201ca big strain on the Australian health system\u201d. Research from the Australia Institute suggests that Australia\u2019s private health insurers are set to make savings of between $3.5bn and $5.5bn \u2013 around half of their benefit payouts \u2013 over the next six months. This is because distancing measures, stay home advice to older Australians and closures mean visits to dentists, physios and other providers covered by extras payments will drop considerably. Consumer advocacy group Choice are asking health funds to \u201cstop charging people for services they can\u2019t get\u201d, and calling on health funds to reduce premiums by 50%. \u201cHealth funds must urgently take action to make sure people aren\u2019t paying for services they can\u2019t access,\u201d says Choice health insurance expert Dean Price. \u201cWe urge the industry to do the right thing for people and reduce their premiums by 50% across the board and more where possible. We will call out any private health insurer who is ripping people off by making them pay the full price but only getting half the service.\u201d In a bit of good news, it appears Coles is not suffering from lengthy queues after imposing strict customer limits inside stores. Yesterday Coles and Woolworths both placed limits on how many people could be inside their supermarkets at once. These limits are determined store by store, based on size, in an attempt to ensure supermarkets are not inundated over the Easter weekend. This means customers may be required to queue outside before they enter, however, for Coles at least, these lines don\u2019t appear to be lasting too long. \u201cOn Monday, the first day of the new measures, we had queues at less than 5% of stores at some point in the day, excluding the customers waiting for us to open either at 7am for Community Hour or 8am when we let everyone else in,\u201d said a spokesman for Coles. \u201cThe queues moved quickly and customers weren\u2019t kept waiting for more than a few minutes.\u201d \u201cOur modelling is that 87% of stores won\u2019t have a queue outside, and those that do will have a queue on average ~7% of the time. It\u2019s really only our busiest stores, at their busiest times of day. Most people will not even see a queue.\u201d Speaking of indefatigable, a doff of the facemask to sports editor Mike Hytner for filing a sports post when there is no sport being played. The marriage of reality TV and rugby league that is \u2018NRL Island\u2019: these are strange days. We\u2019ll know a lot more about the feasibility of the \u2018NRL Island\u2019 concept later this week, after the league\u2019s innovation committee meets on Thursday to discuss the idea of placing the entire cohort of players in an isolated \u201cbubble\u201d, potentially at a luxury Queensland resort, in a bid to rescue the suspended season. Larissa O\u2019Connor has more on that here. Former NSW captain Paul Gallen doesn\u2019t think it can work \u2013 he said players could not be expected to come out the other side as \u201cnormal human beings\u201d \u2013 but the concept is gathering momentum and the AFL is also now exploring the option of putting its players in a quarantine hub and playing out a modified form of its season. It doesn\u2019t take Paul Gallen \u2013 or for that matter the AFLPA president Patrick Dangerfield, who has expressed doubts over the viability for his code \u2013 to point out the potential pitfalls of such a scheme, but the concept of creating centralised hubs does appear to be gathering support in some quarters. Carlton coach David Teague said earlier today he was \u201call for\u201d the idea as long as it meant the season could get back up and running, while Sydney coach John Longmire said his club was \u201copen to anything\u201d. Collingwood president and AFL coronavirus cabinet member Eddie McGuire had yesterday proposed a four-hub plan across three states. The coronavirus pandemic has thrown sport across the globe in financial crisis and while the men\u2019s competition scrambles to save its season, there has been concern over the future viability of the entire women\u2019s competition. But Susan Alberti, the respected women\u2019s footy pioneer, said today she was confident the AFL had put too much time and effort in getting the AFLW up and running to let it fall over now. \u201cThe AFL are absolutely committed to the AFLW ... it\u2019s been a long time in the planning, it\u2019s here now, and it\u2019s not going away,\u201d Alberti told SEN. \u201cIt was quite sad how [the season] ended [without a premier being named], that\u2019s unfortunate, but they\u2019ll come back bigger, stronger and better next year. \u201cThe growth that I have seen in the game in the last few years has been remarkable. We\u2019ve got around 600,000 young women playing our game now and it\u2019s not going away, it\u2019s just going to get bigger and bigger. It just takes time.\u201d I\u2019ve just been through the latest data released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Covid-19\u2019s effect on business. It shows an extraordinary impact on the hospitality sector, in particular. The pandemic has forced a staggering 70% of businesses in the hospitality sector to reduce the hours of their staff and 43% to either sack workers or place them on unpaid leave. More broadly, two-thirds of businesses across all sectors reported taking a hit to revenue or cash flow due to Covid-19. One in 10 have had to pause operations entirely. The ABS data is based on a survey of 3,000 companies in the days after the government\u2019s tough social distancing restrictions were announced on 29 March. Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, and manager of opposition business in the Senate, Katy Gallagher, will stand up at 2.40pm to announce a Senate select committee into the government\u2019s response to Covid-19. This was on the cards for a few days \u2013 with the Greens, Centre Alliance and Jacqui Lambie all calling for more scrutiny \u2013 but the new development is that the government has signed up to support it. The committee will have broad terms of reference \u2013 encompassing both the health and economic aspects of the response \u2013 and will last for two years. Gallagher will chair it. Of course, a committee does not replace regular sittings of parliament \u2013 so it\u2019s possible there could still be fireworks about why parliament is adjourned until 11 August when parliament resumes briefly on Wednesday. This is Ben Doherty here, my thanks to Josh Taylor and all of my indefatigable colleagues for their earlier work. Post the prime minister\u2019s press conference, there is sad news to update. Matilda Boseley reports: Tasmania has recorded its third Covid-19 death. A man in his 80s died at the North West Regional Hospital today. He was a passenger on board the Ruby Princess. This brings Australia\u2019s death toll to 46. Will the future modelling include underlying assumptions? Morrison says the public is getting \u201ceverything we\u2019ve got\u201d. And that\u2019s it for now. I am handing over to my colleague Ben Doherty. The six months timeline was based on early work done, and the length of time the Australian government was able to provide support, Morrison says. He says it was important to have a realistic timeframe. He says Australia is the only country to the best of his knowledge to be thinking in terms of it running for six months at this stage. The $130bn jobkeeper package buys Australia the next six months, he says. Asked how many people would need to be immune in the community to prevent transmission, Murphy says some say 50-60% but he stresses Australia is not pursuing a path of herd immunity. Murphy says testing people with acute respiratory symptoms in cluster areas makes more sense than testing asymptomatic people more broadly, except for those in aged care facilities because of how much devastation the virus can wreak on people living in aged care. Murphy says more modelling will be released \u201cin coming weeks\u201d. Morrison says decisions need to be based on the right data, and we need to trust the science and research, and not force them to meet arbitrary deadlines. \u201cThere is no map for this. We are in uncharted territory ... what we have is time.\u201d Morrison says the national cabinet will look at all the information, and some states and territories might ease their restrictions before others. He says NSW and Victoria, and South East Queensland might wait to see how trials go elsewhere before easing restrictions given the bigger impact in those areas. Murphy says modellers have the data on nearly 6,000 cases, and once there is something useful, it will be provided to national cabinet and the public. It\u2019s too early to tell on trend data, but we will have much better data in the next week to 10 days, he says. There\u2019s still a lot of noise in the data from returning travellers. Murphy says the people who don\u2019t know they have coronavirus are why states like NSW are broadening testing in hotspot areas. He says fewer people are turning up to get tested because the flu is not spreading as much this season as in the past, so people don\u2019t have symptoms. Brendan Murphy says national cabinet will be presented with various scenarios on ways out of this crisis, including waiting for a vaccine or keeping the borders closed until there is one. Scott Morrison says if the scenarios go beyond the government\u2019s ability to support it for a period of time (for example, beyond the six months for the jobkeeper payment) this would not be supported. The modelling being released now won\u2019t show when we relax social distancing measures, Murphy says \u2013 that will come in the next round using Australian data and it\u2019s too early to say when that will happen. Future modelling will be based on actual real-world data from Australia on the recorded cases, Brendan Murphy says. Early indications are positive, he says, but we must not be complacent. Community transmission will be the focus of the modelling \u2013 the infectivity rate, where infections are occurring. He says returned travellers in quarantine hotels are still becoming ill with Covid-19. \u201cWe are not in any way out of trouble at the moment but we are in a relatively strong position to keep the pressure on,\u201d he says. The tools Australia is using are working and can be scaled up and down as needed. In theory we have the tools we can dial up to suppress the outbreak to manage within our resources, Murphy says. But he says Australia is doing even better than the best case theoretical modelling scenario right now. If there was an uncontrolled pandemic and 23 million people were infected at the same time, Murphy says, it would have been a \u201chorrendous scenario\u201d, with demand for 35,000-plus ICU beds every day. The would be beyond the realm of Australia to cope with, he says. He stresses that this is a highly artificial, unreal scenario. We are flattening the curve, Brendan Murphy says. Modellers have the Australian data now and will offer predictions based on this data. On the modelling, there are two papers from the Doherty Institute, on: Whether we have the right tools to manage the worst-case scenario. The risk of people travelling to Australia from other countries. Murphy stresses they\u2019re highly theoretical and not based on Australian data, but based on countries that have had significantly worse experiences with Covid-19 than Australia. Murphy says renal transplants have been stopped in Australia owing to virus risk but it is hoped that can start again as soon as possible. He says GPs are worried people that are too frightened to go to the doctor. He says this is concerning because people with chronic conditions need regular checkups. He says telehealth consultations are one option, and people shouldn\u2019t neglect general health conditions. The chief medical officer, Brendan Murphy, says as of this morning there are 5,844 confirmed cases, fewer than 100 people in ICUs and fewer than 40 people on ventilators. The big concern is the 500 community transmissions: we don\u2019t know where they contracted the virus. \u201cThat is why we cannot relax what we have been doing,\u201d he says, but he adds that there have been impressive reductions in infection rates. Schools were discussed at national cabinet and will be discussed on Thursday after education ministers meet today. Scott Morrison says it was not unexpected that Victoria would announce its plan today as schools near the term 2 start date. He says from the commonwealth\u2019s point of view, it\u2019s up to the states, but it wants to ensure parents can still send their children to school if they can\u2019t keep them at home. He says he doesn\u2019t want students to lose a year of their education. On the commercial tenancies code, Morrison says the national cabinet has agreed that a mandatory code will be legislated and regulated by the states and territories. The code will apply if the tenant or landlord is eligible for the jobkeeper program, where they have a turnover of $50m or less. Landlords must not terminate a lease or draw on securities. Tenants must honour leases. Landlords must reduce rent in proportion to lost turnover, and it can be a waiver or deferral, he says. There will be a binding mediation process. Morrison says the modelling will not show predictions, and media should not report it that way because that would be misleading. He says the data will help plan the way out. Morrison says Australia\u2019s coronavirus modelling will be released later today: You will have what we have... it is the full complement of what we have available to us. He says it is theoretical and is not based on case data, and does not predict what will happen in Australia in terms of how many people will contract the virus or will die from the virus, or how long it will last in Australia. This modelling, he says, draws on a broader international dataset, and proves the theory of flattening the curve \u2013 which is what is happening: Controlling the spread, boosting the capacity of our health system, and buying time, giving us the opportunity for more choices. \u201cWe must keep the tension in the cord,\u201d Scott Morrison says. Easter will be critically important, he says, telling people to stay at home. If people do not stay at home this weekend it will undo all the work that has been done, and \u201cpotentially worse\u201d. \u201cYou must follow these very helpful and straightforward requests we make of you.\u201d Morrison extends his concerns and support to the UK PM, Boris Johnson, who is in intensive care. Scott Morrison says Australia is making significant progress and we have avoided the thousands or tens of thousands of cases that could have happened with community transmission. The daily growth rate has been brought down but we must hold the course, he says. We must lock in these gains. It is providing us with much-needed time. We have so far avoided the horror scenarios we have seen overseas. And here\u2019s the PM\u2019s press conference. We are still waiting on the PM\u2019s press conference \u2013 it\u2019s slightly delayed. The industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, has held a press conference to give further detail on changes to law to implement the $1,500 fortnightly jobkeeper payment. A proposed final draft has now gone to the ACTU, Labor and employer groups ACCI and AiGroup. The main proposed changes are: Employers would be allowed to activate a \u201cjobkeeper enabling stand-down\u201d and alter their employees\u2019 hours of work if the employee can\u2019t be usefully employed at their full hours as a result of Covid-19. Employers will be able to alter the usual duties and location of employees\u2019 work, provided it is safe, reasonable, inside the employee\u2019s competency and the employer\u2019s usual scope of work. Employers and employees can agree to vary the days worked, and agree to use up annual leave while the employer is claiming jobkeeper and paying it on to the employee. This must be by agreement, but an employee cannot \u201cunreasonable refuse\u201d. Employees must keep at least two weeks annual leave in the tank as well. All three elements are reviewable by the Fair Work Commission, a crucial safeguard. Asked if the government has an estimate of how much of the $130bn wage subsidy employers could use to pay down leave entitlements, Porter said whether people are at work or taking leave, the subsidy will \u201csave that business and help that employee by subsidising their wage\u201d. Labor quibbles with this element of the package, because they believe it turns the wage subsidy into an employer subsidy. Porter was not pleased with that. He said: I don\u2019t accept it\u2019s a saving. Employers have no business. They\u2019re not doing very well at the moment. We\u2019re in the middle of an economic challenge like we\u2019ve never seen before. The $1,500 payments help the employee stay engaged to their employer, help the employer pay their employee. Whether or not they\u2019re paying their employee in a business with next to zero work to be on leave or doing something else for a couple of hours a week. Does it really matter that much? If it saves the employee\u2019s job and helps keep the business afloat. Is this really Labor\u2019s argument about this? The prime minister, Scott Morrison, will hold a press conference in about 15 minutes\u2019 time. This is after this morning\u2019s national cabinet meeting. There\u2019s expectation we could get the modelling of coronavirus cases in Australia today. APT Touring has taken legal action seeking to strike down a federal government order that all cruise ships leave Australian waters as soon as possible due to the coronavirus pandemic. If successful, the move would deal a major blow to the government\u2019s approach to the pandemic. APT\u2019s vessel, the Bahamas-flagged Caledonian Sky, is now moored in port at Darwin, but during a brief federal court hearing this morning it emerged that its legal action could affect all cruise ships now in Australia. These include the virus-riddled Ruby Princess and several other large cruise ships operated by the multinational company Carnival. On 27 March the federal government made a determination under the Biosecurity Act ordering the operators of foreign cruise ships \u201cas soon as reasonably practicable\u201d. This morning, judge Angus Stewart said because APT was arguing for orders about this section of the determination, the case \u201cpotentially affects all foreign cruise vessels in Australian territory and not only the particular vessel otherwise directly affected by this case\u201d. APT and Border Force have been contacted for comment. The case is to be heard next Wednesday. All ships will be gone from Queensland tomorrow, via AAP: All cruise ships will leave Queensland waters by Wednesday to limit the spread of COVID-19 across the state. Nine cruise ships had been off the coast and the four that now remain have been ordered to move out of Queensland waters by one minute before midnight on Wednesday. Health Minister Steven Miles says four of Queensland\u2019s five fatalities from the coronavirus were from people who had been on cruise ships. Passengers account for 119 cases of the virus in Queensland and a further six people have caught the virus from them. \u201cWe need to stop these cruise ships coming into Queensland and bringing the virus with them,\u201d Mr Miles said. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, is talking about the agreement between the unions and the government over the changes to industrial relations legislation to allow the jobkeeper payments. He says the safeguards protecting workers will be in the legislation. The opposition and the crossbench are still waiting to see the legislation before parliament sits tomorrow to pass the package. He also says it\u2019s not practical for parliament to sit regularly because of all the flights needed to be organised to get there at this time. But he says there will be a Senate select committee reviewing the government\u2019s coronavirus response. The Australian Taxation Office is making it easier for people to claim working-from-home expenses during the Covid-19 pandemic. Now all you will need to do is log all the hours you work at home from 1 March, and claim 80 cents an hour for that time. People who don\u2019t wish to do a claim that way can still do it the old way, and the ATO has said it will review this new method after this financial year. In South Australia it is OK to do driving lessons with someone in your household. Nine is reporting that two police officers in Sydney were fined for attending an event in the CBD on Saturday night. The Australian Bureau of Statistics is reporting that two-thirds of Australian businesses have reported a downturn in their turnover or cashflow as a result of Covid-19. That\u2019s where I leave you for this morning. My colleague Josh Taylor is now on deck and will keep you up to date with any Australian Covid-19 news that might arise. NSW Labor has called for a more extensive investigation into the handling of the Ruby Princess cruise ship. The ship docked in Sydney on 19 March and 2,700 people were allowed to disembark even though some showed symptoms of Covid-19. There are now more than 600 cases associated with the ship, and 13 deaths. NSW police launched a criminal investigation on Sunday. The state\u2019s opposition leader, Jodi McKay, today said: We absolutely support any investigation into criminal behaviour. But, as we\u2019ve said for a week now, we believe there needs to be a public, transparent inquiry with the powers of a royal commission. It\u2019s essential that this inquiry is arm\u2019s length from government and leaves absolutely no stone unturned ... This is a matter of public trust and I can say to you that the trust of the community has been overwhelmingly broken. If you are just joining us now here are a few key things that have happened this morning. South Australia has recorded its first Covid-19 death. A 75-year-old Adelaide man is said the have contracted the disease interstate. Victoria recorded 33 new cases, a jump up from yesterday\u2019s 23 and Sunday\u2019s 20. There has been talk of Victoria flattening the curve; this slight uptake could be a bump in the road. Victorian schools will reopen next Wednesday but the vast majority of students will be asked to learn from home. Children of essential workers and students for whom online learning isn\u2019t an option are still able to attend school campuses. NSW recorded three deaths overnight, bringing the state\u2019s total to 21. Parliament will meet tomorrow, with Anthony Albanese saying Labor will support the jobkeeper payment scheme despite concerns some casual workers will be excluded. Scott Morrison has tweeted his well wishes to Boris Johnson. The British prime minister, who has Covid-19, was moved to intensive care overnight. Here is a little more information about those NSW overnight Covid-19 figures I mentioned earlier. There are now 2,686 cases in the state, an increase of 49 from yesterday, with 229 people being treated in hospital, including 37 cases in intensive care units and 24 requiring ventilators. NSW recorded another three deaths overnight, bringing the state\u2019s total to 21. One thing to look out for today is the federal government releasing its modelling on different Covid-19 scenarios. This may give the public a better sense of how different tactics work in dealing with the pandemic, including potential death tolls. But the finance minister, Mathias Cormann, warned that these models shouldn\u2019t be taken as law and are only tools the government is using to estimate figures. The important thing to remember about modelling is that modelling doesn\u2019t predict the future. It presents you with certain potential scenarios, depending on the assumptions that you input into the model ... And it\u2019s very important to release that sort of information in the right context. In particular in the middle of a crisis. Calla Wahlquist and Daniel Hurst have this report on a University of Sydney model that suggests we could see new cases reduce to almost zero by July. There has been a lot of talk about Covid-19 treatments, cures and wonder drugs, but by far the most talked-about is hydroxychloroquine. Oliver Milman takes you through why this anti-malaria drug might not be the miracle solution some are describing it as. There have been reports this morning of a \u201cdeal\u201d between the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the industrial relations minister, Christian Porter, on changes needed to implement the $130bn wage subsidy jobkeeper payments. Guardian Australia understands that negotiations are still ongoing but talks have been constructive. As Labor has already indicated it will support the package it seems a foregone conclusion that changes will be made through the Fair Work Act rather than award by award. What has changed is the ACTU believes Porter has strengthened a clause allowing Fair Work Commission oversight of financially distressed employers\u2019 decisions to cut or increase workers\u2019 hours to make their hours match the $1,500 fortnightly payment. The ACTU is still pushing for increased eligibility for casuals, which Porter has so far refused to do. I do not expect an ACTU statement endorsing the particular legislation parliament will consider on Wednesday. Guardian Australia understands that Porter has ruled out changes to the Fair Work Act that go beyond implementing jobkeeper, so some of employers\u2019 more daring ambit claims to suspend unfair dismissal laws have not been taken up. This blog is looking at all the Covid-19 related news but there is, of course, another huge news story in Australia today. George Pell\u2019s conviction has been quashed by the high court of Australia. My colleague Luke Henriques-Gomes has all the details in another live blog. My colleague Christopher Knaus has this report on the government\u2019s callout for local companies to supply Covid-19 testing components. Here\u2019s a bit more information about the NSW healthcare funding the premier, Gladys Berejiklian, announced earlier. The total package will provide $104m in funding for the NSW healthcare sector. Here is a breakdown of where that money will go: $58m for health worker accommodation $25m for medical research and vaccine trials $11m for commercialisation of research products $10m of funding to partner with industry to boost domestic supply chains. In a statement, the premier\u2019s office specified that last $10m would go towards \u201cworking with NSW engineering, electrical and manufacturing businesses to urgently undertake pilot projects to produce ventilators and other critical medical equipment locally\u201d. The National Catholic Education Commission says it\u2019s worried that staff from low-fee Catholic schools will miss out on jobkeeper payments. Its executive director, Jacinta Collins, said: In low fee schools, staff salaries make up the majority of school expenditure, so a loss of even 15 or 20% of fee income \u2013 well below the required 30% threshold \u2013 will have an enormous impact on our staffing provision at a time when schools are being asked to deliver both onsite and remote learning. Jobkeeper doesn\u2019t solve the challenges low fees schools are experiencing; we need a solution that works for the whole sector. We are ready to work collaboratively with the government, and the rest of the sector, to come up with something effective and fair. I know plenty of us have been reaching for the pinot when five o\u2019clock hits but be careful, the habits you pick up in isolation might be tough to break when the country opens back up. Brigid Delaney has the full report: Tasmania has recorded three new cases overnight. The state total now sits at 89, including six healthcare workers. The premier, Peter Gutwein, says 34 Tasmanians have since recovered. Just on the deaths from overnight. So far we know of: Two deaths in NSW, bringing the state total to 21 One death in Victoria, bringing the state total to 11 One death in South Australia, the first in the state This brings our national death toll to 45. There are several cruise ship now floating in Queensland waters. The state\u2019s health minister, Steven Miles, said in a press conference this morning that they would soon be on their way. The cruise ships will be required to leave Queensland waters by midnight tomorrow night. Currently we have four ships in Queensland waters, two of which have refuelled and are on their way to rendezvous and then out of Queensland waters. One cruise ship is currently in the Brisbane port, fuelling up, and when it leaves today, the last one, Pacific Dawn, will come in to fuel and bunker up and will leave tomorrow. A 75-year-old man from metropolitan Adelaide died last night in the Royal Adelaide hospital. For more information about schools and their role in the Covid-19 crisis, check out this report from Sally Weale. Victoria\u2019s education minister, James Merlino, says the government will work with families to ensure all students have the capacity to learn from home. The vast majority of students, the vast majority of staff, will be working remotely, and we\u2019ll have small numbers of staff and small numbers of students at each of our schools across Victoria ... We\u2019re gonna make sure that every child, every student, gets the support that they need. And that will be in the technology space \u2013 we\u2019ve got around 4,000 sim cards, a thousand dongles, we\u2019re working with internet providers ... Every child that needs a laptop or a tablet will receive one. Every child. Victoria\u2019s schools will open for term 2 next Wednesday, but the premier, Daniel Andrews, has urged students to learn from home if possible. School is going to look very different in term 2. If you can learn from home, you must learn from home. He said there would be significant changes to year 12\u2019s VCE studies but the Victorian government planned for all assessments and exams to be completed this year. We\u2019re not about years 13 or people repeating. We think that we can get this done. Details of this 11th death have not yet been released. The premier, Daniel Andrews, says the state recorded 33 positive cases overnight, a rise from the previous two days. My colleague Michael McGowan has this report on last night\u2019s Q+A where health workers said they were struggling to source personal protective equipment. Mathias Cormann said although the government had moved to adjourn parliament until August it could be recalled if necessary. We have said that we would be prepared to explore the manner and the form in which the parliament might be able to come together. But that is not entirely straightforward. But it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re not able to bring the parliament back together if that is required, to deal with urgent matters. As we are doing now. And we reached agreement with the opposition when we last sat, on the circumstances and the processes to use if the parliament had to be recalled. The finance minister, Mathias Cormann, told ABC the government had not moved to include casual workers who have been with a company for less than 12 months in the jobkeeper payment program. No changes to what we\u2019ve announced. Long-term casuals, these are casuals that have been with the same employer for 12 months or more, will be covered by the jobkeeper payment ... And if you have been working for less than 12 months and you are out of work, and then, of course, you have the opportunity to apply for jobseeker payments. The NSW chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, has urged anyone with symptoms in certain areas with high rates of community transmission, to get tested for Covid-19. We take this opportunity to encourage people to come forward for testing if they\u2019ve got symptoms in the areas Waverley, Woollahra, Dee Why, Lake Macquarie, Manning, Nowra, Byron and Port Macquarie. In those areas, we have seen a case, or cases, of local transmission where we haven\u2019t been able to find the source. It is important at this time as we try and suppress the numbers of Covid-19 in the community that we basically elevate and raise testing levels in the vicinity of those areas. NSW has recorded three deaths overnight, bringing the state\u2019s total death to 21. A 90-year-old man who died in Liverpool hosptial was a resident of the Opal Care aged facility in Bankstown. This is the second death at this facility. An 87-year-old woman also died. She had been a passenger on the Ruby Princess cruise ship. The third death has previously been reported \u2013 a 90-year-old man who was a resident at the Dorothy Henderson Lodge. This is the sixth death from this facility. Forty-three people have now died in Australia. NSW has recorded 49 new cases of Covid-19, a decrease from yesterday\u2019s 57. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, has announced a $100m package to support frontline healthcare workers, including hotel accommodation. She also announced an additional $35m dollars which will go towards Covid-19 research. They want to protect their families, they want to protect their loved ones, and that\u2019s why we\u2019re offering free accommodation and free parking for our health workers so they don\u2019t have to worry about taking the disease home, and unintentionally passing it on to their loved ones. At least that\u2019s one less thing for them to have to worry about. The NSW premier, Gladys Berejiklian, is speaking now at her morning press conference. She has stressed that physical distancing must continue over the Easter weekend. As you\u2019ll hear from Dr Chant this morning, the number of new cases in New South Wales continues to stabilise and even decline. However, we are still increasingly concerned about the community-to-community transmission ... I know for a lot of people, a lot of us had our hearts set on going on holidays or doing something we\u2019d normally do at Easter, and we can\u2019t this year. The opposition leader, Anthony Albanese, has criticised the government\u2019s move to adjourn parliament until August. Parliaments around the world are continuing to sit. And that\u2019s important. We\u2019re a democracy. And in a democracy, you don\u2019t suspend it. It wasn\u2019t suspended during the Spanish flu, or world war one or world war two. This is quite an extraordinary decision that the government has made. And I think that Christian Porter, as the leader of the House, his dismissal that government ministers have better things to do than sit in parliament, was a bit breathtaking, frankly, for someone who holds that office. It can sit in a modified form, of course, as we are tomorrow. Shortages of personal protective equipment are creating a \u201ccatastrophic\u201d situation among vulnerable Indigenous groups, with some services on brink of closing doors. You can read the full report by Christopher Knaus and Lorena Allam here: Anthony Albanese is speaking now on ABC News Breakfast. The Labor leader says that, although he is concerned about casual workers, his party will still support the government\u2019s stimulus package. The changes were always going to go through, and I said we would support the package one hour after it was announced. So that was always our position. We remain concerned that 1.1 million casuals will miss out. We were against the super changes. That doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re going to play a blocking role, because overall, the benefit of having wage subsidies is too important. So we\u2019ll continue to argue our case. The big news across the world today is the UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, being admitted to intensive care for Covid-19 related illnesses. A No 10 spokesman said: Since Sunday evening, the prime minister has been under the care of doctors at St Thomas\u2019 hospital, in London, after being admitted with persistent symptoms of coronavirus. Over the course of this afternoon, the condition of the prime minister has worsened and, on the advice of his medical team, he has been moved to the intensive care unit at the hospital. The PM has asked foreign secretary Dominic Raab, who is the first secretary of state, to deputise for him where necessary. The PM is receiving excellent care, and thanks all NHS staff for their hard work and dedication. For more updates head to the Guardian\u2019s global live blog. Two more staff at a hospital in Tasmania\u2019s north-west have tested positive to the coronavirus, with authorities banning visitors from the facility. The new cases at the North West Regional hospital in Burnie were confirmed by the state\u2019s public health department on Monday night. It takes the number of NWRH staff who have tested positive to six, with an inpatient also previously testing positive. The NWRH has been closed to visitors, as has the Mersey community hospital near Devonport in the north, but exemptions exist on compassionate grounds. The inpatient had been taken to the Mersey community hospital before he or she tested positive. Health authorities are working to identify and contact any close contacts of the two staff with the virus. \u201cWe acknowledge the current situation is creating concern, both for staff and for the community,\u201d said the chief medical officer, Tony Lawler. All emergency patients from the Devonport region will be transported to Launceston general hospital as a temporary measure. Tasmania has recorded 89 virus cases and two deaths, one of them an elderly woman at the NWRH last month. \u2013 Reporting by Australian Associated Press Good morning and welcome to today\u2019s Australian coverage of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. We will bring you all the latest updates today, including from the meeting of education ministers who will discuss what to do about final-year assessments for year 12 students whose education has been disrupted by the crisis. Here\u2019s where things landed yesterday: Australia has now recorded 41 Covid-19 deaths after health officials confirmed six new deaths on Monday \u2013 three in NSW, two in Victoria and one in Western Australia. A 90-year-old man who died on Monday night was a resident at the Dorothy Henderson Lodge in western Sydney. He is the sixth resident from the aged care home to die after contracting the virus. An 84-year-old man who died in Western Australia had been a passenger onboard the Ruby Princess cruise ship. He is the 12th person who sailed on the ship to die. The NSW government said Airbnb had not been banned in the state, after earlier reports quoted a spokesperson from his office saying the rental accomodation site was now \u201cillegal\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
