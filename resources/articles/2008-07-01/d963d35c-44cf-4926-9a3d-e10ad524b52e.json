East-West vulnerable, dealer South: When Bocchi and Duboin sat in North-South seats this was the bidding: The auction at the other table: Versace's light overcall gave the bidding a momentum that it lacked in the other auction. Lauria's first double was a competitive move, which coupled with his later bid of three diamonds indicated that he had good values in support of his partner's suit. Molberg's 3NT was a gamble - he was hoping that his partner would provide a real diamond stopper and a trick on the side to go with six club winners and the ace of hearts. 3NT would have been beaten easily so Lauria's decision to double it was sound since it would have brought in a 300-point penalty. But Molberg now repented of his rashness, and removed to four clubs. However, Terje Aa in the North seat diagnosed that his partner must be very short in diamonds and that the club suit must be solid. His doubleton heart and excellent spade holding convinced him to raise to five clubs, which was doubled by Versace. Declarer could easily hold his losses to one trick in each major, and the Norwegians collected plus 550. A few days later, they collected the European title."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
