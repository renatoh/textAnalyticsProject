They take on Italy in Lille on Wednesday in their final group game and, despite earning only one point from their opening two matches, the door is still open for Martin O\u2019Neill and his players to sneak into the last 16. To do that, however, Ireland will have to roll back the years. It was in 2002 that they last won a game at a major tournament \u2013 Saudi Arabia were their rather obliging opponents in Japan on that occasion \u2013 and the memories of famous victories against one of the heavyweight nations at a European Championship or World Cup finals are fuzzier still. Beating Italy at Giants Stadium in New York is among them and what Ireland would do for a Ray Houghton moment, with or without the forward-roll goal celebration, against the same country 22 years on. \u201cOf course it\u2019s possible,\u201d Seamus Coleman said, when asked whether Ireland could defeat Italy. \u201cWe\u2019ve had some big results at international level.\u201d Yet Ireland know they will have to play with much more conviction than against Belgium to have any chance of producing a win like that against Germany in Dublin eight months ago. A shot on target would help \u2013 Thibaut Courtois did not have a save to make on Saturday \u2013 and Ireland also need to show far greater composure in possession. \u201cWe\u2019re disappointed in ourselves that we didn\u2019t keep the ball better,\u201d Coleman said. The good news for Ireland is that Italy have won the group with a match to spare, leaving Antonio Conte with the option of resting key players. The bad news is O\u2019Neill is not exactly spoilt for choice when it comes to freshening things up, in particular in the attacking areas, where Ireland looked so toothless here. Robbie Keane, a wonderful servant for Ireland but fast approaching his 36th birthday, was the man O\u2019Neill turned to in the closing stages, perhaps to give Shane Long a rest for the Italy game as much as anything, because by that point Belgium were out of sight. Romelu Lukaku\u2019s opener, following a lovely interchange with the outstanding Kevin De Bruyne, put Belgium on the path to a restorative victory that eases the pressure on Marc Wilmots, who seemed to be doing his best to get involved with the goal celebrations. Axel Witsel\u2019s header doubled Belgium\u2019s lead and it was left to Lukaku, after some hare-brained defending from Ciaran Clark, to finish off Eden Hazard\u2019s neat approach work for the third. Bottom of the group, Ireland have it all to do if they are to prolong their stay in France. \u201cUp till this point we\u2019ve never done things the easy way,\u201d Brady said, alluding to their tricky qualifying campaign. \u201cIt always looks like we\u2019re \u2018all off\u2019 and then we come back, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be needing to do again. We\u2019ll be doing all we can to go and get a historic result to push ourselves through.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
