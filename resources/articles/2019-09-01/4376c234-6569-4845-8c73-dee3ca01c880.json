The Right to Farm Bill 2019, currently before the NSW parliament, can punish unlawful entry and disruption on \u201cinclosed lands\u201d with up to three years in jail, and increases the fine from $5,500 to $22,000. The bill is aimed at stopping animal rights protests on farms, but a range of groups and MPs say the wording would outlaw civil protest on any enclosed space, including schools, hospitals, mine sites or banks. Chris Gambian, the chief executive of the Nature Conservation Council of NSW, said the threat to protest was \u201chidden within this bill\u201d. \u201cIt includes farmers and knitting nanas protesting coal seam gas, unions on worksites, people staging a sit-in in corporate headquarters of a company, and more. On Tuesday, the independent NSW MP Justin Field proposed an amendment that inserts a clause so it \u201cdoes not apply to a person who is engaged in a genuine peaceful demonstration or protest\u201d. Without it, he said the new bill \u201cmassively increases penalties and introduces jail time for peaceful assembly and protest activities that have nothing to do with farming\u201d. Pauline Wright, the president of the NSW Civil Liberties Council, said the new law was unnecessary and the wording too broad. \u201cThese laws, although they are expressed to be talking about people coming onto farmlands and disturbing farmers going about their business, in fact they apply to any lands that are by definition enclosed \u2026 It is a crackdown on people\u2019s rights to protest.\u201d Wright said that existing laws against trespass already dealt with the issue adequately. The government had earlier increased the penalty from $550 to $5,500 in 2016. \u201cI can\u2019t see the purpose of these new laws,\u201d she said. \u201cThe existing laws already criminalise the behaviour that is targeted by this. It seems to just be grandstanding on the part of the politicians. \u201cWe of course don\u2019t like the notion of anyone entering on private land and acting unlawfully, and that shouldn\u2019t be condoned. And it\u2019s not. The law already adequately deals with that. Imposing tougher penalties won\u2019t do anything. All the research indicates this does not act as a deterrent.\u201d The proposed bill would amend the existing Inclosed Lands Protection Act 1901 to create harsher penalties. It would also add the words \u201cor hinder\u201d to the offence of \u201cinterfering with\u201d business on that land. Under the new penalty, a person would be fined $13,200 or imprisoned for a year (or both) if acting alone, and fined $22,000 and jailed for three years if with two other people or under other aggravating circumstances. Inclosed lands are defined by the act as \u201cany land, either public or private, inclosed or surrounded by any fence, wall or other erection, or by some natural feature \u2026including the whole or part of any building\u201d. But the agriculture minister, Adam Marshall, said the bill would not affect peaceful protests, and had been mischaracterised by \u201cminority groups\u201d. \u201cThis bill doesn\u2019t impinge on anyone\u2019s right to peacefully protest. It punishes those who break onto people\u2019s farms to cause upset and chaos to make a point,\u201d he said. \u201cThis bill does not infringe on rights conferred by any other piece of legislation, including union protests. A sit-in would also not be caught by these provisions as the penalties for simple trespass remain untouched. Nor would waving placards around or protesting on public land about agriculture \u2013 in fact, that happens almost every day in Martin Place already. \u201cWhat this bill does is give police the ability to punish those who break onto a farm and impede that farming business \u2026 It addresses a real need and gaps in the law.\u201d On Tuesday, the bill was referred by the Animal Justice Party to an inquiry, which will report back on 21 October. Unions NSW said it was examining the bill closely but was concerned it could inhibit the ability for unions to do their work. Thomas Costa, the assistant secretary of Unions NSW, said it was an attempt to legislate against people\u2019s rights to protest. \u201cThe Liberals have a track record of trying to criminalise dissent. They think they can legislate against it and frustrate our very legitimate right to protest,\u201d he said. \u201cThese laws are designed to intimidate activists against taking action. Even if they pass parliament, they won\u2019t quell activist spirit.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
