Not because of excessive enthusiasm about soya instead of old English beef, or even youth's reckless consumption of crisps. A more fundamental weakness has been unearthed by the celebrity (but thoughtful) chef Jamie Oliver in his televised experiences as a school cook. These led to one of this month's more memorable statistics. Mr Oliver has discovered that each of his temporary charges' meals, under the current system, costs 37p. Making every allowance for economies of scale, that is a pittance. It would have turned Mr Bumble the beadle rosy with pennypinching delight. What can you buy for 37p in the House of Commons' cheapest canteen? An apple (30p). Slightly more extravagantly, a large cup of tea (35p). Members of parliament might like to set themselves a test this week of producing five lunches which keep within this minuscule budget. There is a parental problem here. Britain has a legacy of derision about \"school dinners,\" from memories of watery cabbage to nostalgia for unhealthy dollops of pudding awash with a goo falsely called \"jam\". No one who has read it can forget Nigel Molesworth's Revolt of the Prunes at Geoffrey Willan's fictional school which was called, with good reason, St Custard's. Like the just-add-water potato dust and processed peas which drove a school dinner lady in Devon to resign in disgust this week, that custard was certainly powdered. So large numbers of children, with parental approval, skip the dinners and take in their own concoctions. But the opters-out, by and large, are pupils who are well-fed at breakfast and in the evening. An added cruelty of the 37p is that it is often feeding children who do not get enough - in quantity, balance, taste and nourishment - at home. Mr Oliver is sometimes criticised for his rich menu of ripe language. But on this issue, the dishing-up of what he memorably calls \"scrotum-burgers\" and such like, ripe language is in order. So is that 37p challenge to MPs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
