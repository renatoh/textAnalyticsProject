Those pale, cod-like eyes; the stately, fatal wit; an expression that rarely betrays anything but implacable boredom - well, you can just imagine him surrounded by white cats and red buttons. Flicking through the photographs in his new autobiography, I find myself wondering whether he has any teeth. Their last outing in front of the camera seems to have been in 1949, as he and his future wife, Jill, larked about, a rather fun-looking couple, on a beach. After that (at the wedding, on duty at the Royal Court Theatre Club, advertising Chunky Meat dog food, on the panel of Call My Bluff, learning how to fly a plane while on assignment for the Telegraph, on the cover of Paul McCartney's Band on the Run, campaigning for the Liberal Party and being installed as Rector of Dundee University in the presence of the Queen Mother), smiles are rare. And that's the way he likes it. Freud has built his career as a 'personality' on a charm-free charm. His cleverness, and his unapologetic desire to assert it, make him unique in the 'You like me! You like me!' world of entertainment he has ended up occupying. You only have to hear him steamrollering the opposition with his lists on Just A Minute to know that for him, the winning is really, really important - much more important than being loved, the more prosaic ambition of wits and jesters. 'I was always like that,' he says. 'My nanny told me that I didn't speak at all until I was two, and then I came out with some seven-syllable word because I knew I'd be laughed at if I said something childish. I think it's a younger-son thing.' This is the only remotely Sigmundy thing he says during our meeting. Grave, lugubrious, aloof: this is how I expect Freud to be. He does not disappoint. He tells me that another journalist said yesterday, 'We see you as a cuddly Alan Bennett sort of figure', and that his response was, 'Oh. It certainly isn't something that has occurred to me.' Admittedly, he smiles when I arrive, and with slightly more feeling when I leave - his teeth surprisingly small and neat, like a shark's - yet there's something disconcerting about the sight that reminds me of the trade entrances to restaurants. The autobiography, Freud Ego, is the opposite; it's a shop front. It is a dry and droll series of anecdotes illuminating Freud's progress from childhood to his 1973 election as a Liberal MP, via careers in catering, hotel management, night-club ownership, broadcasting and journalism. When traumatic events are mentioned - and his background is packed with dysfunction and vivid feuds - the tone is factual. It reads like a book written with fastidious care, and perhaps a little bit of distaste. 'It's something I've been almost desperate not to do. There were a lot of good reasons not to write an autobiography. There's a lot of my life which is private, which I didn't want to write about. I didn't want to write about my family, anything that would embarrass my children, my 14 grandchildren, the Liberal Party, Jeremy Thorpe... But then the right person asked at the right time and gave the right advance.' Freud says he has omitted everything but the most 'uncontroversial happenings' from the text, and this is mostly true. But there are a few moments when indignation or irritation surge to the surface. In conversation, he is prepared to go further. In the book, for instance, he fudges his parents' non-appearance at his 1950 church wedding to actress Jill Raymond (who now runs two theatre companies in Suffolk). My interpretation had been that they had not been invited. But he corrects me on this. They were asked but chose, as atheists, not to attend. Freud despises the way he was raised. His architect father, Ernst, one of Sigmund's six children, married an heiress whom he had met at Munich University, and the family moved from Berlin to London in 1933, 'refugees from the Nazis before the habit had caught on'. Ernst, though he rarely seemed to notice his three sons, was a more benevolent presence than Lucie, who was 'very beautiful and fairly distant', as her youngest son writes with magnificent understatement. 'When she came into the nursery she nodded to Stephen and me, and sat down with Lucian and whispered.' Elsewhere he writes that the three brothers 'were never taken anywhere but together, which is a rotten way to bring up children'. Clement, himself, has three sons (one is an adopted nephew) and two daughters, and his attitude to parenthood, the one career he has embraced with lasting fervour, has been pointedly different to that of Ernst and Lucie. When his children were little, there was a rota system in operation on Sunday afternoons: 'A tea dance with Nicola, a backgammon tournament with Dominic, a tug-of-war competition at Alexandra Palace with Ashley, a pantomime with Emma and Matthew... who were (still are) very close'. I wonder from what he and his eldest brother Stephen, who now sells painted doorknobs on Chiltern Street, felt they were being excluded in the nursery. 'Secrets,' he says without expression. The secrets continued long after childhood. He was in the States when his father died suddenly in 1970, but his mother never told him how, or where he was buried, though Lucian knew. 'Then my mother took an overdose. She was in St John Elizabeth hospital for four or five months. She never opened a conversation after that. She sat, and if you asked her a question she gave you a negative answer. So I don't know where my father was buried.' He says that going into restaurants, he occasionally caught himself wondering if he might see Ernst at another table. His mother, for the last 20 or so years of her life, showed no interest in Clement, though her relationship with her middle son grew more intense. 'After she came out of hospital, she just sat in St John's Wood in the house where we'd lived, and played Solitaire, and Lucian looked after her, picked her up every day, painted her - hundreds of paintings.' Lucie's death, at 93, was as mysterious as that of Ernst. 'She disappeared. There was no funeral, no service.' He looks at me as if I am mad when I ask whether this upsets him. 'No, no, you're really overemphasising this,' he murmurs. So you never wake up feeling angry about it? 'Oh, never! Never!' he says as if this is the craziest thing he has ever heard. So I say, 'Well, that's an achievement. Congratulations! Have you been in therapy about it?' and at last, he laughs. 'Never. I'm not sure I've ever met anyone who was improved by therapy.' We're sitting in the kitchen of his enormous, rather empty apartment in a central London mansion block, which he uses as a pied-\u00e0-terre when up from Suffolk. It has pale carpets and huge windows. Walking into it from the dark panelled wood of the stairwell is like the moment when a plane rises above cloud. 'There is a book,' he is saying, 'one of the many books about the Freud family, and this is wholly reported, in which my aunt Anna wrote to someone saying: \"How sad that Ernst and Lucie aren't together anymore.\" And that would be just about the time that Lucian was conceived. So it is possible - Lucian thought it was wholly bogus, but if you look at the three of us... I wouldn't write about it, because Lucian would sue you. But there was a special relationship between my mother and Lucian.' He and Lucian ('fearless, curly-haired, belligerent and artistic') grew temporarily close when the three boys were offered trophy scholarships to Dartington, but they seem to have had little in common. The last time the two met was at Christmas lunch in 1954 or '55. A few months later, Lucian turned up at Clement's nightclub and told the receptionist to find him urgently. He had wanted a loan, but Clement was out, and by the time he arrived, Lucian had stormed off in a fury. Clement has seen him only once since then, many years ago, as he and Dominic went into Marine Ices in north London, Lucian was prompted to evacuate it in a hurry. Now that Clement is 77, does he think about attempting a reconciliation? 'No, it has never occurred to me,' he says, returning to those faint, astonished tones. 'Lucian's fallen out with Francis Bacon... virtually all of the people who were close to him. Forgiveness. I'm not great at forgiving. If I decide that I don't like someone, that's it. It was the same in Parliament. I used to forget why I hated them, but by goodness... I remember with Jill Knight. I can't remember for the life of me what, but she did something that I found villainous, and that was it.' He looks almost amused. His voice is really super-soft, almost Lecterish at this point. He might be reading me a bedtime story. 'Even on parliamentary delegations, I wouldn't share a taxi with her.' The book is packed with examples of Freud's ferocious competitiveness. Early on he lists, only partly in jest, all his prep-school achievements: house captain, first-team soccer, cricket and squash, regular contributions to the school magazine. Later, he has perfect recall when it comes to scoring points off wing commanders, hotel guests, sniffy art experts. He is proud of the fact that he has never been beaten at table tennis by any of his children - though he admits he stopped playing Matthew just at the point at which defeat was looming. Perhaps, I suggest, beating his father at table tennis might be necessary for Matthew's development. 'Well,' he replies, 'I think my development's much more important.' It is, of course, a curiosity that Clement, who as a boy was always haunted by people's interest in his grandfather ('there was a niggling distaste for permanently being aligned as a relative'), now finds himself dogged by the fame of his brother and children: in particular the dark lustre of Matthew, the PR Svengali who recently married Elisabeth Murdoch, and whose profile now rivals that of most of his clients. Jonathan Self, brother of Will, may understand Clement's position more than most. This summer, he published a memoir called Self Abus , a peculiar cry for attention, in which he mentions conducting an affair with 'June', a fortysomething married woman, while he was 16. It was revealed simultaneously that June was in fact Jill, Clement's wife. 'Oh I heard about the book, I didn't see it,' Clement says, unmoved. 'I don't know anything about it. I know Jonathan because he helped with my elections, and Will.' Any curiosity about it? 'Jonathan's book? No...' At one point, Self writes, 'There was no question of deceiving June's husband, as they had an open marriage.' Is that true? Freud says, 'I don't know what an open marriage is.' Again, that perplexed, detached expression - his evasion is so polished, I feel oddly unembarrassed about trying yet again. Have his feelings towards Jonathan changed since the book came out? 'Absolutely not,' he says, indignantly. 'He came to our golden wedding anniversary, I saw him on the first night [of the Suffolk theatre production] this summer... I honestly don't know what you're talking about.' So yes, Freud is as spooky and unreadable as you might have imagined. Ask any of his friends. The writer Hunter Davies was invited to the races for Freud's seventieth birthday, along with other chums: the Lloyd Webbers, Melvyn Bragg, John Mortimer. 'I can't say I know him well,' Davies wrote in a newspaper account of the day. 'I've discussed him with people whom I assumed knew him much better than I did, and they said, No, they didn't really know him either.'
