Watmore, the FA chief executive, has met all the major broadcasters, particularly focusing on the BBC, in an effort to find a partner to screen the FA Cup. The BBC felt aggrieved after Watmore's predecessor, Brian Barwick, accepted ITV and Setanta's joint tender of \u00a3425m for England and FA Cup rights in 2007, having rejected two joint BBC-Sky bids insiders claim were worth \u00a3340m and \u00a3350m. Turner, the FA's head of broadcasting, was heavily involved in those rights negotiations, but his role was as the number-cruncher. As the final decision rested with Barwick, Turner is still in high regard at the BBC. There is some breathing space, since Turner secured up to \u00a329m in advances on Setanta's \u00a3150m four-year contract to broadcast FA Cup matches. But with ITV writing down the value of its \"onerous\" contracts with the FA by up to 25%, it is clear television executives believe FA Cup rights to be worth much less than when the ITV-Setanta deals were signed. Indeed since then the BBC has committed to a \u00a340m-a-year rights contract with Formula One, restricting its football budgets. With Wembley also having punched an \u00a385m hole in the FA's accounts last year, it is small wonder its directors would not go further than to say they \"have a reasonable expectation that the company has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future\". World Cup's \u00a315m gamble The Football Association put an additional burden on its finances of up to \u00a315m when it decided to bid for the 2018 World Cup. Although it is a gamble, that sum would be considered a small price to pay if Fifa awards England the tournament. Germany's 2006 event earned that nation's football federation around \u20ac150m. It is expected that the margins in this country, where fewer stadiums would require rebuilds - the sole advantage of the enormous Wembley construction debt - would be greater. If the FA fails, it is just another few millions lost. French dignity at stake Having taken legal advice in a meeting on Tuesday night over the case of J\u00e9r\u00e9my Boga, the 11-year-old who moved to Chelsea two years ago, ASPTT have chosen not to pursue the matter with Fifa. The amateur club from Marseille say the decision was taken \"for the good of the player\". But while other French football clubs attack the \"predatory\" nature of Premier League counterparts who engage some of their most promising players, it is perhaps worth considering criticisms of their own government. Yannick Bodin, an opposition senator and secretary of culture, education and communication commission, chided the secretary of state for sport, Bernard Laporte, during a senate debate for overlooking in his evidence the young African players who \"slip through the net\" in French football's academy system. According to Bodin, players \"recruited\" from Africa who fail to make the grade are \"expelled\" from academies and can find themselves in \"impossible situations to be considered like illegal immigrants\". He added: \"The French republic, which went to fetch these players, has responsibilities. It is a question of dignity.\" Fancy being a Bernie? Formula One's parent company has released its accounts, showing that only $84m (\u00a373m) of the $2.5bn in loans the company took out with a syndicate of banks led by the Royal Bank of Scotland in 2006 has been repaid in each of the past two years. Everyone knows that Fred 'the Shred' Goodwin was partial to a bit of motor racing (the former RBS chief executive was reportedly spotted in the paddock sporting tartan trousers matching those of the RBS ambassador Sir Jackie Stewart) but surely his bank was due a bit more return on its outlay? Insiders say CVC Capital, the private-equity house that owns the sport, intends to float Formula One on the stockmarket ready to repay the loans in 2014, meaning one day we all will have a chance to be a Bernie Ecclestone, right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
