It would be an exaggeration to suggest there is any kind of pressure building this early into the season but Hull\u2019s wait for a competitive victory goes on following the most remarkable of finishes in a cauldron of emotion by the banks of the River Humber. It is now over seven months since Lee Radford\u2019s side won a meaningful fixture, dating all the way back to their victory over Widnes last June. Since then Hull ended 2018 with a run of 11 consecutive league defeats, a sequence that stretched to 12 here following a fairly uninspiring start to 2019. Few of those losses have been as tough to take as this, though. Hull fans will take little consolation from the result or the manner of defeat of course but Jimmy Keinhorst\u2019s magnificent finish with the final play of the game was a fitting way to end another superb spectacle for the new-look Super League in 2019, following on from Thursday\u2019s electrifying opener between St Helens and Wigan. Here Bureta Faraimo\u2019s try with 13 minutes remaining looked as though it would be enough before Keinhorst struck in spectacular fashion. \u201cI\u2019m very happy for the club \u2013 we\u2019ve had a lot to contend with during the off-season and we\u2019ll be a lot more coherent as the season goes on,\u201d said the Hull KR coach, Tim Sheens. \u201cWhen the video referee was checking and checking I left my box, then I heard the cheering and I knew.\u201d Hull twice forged leads over the course of the evening, including a commanding 12-point advantage in the first half courtesy of tries from Sika Manu and Matty Dawson-Jones. Rovers responded well, though, Joel Tomkins and Mitch Garbutt replying; Josh Drinkwater converted both before adding a penalty to make it 14-12 at half-time. \u201cTheir heads were down when I went in the sheds but I gave them a bit of a bollocking and told them to pick themselves up,\u201d a typically upbeat, defiant Radford insisted afterwards. \u201cIf we continue to turn up with that attitude and we add some finesse down the other end, we\u2019ll be OK.\u201d Despite continuing to be stuck in this run of defeats it is hard to argue with the Hull coach. Had Rovers taken advantage of a period of prolonged pressure in the moments after half-time, the result might have been far more comfortable for the home fans. Instead it looked as though a litany of missed opportunities would prove to be fatal when, on 67 minutes, Faraimo charged over in robust fashion to put Hull back in the lead. Yet with seconds remaining Rovers, though looking out on their feet, kept the ball alive long enough for Keinhorst to dive over in the corner and send three-quarters of a near sold-out stadium into raptures. It is never dull in Hull, the locals are fond of saying, and how right they were in this particular instance.
