It turned out he was after a trial, complaining he could not do any worse than anyone actually employed by the club. His message came across loud and clear. On Saturday the culmination of a bone-chilling afternoon - even Andrei Kan- chelskis wore gloves - would appear to be that Joe Royle's team are returning to those days of Mancunian maudlin. The names and faces may change but there is just something about City, a genetic defect that yanks them back every time they seem to be making progress. To stand a realistic chance of survival they will need four wins now from their remaining eight games and, though that might not sound incredibly much, it cannot be overlooked that they have won only two of their last 21 league matches. Anything but an away victory at Valley Parade these days should be construed as a setback, yet there were times here when Bradford threatened to embarrass their guests. Confidence is clearly a lost commodity at Maine Road and what should have been a humdrum victory once Gerard Wiekens had scuffed them into the lead became an undignified toil when, for no apparent reason, their customary butterflies suddenly developed into full-blown jitters. Suddenly Bradford began playing with something curiously reminiscent of confidence and self-belief. Robbie Blake and Ashley Ward turned the game on its head with a goal apiece at the start of the second half and if the referee Steve Dunn had awarded any of five fair-to-middling Bradford penalty appeals the damage might well have been irreparable. The vagaries of officialdom have dealt Royle a poor hand in recent weeks but at the end of a match full of incident it would not have been inappropriate for the visiting manager to name Dunn as his man of the match. As it was, Shaun Goater equalised with 20 minutes to go but a draw did not suit anyone save Middlesbrough and, no one particularly happy, the fans shuffled away like a scene from an old LS Lowry print. For both clubs there are testing times ahead. \u0095 Four Manchester City fans were charged with singing racist abuse at the game, believed to be the first charge under the Football Offences Act, and 26 people were arrested for alleged public order offences."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
