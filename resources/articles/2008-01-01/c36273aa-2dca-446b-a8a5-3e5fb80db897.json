Communities Minister Stewart Maxwell will tomorrow reveal details of a \u00a324m funding package to assist people on low incomes to buy a home on the open market. The new Low-Cost Initiative for First-Time Buyers (Lift) and the Open Market Shared Equity Pilot will allow people to buy a majority share in a property on the open market through borrowing - normally between 60 and 80 per cent of the price - while a housing association funds the balance. According to recent figures from the Bank of Scotland, the rising cost of homes means buyers are being priced out of the market in most of Scotland. The number of first-time buyers in Scotland fell to a 20-year low this year. 'Housing supply is failing to match demand and first-time buyers are being priced out of the market, adding to the pressures on an already stretched social rented sector,' said Maxwell. 'The time to bring about change is now and we must seize the opportunity to do so.' Maxwell will launch an extension of the pilot scheme that has been trialled in Edinburgh and the Lothians to cover six further local authority areas that are property hotspots. 'Through Lift we are expanding shared-equity schemes and mortgage-related products and services,' said Maxwell. 'I am particularly keen to work with private lenders and investors to help achieve more shared-equity homes for first-time buyers, by taking forward our manifesto commitment to create a Scottish housing support fund.' The rising cost of homes has forced many younger people to move out of rural communities such as Arran, Braemar and Cairndow, where the influx of wealthy second-home owners has pushed up prices."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
