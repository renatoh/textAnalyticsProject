John Kostecki's Illbruck, which has led for three weeks and was more than 100 miles clear four days ago, was only 11.5 miles ahead yesterday morning, though it recovered to stretch its advantage to 25 miles with 65 remaining. Until then it had been going a knot slower than its pursuers . Of the four chasing boats Grant Dalton's Amer Sports One was best placed to challenge the leader last night. Dalton has the advantage of having Paul Cayard, who won the last Whitbread Round the World Race, on board and helping to define the strategy. Assa Abloy and Tyco were six miles farther back with Djuice two miles behind them. \"It is amazing how after 7,000 miles here we are stacked up in a row,\" wrote Mark Rudiger yesterday from Assa Abloy. \"It would be really exciting to have the other three boats here as well, although we have our hands full with these four. Now we have to survive a different endurance test: to try to stay focused and active in increasing heat and a light, frustrating wind. It's harder than you think.\" As the weather gets lighter, as it has in the past 24 hours, the pursuing boats hold the advantage. Illbruck was predicted to finish in the early hours of this morning but, with the breeze dying away, it may take several hours longer, prolonging the chances for the chasing pack to find ways of closing the gap. This has become a slow-paced, tactical battle. According to Tom Blackaller on Amer Sports One it is like \"watching grass grow; close grass growing, though\". As Illbruck has led for three weeks, across the ice strewn Southern Ocean for much of that time, it is generally felt that her crew deserve to win this leg. But try telling that to the other crews as they approach Rio. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
