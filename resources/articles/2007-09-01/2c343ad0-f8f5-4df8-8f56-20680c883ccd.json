Those Catholics and others who now feel that they have to resign from Amnesty over the abortion issue are certainly not \"prepared to halt this charity's activities\". It is highly likely that they will transfer their support to other human-rights groups that do not have the same high profile as Amnesty (not actually a charity) but which work in the same field. It is outrageous for Williams to suggest that the church wants to punish those teenage girls in the developing world who are dying because of unsafe abortions. Unborn children also have human rights. In a country like ours, in which almost 200,000 unborn growing children are killed every year, there should be a debate about abortion. It has to be and is a very serious moral issue, not just for Catholics. But this is a debate into which Amnesty did not have to enter. I, for one, and there are many Catholics like me, do not believe in automatically criminalising abortion. We should, rather, make it an option that no one would want to choose. Morality and criminality are not interchangeable concepts. God help adulterers were that the case. Amnesty's reputation has been built on a single issue: concern for those unjustly detained and cruelly treated anywhere in the world. Williams' claim that there has been a history of \"delicate cooperation\" between Amnesty and the Catholic church is just not true. Amnesty has had massive support from church people - and two of Amnesty's founders, Peter Benenson and Sean MacBride, were Catholics. I have been, over the years, to parishes and religious communities up and down the country where Amnesty has been enthusiastically supported. I well remember a visit to the late Father Paddy O'Mahony's church in Birmingham to greet a prisoner of conscience who, after years in prison without trial, had been released in part because of a stream of letters from that parish to the government responsible. The Amnesty candles, with their barbed wire, were on the altar as we stood to cheer him. Why should Amnesty now leave its traditional focus and take up a position supporting abortion? It is not a hands-on welfare body dealing with cases on the ground. Those women who have suffered the horror and indignity of rape will not be short of pastoral care from a range of humanitarian groups. At the 2007 Amnesty UK conference, a large majority voted that Amnesty should retain its neutral position. A rather smaller majority supported the changes proposed, but not a general endorsement for abortion as a right. This confusion is hardly a democratic basis for landing the thousands of UK Amnesty members with a new and divisive policy. At next year's conference there will be a proposal to allow Amnesty members to indicate whether they wish their subscription to be used for abortion purposes. I very much hope that Amnesty's leadership will see this as a flexible way forward which will respect the consciences of many supporters. \u00b7 Bruce Kent is an amnesty member and vice-president of the international Catholic peace movement Pax Christi bruce.kent@abolishwar.org.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
