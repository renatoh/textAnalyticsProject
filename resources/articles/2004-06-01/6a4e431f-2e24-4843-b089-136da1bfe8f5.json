What football?", "bodyText": "Sheltering the rose-pink walls of the Lapa Palace hotel, a huge Australian fig tree spreads across the gardens. In the pool below, a senatorial gentleman does the slowest breaststroke lengths, his ancient head erect above the water. Couples in designer swimwear and shades relax on the concentric circles of sunloungers arranged around the fountains and immaculate lawns. The English have arrived in Lisbon, but the chances of a riot, in truth, seem pretty slim. With Portuguese police gearing up for the entrance of the soccer fan, many visitors from our shores will be anxious to distinguish themselves from the hoi polloi, if only to avoid an embarrassing contretemps with a baton; as we reported last week, the English can all tend to look the same to the forces of law and order. A few not-too-subtle behavioural indicators are advisable: as we explain below, drink porto not pils; eat pasteis, not pasties; listen to fado, not The Farm. The following advice was culled from a brief trip to Lisbon with a tour operator who promises short breaks for \"discerning travellers\" - exactly the type of image you might wish to project this June. Peruse the finer arts While commentators drool about the artistry and craft of Figo and Ronaldo, a visit to the Fundacao Ricardo do Espirito Santo Silva should put all that in perspective. The foundation provides a home to the artisans who still practise centuries-old crafts such as cabinet making, bookbinding and wood-sculpting by hand. The techniques - and patience needed - are astonishing. In one room, a woman has been stitching an intricate rug for a year; in another, a team has spent months painstakingly reproducing a wooden decoration inspired by the Knights Templar. Alone in a workshop, Fernanda represents the fourth generation of her family to practice the art of hand-beating gold leaf. An ingot the size of a bar of chocolate will make over 5000 small (8cmx8cm) leaves. It's quite a sight to see her move from airily bashing an ingot with a five-kilo hammer to delicately handling the final fragile, translucent leaf. You can drop in to the foundation's museum of decorative arts (Largo das Portas do Sol, 2, entry \u20ac5, closed Mondays) which holds collections ranging from furniture to the ornate azulejos - porcelain tiles - that are such a distinctive feature of Lisbon's buildings. But guided tours of the workshops - far more interesting - can only be arranged by appointment. See www.fress.pt or email geral@fress.pt to arrange. Listen to fado Songs of pain and loss are all too familiar to English fans, but David Baddiel doing Three Lions doesn't quite have the emotional depth of Tina Santos wailing out fado. These traditional Portuguese songs provide the entertainment at several bars and restaurants through the city, most accessible in the Alfama district. The Parreirinha de Alfama (1 Beco do Espirito Santo, 21 886 8209) pulls in some of the biggest names; the food's nothing special but the music is free. Fado seems to range from the melancholy mood you might associate with tango to the upbeat folk of the French songwriting tradition, accompanied by guitarists - on the night I visited, two old fingersmiths who could have popped straight in from the Buena Vista Social Club. The female singers wore the classic Mediterranean look of long-etched mournfulness, as if they've never got over Eusebio's retirement, but the men were startling in their bank manager-esque normality. One who I had down as no more than a compere suddenly burst into song. He was smooth, suited, immaculate: think Des Lynam, but with dignity and music. Eat pasteis Like pasties? Not really. Pasteis de nata, or little custard pies, can be found all over, but the traditional favourite should be bought - or preferably fetched rather than queuing up with the tourists - from the Antiga Confeitaria de Belem (near the stunning Mosteiro dos Jeronimos, a 500-year-old world heritage monument). Dust them with cinnamon and icing sugar, and sip down with a little port (see below). Pass the port Or, in the vernacular, porto. Ideal as an aperitif or possibly a digestif, but - crucially - rarely swigged on the English terraces. To get to grips with the national drink in all its varied forms, try a degustation. In the Rio Tejo bar at the Lapa palace, you can do this in style, with an assortment of cheeses to bring out the best in each of five different glasses. It's done with a real flourish: for the piece de resistance - on my visit, a vintage Taylor Quinta de Vargellas, 1987 - a distinct technique is required to open the bottle. With the aid of a tenaz (heated tongs) and some cold water, the waiter cuts through the neck rather than risk crumbling the old cork into the port. It's expertly done to general applause; a discreet and genteel version of getting a cap off a beer bottle with your teeth. Tastings are also available at the Solar do Vinho do Porto - Lisbon's port institute, no less - in the Bairro Alto neighbourhood (rua de S. Pedro de Alc\u00e2ntara, 45, ivp.pt) Dress the part A few simple purchases should do the trick. Start at Nunes Corr\u00eaa (rua Augusta 250): these former tailors to the aristocracy have branches around the city, with a few modern concessions to off the peg designer labels. Pick up a hat and umbrella at Azevedo Rua (Rossio 73), and stroll uphill to Luvaria Ulisses, glove makers of distinction (rua do Carmo 87A) to complete the look. (They don't do goalie gloves.) Enjoy cafe society The Martinho da Arcada (Praca do Comercio 3) was around a century before football. Today, this national monument of a cafe doubles as a slightly pricey restaurant, but over the years dissidents, artists and poets all came in to drink absinthe and smoke. In case the chairs start flying, it's probably best to be away from the main squares. Uphill in the Chiado district is one of the most famous cafes, the art nouveau A Brasileira (122 rua Garett). You'll spot this establishment, running since 1895, by the statue of former patron, Fernando Pessoa, seated outside. Who did Pessoa play for, you ask? No one - he's Portugal's most famous 20th century poet. Leave town In a worst-case scenario, flee. A train to the beachy suburb of Cascais costs a mere euro; you can hire bikes there and cycle down to Guincho, where there are several excellent restaurants, including the Michelin-starred Porto de Santa Maria, overlooking the Atlantic. Or do it in style: tour operator Kirker Holidays can arrange a whole day private trip around Estoril, Cascais and Sintra by car with an English speaking driver for \u00a3145 (for up to four people) And one occasion where you might pretend to be a fan... The Portuguese Institute of Museums (IPM) is offering 20% off entry to all 28 of their museums until the end of July - with a voucher you can only find in their special Euro 2004 brochure, available on request in tourist offices in major towns and airports. Way to go Three nights at the Lapa Palace with Kirker Holidays costs from \u00a3692pp, based on two sharing, including return scheduled flights from London, private transfers, breakfast, and Kirker's unique sightseeing guide. See kirkerholidays.com or call 0870 112 3333 for reservations. \u00b7 The Portuguese tourist office advises that it's still possible to find both flights and accommodation for the next few weeks, if you're willing to be flexible. Both British Airways and TAP Air Portugal have added extra capacity to Portugal. There are still plenty of rooms available in the Algarve during the tournament. While most Lisbon city centre hotels are now full, there are places to stay in the surrounding region, for example Estoril and Cascais on the coast or the beautiful UNESCO World Heritage town of Sintra. And if you do find yourself drawn to the football, \"fan zones\" with giant screens will be set up in Lisbon in five locations; Pavilh\u00e3o Atl\u00e2ntico in the Park des Nac\u00f5es (the former site of Expo 98), Anfiteatro Keil do Amaral in the Monsanto park, in the lively Docas area at Doca dos Olivais and Doca de Santos, and in the \"fans square\" at Pra\u00e7a da Figueira."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
