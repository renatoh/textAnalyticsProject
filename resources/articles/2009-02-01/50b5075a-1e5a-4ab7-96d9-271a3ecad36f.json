The answer may well be \"Not a lot\", even if the England manager is unlikely to say as much in public \u2013 for the moment, at least. \"There's no such thing as a bad England team,\" Declan Kidney, the Ireland head coach, said before Steve Borthwick's side did a fair job of proving him wrong with this largely bereft performance in an exceedingly poor game. Johnson managed to contain his frustration until late in the match when replacement scrum-half Danny Care needlessly maintained England's appalling disciplinary record and was sent to the sin bin. Up in the stands, Johnson half stood before aiming a downward punch that would have done serious damage had anyone been in its way. Wins over the Pacific Islands and Italy are the only slivers of satisfaction Johnson has managed to gather up during his four months in charge. Offsetting these are the defeats by Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, Wales and now Ireland. Although Johnson is from a playing generation almost immediately adjacent to the present one, the gap between the two is wide. While his generation was brought up in the age of amateurism when celebrity status meant you appeared occasionally \u2013 and gratefully \u2013 on A Question of Sport, the current crop of top players consult first with their agents to see whether Question of... is quite right for their image (and their bank balance). There is a serious point here. The bond between a manager or coach and his team is fundamental to their success and evidence is emerging that the rapport between Johnson and his players, the very models of modern professionals, is not all it should be. The consequence has been plain for all to see on the pitch. Under Johnson, England have performed disjointedly, as if being guided by a man without a plan \u2013 or by a man without a plan that he can get across to players to whom he finds it hard to relate. The most obvious alienation has been between Johnson and fly-half Danny Cipriani, the epitome of the type of celebrity player Johnson cannot be doing with. Last March Cipriani, making his first start in an England shirt, was the key player as he contributed 18 points to the 33-10 win over Ireland at Twickenham. Twelve months on and he was not even on the bench as England flailed around for some sort of cohesion. To be fair to England, they did better in terms of the scoreline than most people predicted they would and in the first half, when they competed with great vigour at the breakdown, deservedly contained the Ireland effort. Along with their hosts, though, they produced very little constructive rugby and were drawn into a tiresome kicking contest. In the second half, they undermined a slightly more adventurous performance by their own acts of indiscipline, with first Phil Vickery and then Care spending 10 minutes in the sin bin. When Care departed, Johnson's show of spleen said it all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
