Generally, but not always. Professor Sir Alec Jeffreys had his almost 20 years ago, in the very same lab at Leicester University where we are now talking. He's even holding the very same grainy X-ray containing the DNA profile of his research assistant, Jenny Foxon, and her mum and dad, that gave him his eureka moment. \"It was 9.05 in the morning,\" he says, \"and I was looking at these extremely variable patterns of DNA. My first reaction to the results was that they were far too complicated. Then the penny dropped.\" Jeffreys began working on gene evolution at Leicester in the late 1970s, and by 1980 his research was focused on a minisatellite section of human DNA, which appeared to show more dramatic variations than other strands. He was trying to trace genetic markers through families in order to better understand the inheritance patterns of illness. But on September 10 1984, Jeffreys realised he hadn't found the key to a medical problem. Quite by accident, he had solved another problem entirely. He had established the method of biological identification that would become known as genetic fingerprinting. Within minutes of this realisation, Jeffreys began brainstorming possible applications and rapidly came up with forensics, paternity testing, identical twins and wildlife classification. That night his wife Sue added another - resolving immigration disputes. Even so, it wasn't a done deal. \"There were two main challenges,\" Jeffreys says. \"You wouldn't have hanged a dog on the evidence of our first sample, so we had to find a way of improving the quality of the image. And then there was the question of whether anyone would pay the slightest attention to our work. I somehow instinctively felt it just wouldn't take off.\" It took just three months to tweak the radioactive processes to produce substantially clearer DNA patterns, and by the end of 1984 Jeffreys had filed patents for his discovery. Winning over the scientific establishment took a little longer. But not much. In March 1985, the journal Nature, ran the first in a series of four articles to appear that year and the press quickly sniffed an angle. \"I think it helped that I called the process genetic fingerprinting,\" Jeffreys laughs. \"If I'd called it something more scientifically accurate, such as 'idiosyncratic sudden block minisatellite hybridisation profiles', then I'm not sure it would have caught people's imagination.\" As a result of the press coverage, Jeffreys got a letter from a solicitor at the Hammersmith and Fulham Community Law Centre asking for help in resolving a two-year immigration case involving a Ghanaian boy who had been stopped from entering the country on a forged passport. \"I said yes, though I didn't hold out much hope,\" Jeffreys says.\"For one thing, there were still question marks over the statistical independence of the process and, for another, the case was enormously complicated. No one was sure whether the boy was the mother in question's son, nephew or was completely unrelated: to make matters worse, the mother was not sure who the father was.\" In fact, identification turned out to be a doddle. Jeffreys was able to prove that not only was the woman the boy's birth mother, but that the other children shared the same father. It was a legally defining moment for genetic fingerprinting, and before long the process had been used to establish both the innocence of a man suspected of the murders of two women, and the guilt of the actual perpetrator. After that the floodgates opened and Jeffreys' team was involved in countless cases, including the identification of the body of Josef Mengele and verifying the authenticity of Dolly, the cloned sheep. \"DNA has proved to be a remarkably stable substance,\" Jeffreys points out. \"It degenerates in hot, humid and acid environments, but the oldest DNA fingerprint we have taken is of an 80,000-year old Neanderthal man.\" It was all good fun, but by the mid-90s Jeffreys had begun to lose interest. The science had been solved and genetic fingerprinting had been turned into a hi-tech production issue which he was happy to hive off to ICI. Amid all the excitement, it had largely gone unnoticed that Jeffreys' original discovery had been the accidental by-product of blue-skies research - his first DNA sample had come from grey seal muscle bought from the British Antarctic Survey - and Jeffreys questions whether the current academic climate would have been so forgiving. \"I'm not arguing that something like the discovery of genetic fingerprinting couldn't happen today,\" he says, choosing his words carefully. \"But both science and funders require more applied work these days, so projects like mine are less easy to support.\" But not once you've achieved success. Jeffreys was keen to get back to studying the two basic processes of genetic diversity - mutation and recombinational crossing over - and Leicester University and the Royal Society were happy to let him write his own brief. So for the last 10 years, through the study of human sperm, he has been trying to understand how DNA is organised - an essential starting point for the analysis of common human diseases. Jeffreys has not been looking at specific applications - though these may well arise - but only last week one of his colleagues, Professor Yuri Dubrova, announced findings that may well have implications for families affected by radiation poisoning. What Jeffreys' research has taught him is that the \u00a362m UK Biobank project to collect DNA and lifestyle details from half a million people is likely to be an expensive waste of time and money. \"All you've got is a basic snapshot,\" he says. \"You can't do regular check-ups, you're reliant on notoriously unreliable hospital records and the sample is far too small to study low-frequency diseases. To do Biobank properly would cost a totally unfeasible \u00a3100bn.\" \"You're far better off making a more focused study of individual diseases by concentrating on the people who suffer from them, and their families. If genes influence the risk of disease, you have to study family groups and Biobank makes no allowance for this. What's more, sufferers will be committed to a long-term longitudinal study and their health records are much more likely to be complete.\" Jeffreys' comments won't win him any favours from Professor John Newton, chief executive officer of Biobank, but his position is secure enough not to worry. Over the years, he's been awarded just about every scientific honour, including a knighthood, and the only one that's missing is a Nobel Laureate, something many colleagues regard as long overdue. Not that Jeffreys is desperate for the \u00a3700,000 or so that comes with the prize. Other universities have offered him inducements to leave Leicester over the years, but he's resisted all of them. \"Partly it's out of loyalty,\" he admits, \"but it's also because every offer has been to head up this, that and the other. But what I really want to do is carry on working in the lab.\" Jeffreys' loyalty to Leicester was recently rewarded when he came top in a popularity poll - ahead of Gary Lineker and the Attenboroughs - in the local paper. \"Hmm,\" he grunts. \"I'm not sure about the statistical reliability. Most people were away and I'm sure the university skewed the voting.\" But what about Gary Lineker's ears? I ask. \"Genetic or environmental?\" \"Environmental,\" he says,without a pause. \"Now, if you don't mind, I've got the BBC coming and I need a coffee and a cigarette.\" No greater love has any man than this, that he lays down his body for genetics.
