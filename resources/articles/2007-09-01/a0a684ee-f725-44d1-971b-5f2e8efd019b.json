France's clash with Ireland at the Stade de France tonight was expected to determine who went through to the quarter-finals as group champions, with the losers having a trip to Cardiff and the All Blacks to look forward to, but the knockout stage has started early for the hosts after their defeat to Argentina. Victory would guarantee Ireland a place in the last eight at France's expense, but they would have to wait until their final pool match, against the Pumas, to resolve whether they would be flying to Wales or revisiting the Stade de France to face, most likely, Scotland. If Les Bleus felt weighed down by the crush of expectation on the opening night, every mistake, slip and point scored against them tonight will be greeted with groans and anguished howls loud enough to carry down the adjacent railway track to the Gare du Nord. Ireland will be feeling every last degree of the same heat. The Irish have won their opening two matches, but they failed to dispatch Namibia with the same panache as the French and had to hang on grimly against Georgia, a country with only eight senior clubs. The Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan used the word crisis this week but, if that sounded over the top, remember that it always used to be said of Irish rugby that when times were hard, the situation was critical but never serious. Rumours have been rife this week about Irish players being unhappy or distracted by personal problems, but the outside-half Ronan O'Gara dismissed it all. \"There is all sorts of stuff being said,\" O'Gara declared. \"Apparently, I am meant to be in trouble and cranky and a lot of fighting is going on, but that's all rubbish. I never play with a smile on my face, but that does not mean I am not enjoying myself. I just care passionately about the performance of our team. We know that if we do not kick-start our campaign against France, in all likelihood we will be going home.\" O'Sullivan has dropped O'Gara's long-term half-back partner Peter Stringer after hauling off the scrum-half against Georgia. Wasps' Eoin Reddan, who offers more of an attacking threat around the breakdown, replaces him, as Ireland, having become over-reliant on the midfield partnership of Gordon D'Arcy and Brian O'Driscoll, look for momentum through their back row. \"The team is hurting,\" O'Gara said, \"but there's nothing fatal at this moment. We should be excited by this challenge.\" Ireland have won the Triple Crown three times since the last World Cup, but they have not beaten France in that time. \"Ireland are in much the same position as us and need to win,\" said the France outside-half Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Michalak. \"We are fortunate that we know a lot about Reddan because he plays for the same club as our captain, Rapha\u00ebl Ibanez. He is more dangerous than Stringer, but we are confident. Perhaps we got a bit carried away by our three warm-up victories in August. We saw ourselves as a bit too pretty and the defeat to Argentina liberated our minds.\" Stringer has paid for the Ireland forwards' insipid start to the tournament. The likes of Paul O'Connell, Donnacha O'Callaghan, David Wallace and even Denis Leamy need to start living up to their reputations. The form of the Irish eight that spat out England in the Six Nations at Croke Park has yet to be sighted in France, as has the combination of physical intensity at the breakdown and the ability to move the ball wide that did for South Africa and Australia last autumn. France are looking to the Sale forward S\u00e9bastien Chabal to give them momentum. \"Opponents fear him because he can hurt them,\" said the home manager Jo Maso of a player who is depicted in the French version of Spitting Image as Hannibal Lecter with long hair. It may, though, be a case of hair today, gone tomorrow. \"I am going to the barber's and the hairdresser's and I may bring you back a lock of hair,\" Chabal told reporters. Munster battered Chabal into submission in the Heineken Cup at Thomond Park two seasons ago and the Ireland defence coach Graham Steadman wants the national side to do likewise. \"Stop Chabal and we shut up the crowd,\" he said. France have dropped Yannick Jauzion, arguably their best back, to the bench because of personal problems and brought in David Marty, who spurned so many chances against Namibia. Ireland must create a platform for D'Arcy and O'Driscoll. That means competing at the breakdown, or it will all break down for them.
