The catalogues advertise them to booksellers, overseas publishers and the media; they are the documents by which the houses are measured. But Penguin is about to depart from convention. It says that its autumn catalogues will be its last and that it will instead produce sales documents for booksellers as well as an online database of forthcoming titles. Pan Macmillan is working on improving its website with a veiw to making the same move, and other publishers are likely to follow suit. Booksellers do not need half-yearly catalogues any more because publishers produce a lot of glossy brochures for them: and the publishers also think that they can save six-figure printing costs by encouraging journalists to look for titles on the web. \u00b7 I have been reading a rather wonderful memoir. Much as I like it, though, I cannot condemn the hundreds of literary agents and publishers who declined to take it on. It is called Ginny Good, and it is written by Gerard Jones, who came to my attention with his website, everyonewhosanyone.com, a listing of more than 2,000 publishers and agents in his native US and in Canada, the UK and Ireland. He has sent them all samples of his writing; you can read some of the rejection letters at the site. However, an agent did sign him up eventually, and sold Ginny Good to a small, new US house called Monkfish. After I had used the site several times, I decided that I should click Jones's \"send me money\" donations button; in return, he sent me a copy of his book. It is the story of his life in the hippy culture of the US West Coast in the 1960s and 70s, and of his relationship with Virginia Good, a volatile child of that era. It is direct, funny and touching. Getting published should have been straightforward, surely. But the problem is how to market this book. Yes, he is a gifted writer, but that is a hard quality to sell. There is also the matter of precedent. In the time I've been writing about the book trade, I've come across quite a few memoirists such as Jones, dismayed that publishers have failed to appreciate their work; none of them, before him, has had any talent. It's difficult to prove yourself the exception. \u00b7 One memoirist with no problem being recognised is Bill Clinton, whose My Life will, according to an official announcement, appear in the US and UK (from Hutchinson) on June 22. The former president's book has been the subject of many rumours, among them that Democrat candidate John Kerry fears it will distract attention from his presidential campaign, and that Clinton's text was too skimpy and required a great deal of editorial salvaging. The latter story seems unlikely, as the publisher is promising a finished work of nearly 1,000 pages. \u00b7 Penguin's titles are in short supply at the moment. The company has moved its warehouse to Rugby, where the new distribution centre is taking a while to get up to speed. Novels by Plum Sykes and Graham Swift are among those affected, and the shortage of copies of The Iliad has dismayed booksellers who have seen a surge in demand for Homer's epic following the release of the film Troy. \u00b7 A specially programmed website will allow library users to select titles from this year's Man Booker prize longlist using search terms defining their tastes. Categories will include \"easy\", \"disturbing\", \"optimistic\", and - one that rules out several fancied candidates - \"no sex\". The site will be at www.themanbookerprize.com. \u00b7 Nicholas Clee is editor of the Bookseller.
