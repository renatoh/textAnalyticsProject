The number of denominational schools in England continues to grow, as does their proportion of the total number of state schools. The Archbishop of Canterbury is reported as saying he wants the Church of England to take over as many secondary schools as possible, and in Darlington it has offered a large sum of money to the local authority towards the renovation of a secondary school provided it then becomes an aided Church of England school. The situation is now that in some places a non-denominational school is not locally available and parents have to send their children some distance to get to one, with attendant travel expenses and journey time. The alternative is to send their children to the local denominational school with whose ethos they may profoundly disagree. Campbell Forde Richmond, North Yorks Aaronovitch does not mention that some Christian parents choose not to send their children to faith schools. One reason is they do not want them to gain the educational advantages of these schools when they are not available to other children. Another is they do want them to mix with pupils from different ethnic, religious and social backgrounds Bob Holman Glasgow The government claims to be committed to equality of opportunity for all, and to choice in education. Yet the child of a non-religious person (for example) has fewer schools to choose from compared to the child of a believer. Richard Giles Loughborough, Leicestershire Muslim parents want faith schools. Most Muslim children who attend one are in favour, too. But let's make sure that those supporting them know what they are supporting and why, and that Muslim children get the schools they need. Yakoub Islam Tasneem Project, Huddersfield In Doncaster we have the prospect of 'academies' run by the Emmanuel (formerly Vardy) Foundation (notorious for funding Emmanuel College, Gateshead, where creationism has been taught) replacing traditional state-run comprehensives after local consultations of the smoke and mirrors variety conducted by the council. The current consultation is over the possible replacement of Conisbrough Northcliffe School by a school whose management will be unaccountable to the local education authority and will have a governing body dominated by representatives of the foundation. Money will come directly from the government and the foundation will pay \u00a32m for a controlling interest. This policy of introducing academies and allowing them to be run by religious groups is favoured by Tony Blair and speaks louder of his devotion to faith than of his commitment to democracy.
