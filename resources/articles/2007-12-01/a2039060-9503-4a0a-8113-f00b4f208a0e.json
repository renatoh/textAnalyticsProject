The number of companies offering tests for conditions such as Alzheimer's, heart disease and certain cancers has soared in the past two years, with many charging in excess of \u00a3500 a test. But genetics experts say the kits are at best premature and at worst a waste of money. In some cases, scientists said the genes being tested have no bearing on a person's likelihood of developing a disease. Other tests scan a person's DNA for just one gene linked to a disease, when the risk of contracting it may rely on as many as 1,000. Dr Christine Patch of the Human Genetics Commission said the public were in danger of being misled over the ability of the tests to accurately predict their health. \"My message [to them] is you are wasting your money,\" she said. Next week, the HGC will call for stringent checks on genetic tests before they can be marketed. If the changes are adopted, companies will have to prove tests are based on good scientific evidence. Geneticists fear the tests are likely to cause anxiety for those patients who, on the basis of a single gene, are told they have an increased risk of a potentially life-threatening disease. Others, meanwhile, are given false reassurance. In many cases, family medical history is a better indication of risk of cancer or heart disease, said Stuart Hogarth, a researcher at the institute for science and society at Nottingham University. \"Most scientists believe we need more research before we move to clinical testing,\" he said. Doctors are particularly concerned at the surge in poor quality genetic health tests as they fear they may damage public confidence in well-established genetic tests for conditions such as breast cancer. Genetic tests have received widespread publicity through TV programmes such as The Killer Within, which aired on ITV last month. It is being investigated by Ofcom. The tests used in the programme were conducted by the Harley Street-based company Genetic Health. The pressure group GeneWatch has asked the the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency to investigate the company amid concerns about whether some of the genes tested were linked to the diseases claimed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
