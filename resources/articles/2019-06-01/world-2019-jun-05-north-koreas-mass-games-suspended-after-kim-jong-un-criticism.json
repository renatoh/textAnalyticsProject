Kim, North Korea\u2019s leader, said he was unhappy with the event, entitled The Land of the People, after attending Monday\u2019s opening night at the 150,000-seat May Day Stadium in Pyongyang with his wife, Ri Sol-ju, and his influential younger sister, Kim Yo-jong \u2013 who had not, until then, been seen in public for weeks amid speculation Kim ordered her to keep a low profile after the failure of his second nuclear summit with Donald Trump. The state news agency KCNA said Kim had \u201cextended warm greetings\u201d to the performers, many whom were children, but had later called the event\u2019s producers and \u201cseriously criticised them for their wrong spirit of creation and irresponsible work attitude\u201d. Noting that artists had \u201ca very important duty in socialist cultural construction\u201d, Kim \u201cset forth important tasks for correctly implementing the revolutionary policy of our party on literature and art\u201d, KCNA added. Simon Cockerell, general manager of Koryo Tours, in Beijing, said his firm had been told by their North Korean partners that the show, which features mass gymnastic displays, would be suspended for days or weeks from next Monday to allow its creators to make adjustments. The firm tweeted that \u201cthere will be a pause for some days/weeks while the show is adjusted before being launched again \u2013 we wait to see what will change and when it will restart\u201d. Young Pioneers Tours, another travel company that arranges trips to North Korea, tweeted that the suspension was due to Kim\u2019s \u201cdissatisfaction with the opening performance\u201d, adding that no dates had been given for the show\u2019s resumption. It was not clear what had irritated Kim, but some observers noted that his portrait appeared at the event alongside pictures of his grandfather, North Korea\u2019s founder Kim Il-sung, and his father, Kim Jong-il, whom he succeeded as leader in late 2011. It is rare for portraits of Kim Jong-un to be shown in public, and unlike his predecessors, no statues of him are known to exist. The mass games were held last September for the first time in five years as part of the regime\u2019s attempts to improve its international image after years of condemnation over its missile and nuclear weapons programme. The games are also popular with tourists and are a source of much needed foreign currency. But last month Thae Yong-ho, the former deputy ambassador to the UK, who defected in 2016, called on travel companies and tourists to boycott the games, describing them as \u201cinhumane\u201d. \u201cYou should know that it means the children, aged from six to nine, cannot go to school for six months \u2013 it\u2019s a forced exercise,\u201d Thae told the Oslo Freedom Forum. \u201cAnd who are the audience for this? Europeans, and there are many European tour companies who organise trips. We should argue this with the European companies \u2013 these are inhumane displays.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
