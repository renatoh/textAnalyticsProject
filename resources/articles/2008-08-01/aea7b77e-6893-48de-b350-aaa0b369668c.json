The trio seem to be on the fast track to mainstream success - they've already played in America and Japan, setting the scene for a Klaxons-style upward trajectory. The surprise is their sophistication; like Klaxons, they're just fluorescent enough to keep club kids interested, but their real commitment is to sparkling, modern pop. The album is full of it, every track pulsing and clattering around an electronic heart and almost never exceeding three minutes. Singer Ed Macfarlane's voice rarely rises above a blissed-out murmur except when the whooshing party anthems Lovesick and Paris move him to unfurl a falsetto. Lyrically, they veer between odes to suburbia, such as Photobooth, and dreaming big dreams (\"One day we'll live in Paris\"); either way, they couldn't be more likable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
