They play London's Koko with guests, including Swedish vocalist Cornelia, on 17 April; a gig likely to reveal just how far they've come in imparting deeper levels and richer nuances to a repertoire populated by disarmingly artless themes. Much of the music was on last year's studio album - including the loping Window Seat with its swooping string sounds, the violin-like sax melody of Ruins, and the initially dreamy and then hauntingly intense Rubidium. Sleepless, delivered by Cornelia here with a fragility (clustered around by her own church-like echo) that swells to soulful cries, represents some of the most memorable moments of a memorable set. Portico were prone to noodliness in their early days, as if they were waiting for the instrumental skills that could elaborate on their catchy compositions. Now they've developed a textural palette that's bypassed that problem, and in the process taken their emotional clout to another level."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
