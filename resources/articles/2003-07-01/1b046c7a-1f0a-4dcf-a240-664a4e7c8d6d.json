The average tenure for a chief executive has fallen to 2.75 years and only 12 per cent have held their jobs for more than a decade, according to an analysis by consulting group Egremont. That is a big fall compared with 15 years ago, when the average chief executive stayed put for 15 years. Yet Egremont points to research by the University of California which showed that earnings, as a proportion of assets and return on assets, barely changed following the dismissal of a chief executive. A fuss at GUS Retail group GUS has given the former chairman of its Burberry designer fashion business shares worth over \u00a3440,000 under a phantom share-option scheme set up three years ago. Victor Barnett was given phantom options over 164,700 shares in August 2000; these were converted into 83,596 Burberry shares when it floated last July, worth \u00a3192,270 at the issue price of 230p. But GUS has since changed the arrangements, matching the Burberry shares at a ratio of 1.3 for every one granted originally, and deferred for five years from the float date. Barnett can take the shares now at a discount of 10 per cent. PIRC, the corporate governance service, says this is worth a further \u00a3250,000. It recommends voting against the GUS remuneration report. Corus tries again The chief executive of Anglo Dutch steel group Corus, Philippe Varin, is weighing a fresh attempt to sell its aluminium arm to Pechiney of France. Varin, who spent 24 years at Pechiney before joining Corus this year, has been in contact with Jean-Pierre Rodier, head of the Paris-based group, which is resisting an approach from Canadian group Alcan. Corus's attempt to sell its aluminium business to Pechiney for \u00a3543m was blocked earlier this year by the company's Dutch supervisory board, headed by former shipping boss Leo Berndsen. Varin has been building bridges with Berndsen. There is fear that, if Alcan takes over Pechiney, the value of Corus's aluminium assets will slump."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
