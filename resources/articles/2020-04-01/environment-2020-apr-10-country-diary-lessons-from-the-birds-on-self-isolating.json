Every spring, male songbirds carve out their own inviolate space. This row of urban semis and small gardens is a constant racket of avian announcements and warnings. It begins with the robin\u2019s plaintive heralding of first light. If I shook off the duvet\u2019s warmth and peeped through the curtains, I\u2019d see him on his regular streetlight songpost. But I tell myself the movement will disturb him, so I lie on to listen for the dunnock. He\u2019s due any minute. I tense with waiting, praying that his predilection for the garden\u2019s low bushes has not meant that he has succumbed to a cat overnight. Ah! There\u2019s his cheery warble. I can get up. Breakfast is both strangely quiet and startlingly noisy. I live under an airport flight path that\u2019s weirdly muted. But the absence of planes magnifies the birdsong. That chaffinch with his individual take on the terminal flourish of his species\u2019 song. Two wrens rattling sabres across a no-go zone that includes our back garden. As the song of the one in the next street starts overlapping with that of two doors up, it\u2019s only a matter of time. Song overlapping or matching is a sign of aggression. Eventually my neighbour\u2019s wren falls silent. I settle to my laptop. Throughout the day, I get more reminders of the importance of physical distancing. The tunes vary, but the message is the same. From the canopy fringing the River Lagan, an elevenses song thrush, his deliberate flutings clearly audible against the traffic\u2019s lowered growl. Cosy house sparrow chatter accompanies lunch, but bursting through are slurred exhortations of a collared dove and a thin exasperation of a goldcrest. In the afternoon, the nearby pedestrian crossing beeps and a great tit responds with furious monosyllables. I wonder who has provoked him, for when I check the window there\u2019s no one to be seen. Evening: our blackbird has assumed his usual position on the chimney opposite. I stop to listen to his gorgeous baritone. And further away, another. And another. The chain of song reminds me of \u201call the birds\u201d of Edward Thomas\u2019s Adlestrop. \u201cFarther and farther.\u201d All heeding, all reminding each other: \u201cKeep your distance, keep your distance.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
