That match, which led to Ruud van Nistelrooy receiving a three-match ban for violent conduct after aiming a kick at Ashley Cole, was termed \"pizzagate\" after food was allegedly thrown at Sir Alex Ferguson from the Arsenal dressing room. Despite the high stakes for this match, raised by Chelsea's 10-point Premiership lead, Wenger believes the football on offer should be attractive. \"I would say spontaneously the losers are out of the title race - and if Chelsea win at Blackburn the next day then definitely they are out of it,\" said Wenger. \"It's a massive game for both teams, but sometimes these games are very tight and others are open. You just don't know. \"The disappointing thing in the first game was that it was not a really good promotion for English football. It was a game watched by 600 million people and we wanted a good game. \"But I think this could be a classic game. We are only focused on the football and, in fairness, I can ignore completely that we are playing Manchester United because for me what's important is to fight for the championship and to get three points.\" Wenger was speaking after the publication in the Guardian yesterday of Sol Campbell's comments regarding matches against United, which he described as \"bitter and personal\". The Arsenal manager had sympathy with Campbell's sentiments, recalling how Wayne Rooney won a disputed penalty that set United on the way to a 2-0 win that ended the Gunners run of 49 Premiership games unbeaten. \"Maybe [when] Sol said that, that comes from a feeling in the first game when he was done by Rooney and maybe that is why he is still bitter because up until that goal Manchester United had not had a chance,\" he said. \"We will always try to play football - which we love - and that is the most important thing of all.\" Arsenal's sole transfer activity yesterday was Jermaine Pennant's departure on loan to Birmingham. The Brazilian midfielder Edu's expected move to Valencia fell through after the Spanish champions failed to meet Arsenal's \u20ac2m (\u00a31.4m) valuation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
