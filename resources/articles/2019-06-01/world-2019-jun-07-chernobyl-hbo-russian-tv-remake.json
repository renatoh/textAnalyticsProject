Chernobyl, which will air on Russia\u2019s NTV channel, appears to fulfil a demand from tabloid columnists and state TV news for a more patriotic retelling of the story. Craig Mazin, the creator of the HBO series, famously obsessed over minor details such as shoelaces and telephones, and adopted first-hand accounts of survivors to authentically recreate the Soviet Union of the 1980s. NTV\u2019s Chernobyl, filmed in Belarus, takes far more liberties. A description of the show says that the plot revolves around a CIA agent dispatched to Pripyat to gather intelligence on the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and the Russian counterintelligence agent sent to track him down. If it sounds like fiction, that\u2019s because it is. But the director, Alexey Muradov, said the show \u201cwill tell viewers about what really happened back then\u201d. \u201cThere is a theory that the Americans had infiltrated the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and many historians do not deny that on the day of the explosion an agent of the enemy\u2019s intelligence services was present at the station,\u201d Muradov told the tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda, which said the show \u201cproposes an alternative view on the tragedy in Pripyat\u201d. State-run television and Russian tabloids have accused the HBO series of bias by papering over the heroic acts of Soviet emergency workers, the so-called \u201cliquidators\u201d. \u201cChernobyl did not show the most important part \u2013 our victory,\u201d ran one headline in Komsomolskaya Pravda, the country\u2019s most popular daily. Another article by the prominent war correspondent Dmitry Steshin in the same paper claimed the show was filmed in order to sabotage overseas sales of nuclear energy technology by the Russian state company Rosatom. Russia fetes its military veterans like few other countries do, but far less attention is paid to the Chernobyl liquidators. Ilya Shepelin, a Russian journalist, wrote in the Moscow Times that \u201cthe fact that an American, not a Russian, TV channel tells us about our own heroes is a source of shame that the pro-Kremlin media apparently cannot live down\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
