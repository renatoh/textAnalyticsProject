It was both business as usual for haute streetwear designer Astrid Andersen and proof that \u201cladwear\u201d is usurping tailoring and eccentricity in the race for dominance of British men\u2019s fashion. For the past few seasons, there has been a growing divide between two clear camps: peacock and hyper-casual. One is effeminate, an imaginative take on the Brummellian dandy; think last autumn\u2019s leopard print at Topman Design or printed shirts at Burberry. The other is streetwear and its various sub-styles \u2013 tracksuits, longline sweaters and textured hoodies. It\u2019s a look Danish designer Andersen has made her trademark for the past four seasons. But only now is it coming out on top, as the weekend\u2019s London Collections Men event has demonstrated. This season at Cottweiller, there were sweats, tees and minimal tracksuits in neutral tones. Topman Design had neutral hoodies while Nasir Mazhar rolled out an urban Darth Vader in loose skater trousers as well as zip-up, utilitarian waterproof jackets. Patrick Grant at E Tautz, a label which historically leans towards tailoring, was inspired by the roller discos of Grant\u2019s 1980s youth, pairing wide-legged cord trousers with loose-fit macs. Smart lad, if you will. Danish designer Andersen has been doggedly creating eccentric, heavily logo\u2019d streetwear since 2014, but only now does her taste seem to chime with the norm, as Andersen\u2019s clothes are regularly worn by rappers Drake and the A$AP Mob. This season, her ensemble of loose-fit lace and cotton mix jogging bottoms, two-stripe tracksuits and meatier puffas in restrained shades of blood red and khaki sums up the normalisation of casualwear for men. \u201cIt is casual but I don\u2019t call it casualwear,\u201d she said. \u201cThat just boxes it in. I mix the [jogging] bottoms with a longer formal jacket, so it\u2019s both formal and casual. It can be both.\u201d While this look feels more at home in London than, say, Milan, it\u2019s not specific to the capital. As Adrian Clark, style director of ShortList explained, Walter van Beirendonck, Bernhard Willhelm and Riccardo Tisci at Givenchy had focused on this \u201cvery distinctive ghetto-garage sport-luxe look\u201d for years. From Camden punks to mods to 1990s skater wear, British fashion is well-known for referencing subcultures, so it\u2019s arguably easier to get away with here. A new exhibition, Mad About the Boy, which has opened at London\u2019s Fashion Space Gallery, focuses on the link between catwalk and youth trends: \u201cDressing patterns have changed,\u201d said Lou Stoppard, editor of SHOWstudio. \u201cThese days track pants are as relevant to the working man as they are to a teenager.\u201d They must be doing something right. British menswear continues to show encouraging growth, with the market expanding by 18% between 2008 and 2013, and now worth \u00a312.9bn a year. One thought is that this is a reaction to the hyper-feminisation of menswear which is arguably less wearable than, say, a tracksuit. Damien Paul, head of menswear at matchesfashion.com, has seen a spike in this trend: \u201cLuxe sportswear is consistently one of our best-selling categories \u2013 and tracksuits continue to be a key style. Astrid Andersen has really nailed the aesthetic \u2013 in only a short time she\u2019s developed an incredibly clear idea of who her man is.\u201d This \u201cman\u201d has thus far been ill-defined: laddy, edgy, a bit sporty but with soul. He cares about his clothes without kowtowing to the mainstream. Clark said: \u201cI think its appeal is that it is the ambiguity of it being one part anti-fashion and one part very avant-garde and niche.\u201d If he can\u2019t fork out for Andersen\u2019s pieces, he can get something more affordable in JD Sports. One of the most obvious shifts is from slim-fitting to loose, with the much-maligned skinny \u201chipster\u201d look being phased out in favour of something a little sportier and relaxed. This softer, more casual silhouette, which has so far dominated the catwalks, is in stark contrast to the Yves Saint Laurent-style skinny suits of last season. The focus is less on prints and contrasting colours and more on texture. To wit: Andersen\u2019s standout chenille two-piece tracksuit and the brown corduroy at E Tautz. \u201cMenswear is definitely moving in a more relaxed and tactile direction,\u201d said Clark. \u201cWhile I\u2019m a big fan of the skinny silhouette, I\u2019m also really into this more voluminous silhouette coming through.\u201d Perhaps the main difference is that this street style is less aggressively pitched this time around \u2013 last autumn/winter, Christopher Shannon\u2019s now infamous plastic bag embossed collection turned heads but felt a little premature, even at odds with what men would actually be wearing. In the past year, the gap between \u201cterrace wear\u201d (think Stone Island and K-Way jackets along with the usual sportswear suspects) and high fashion has closed. Shops like Urban Outfitters and Asos are selling off-pitch sportswear like Fila, Adidas and Champion alongside its usual raft of new designers. \u201cOversized T-shirts finishing near to the knees, tanks and board shorts are lining the length and breadth of Oxford street,\u201d said Clark. It\u2019s in keeping with a general shift in what\u2019s cool. It\u2019s perhaps a little green to start mourning tailoring. \u201cI do think it will take the average man on the street a while to shift from one to the other though, it\u2019s quite a dramatic switch,\u201d continued Clark. As with all things fashion, it will take time for this trend to gravitate fully to the mainstream."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
