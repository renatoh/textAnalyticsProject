Rail services almost ground to a halt, with 82% of drivers on strike and at least 90% of regional trains cancelled, amid fears that the open-ended transport disruption could continue for days. In Paris, 11 out of the 16 metro lines were shut, forcing commuters to scramble to hire bikes and scooters. Many schools were closed and even some police unions warned of \u201csymbolic\u201d closures of certain police stations. Shops along the route of a march in Paris were advised to close in case of violence on the edges of the demonstration. About half of the scheduled Eurostar trains between Paris and London have been cancelled. Tourists were turned away at the Eiffel Tower because of the strike. The standoff is a crucial test for the centrist French president, whose planned overhaul of the pensions system was a key election promise. The government argues that unifying the pensions system \u2013 and getting rid of the 42 \u201cspecial\u201d regimes for sectors ranging from rail and energy workers to lawyers and Paris Opera staff \u2013 is crucial to keep the system financially viable as the French population ages. But unions say introducing a \u201cuniversal\u201d system for all will mean millions of workers in both the public and private sectors must work beyond the legal retirement age of 62 or face a severe drop in the value of their pensions. The row cuts to the heart of Macron\u2019s presidential project and his pledge to deliver the biggest transformation of the French social model and welfare system since the postwar era. Since his election in 2017, Macron has leaned towards a Nordic style of \u201cflexi-security\u201d in which the labour market is loosened and the focus is on changing from a rigid work code to a society of individuals moving between jobs. Pension reform is the latest step for Macron after he overhauled labour rules and changed the unemployment system, but it has always been an extremely sensitive topic in France. Macron\u2019s approval ratings, at about 30%, have improved since the height of last year\u2019s gilets jaunes anti-government protests. But while many French voters agree that the pensions system should be changed, they are not sure the pro-business president can be trusted to do it. A recent Ifop poll found 76% of French people back pensions reform, but 64% do not trust the government to pull it off. Unusually, the protest strike is going ahead before the full details of any pensions changes are known. A consultation process is still under way and parliament will not debate proposals until 2020. Tensions are running high after months of anti-government protests by the gilets jaunes, amid a general feeling in France that life is hard and public services are declining. A poll last month by Viavoice for Lib\u00e9ration found 89% of French people felt the country was experiencing a \u201csocial crisis\u201d. Beyond trade unions, there is an angry grassroots base of rail workers and other state workers keen to put pressure on the government. It is not certain how long the transport strike will continue. At Place de la R\u00e9publique in central Paris, Didier Dupir from Lyon was among firefighters from the Sud trade union staging an unusual protest by sleeping outside in tents despite freezing temperatures. He was protesting over staffing levels, remuneration and pensions. \u201cI\u2019ve been a firefighter for 20 years and I\u2019ve never slept out on a demonstration like this before,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is about getting proper recognition from the government for what firefighters do. People are very sensitive to the state of public services.\u201d Stewart Chau, a sociologist and consultant for Viavoice pollsters, said the public mood was of distrust rather than defiance, with people wanting pension reform but not confident in the government to carry it out. \u201cWhat\u2019s certain is we\u2019re in a climate of real social tension today, which goes beyond pensions. Our study in Lib\u00e9ration found almost unanimity \u2013 89% \u2013 of French people thinking we\u2019re living through a social crisis, but also 64% said they felt Macron didn\u2019t understand those social difficulties \u2026 That mood of social crisis will hang over this strike action.\u201d Chau said that since the gilets jaunes protests, Macron\u2019s top-down approach to changing the French system had altered, with the government now appearing to engage in more public consultation. The challenge for the president was to balance a need for pensions changes and structural reform \u201cwhile not appearing to force the changes through which could amplify the protests or generate a sense of social fracture, with different grievances joining up together\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
