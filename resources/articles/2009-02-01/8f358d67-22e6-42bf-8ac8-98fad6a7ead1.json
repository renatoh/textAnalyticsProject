It's an emotive, deeply controversial subject, where strong opinions are the norm \u2013 at least in the public domain. But what is the database state? This afternoon, at one crowded session at the Convention on Modern Liberty, Guy Herbert, the general secretary of No2ID, offered a definition at the outset: it is the use of computers to govern us; the centalisation of government, regulation, oversight, and control of the population by the collection and dissemination of information. Of course there have always been government records \u2013 all the way back to the Domesday Book and beyond \u2013 and Herbert said nobody is against records. But the \"proactive management of data\", the \"conceit\" of using computers to manage it all, is relatively new. Christina Zaba, also of No2ID, is a powerful speaker, and her catalogue of the information that is to be collected made for compelling listening, not to mention food for thought. When we think of ID cards, she pointed out, we think of the old-fashioned booklet with a photo and stamps. Banish that idea, she warned. It's about computers knowing things about you, and storing that data which is no longer our personal property, but that of the government. What about transformative government, that clumsy and ambiguous phrase? This idea, said Sam Talbot-Rice of the Centre for Policy Studies, started life long before 11 September 2001 and the subsequent anti-terror measures, and was intended to provide tailored packages for public service users, with the tailoring being invisible to the public. Transformational, certainly, but for the worse, Talbot Rice said. Why? For several reasons that the Centre for Policy Studies has identified: it promotes centralisation; there are concerns about the costs and about whether huge government databases can be made to work; and there are security worries about anything that is billed as a \"single source of truth\". The justifications, that you only have to provide information once, that you'll get things tailored to your needs or wants, or that it is inevitable, were rejected as spurious. So, what are people to do? And what are the alternatives to the database state? Change is taking place on three levels, said Simon Davies, of Privacy International: technical changes, manipulation of language and images, and the destruction of due process. While plans are advancing in at the technical level, the language and due process levels can still be saved. So, Davies recommends everyone to take action when they see these being undermined, be that \"outing\" the perpetrators (mainly civil servants, he says), or making a nuisance of yourself with officials whenever addressing officialdom. Ask \"why\"! The alternatives? Aside from rejecting the move towards a database state, and the personal measures one can take, policy proposals came only from Talbot-Rice. Fundamentally, it needs to be recognised that our data is ours, not the government's. We need to take (and presumably be given) ownership of our personal data; there needs to be a greater distinction between access to and control of data; and we need to move towards an information society, and away from a database state. Sounds great \u2013 but it was too thin on detail. And any debate here today runs the risk of preaching to the converted. Davies started his speech asking the audience how many felt the balance between rights and surveillance had moved too far towards surveillance. Almost everyone raised their hand. So, there was no debate among the panel, nor among the audience, just agreement to varying degrees. Where were the proponents of the databases, the NHS official or police chief or government representative who sees values, and can explain the value? What are the positive transformations promised by the transformational state, and why do (presumably sane) people propose pursuing this path? None of these questions were raised, let alone answered. To quote Davies, \"a tough crowd\". \u2022 See more on the convention and civil liberties at liberty central"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
