For those of us who like to walk or cycle it became treacherous as paths turned to ice-rinks. Every day I\u2019d hear tales of people who had slipped and broken a bone, or sprained a wrist. Others said they didn\u2019t dare risk the \u201cCresta run\u201d and resorted to taking the car. This year York council are running a pilot scheme, using special \u201cbaby-gritters\u201d to keep 22km of York\u2019s walk/cycle network ice-free. Although it\u2019s been a mild winter so far, when we have had icy mornings it\u2019s been a joy to pedal off and to see the riverside paths just as busy as on a summer\u2019s day. And the evidence suggests that York\u2019s progressive decision may save the city money too. Statistics from Sweden show that when conditions are icy, pedestrians are three times more likely to be injured than motorists. Back in 2012 the town of Karlskoga in central Sweden switched the order of the snow-clearing schedule to prioritise foot and cycle paths. This simple change resulted in significantly fewer injuries, and consequent savings in healthcare and fewer days taken off work. Hopefully York\u2019s baby-gritters will have similar benefits \u2013 bring on the snow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
