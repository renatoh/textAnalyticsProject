The striker has appeared in every game this season and despite a busy festive schedule, and a daunting fixture list in January, his manager has no plans to rest him. \u201cWhen you are 22 years old and enjoying your football, you can\u2019t wait for the next game,\u201d Mart\u00ednez said, before Saturday\u2019s visit to Norwich City. \u201cThe players you need to be careful with are those around 28, 29 or 30. We have a few of those, and you have to measure their recovery times really well, but players who are 21 or 22 can recover in 12 hours because they\u2019ve got so much energy.\u201d There is a theory that young players who are still developing are more at risk of early burnout, although Mart\u00ednez does not subscribe to it. \u201cI don\u2019t see such a problem, I think it is the opposite for young players,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m happy to keep players like Romelu, Ross Barkley, Gerry Deulofeu and John Stones in the team together, it is a matter of keeping the momentum going. It is different if they pick up a knock or a strain but until that happens as long as they are playing well they can carry on. Burnout comes when you are not playing well and still forced to play. That makes you play with pressure and that can be tough.\u201d Lukaku was in that situation a year ago, still not back to his best after returning from the World Cup and struggling to live up to expectations, so Mart\u00ednez dropped the Belgian for a game at Newcastle United. At the time the manager called it a rest but now says he lost his place. Either way, Lukaku was not happy about it. \u201cThat period was tough for him, he wasn\u2019t enjoying his football, he was physically catching up, so I dropped him for the Newcastle game,\u201d Mart\u00ednez explained. \u201cHe didn\u2019t like it one bit, though from that point on there was a mindset change. He suddenly started to think: \u2018I need to fight for my place\u2019 instead of: \u2018I need to win a game.\u2019 From the moment he lost his place he became very clear about his priorities and now he looks fresh in every game. That is all young players need \u2013 to be enjoying their football. I think last season was tough for Ross Barkley, too, at times but he\u2019s learned from the experience and now the pure enjoyment is back. Those players don\u2019t need to be rested.\u201d Mart\u00ednez is not only relaxed about next month\u2019s transfer window \u2013 \u201cWe never lose anyone in January unless it is someone who hasn\u2019t been playing and we need to find a solution\u201d \u2013 he is unperturbed about the prospect of three meetings with Manchester City next month. One in the league, the other two in Capital One Cup semi-finals. \u201cWe thought it was going to be four before the FA Cup draw was made,\u201d he joked. \u201cIt is a tough schedule but for the right reasons. We want to be involved in big games like that but the focus we have now is the next 12 points in the league. We have four league games before we go into the semi-final and that period is going to be vital.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
