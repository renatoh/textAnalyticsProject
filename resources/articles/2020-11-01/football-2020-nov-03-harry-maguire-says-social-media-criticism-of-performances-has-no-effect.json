Scrutiny of Maguire\u2019s performances has increased this season after he was found guilty in a Greek court of aggravated assault, resisting arrest and attempted bribery, charges he denies. The 27-year-old, who is appealing against his conviction, has been part of a defence that has struggled, especially at Old Trafford. United have lost there 3-1 to Crystal Palace and 6-1 to Tottenham, with Maguire unconvincing in both matches. Those results prompted criticism and he was asked how he deals with negative posts on social media. Maguire has accounts on Twitter and Instagram. \u201cI don\u2019t go on it, don\u2019t read it,\u201d he said. \u201cMy mind is fully focused on football. Obviously as the captain I focus more on the team than the individual. Defensively we didn\u2019t start in the best shape against Crystal Palace \u2013 we were too open. Against Tottenham we let ourselves go, especially when we went down to 10 men [Anthony Martial was sent off]. \u201cTo concede six in any game, especially at this club, isn\u2019t good enough so we\u2019ve worked hard on that since we\u2019ve come back from the international break. Obviously I had a difficult period in the summer but now I\u2019m fully focused. I come into training each day and work as hard as I can.\u201d United lost 1-0 at home to Arsenal in their last league game on Sunday. This caused Roy Keane, a Sky TV pundit and former United captain, to claim Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s players had let the manager down. Solskj\u00e6r was asked about Keane\u2019s view that United do not have footballers he would want to be \u201cin the trenches\u201d with. \u201cRoy has always been outspoken,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m very glad we have the players we\u2019ve got here. We\u2019ve got different jobs and Roy\u2019s job is to give his opinion and I always listen to Roy. But we always move on with a great group of players and I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see a response.\u201d Keane also stated that United lack leadership, which Maguire denied. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen his comments because especially after a negative result we don\u2019t bring the negativity into the place,\u201d he said. \u201cWe stay positive and I can stay for sure that there\u2019s a lot of leaders in this squad. I\u2019m the captain and I\u2019ve got a lot of leadership around me \u2013 staff and players.\u201d Paul Pogba admitted he was at fault for conceding Arsenal\u2019s game-winning penalty by rashly fouling H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn. It was the latest error from the midfielder, who was dropped for three matches following the Tottenham defeat. Solskj\u00e6r brushed off the notion that Pogba may not fulfil his potential at United. \u201cEvery player is frustrated with himself and is disappointed after defeat,\u201d he said. \u201cPaul has gone through a difficult period with an injury last season and having Covid. Now he is working up to full fitness. We\u2019ve seen plenty of positives now and hopefully more can continue,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said United are at Istanbul Basaksehir for Wednesday\u2019s third Group H match, having won their opening two ties in the Champions League. \u201cHopefully we can put in another performance like we\u2019ve shown we can do in the competition,\u201d Maguire said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
