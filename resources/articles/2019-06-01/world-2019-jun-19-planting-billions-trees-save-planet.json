It was, she says, a sign. Humanity is nearing a precipice. Trees can stop us going over the edge. This calling was so strong that Dubois, a business life coach, founded TreeSisters with a friend, Bernadette Ryder, to take on a daunting mission: to reforest the tropics within a decade. In 2014, their new charity funded its first 12,000 trees by encouraging western women to make small monthly donations to reforestation projects in the tropics. Today TreeSisters is planting 2.2m trees (average cost: 33p a tree) each year across Madagascar, India, Kenya, Nepal, Brazil and Cameroon. \u201cWe have to make it as natural to give back to nature as it is to take nature for granted,\u201d Dubois says, musing on the need to \u201cshift from a consumer species to a restorer species\u201d. She is not alone. The global elite is embracing tree-hugging rhetoric. It is as if the world has suddenly woken up to the restorative powers of plants. Forests can stop runaway global heating, encourage rainfall, guarantee clean water, reduce air pollution, and provide livelihoods for local people and reserves for rare wildlife. Politicians are waking up to the potential of \u201cnatural climate solutions\u201d \u2013 reforestation and other ecological restoration \u2013 to capture carbon and tackle the climate crisis. Such solutions could provide 37% of the greenhouse gas mitigation required to provide a good chance of stabilising global heating below the critical 2C threshold. In March the United Nations announced a Decade of Ecosystem Restoration and has set a target to restore 350m hectares \u2013 an area bigger than India \u2013 by 2030. India itself has pledged to plant 13m hectares of forest by 2020, Latin America is aiming at 20m hectares and African countries 100m hectares by 2030. China\u2019s aspiration is to plant an area of forest as large as Ireland every year. Trees are increasingly hailed as a solution for climate-stressed cities too, preventing overheating and reducing air pollution. In England, more than 130,000 trees are to be planted in towns and cities over the next two years. But it isn\u2019t as simple as just grabbing seeds and saplings and sticking them in the ground. Non-native plantations can cause problems for biodiversity, local livelihoods \u2013 or both. Grand pledges aren\u2019t always met. Dubois is only \u201cvaguely heartened\u201d by the new mood. She points out that a 2014 UN declaration pledged to halve deforestation by 2020. Instead, record deforestation ensued and in 2018 an area of primary forest the size of Belgium was lost, the third-highest annual depletion since records began in 2001. Technology \u2013 such as tree-planting by drone \u2013 is often hailed as a game changer, but it can be hit-and-miss. \u201cEverybody thinks that smarter technology is going to save us,\u201d says Dubois. \u201cA significant amount of the materials required to be mined for that smarter technology are under the last remaining old-growth forests.\u201d TreeSisters refuses to use drones, \u201cbecause we\u2019re all about the relationship between people and trees\u201d, says Dubois. \u201cIt\u2019s the disconnect between people and trees that drives deforestation. We need people connected with forests.\u201d TreeSisters\u2019 philosophy is different: local, community-based reforestation with native trees in the tropics. \u201cThe tropical forest belt provides cooling and rainfall,\u201d says Dubois. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the delivery system for a habitable climate for all of us.\u201d In Madagascar, the charity is helping Eden Reforestation Projects replant lost mangrove and dry deciduous forests on the north-west coast. Mangroves are a wonder-tree for local and global ecosystem services; they protect human communities from coastal floods but also filterriver flows out to sea and prevent soil washing into the ocean and destroying coral reefs. They are also crucial nurseries for juvenile fish. Most importantly, perhaps, studies suggest they can sequester four times more carbon than rainforest. Between 2000 and 2015, the equivalent of Brazil\u2019s annual carbon emissions was released by the destruction of mangrove forests. Eden employs local people to gather and plant mature propagules from mangroves. These seedlings usually fall from the tree and stick straight in the mud or float away until they reach another shore and grow. The mangrove-planters also clear debris from the forest because logs and debris shifted by the currents can destroy seedlings. (The debris is piled in particular spots so it creates wildlife habitat.) At most planting sites, the two-week tide cycle contains a six-day window when planters can canoe into the mangroves, plant propagules and catch the outgoing tide before they get stranded on the mudflats at low tide. \u201cOur goal is twofold: reforestation and poverty alleviation,\u201d says Jamie Shattenberg, international director of Eden Reforestation Projects, Madagascar. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to do reforestation and you ignore the human issue \u2013 poverty \u2013 it\u2019s difficult to find success, because the forest is what people turn to last if they have no other sustainable livelihood.\u201d In the project\u2019s first year, eight people planted 100,000 mangroves. Now Eden employs more than 1,000 people to plant trees, with 225m new mangrove trees planted since 2006. Some Malagasy planters were enslaved to local fish barons because they owed money for using their fishing equipment; tree-planting income has enabled them to repay their debts and escape this bondage. Restoring coastal mangroves is not simple. Eden plants mainly on government and community land along the coast, with the support of local villages. Most mangrove is no-man\u2019s land but people still claim rights to establish shrimp farms or raid forests for timber for building and charcoal. \u201cThe thing that\u2019s really now destroying them is charcoal,\u201d says Shattenberg. \u201cOnce a mangrove forest is cut down it takes generations to refill, the mud starts eroding and kills the reef and a negative cycle starts. We\u2019ve had areas tree-poached, and we\u2019ve put guards in. Charcoal is a constant problem, and you can\u2019t change it overnight because so much of Madagascar relies on charcoal for their cooking. It\u2019s like telling England and France \u2018no more gas\u2019. You have to find a different source of fuel and make it affordable.\u201d Then there is a \u201ccharcoal mafia\u201d: \u201cYou get in the way of charcoal directly and you\u2019re in the way of people\u2019s money and people don\u2019t like that.\u201d Shattenberg is optimistic, however, about visible changes to the environment \u2013 and consciousness. \u201cMassive areas are starting to come back and the Malagasy are seeing changes in the fish, crab and wildlife populations. We\u2019re seeing a change in how people feel about the forest. They recognise they can protect it. It\u2019s for Madagascar, for the Malagasy people and it\u2019s for the future of our world.\u201d A similar emphasis on reforestation for local people is driving the restoration of deforested Mount Kenya. TreeSisters is working with the International Tree Foundation (ITF), a charity founded in 1924 by a visionary forester in colonial Kenya called Richard St Barbe Baker. The charity was originally called Men of the Trees. Now it is supporting reforestation led by local women. \u201cOne of the very clear learnings we\u2019ve had is that the more you can work with local organisations that are women-led or driven by women, the better your results,\u201d says Paul Laird, programmes manager at the ITF. \u201cIt is the women\u2019s groups that really drive and motivate, and men are often pleased to have women running it.\u201d Kenya is water-stressed, and dependent on seasonal rains for its water supply. Forest cover can influence rainfall and local humidity and temperature, as well as filter water. The country\u2019s current forest cover is a meagre 7% at best; Kenya\u2019s constitution commits to increasing it to 10%. Kenya has also signed the African Forest Landscape Restoration Initiative (AFR100) commitment to restore 5.1m hectares of degraded land in Kenya. But such targets are not yet creating much traction on the ground, according to Laird. Below Mount Kenya is a circle of humid montane forest. Google Earth reveals it is decidedly patchy. \u201cWhat happened to the forest? The 20th century happened to the forest,\u201d says Laird. The colonial regime harvested native forest and replaced it with eucalyptus and pine plantations \u2013 non-native monocultures that are \u201ca killer in terms of biodiversity\u201d, according to Laird. After independence, commercial gangs took timber and both rich and poor turned forest into farmland. The ITF is supporting local charities such as Mount Kenya Environmental Conservation to work with local women to establish small nurseries of native trees at the forest fringe. The sales of these tree seedlings provide the groups with an income, which is then distributed as loans to help women\u2019s farms and businesses. Native trees are planted directly into deforested areas, while a new scheme enables local people to temporarily grow potatoes in reforested areas, the cultivation helping native trees grow free of weeds for their first few years. The women also grow high-value grafted trees such as avocado and macadamia nut on their own burgeoning agro-forestry farms. \u201cWomen are the primary caretakers of the household and know their reliance on a healthy forest,\u201d says the Nairobi-based Teresa Gitonga of the ITF. \u201cThey are the people who look for firewood, they are the people who cook so they also look for water. Women are change agents. The only thing they need is to unlock their potential and know that planting trees will make their lives better.\u201d According to Anastacia Njoki, a member of a tree-planting group close to Mount Kenya, she and her fellow agro-foresters share experiences, as well as sing together. \u201cWe are doing it because we are the ones who have to collect the firewood. Instead of cutting a large tree, we are collecting dead wood,\u201d she says. But she recognises the wider benefits of trees to the region and Kenya itself. \u201cThe trees that we are planting are indigenous and we as a community are benefiting in one way or another to conserve our ecosystem and maintain the areas where our water is coming from,\u201d she says. Mount Kenya\u2019s forests, she says, make it their \u201cwater tower\u201d. In western countries, TreeSisters continues to raise awareness of a feminine way of responding to ecological crises and climate change, and the need to balance consumption with restoration. Dubois wants to embed restoration into every financial transaction: in other words, everything we buy must also include \u201ca kickback to nature\u201d. \u201cExtinction Rebellion has blasted through collective denial and there\u2019s suddenly a longing for solutions,\u201d says Dubois. \u201cWe\u2019re saying: \u2018Let\u2019s not wait for the government, we the people are the solution and can drive massive change.\u2019 We\u2019re talking about how we can move from rebellion to restoration.\u201d It may be difficult to measure how awareness is raised, but perhaps it can be guided by the straightforward measurement that is planting trees. As Dubois puts it: \u201cIt\u2019s tangible, it\u2019s simple, it\u2019s life-giving.\u201d \u2022 This article is part of a series on possible solutions to some of the world\u2019s most stubborn problems.
