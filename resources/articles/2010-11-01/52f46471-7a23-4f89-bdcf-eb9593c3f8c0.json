England were trailing 1-0 when Steele, on as a half-time replacement for Scott Loach, brought down Boris Vukcevic as the striker tried to go around him. The referee, Christof Virant, stuck to the letter of the law by awarding a penalty and dismissed Steele, and Cenk Tosun beat Lansbury to put the game beyond England. \"I think it was one of those scenarios where a penalty would suffice for ourselves and the Germans,\" Pearce said. \"The game was probably finished when the ball hit the net from the penalty spot, but whether it was a penalty or not, I have no idea. As a spectacle for the fans, it spoiled the game. It might have been the right decision but it's irrelevant. It's one of those things that happens when you are a goalkeeper.\" It was a frustrating end to England's 15-game, five-year unbeaten away record, as they hoped to avenge last year's 4-0 Uefa Under-21 Championship final defeat to the same oppositiion, which was played on neutral soil in Sweden. Pearce had no complaints with the overall outcome, as his depleted side had fallen behind when Loach failed to keep out a speculative effort from Konstantin Rausch. Lansbury fared rather better than his two predecessors in the England goal, making several competent saves to stop Germany turning a dead game into a rout, and his attitude impressed Pearce. \"Henri put himself forward and I thought he was outstanding. Everything that went to him he handled very well. We might have found another goalkeeper tonight.\" Pearce added: \"I thought Ryan Bertrand played well. I thought Danny Rose slogged away well and I thought the spirit when we went down to 10 men was very good. A lot of our players made debuts tonight. If you asked [Connor] Wickham and [Josh] McEachran, who have got their first cap, what they felt then they'd have been happy. [Manchester City's Kieran] Trippier had a solid game at right-back. You have to take the positives out of it and move on.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
