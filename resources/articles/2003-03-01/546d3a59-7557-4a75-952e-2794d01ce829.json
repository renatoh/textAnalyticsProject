The company's spectacular climbdown came just one day after a front-page story in The Observer Business section prompted furious protests from campaign groups. The \u00a312 million claim was equivalent to 10% of the impoverished South American state's annual income and less than 0.3% of Big Food Group 's \u00a35.5 billion turnover last year. The company's dogged pursuit of compensation for funds invested in the country's sugar industry prompted comparisons with Nestle, the Swiss food conglomerate that attracted disdain for its attempts to recoup funds from the Ethiopian government. Nestle too dropped its claim in the face of public outrage. Big Food Group said yesterday: \"We have reviewed this matter carefully and believe the interests of both our company and those of the people of Guyana are best served by not proceeding.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
