Pep Guardiola was as pleased with this cold-eyed display as he was at having Sergio Ag\u00fcero back on the field, the forward scoring after only 10 minutes of a late cameo. \u201cHis instinct to score will always be there, he had three or four training sessions and the reaction was good,\u201d said Guardiola of Ag\u00fcero\u2019s recovery from a knee problem. \u201cTonight he had 25 minutes and scored. Step by step [for him] \u2013 we will see his reaction tomorrow to returning \u2013 this is most important.\u201d The manager offered a clear \u201cno\u201d when asked if Ag\u00fcero can start Saturday\u2019s derby at Manchester United. Of City\u2019s group stage he said: \u201cReally happy for the way we played in all the games without exception, we scored goals, we conceded only a few. It is the next round now and we\u2019ll see some incredible teams in it so it will be an interesting draw.\u201d Guardiola retained only Ilkay G\u00fcndogan and Riyad Mahrez from Saturday\u2019s win over Fulham here yet he still patrolled the technical area. A familiar pattern of fast passing often moved the ball towards Steve Mandanda\u2019s goal, as when Phil Foden completed one sequence with a cross aimed at Kyle Walker. The right-back leaped high but his header was misdirected. A clearer chance came when Bernardo Silva threaded a pass to Mahrez. The Algerian was clear but left his manager clutching his head as the shot was saved by Mandanda. City\u2019s opener felt a matter of time but it was not to come during the first half. Their incessant pressure next featured G\u00fcndogan\u2019s free-kick being met with a powerful Aymeric Laporte header but, again, this was off target. Now came a first foray from Marseille. Dimitri Payet switched from his central striker role to the right and floated the ball in. City can be vulnerable aerially and so it proved: Laporte was nowhere near the delivery and Val\u00e8re Germain should have done better than a miscued header. By the interval the contest remained goalless. After a 20-yard Mahrez effort went wide, Marseille enjoyed some sustained pressure. John Stones, on for the injured Eric Garc\u00eda, made a sliding challenge to deny Germain. Moments later Morgan Sanson steered past Zack Steffen\u2019s right-hand post. Then, Pape Gueye was denied by the latter at close range. Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas\u2019s side\u2019s hopes of finishing third and thus earning a Europa League berth were rocked three minutes into the second half. This time City\u2019s radar was precise \u2013 in the slick relaying of the ball from Laporte to Silva to Mahrez to Torres \u2013 and in the latter\u2019s ruthless finish. This had Villas-Boas visibly furious as Marseille\u2019s task of bettering Olympiakos\u2019s result in order to qualify \u2013 the Greeks were losing to Porto at that point \u2013 had become far harder. The sight of Kevin De Bruyne, Gabriel Jesus and Benjamin Mendy warming up will not have cheered them either, Raheem Sterling having already replaced G\u00fcndogan at the break, the latter taking a knock to his ankle. Still, Florian Thauvin offered a flicker of hope for the visitors with a run though his cross was cut out and, now Foden threatened for Cityonly to disappoint when twice giving Mandanda tame efforts. City were in firm control, flooding Marseille at will. Along the touchline a grinning Ag\u00fcero enjoyed a vigorous warm-up and was introduced on 66 minutes. His instinct allowed him to make it 2-0 from close range, before Sterling bundled in a late third, later given as an \u00c1lvaro Gonz\u00e1lez own goal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
