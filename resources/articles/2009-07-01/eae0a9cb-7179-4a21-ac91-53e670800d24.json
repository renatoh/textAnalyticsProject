From the trite little joke about the need to rename the Venus Rosewater Dish, which Serena held like an offertory plate to the sky; to the way she knelt on the grass in supplication after winning; to the manner in which she bowed her head upon the desk in the interview room in order to the illustrate the bone-headedness of the world rankings; Serena showed she has emerged from the shadowy place which a couple of years ago made it look as though she was nearing the end. \"I was going through a lot of stuff, besides surgery and including surgery,\" she said. \"A lot that not everyone will understand or ever know.\" Now, at 27, she has shown herself to be the supreme server in the women's game, her beautifully simple action launching 12 more aces in the final and bringing her total for the tournament to 72; as a bold spirit in adversity, having followed the match point she saved in her semi-final with two saved break points at 3\u20134 against Venus; and as capable of climbing the pantheon. This, her 11th grand-slam title, took her to within one of Billie Jean King. Though still a long way behind Margaret Court (24) and Steffi Graf (22), Serena does now appear to be considering whether it might be possible to reach the 18 won by Martina Navratilova and Chris Evert. \"That would mean a lot of tennis,\" she said. On the evidence of her current fitness, that may now be possible. As for having prevented her sister from joining Navratilova, Graf and King as those who have won three straight Wimbledon titles, her answer \u2013 that Venus is \"a living legend right now,\" \u2013 hinted that the ultimate nightmare, of permanent hurt between sisters forced to compete against each other, has been avoided. This year's final was unlike the 2008 match, when Serena took her defeat with a twisted face and confused emotions, or the year-end championships in Doha, when she ended in tears. When that kind of thing happens one remembers the warning from the British player Christine Truman-Janes that many people are oblivious to the potential hell of being required to compete against a sibling, which led to her elder sister giving up the game. On Saturday, the two Williams played full throttle against each other \u2013 quite unlike some of their earlier encounters \u2013 and with evident emotional hurt. They had no eye contact during the cross-over after the first set. But at the end they hugged and patted and smiled at each other. \"I didn't think about Venus at all today, I just thought of her as an opponent,\" said Serena. Twice there were net cords without any noticeable apology. \"Let's face it, life's unfair,\" one remembered Venus as having said. \"Once you accept that, you'll be fine.\" Maybe that was why she was so stoical about the heavily bandaged knee, which reportedly caused her to come down the stairs at an angle before the final. Her father, Richard, had said this was a problem, but Venus did not. It may nevertheless have been a factor in her serving wobbles, which several times caused her to let drop the toss and restart the action and which brought a double fault at break-point down at 2\u20133 in the second set. This was the first break of serve in a match in which both women hit the ball with extraordinary power and often with great topspin, but rarely with subtlety and not at all with slice. After it, the door to victory was open and Serena accelerated through to victory. It contrasted with Serena's serving response at 3\u20134, 15\u201340 in the first set, when she twice got solid deliveries in and attacked. In trouble, she always wanted to attack, she had said, to try to \"do something like a hero\". Such conspicuous spirit in adversity caused her father to make some not entirely appropriate remark about alligators and Mike Tyson. She had said, rather tersely, that it was no surprise Richard was absent from the final, as \"we booked his flight back already\". Afterwards she was more generous to him, turning to the cameras and saying \"thanks, dad, for putting up with me.\" Unfortunately the women's world rankings do not reflect how well Serena has regained pre-eminence, prompting jokes about how someone who holds three of the four grand-slam titles can fail to be world No1. \"You know my motivation is to win another grand slam and stay No2,\" Serena chuckled. She then made herself and everyone else present laugh by attempting to describe the situation straight-faced. \"I think Dinara [Safina] did a great job to get to No1 \u2013 she won Rome and Madrid,\" she said. It was at that point that her head ended on the desk.But she had been playing for laughs. She arrived at the press conference in a T-shirt on which was printed \"are you looking at my titles?\" on the part covering her breasts. \"I thought if I won and got 11 titles I would wear this shirt, because I wouldn't know if you guys were looking at my titles, orrrrrr,\" Serena said, moving her hand across expansively across her front and delivering a suggestive anti-climax, \"......my Gatorade bottle.\" It was seaside postcard humour. But better than a prescription for sororicidal trauma. Ends"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
