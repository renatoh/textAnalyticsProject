I will be victorious.\" The 32-year-old Guyana-born Eastman has become the cornerstone of the BBC's domestic boxing coverage, with Audley Harrison apparently unable or unwilling to face a worthwhile opponent. By contrast, Eastman is having his sixth contest in only 10 months and is one of the few fighters Britain can boast as being of genuine world class. \"There has been a conscious decision taken to move Howard up to another level, because we believe in him and think he is capable of winning a world title if he gets the chance,\" said the BBC's head of boxing strategy, Mike Lewis. \"Cherifi is proven at the top, and this is a proper fight.\" Perhaps Cherifi is not quite the fighter he was. In 1997 he lost on a split decision to the then World Boxing Council champion Robin Reid, and won the same title the next year by beating the American Keith Holmes. Subsequent defeats to William Joppy,the American who inflicted Eastman's only professional defeat in 38 contests, and the Namibian Harry Simons, were no disgrace, although some feel a four-round pounding he took from Felix Trinidad may have taken its toll. Eastman has an ambition to win world titles at more than one weight, and has been linked with a contest against the World Boxing Organisation super-middleweight champion Joe Calzaghe. Although the prospect of that fight has never got past the discussion stage, Eastman's promoter Mick Hennessy said: \"There are some major showdowns out there. \"Howard has already demonstrated against opponents from this side of the pond that he is arguably the world's best middleweight and it won't belong before he is doing that to American opposition. \"I have tried in vain to make fights against the likes of Joe Calzaghe and Wayne Alexander [both promoted by Frank Warren ], so now it is time to look at the bigger picture. A victory over a widely respected opponent such as Hassine Cherifi will obviously help our cause. He is still extremely dangerous.\" A panel of experts recently rated Eastman only behind Calzaghe and Lennox Lewis in pound-for-pound talent among current British boxers, and he could win by a stoppage tonight, around the eighth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
