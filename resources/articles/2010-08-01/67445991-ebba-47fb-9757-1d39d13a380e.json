According to her trainer, this is likely to be her second-last outing in France before she attempts to go out with a bang at the Breeders' Cupin America. Freddy Head teased followers of the sport this week, saying it was \"not impossible\" that Goldikova would remain at his yard through 2011, when she will be six, an age by which top-class racehorses have invariably been retired. Yesterday, he sounded a little wistful as he confirmed that keeping the mare in training was \"not the plan\". Referring to her owners, the Wertheimer brothers, he said: \"I think they want her to go to stud, let's put itthat way.\" Barring a change of heart, that means British racegoers had their last glimpse of Goldikova when she held on by a diminishing margin in the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot in June. Her main rival tomorrow is Paco Boy, the horse who came within a neck of running her down on that occasion, and Head is respectful of the challenger. \"It's going to be a tough race,\" he said. \"Paco Boy is a real tough horse and I imagine he's going to be a bit nearer [during the early part of the race] than last time.\" Tactics seem likely to play a part in the Marois. Richard Hughes, Paco Boy's jockey, has expressed a desire to \"sit up her pipe\" tomorrow, having been prevented from tracking the French horse at Ascot by the large number of runners in that race. There will be only eight at Deauville, two of them acting as pacemakers for Goldikova. \"I think with two, it's a bit better,\" Head said. \"I want to make sure [of a strong pace] and one will help the other. One will lead and one follow.\" Using more than one pacemaker, though not unprecedented, is highly unusual but the trainer is determined to play to Goldikova's strengths. \"She has a hell of a pace and then she has another gear at the end of her races.\" Head said of Ascot: \"I don't believe that was her best race.\" He believes the cross-channel travel took something out of his mare, who had also run below form when winning the Falmouth at Newmarket last summer. \"And then Ascot is a very tough course, with the long, straight mile, and yes, she started to get a little tired going uphill at the end. But she took the race well and she's as good as she's ever been.\" A fortnight ago, Goldikova reappeared back on home soil, in the Prix Rothschild, and hacked up by an easy three lengths. Trailing in her wake was the British-trained Music Show, with Hughes on board. It was her fourth success from four visits to Deauville, the course on the Normandy coast that stages a series of major races through August. More significantly, that win was her 10th in a Group One contest, matching the record for a European-trained horse set by her compatriot, Miesque. Head was Miesque's jockey and happily acknowledges his luck in being associated with both horses (\"It's amazing, you can't imagine. It must be a million to one\"). He is, understandably, reluctant to compare them, though he describes Miesque as a trickier ride who could stop if taken to the front too soon. That being said, Head does not accept Goldikova should automatically be regarded as the better horse if or when she gets the record to herself. Four of her victories, he points out, have been in races confined to fillies and mares, the Rothschild and the Falmouth, which did not have Group One status when Miesque was in action in the late 80s. \"If they had been Group Ones, I suppose Miesque could have won even more,\" he said. And it should be acknowledged that Miesque's success came in a shorter span, as she retired at the age of four. Miesque's most notable achievement was in becoming the first horse to win two Breeders' Cup races, a feat that has since been matched by a talented handful but never surpassed. If all goes well tomorrow, Goldikova will have her final European run in the Prix du Moulin before jetting over to Kentucky in pursuit of an unprecedented third victory in the Breeders' Cup Mile. Her first two Cup wins came at Santa Anita in California but Head feels the change of venue, to Churchill Downs, should not be a problem. \"American courses are all very similar. In fact, I think there is a longer straight there, which will help us. \"But that is in the future. It all depends on Sunday.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
