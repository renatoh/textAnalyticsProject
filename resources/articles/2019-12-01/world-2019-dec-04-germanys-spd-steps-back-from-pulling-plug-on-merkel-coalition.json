In a surprise result, two little-known leftwingers, Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken, caused an upset at the weekend when they won the leadership vote of the world\u2019s oldest social democratic party, a move that seemed to signal a rejection of the party\u2019s centrist \u201cthird way\u201d phase initiated under the former chancellor Gerhard Schr\u00f6der. The result came as a shock not only to the widely expected winner, Germany\u2019s deputy chancellor and finance minister, Olaf Scholz, but also to the victorious pair and their supporters. The new leaders, both critics of the SPD\u2019s \u201cgrand coalition\u201d with Merkel\u2019s centre-right party, had said throughout their leadership campaign that a decision on the future of the governing alliance would be made at this weekend\u2019s party conference in Berlin. But the latest draft for Friday\u2019s main motion, agreed between Esken, Walter-Borjans, Scholz and the interim leader, Malu Dreyer, seems designed to put the break on a rushed exit by tasking the new leadership merely to \u201cseek a dialogue\u201d with Merkel\u2019s CDU about measures to stabilise Germany\u2019s slowing economy and amend an already agreed climate package. In a move designed to mend relations between leftwing and centrist factions in the SPD, the Guardian understands the wording of the motion could lead to Scholz and other ministers being invited to join the talks. Kevin K\u00fchnert, the hoodie-wearing leader of the SPD youth wing, who is seen as one of the architects of Esken and Walter-Borjan\u2019s shock victory, has also appeared to cool on the prospect of an exit from the grand coalition, known as \u201cGroKo\u201d. \u201cIf you leave a coalition, you end up giving up a degree of control,\u201d K\u00fchnert told the Rheinische Post newspaper in an interview. \u201cSPD delegates should bear that in mind too when they made up their mind.\u201d \u201cIf need be, I am not afraid to go into an election with the SPD in the next three months,\u201d said K\u00fchnert, who is in the running to be voted deputy leader at the weekend. But many party insiders question whether the leftwingers calling the shots have the right staff and action-ready strategy to go into fresh elections early next year. Another reason why even seasoned GroKo critics are reluctant to bring down the current government is that it has yet to implement one the SPD\u2019s totemic projects, a raising of the basic pension for low-income workers employed all their lives. Yet the risk of a chaotic end to Merkel\u2019s fourth term in office remains. Apart from formally voting in Esken and Walter-Borjans as new leaders, delegates could propose and pass a motion to ditch the government\u2019s commitment to balanced budgets, the so-called schwarze Null (\u201cblack zero\u201d). A strongly worded motion committing SPD ministers to further spending could push the more fiscally conservative finance minister Scholz to throw in the towel, unravelling Merkel\u2019s current cabinet. Walter-Borjans told the Guardian in an interview last month that driving Germany to commit to more spending would be a defining issue of his leadership. \u201cIf the economy does indeed enter a downturn then we will need to make massive investments. Because our infrastructure is not in a good state, and nor is our digital infrastructure nor our schools. We have to question the black zero,\u201d said Walter-Borjans, a former finance minister of the state of North-Rhine Westphalia. \u201cIf that doesn\u2019t work with our coalition partner then that\u2019s not a good sign.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
