He said the scientist was concerned about his pay, \"but not bitter\". On his dealings with the press, Dr Shuttleworth said that Dr Kelly was actively encouraged by the government to provide press briefings on areas of expertise such as the 1991-98 weapons inspections in Iraq. There was, however, some confusion over whom Dr Kelly should report to concerning his dealings with the media - his \"employers\" were the Ministry of Defence, Foreign Office and UN - but, said Dr Shuttleworth, he was never aware of any objections over Dr Kelly's press links. Key question When you say that Dr Kelly was encouraged to provide briefings, can you elaborate a little on what subjects the briefings would be? Would it be of a technical nature relating to WMD? Key answer During my time, most of the interest was related to Iraq, and he was asked to give briefings on the work of Unscom [the 1991-98 weapons inspection regime in Iraq], which covered not only technical issues but also issues relating to the personalities who had been involved on the Iraqi side, the scale of activity; essentially assessing and assessments of the Iraqi programme."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
