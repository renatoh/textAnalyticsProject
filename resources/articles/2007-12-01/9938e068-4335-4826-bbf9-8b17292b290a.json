This seems to have cured the problem, but my PC is phenomenally slow. Is there likely to be something still remaining? Is Spyware Doctor worth keeping or should I try something else? John Uttley JS: W32.Myzor.FK@yf is part of an attempt to sell you a fake anti-spyware program - there are lots - and it also tries to steal passwords. You should change yours. Many free programs are able to remove it, including Lavasoft's Ad-Aware and AVG AntiSpyware (formerly Ewido). To double-check your PC, download a new free antivirus program, reboot your computer in Safe Mode and run it, then reboot and run it again. You could also try one of the online scanners, such as Trend Micro's Housecall or Kaspersky Online (kaspersky.com/virusscanner). PC Tool's Spyware Doctor is a well-respected program, and a cut-down version is included in the Google Pack software. It can be a resource hog, but as you've bought it, it's not worth paying for Webroot's SpySweeper as well. Unfortunately, the free versions of AVG AntiSpyware and SuperAntiSpyware don't provide continuous real-time monitoring. If you feel you need this, I'd suggest using Windows Defender (formerly Giant AntiSpyware), and running Spyware Doctor from time to time to double-check it. Bugged by pops and clicks I've been using my hi-fi turntable to transfer vinyl to CD, but it faithfully reproduces all the clicks and crackles of my well-played collection. I've tried the Wave Editor tools in both Roxio (3 through 9) and Nero but they still leave a recording that is decidedly \"vintage\". John Palmer JS: There are a lot of programs that will automatically remove clicks and crackles from digitised files. However, the results can be extremely variable, and many people complain they also take some of the life out of recordings. The best you can do is try a few and see what suits your needs best. At the moment, Acoustica's Spin It Again 2.1 (acoustica.com/spinitagain) is well-regarded when it comes to delivering good results economically - it's $34.95 (\u00a317) - without much effort. An alternative was Steinberg's Clean Plus 5, most recently sold by Pinnacle, but it seems to have been discontinued. Diamond Cut Audio Restoration Tools (diamondcut.com) are also worth considering, and Diamond Cut Millennium is available online for $55. (The full Diamond Cut 7 costs $159.) Serious restoration might well involve several passes, and Sonic Foundry's Noise Reduction ($399) includes four separate plug-ins: Noise Reduction, Click and Crackle Removal, Vinyl Restoration and Clipped Peak Restoration. There's also Brian Davies's Click Repair, which is available for $40 Australian (\u00a317), direct from the author (tinyurl.com/yuac76). If you want to do the job using free software, Clive Backham has an excellent guide to digitising vinyl (tinyurl.com/j58o) that covers the main software options. Backham also wrote Wave Repair to \"ease many of the tasks that are required during restoration of music recorded from vinyl records, and which are often difficult using general purpose tools\". Obviously it would be better not to have too many clicks and crackles to start with. Check your stylus and make sure your deck is set up correctly. You should also clean your records. Specialist products include the Disc Doctor's Miracle Record Cleaner (discdoc.com), which may be available in the UK from vinylcare.co.uk, and carbon fibre brushes. A PC for Photoshop Since I bought a camera producing RAW images and became more adventurous with Photoshop, I have outrun the capacity of my old PC, although it has 4GB of memory. Most of the available quad-core machines seem to be designed for gamers, which is not what I require. Martin McNicol JS: Almost any modern dual-core PC should be fine for Photoshop, which uses up to 2GB of memory on 32-bit systems, and mainly does two-dimensional graphics. You don't need a gaming machine designed to provide high frame rates with 3D graphics. For good performance with Photoshop, it's best to have a fast processor and a very fast hard drive, although a fast 2D graphics card should help. Moving to a 64-bit version of Windows XP or Vista (or Mac OS 10.5) would also speed up the program in use, but you might have a few problems getting drivers for peripherals. Sadly, even the latest Adobe Creative Suite 3 is still 32-bit, and the major benefits will not emerge until it's a 64-bit application, and has been optimised for multi-core processors. Adobe has a technical note, Optimise performance of Photoshop (CS2 on Windows), at tinyurl.com/2rvjs2. Following Adobe's advice could speed things up a bit, and therefore make your need for a new PC less urgent. HomePlug or DS2? You recommended HomePlug as a way of creating a home network over the mains wiring. Could you advise whether to go for the American HomePlug or for the European DS2 200Mbps standards. I gather that BT and Sky have announced some sort of scheme to provide Freeview/Sky over the National Grid using DS2. My interest is in establishing a private computer network in my block of flats rather than in watching television! Peter Davis JS: HomePlug 1.0 is the de facto standard used by most products, which are based on Intellon chips. These are usually 14Mbps, which is fast enough for home networking, or have been extended to the \"turbo\" 85Mbps. However, products using the later 200Mbps HomePlug AV standard are now widely available. DS2 Powerline technology, which uses chips from a Spanish company (ds2.es), starts at 200Mbps, and 400Mbps has been demonstrated. The problem is that the different systems may not live together, as some people who have installed BT Vision using the DS2-based Comtrend mains adaptors have found (tinyurl.com/338gfw). HomePlug 1.0 and AV are designed to co-exist. However, the safest approach is not to mix different speeds (14, 85, 200) or different technologies (HomePlug 1.0, HomePlug AV, DS2), if possible. The IEEE is now voting on a draft standard for powerline communications through the P1901 working group (grouper.ieee.org/groups/1901). In November, a merged proposal from the HomePlug Powerline Alliance and the Japanese Consumer Electronics Powerline Communication Alliance (behind Panasonic's HD Power Line Communications) beat the one from the Universal Powerline Association (behind DS2) by 28 votes to 13. It now needs 75% of the vote taken on December 11. Since HomePlug AV is backed by Cisco, Comcast, General Electric and Intel, it should win through. Under the circumstances, 200Mbps HomePlug AV products seem the most likely to be closest to standard, but it's a case of overkill for sharing a DSL connection. \u00b7 Get your queries answered by Jack Schofield, our computer editor at jack.schofield@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
