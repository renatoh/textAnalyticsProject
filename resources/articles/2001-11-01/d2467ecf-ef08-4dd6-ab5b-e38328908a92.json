Obviously they will not turn up for the medicals in an ambulance - all they have to do is look suitably glum during the press conference which announces their inability to travel, then get home pronto and get on the telephone to sort out their injury insurance. Churlish? Cynical more like, if not downright defamatory. Misguided or not, it was a courageous decision not to travel which was made by the bowlers Robert Croft and Andy Caddick. In a plaintively wet bit of ghosted self-justification in a Sunday newspaper yesterday Caddick said: \"Scorn has flowed . . . the word coward has been used.\" Croft had earlier admitted: \"Some people are calling us spineless.\" Those \"some people\" included even the Times, which thundered on the top of its front page the unambiguous headline \"England's Two Refuseniks Professional Whingers\". With Croft a Welshman and Caddick born and bred in New Zealand, I was reminded of the gloriously sniffy and magisterial outburst by the former Times cricket correspondent, emeritus John Woodcock, a quarter of a century ago when the England captain, South African-born Tony Greig, was revealed as clandestine recruiting officer for Kerry Packer's breakaway rebels. \"What has to be remembered is that Greig is not an Englishman by birth or upbringing, but only by adoption. It is not the same thing as being English through and through.\" For students of family tensions it is a piquant fluke that Caddick has been replaced by his Somerset confrere Richard Johnson. \"My thoughts will be with him,\" (I bet they will) said Caddick yesterday, adding disingenuously, \"I want desperately for England to win but also to come back intact.\" Croft said last week: \"Most people I bump into in Wales tell me they wouldn't go either if they were in my shoes.\" Mischievously, one wonders if those Welsh supporters did not have bombs in Afghanistan on their minds but were among those who had seen Croft carted all over Cardiff and beyond this summer, where the off-spinner's return for Glamorgan was to plonk him at a humiliating 109th (his replacement Martyn Ball was 35th) in the English first-class averages with 23 wickets at almost 40 runs apiece. One wonders as well how much their support for Croft's decision to stay at home had to do with the fact that four scintillating Indian batsmen must have each been smack ing their lips when they read Croft's name in the original touring party - the more so had they seen the cutting from the bowler's local Western Mail on Wednesday, which quoted the off-spinner cursing his luck at missing \"the opportunity of testing my skills against Tendulkar, Dravid, Laxman and Ganguly on their own pitches\". India's debutant centurion this weekend, Virender Sehwag, makes five. Any bets on whether Caddick, too, had been nursing similarly keen expectations of proving his skills against Tendulkar and co when he was going for that horrendous four-an-over nought for 146 against Australia at the Oval in the last Test in August? I confess to even further demeaning suspicions about Wednesday's fitness tests for White and Giles. With the latter already giving himself \"only a 50-50 chance\" and with Ball's selection proof of the barren cupboard for English spinners, it would be dismaying if they lazily aimed like-for-like and named Phil Tufnell as stand-in for Giles. The Middlesex left-armer's one for 174 at the Oval in the face of Australia's single-innings onslaught of 641 for four was a return as horrible as Caddick's, and one fears for the free-hits he will offer to India when his shoulders droop and the going gets tough. Anyway, why inflict Tufnell on the Indians again? On the last tour there eight years ago his weary mid-trip bleat still makes the blood boil: \"Done the elephants. Done the poverty. That's it, can't we go home now?\" Enough of the Cockney dodger - he has had his chances and feebly dodged most that actually mattered - and, should Giles prove unfit on Wednesday, why not opt for the tried-and-trad English method and admit there is no excuse any more to neglect Surrey's Martin Bicknell? Bicknell has been tilting at the county creases so long and devotedly uncomplaining that he is perceived as much older than his actual years. In fact, he is younger than both Caddick and Tufnell. Spearheading the best county attack of the decade, this summer (72 wickets at 21) Bicknell made it 10 seasons on the trot that he has taken more than 50 wickets. He is an English bowler in the classic tradition - shortish gallop, bowl-all-day, not too fast, not too slow, high action, away swing and surprising nip-backer. He has been as much the metronomic heartbeat of the Oval in the 1990s as Alec Bedser was in the 1950s and, should Giles (or White) not be 100 per cent in mind or body there should be no excuse for not picking him. Mind you, looking it up, Sir Alec never set foot in India on cricket tour with England. In fact, how about this for an Olde Englande all-star XI? Hutton, Bailey, May, Compton, Close, Evans, Illingworth, Laker, Trueman, Snow and Bedser. Not one of them toured India. All were invited, all declined. And there were a few more where they came from. No one carped when any of that lot languidly decided on a winter at home. How times change. There will be carping all right if one particular man declines a trip. The ECB chairman, Lord MacLaurin of Knebworth, owes it to himself and his reputation, as well as to English cricket, to put in an appearance. He must be seen flying the flag in support of the team he sent. M'lord Tesco will pump up his deflating profile only if he is seen, say, in the front row of the president's box for all five days of the opening Test in the first week of December at Mohali (potentially the most politically volatile of the Test venues), and seated next to his perceived arch-enemy, the Indian cricket board president Jagmohan Dalmiya. MacLaurin, even by his standards, has had a contrary month. While his subordinates, the chairman of selectors Graveney and, especially, the ECB chief executive Tim Lamb, have played their difficult hand of cards assuredly, his lordship's ham-handed interventions and plonking pronouncements have continued to wobble the tightrope and, certainly, done no favours to the wavering players. One day: \"The tour is definitely on, no question,\" said MacLaurin. Next day: \"There must be a definite improvement in the situation within a fortnight or the tour is definitely off.\" Such misjudgments for the head of a major sport were as diplomatically askew as MacLaurin's letter to the Times on the eve of the general election, which urged the country to vote for the obviously-to-be-obliterated Conservatives - where did that leave cricket under the new government? Just as crass was MacLaurin's performance during England's winter tour to Pakistan this time last year when, after judgmentally demanding that any Pakistan player under even the foggiest of rumoured suspicion for match-fixing should not be allowed to play against the purity of England until cleared totally by a tribunal of inquiry, once the same mud is thrown a few weeks later at England's Alec Stewart, the good Lord \"clears\" his player of any suspicion on the strength of a two-minute phone call. That upset the sub-continent hugely, a prime case, with a vengeance and long after its time, of playing the colonial white man and district commissioner. It was in the same timeless spirit, I suppose, as the MCC captain Lord Lionel Tennyson 65 years ago, when he brought back his England team after the happy 1936 tour, to be chided officially by the colonial secretary for addressing in public throughout the expedition pompous Lord Linlithgow, Viceroy of India, as \"Boy\" and not \"Your Excellency\". Explained Tennyson: \"Dammit, Sir, don't you realise the fellow was my fag at Eton?\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
