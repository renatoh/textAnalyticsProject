More often we hear of a 'democratic deficit' - that decisions are made out of sight of the people. There is an exception: the Eurovision song contest. Once, shadowy national juries allocated votes on behalf of the nation. But now millions of TV viewers across the continent get to vote by phone or text message for the kitsch musical abomination of their choice. (Naturally we congratulate this year's deserving winners.) This popular participation has only exacerbated the trend for ancient enmities and neighbourly alliances to take precedence over the music. The power to decide what should be the Song for Europe must be taken back from the masses. It is the only way to restore confidence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
