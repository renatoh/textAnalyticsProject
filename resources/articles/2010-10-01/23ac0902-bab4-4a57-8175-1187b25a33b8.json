Losses from online banking fraud reached \u00a339m in the first half of 2009, a rise of more than 50% over the year before. Whichever way you look at it, the director of GCHQ, Iain Lobban, was not exaggerating when he said this week that Britain's critical infrastructure faced a real and credible threat from cyber attack. As each government conducts more of its business online, the bar for entry to the espionage game is being lowered. Cyberspace is not no man's land. It is a battlefield contested every day, hour, minute and second. Mr Lobban's rare foray into the limelight is not accidental. On Monday the government will publish the \"strategic context\" of its defence review, and it is likely that cyber warfare will feature prominently in it. However, before we get carried away with ghoulish phrases such as cyberwar arms race or cybergeddon, it is worth taking a cool look at the nature of this threat. First, if there is a war going on out there in cyberspace, it is one in which western government agencies take an active part. The cyber attacks that generate publicity are those presumed to have been launched by autocratic regimes against democratic governments or individuals \u2013 Estonia and the Dalai Lama being just two of the recent victims. A veil, however, is cast over computer malware programs designed to cripple the Iranian nuclear programme. One such program, called Stuxnet, which is designed to attack a Siemens industrial control computer used to manage oil pipelines, electrical power grids and nuclear plants, has appeared in China, India and Indonesia as well as Iran. That leads to the second point, that this is a war in which authorship is contested. Unlike a missile flying through the air, or even polonium-210, the evidential trail of a cyber attack is difficult, if not impossible, to establish. Some use botnets, a collection of compromised computers running programs that allow them to be controlled remotely. This will create two contradictory dynamics. It will be in each country's interest \u2013 not least those, such as Britain, with a growing information economy \u2013 to tighten up liaison between private companies, internet service providers and the government. If the internet has become part of our critical infrastructure, like electricity or water, this is a necessity. There will similarly be a need to increase international co-operation on cyber fraud, as there is on drug trafficking. But it is equally true that, as the bar for entry to the espionage game has been lowered, it is a low jump that all players in that particular game will be tempted to make."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
