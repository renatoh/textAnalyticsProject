In a rare statement which was not - it appeared - provoked by David Cameron's speech, she warned that the UK was in the frontline against Islamist fanatics. The former Conservative prime minister joined members of the US administration in a ceremony to mark the fifth anniversary of the attacks on New York and Washington. Dick Cheney, the vice-president, had invited her to stay at the White House. \"These acts of barbarism brought suffering to thousands of families, both in this country and elsewhere,\" Lady Thatcher said in a statement. \"This heinous attack upon America was an attack upon us all. With America, Britain stands in the frontline against Islamist fanatics who hate our beliefs, our liberties and our citizens. We must not falter. We must not fail.\" She added: \"Today, we are here to remember, to pray for the dead and to share their loved ones' grieving. But we also need to renew our resolve that, however bitter or lengthy the struggle, this evil shall not prevail.\" Lady Thatcher also attended a commemorative church service and met Condoleezza Rice, the secretary of state, at a memorial event at the state department."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
