It is flattering, salacious and gap-filled all at once. Beyond that, the comma in the book\u2019s title lurks needlessly like the exclamation attached to \u201cJeb!\u201d What either punctation mark was meant to convey, if anything, remains a mystery. Bennett, a CNN reporter who covers Melania and a former gossip columnist at the Las Vegas Sun, is generally admiring of the first lady\u2019s fashion sense and persona, and draws a strong contrast between her and Donald Trump\u2019s first two wives. In children\u2019s book terms, Melania Trump is the Goldilocks of the trio, neither needy nor spotlight-seeking but just right. For now, anyway. When Trump conditioned his third trip to the altar on a prenuptial agreement, Melania Trump didn\u2019t blink. As the president\u2019s dalliances with Stormy Daniels and Karen McDougal made front-page news, the first lady conveyed decorous disgust. Without a word, she intuited the parameters of the deal. Still, Melania was deeply hurt to learn that Trump hooked up with a porn star just months after the birth of Barron, their son. As retribution, Melania Trump arrived separately from her husband at the 2018 State of the Union address and refused to accompany him on an overseas trip. She also declined to hold Trump\u2019s hand after a domestic flight. The message was not missed, by the president or the press. On the other hand, as Bennett writes, the couple keep separate bedrooms, Melania Trump knew what she was getting into, and her parents were also living at the White House. Multiple safety valves were built in to the Trumpian arrangement. Free, Melania plumbs but not too deeply. Bennett describes how she obtained her green card in 2001 after sponsoring herself as a model of \u201cextraordinary ability\u201d, then in turn sponsored her Slovenian parents for US citizenship. According to Bennett, the first lady and her parents thus used a visa process the Trump administration is \u201ctrying to repeal\u201d, namely \u201cchain migration\u201d. What Trump branded \u201charmful\u201d to US was \u201cOK for his in-laws\u201d. Just a year ago, he tweeted: \u201cCHAIN MIGRATION must end now! Some people come in, and they bring their whole family with them, who can be truly evil. NOT ACCEPTABLE!\u201d But Free, Melania fails to examine how Melania Trump received what became known as an \u201cEinstein visa\u201d. In August 2016, Politico raised the issue of immigration fraud. Michael Wildes, her immigration lawyer, issued a statement denying irregularity or wrongdoing. Free, Melania also airbrushes the first lady\u2019s politics, portraying her as more of a compassionate conservative than the president but omitting her public embrace of birtherism. As Bennett frames things: \u201cIt was Melania who told Trump that the zero-tolerance policy of removing children from the border was cruel and untenable. It was she who emphasized the opioid crisis was an emergency, one that required more federal funding.\u201d Left unsaid was a 2011 television appearance in which she went full birther. \u201cIt\u2019s not only Donald who wants to see [Barack Obama\u2019s birth certificate],\u201d Melania Trump told the camera. \u201cIt\u2019s American people who voted for him and who didn\u2019t vote for him. They want to see that.\u201d Not surprisingly, she lacks similar ardor for disclosing the Trump tax returns. By the numbers, a majority of voters want the returns released, a move Trump continues to fight in the courts. Bennett\u2019s book will most likely be remembered for tying Roger Stone to the nude photos of Melania Trump that graced Rupert Murdoch\u2019s New York Post in the heat of the 2016 campaign, and the White House\u2019s rebuke of Bennett as the president was en route to the Nato summit. Justin Trudeau, Boris Johnson and Princess Anne wouldn\u2019t be the only ones to yuck it up at the president\u2019s expense. Hours later, Anne snubbed the Trumps again. Even Joe Biden has since managed to get into the act. So how did photos taken in the mid-90s see the light of day? \u201cThe theory goes,\u201d according to Bennett, \u201cthat Trump was trying to head off a bad week on the campaign. \u201cMelania has not commented on how she thinks they got into the hands of the tabloid and on to the cover, but friends say she still refuses to believe Trump would do that to her. As for Stone, she\u2019s not so sure.\u201d Stone, whose wife denied that he played any role in the leak, awaits sentencing for lying to Congress and may be praying for a presidential pardon. Synchronicity strikes again. For her part, Stephanie Grisham, press secretary to the White House and Melania Trump, offered indignation and a non-denial denial: \u201cOur office worked with Kate in good faith on her book, and thought she would do an honest job. Sadly, it includes many false details and opinions, showing Ms Bennett spoke to many anonymous people who don\u2019t know the first lady.\u201d Forget the first family. There\u2019s nothing like a flack burned. Free, Melania also studies the first lady\u2019s rapport with Ivanka Trump, the first daughter and a purported object of Trump\u2019s desire. Bennett reports that the White House has taken a toll on the relationship, sliding from a \u201ccomfortable, if not warm, alliance\u201d to \u201ccordial, not close\u201d. Melania Trump went so far as to make clear that \u201cIvanka was not to have an office in the East Wing\u201d, the residence, when the first lady had not yet moved to DC. The pair have reportedly clashed over trips to Africa. Competition? \u201cIt\u2019s a real thing.\u201d Free, Melania reads as if it were written for an audience of two: Melania Trump and her husband, in that order. Bennett concludes: \u201cSay what you will about her, what is clear is that Melania is unlike any other first lady.\u201d There, Bennett has a point."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
