Police and probation officers concentrated on monitoring the highest-risk offenders, but paid little attention to the rest, Wes Kewell, its director of children's services,told BBC Radio 5 Live. The probation union Napo said the charity's proposal would require a big increase in staff to monitor an extra 20,000 offenders in England and Wales, costing about \u00a325m a year. An annual government report on monitoring sex offenders is due out today."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
