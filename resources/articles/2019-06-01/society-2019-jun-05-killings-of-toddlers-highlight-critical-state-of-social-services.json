The serious case review reports said mistakes were made during events leading up to the children\u2019s deaths over a four-month period in 2017 and 2018. Police, schools, health visitors and social workers all made errors. But it concluded it was not clear anything could have been done to prevent the catastrophic incidents. The reports, however, made clear that the backdrop to the tragedies was an environment of chaos in Northamptonshire\u2019s child protection services: unqualified staff making key decisions on the frontline, hundreds of cases left un-assessed for weeks and a chronic shortage of experienced social workers. Those shortcomings were even more vividly outlined in a report to ministers published last month. It concluded children\u2019s services were blighted by \u201clongstanding and systemic\u201d management failure, an embedded culture of complacency, and widespread cynicism among staff that services would improve. The report was written by the commissioner appointed by ministers to overhaul Northamptonshire\u2019s children\u2019s services, Malcolm Newsam. A year after Dylan\u2019s murder, he reflected, its safeguarding operations were still in chaos. Some staff were responsible for an unmanageable 50 child protection cases. \u201cThe service is still very fragile and there remain unacceptable risks in the system,\u201d he wrote. Northamptonshire children\u2019s services\u2019 problems are longstanding. In 2013 they were judged \u201cinadequate\u201d by Ofsted. Despite heavy investment they made little progress, and a crushing follow-up Ofsted report last November, which triggered Newsam\u2019s arrival, confirmed they had slipped back into crisis. Critics have linked Northamptonshire\u2019s woes with austerity cuts to funding and services. However, its new children\u2019s director, Sally Hodges, said financial considerations had played no part in safeguarding decisions. The authority was the second highest spender on children\u2019s social care among county councils. It is not so much that councils are not investing enough in child protection \u2013 nine out of 10 English councils overspent their children\u2019s budgets last year \u2013 but that the gap between available resources and demand is growing \u2013 about \u00a33bn by 2025 on current estimates \u2013 and spending is concentrated on crisis services, not preventive ones. The council has spent millions paying for a huge rise in children being taken into care. It is also reliant on expensive agency social workers, who comprised a quarter of the services\u2019 328 staff in December. Ironically, the children\u2019s budget was underspent by \u00a32m in February because there were so many social worker vacancies. The spiralling child protection bill, however, meant other services had to be cut: Sure Start centres and other family and community projects aimed at supporting families and stopping them slipping into crisis have been gutted, increasing the flow of young people into the child protection system, fuelled by rising child poverty, mental illness and destitution. Safeguarding problems are often rooted in cuts to early intervention services. \u201cChild protection social workers say that when they need to signpost troubled families to early help, services are no longer there,\u201d the local Labour councillor Danielle Stone said. The council has said it wants to reinvest in prevention: but it is not clear where the money will come from to do so. The independent Northamptonshire safeguarding children board is optimistic the new management team is making positive changes \u2013 there are fewer unallocated cases, lower social worker caseloads (down to an average of 19), and tighter management and oversight of cases \u2013 although it accepts change will take time. The child deaths, however, will cast another shadow over a nightmare year and a half for the Tory-controlled council: it has twice been declared bankrupt, and been told by a government inspector that it must be scrapped because its leadership failings are so chronic and deep-rooted that it is unreformable. The council is scheduled to be abolished in 2020, replaced by two new unitary authorities, and children\u2019s services will go into an independent trust outside council control. It will complete the humiliating decline of an aspiring beacon of municipal conservatism into the much-derided sick man of local government."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
