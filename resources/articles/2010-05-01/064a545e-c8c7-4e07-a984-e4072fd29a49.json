The actual number of DVDs sold in the UK dropped 5.6% last year, the first decrease since 2005. The fall was sharpest in new-release titles, which make up about a quarter of the market, with sales down 15% in 2009, according to the British Video Association's yearbook, published today. Including the embryonic digital download market for video, which is dominated by Apple's iTunes, total sales were down 4.7% at 250.7m The average price of a DVD was \u00a38.62, down 60p in the year, and overall DVD sales by revenue were just over \u00a32bn, down 13.3%. Including digital downloads, sales were \u00a32.19bn, down from \u00a32.4bn in 2008. But the rental market actually grew \u2013 to \u00a3415m last year from \u00a3412m in 2008 \u2013 as consumers opted for easy postal rental services such as Lovefilm. The BVA also blamed the \"Mamma Mia\" effect for the drop in sales. In 2008, Mamma Mia! \u2013 The Movie sold 5.1 million copies, many to people who do not regularly buy DVDs, and there was no equivalent blockbuster last year: the three bestselling DVDs were Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the James Bond film Quantum of Solace and the vampire saga Twilight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
