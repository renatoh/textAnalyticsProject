The problem lies less in the score than in the fact that we have become immune to its sentiments. It contemplates both the richness and the transience of existence, though it also envisions nature as part of a divinely ordered totality that creates structure from chaos and works to achieve the spiritual perfection of man. The turning seasons enact the passing of human life from youth to age, preparing man for the divine light of God after the winter of death. Nature's moments of violence are preludes to harmony and structure. Spring sweeps away the dissonance of winter. At the climax of the storm that disrupts the languidity of summer, Haydn re-establishes consonance by breaking into a fugue. Man is a contented creature at the centre of this idyll, peering at natural phenomena in wonder as the orchestra depicts them with mimetic glee. Living in a more jaded age, we are apt to find Haydn's sincerity naive. It's difficult nowadays to perceive The Seasons as anything other than cute. It didn't seem so on this occasion, however, thanks to a performance of affectionate brilliance, which brought together the Wiener Singakademie and the Austro-Hungarian Haydn Orchestra, based at the Esterhazy Palace where he wrote much of his work. The orchestra was the brainchild of Adam Fischer, originally scheduled to conduct. Fischer, however, has replaced the late Giuseppe Sinopoli at Bayreuth. Helmuth Rilling conducted in his stead. His approach is refined, and the score's moments of wildness - the storm, the hunt, the tavern scene - were a fraction too genteel. Elsewhere, however, the playing was immaculate, and the choral singing radiant. The solo parts are tricky. The bass carries the moral weight in a series of preachy arias, though Neal Davies avoided any suggestion of the stentorian. John Mark Ainsley was exquisite in the tenor arias. The soprano, Simone Nold, a replacement for the indisposed Susan Gritton, revealed a silvery tone with a glint in its upper registers. The audience warmed to the piece - by the end, applause was coming thick and fast after every number. Royal Albert Hall"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
