The scientists, led by a group of University of Western Australia researchers who make up the Kwongan Foundation, have spent the past year developing an application to get international protection for an area known as the Kwongan or West Australian sandplains, which stretches from Shark Bay, 630km north of Perth, to Esperance on the south coast. Former Gardening Australia host Peter Cundell is among the foundation\u2019s patrons. Professor Hans Lambers, a plant biologist with the University of Western Australia, said the world heritage application would include all national parks and reserves in the area \u2013 which make up about 20% of the total Kwongan. If the bid is successful, the resulting world heritage area would be more than twice the size of the Tasmanian wilderness world heritage area. The group has been using social media to garner popular support for the idea \u2013 its Facebook page had almost 2,300 likes on Monday \u2013 and plans to present an early draft of the application to state environment minister, Albert Jacob, next month. Lambers said the Kwongan needed to be recognised and protected as one of the richest areas on the planet for plant life. \u201cIn an area the size of England we have 8,000 higher plant species here,\u201d he said. Higher plants mean excluding organisms like algae or moss. \u201cIn the same area in England we have 1,500. The thing is, most of the 8,000 species here are endemic, compared to the 1,500 in England that are mostly seen in neighbouring areas too.\u201d The bid would hang off three National Parks \u2013 the Stirling Range National Park, Lesueur National Park and the Fitzgerald River National Park \u2013 but Lambers said the hyper-local nature of some of the endemic species meant smaller reserves should also be included. The secret to the area\u2019s ecological richness lies in its abysmally poor soils, which Lambers said forces plants to try \u201clots of innovative little things\u201d to survive. \u201cThese are the crappiest soils you can imagine, the poorest soils in the world, and the poorer the soils get, the richer the diversity,\u201d he said. The area is home to native orchids and a wide variety of Proteaceae such as banksias and grevilleas, as well as a disproportionately large number of carnivorous plants, \u201cbecause if you grow in such poor soil, you try every trick under the sun to get nutrients\u201d. But Lambers acknowledged that its ecological significance was not immediately recognised by those who live nearby. \u201cHere people think it\u2019s just a bit of scrub and you can do what you like with it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you have that Unesco title there, I think people will think before they say, \u2018Oh, this is just a bit of useless crap.\u2019\u201d Lambers said the target area included parts of the wheatbelt, but said any existing farmland \u2013 plus an acceptable buffer \u2013 would be excised from the world heritage bid. However part of an area of unallocated crown land near Esperance, which the Shire of Esperance has proposed be converted to farmland, would be included. Shire president Malcolm Heasman told Guardian Australia in December that additional farmland was needed to allow younger farmers to establish themselves in the area and provide an economic boost. But Lambers said the same poor soils responsible for the diverse ecology would mean financial ruin for farmers. \u201cNo farmer will make any money out of that at all. Farmers in the area are really struggling, so to develop more farmland is even more daft,\u201d he said. Lambers said the success of the bid would depend on support from the state and federal government. \u201cIt is the best way to protect these areas and to create an economic boost, in the form of tourism,\u201d he said. \u201cIt cannot proceed without government support.\u201d The environment minister has been contacted for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
