A last-ditch try-saving tackle to stop Newcastle edging ahead was followed by a wonderful solo effort that sealed Leicester\u2019s bonus point. It was timely, too. Having toured in 2013 and with Greig Laidlaw yet to return for Gloucester since his ankle injury, Youngs was in the box-seat for the third scrum\u2011half spot along with Conor Murray and Rhys Webb but his struggles in England\u2019s defeat by Ireland at the end of the Six Nations raised a few doubts. In Youngs\u2019 words it was \u201ca nice little last push\u201d but, while he can rest easy before Wednesday, safe in the knowledge that he could have done little more to persuade Gatland, some of his England team\u2011mates cannot say the same. \u201cIt is not in my hands, I will just wait and see. I will probably just go for a walk on Wednesday and I will either get a text message saying \u2018well done\u2019 or \u2018hard luck\u2019, so we will just wait and see,\u201d Youngs said. \u201cEvery player wants to do it and you don\u2019t want to get obsessed with it so it is a massive let-down if it doesn\u2019t happen. So if it comes about \u2013 fantastic \u2013 I will be over the moon, but we will find out on Wednesday. A few boys are going to Cheltenham, I might go and join them there, we\u2019ll see. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019ll tune in or just wait and see but the only thing you can do is try and put your hand up, you don\u2019t know what style they want to play, what they\u2019re looking for, the only thing you can do is try and play as well as you can.\u201d Youngs\u2019 try was Leicester\u2019s fourth in a 30-3 win against Newcastle and the Tigers \u2013 with Matt O\u2019Connor celebrating his first match back in charge at Welford Road since his return to the club \u2013 are now four points clear in fourth after Bath\u2019s defeat by Worcester. Youngs will be joined at Leicester by George Ford next season but whether they spend the summer together is another matter. Ford did not have his best match in a 25-19 defeat against the Warriors and he will need Gatland to pay close attention to his international form and his relationship with Owen Farrell if he is to be picked. On Friday night, meanwhile, Joe Marler and Kyle Sinckler shone in Harlequins\u2019 39-26 defeat by Exeter and both are now in line to travel as third-choice props on either side of the scrum. Chris Robshaw was tireless as ever but his absence during the Six Nations may ultimately prove costly, while George Kruis \u2013 also just back from injury \u2013 and Courtney Lawes engaged in an absorbing battle during Saracens\u2019 27-25 win over Northampton. \u201cCourtney Lawes just seems to be getting better,\u201d the Northampton director of rugby, Jim Mallinder, said. \u201cHis carrying and his physicality in attack, he\u2019s been outstanding \u2013 not just in the Six Nations but since he\u2019s been back as well.\u201d His opposite number, Mark McCall, was similarly effusive about Kruis. \u201cIt was great for him to get 80 minutes,\u201d he said. \u201cFor him to get 80 minutes under his belt before next weekend [against Munster] was massive.\u201d Kruis\u2019s Saracens team-mate Jamie George was outshone by his England captain, Dylan Hartley, but may yet have done enough to convince Gatland of the impact he could make from the Lions bench. \u201cI\u2019ll be at the training ground on Wednesday,\u201d George said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably the worst place to be, either way. It could be interesting. It might be a restless night\u2019s sleep on Tuesday night. Whatever happens happens; I\u2019ve just got to get on with it.\u201d Christian Wade scored his 16th Premiership try of the season as Wasps won 36-21 to condemn Bristol to relegation to the Championship but the winger is perhaps more likely to tour Argentina with England despite being in the Lions squad four years ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
