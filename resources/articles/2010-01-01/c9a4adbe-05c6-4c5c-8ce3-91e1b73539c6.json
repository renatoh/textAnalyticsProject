Team Sky, which Armstrong anticipates will \"push the envelope when it comes to technology and materials\", is not the only new outfit to be debuting in Australia. Armstrong's RadioShack squad is the other, and it became apparent yesterday, with his renewed criticism of his former team-mate Alberto Contador and his insistence that he will be stronger than he was last year, that the old warrior's hunger is arguably greater than 12 months ago when he launched a comeback that was motivated, he insisted, as much by his desire to raise awareness of cancer as by the goal of an eighth Tour. This year, the campaigning will take a back seat. \"It'll still be an emphasis, but it will be less than in 2009,\" said Armstrong. \"The blending of the two was tough. When you go to a Grand Tour and spend the days leading up to it standing around in a suit and tie, on your feet for hours, that's hard.\" Thus in 2010 he will \"lead the monk lifestyle that a professional cyclist requires\". \"It's different because the team is different and the pressure is different,\" Armstrong added. \"Being in a team sponsored by an American company will be different to racing for no salary for a Kazakh-backed team [Astana].\" Another difference this year is that Armstrong is no longer the only show in town, though his pulling power was illustrated yesterday morning, when an estimated 7,000 cyclists joined him for one of his now regular 'Twitter' rides. But as Armstrong was quick to acknowledge, there is great interest around Team Sky, the squad set up by Dave Brailsford with the same ambition as Britain's all-conquering track team: namely, to be the best in the world. \"I think Sky will be good,\" said Armstrong. \"They bring a structure that has been in place for a while with the track programme there in [Britain]. I suspect, and my prediction would be, that they'll have a very successful year. \"We know that they have the talent. If you look at riders like [Bradley] Wiggins, [Edvald] Boasson Hagen, [Thomas] Lofkvist and Simon Gerrans: on paper they have the horsepower. They'll also use, perhaps more than anyone else, technology. They'll use technology that we're all going to look at and go, 'Woah, I never saw that before!' And I think that's good. I expect they'll be good. Very good.\" The Team Sky sports director on duty in Adelaide is Sean Yates, who mentored the young Armstrong at the Motorola team, and who joined Brailsford's squad from Astana, where he had a ringside seat as Contador and Armstrong fell out during last year's Tour. Yates suggested that the Spaniard, who prevailed in their battle last year and is most people's favourite to do so again this year, has \"a lot of Lance-like traits\". It was an observation that might, during his seven-year reign as Tour champion, have riled him, but the new, more mellow Armstrong seemed unruffled, although his response was revealing in its own way. \"Perhaps Sean was talking about the fact that he's a strong character,\" said Armstrong. \"Mentally, he's almost unbreakable. There were times in the Tour last summer where you thought he had to be fragile mentally because of things that were [going on] in the race... And people thought: this guy's going to crack. And he never did. He was always tough the next day. He's a very strong young man.\" It sounded suspiciously as though a strategy of Armstrong's had been \u2013 as it was in his seven Tour wins \u2013 to \"break\" his biggest rival mentally, despite the fact they were on the same team. With that no longer the case, the gloves can perhaps come off. But of Contador's new-look Astana team \u2013 which is significantly diminished, the strongest riders having fled to RadioShack \u2013 Armstrong appeared almost conciliatory when he said that, \"on paper, he doesn't have the horsepower we have, but I don't think the remarks from people, during the big races, will be: 'He has a terrible team.' I think they'll say 'It's not the strongest team, but it's definitely strong enough to help him.'\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
