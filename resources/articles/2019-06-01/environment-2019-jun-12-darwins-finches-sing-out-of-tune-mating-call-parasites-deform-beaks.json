Researchers found that male finches that picked up the fly parasite had malformed beaks and enlarged nostrils that led to \u201csubpar songs\u201d, making it harder for the birds to find mates and reproduce. The infection is caused by the Philornis downsi fly, which is thought to have been introduced to the islands by accident in the 1960s. The fly\u2019s larvae infest birds\u2019 nests and feed on the blood and tissues of their young. Surveys on the Gal\u00e1pagos islands show that the larvae are now rife and kill more than half of all nestling finches. Those that survive can have badly damaged nasal cavities and nostrils, and their beaks can be deformed to the point that they no longer close properly. In new research, Sonia Kleindorfer at Flinders University in Adelaide and colleagues examined the impact of the parasitic infections on what are commonly known as Darwin\u2019s finches. Observations, measurements and sound recordings of the birds revealed that those with deformed nostrils had more \u201cvocal deviation\u201d when they sang to attract mates and produced lower notes than unaffected birds. The result was off-putting to females, and out-of-tune males struggled to find mates. Writing in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, the researchers describe how critically endangered medium tree finches on the islands were so damaged by the parasites that they produced songs that sounded like other birds. The fly occurs on 13 of 15 islands surveyed to date and is considered the greatest risk to the survival of Gal\u00e1pagos land birds. Katharina Peters, a co-author on the study, said the work showed how even when not fatal, infestations of the fly larvae could disrupt the birds\u2019 mating signals with \u201cdevastating effects\u201d on populations. \u201cThis conclusion should be of particular cause for concern for the fate of Darwin\u2019s finches,\u201d the scientists write. Darwin collected many kinds of finches from the Gal\u00e1pagos during his voyage on the Beagle which set the stage for his ideas on evolution through natural selection. The birds are often credited as the inspiration for Darwin\u2019s theory, but it was an ornithologist, John Gould, who realised that Darwin\u2019s haul of finches were related. Darwin himself originally recorded the birds as members of different families."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
