As Vincent Kompany is injured again there is greater pressure on Mangala to improve his performances, beginning with Tuesday evening\u2019s trip to the Premier League leaders, Leicester City, where he is expected to be in the starting lineup. When City were beaten 2-1 at Arsenal on 21 December, Mangala\u2019s misplaced pass allowed Mezut \u00d6zil to create Olivier Giroud\u2019s winning strike for the home side. In the 4-1 Boxing Day rout of Sunderland at the Etihad Stadium, Mangala\u2019s display was steadier. Yet, given his \u00a342m fee and a string of errors since joining from Porto in the summer of 2014, there are doubts over whether Mangala can establish himself as an elite defender. Sagna, however, backed his compatriot against the view Mangala should be transferred out of the club. \u201cNo. We are always going to have critics,\u201d said Sagna, who joined Arsenal in 2007 for \u00a36m from Auxerre before signing for City in 2014. \u201cThe big difference between him and myself was that he was bought for quite a lot of money, so people will expect him to be above everyone \u2013 but he\u2019s still a human being. He can make mistakes but he can do well and I am sure he is going to do even better. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy. I want to remind everyone that to come and play in this league is not easy at all. I had a chance to come and it was different for me. I came at the same age, 24, and from the first season I had, everything went well. \u201cNow we have a setback with him but he started the season very well and we didn\u2019t concede any goals. But when times are a bit harder, the first ones to blame are the defenders. \u201cI\u2019ve been blamed, he has been blamed but that\u2019s football. We have to deal with it, we have to learn. He\u2019s doing his maximum to improve.\u201d Sagna said Mangala is determined to develop his game. \u201cHe is working really hard,\u201d the 32-year-old said. \u201cI stay with him after training, to work on his position and control of the ball, and he\u2019s doing quite a lot to make a difference. He wants to get better. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t ask me but I want to help him. No matter what, we try to communicate, even after games, we try to analyse when we concede goals what he should have done a bit better, what I should have done a bit better. We try to analyse to improve. \u201cMost of the time you forget he only came last season to this league. This league is difficult, especially when you come from abroad you need time to adapt. I think he is doing quite well. Of course it\u2019s never easy to take criticism but he\u2019s still young. \u201cThe club bought him for a lot of money but it\u2019s not easy to deal with it because he is always going to have that image, that he\u2019s the most expensive defender.\u201d Manchester City\u2019s superior goal difference means if they beat Leicester, they can go above them in the table. To do so, however, City must repel the threat of Jamie Vardy, who has scored 15 goals in 19 appearances, and Riyad Mahrez, who has 15 in 21. Sagna said: \u201cWe have to focus on us, on the way we want to defend, how we want to communicate with each other. We want to dictate the game. We want to show we are City and we want to be successful this season. \u201cI heard about Mahrez in France when he played for Le Havre. He is a top-quality player. He has the level to play for big teams. He enjoys playing and he doesn\u2019t think too much \u2013 he is instinctive.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
