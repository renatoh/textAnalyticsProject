He was my favourite British fighter but I could hardly believe how Watson's gaunt face tightened whenever he spoke about his next opponent, a strutting and contradictory character called Chris Eubank. They were preparing to fight for the first time in the hazy summer of 1991; and Watson could not have known then how a punch from Eubank would change his life forever. Stale layers of sweat were sweetened by liniment oil and disinfectant. Watson breathed in the intimate stench of a world he loved and said softly: \"There's something wrong with Chris Eubank's brain. Why should Eubank describe boxing as barbaric?\" Watson's jawbone jutted whenever he bit down on that name, cutting it to pieces: \"Eu-bank.\" Twenty years later, at his usual table at the Blue Legume cafe in Stoke Newington, Watson's eyes glitter behind his glasses as we remember those lost days. Over the last month we've eaten carrot cake in Finchley, and lasagne here, on Church Street in N16, talking about darkness and hope, poring over everything that happened two decades ago. Watson still talks passionately about his fights with Eubank. He's convinced he won the first clearly. The controversial decision went, instead, to Eubank. Three months later, on 21 September 1991, they fought again at a seething White Hart Lane and in front of an ITV audience of 12m viewers. Having dominated Eubank, Watson knocked down his bitter rival near the end of the 11th round. Eubank was on his hands and knees and, near ringside, I was on my feet, willing Watson to finish the contest. Eubank dragged himself up and Watson moved towards him, intent on a knockout. It happened then. Now, on an April day that feels like the start of spring, Watson barely remembers Eubank's desperate and catastrophic punch. \"All I know is he put me down,\" Watson says as he covers my hand with his, like I might be the one needing comfort. \"I won almost every round before that. I had that world title. I went back to the corner and said I was fine. I got up for the last with only one thing in my mind.\" Watson lifts his right hand and holds it, with his left, in front of his face. The 46-year-old peers though his peek-a-boo stance. \"That's all I was thinking: 'Keep your hands up. Survive one more round and you're champion.' But the referee jumped in. I went back to my corner and felt my spirit leave me \u2013 through anguish. And then I collapsed.\" A brutal uppercut had caused havoc in Watson's brain; and ruin spread as a giant blood clot formed during the crucial first hour after he had slipped into unconsciousness. As the clot exerted deadly pressure on the left side of Watson's brain, he was let down tragically by the British Boxing Board of Control who failed to ensure the necessary medical care at ringside. After repeated emergency operations Watson was locked in a coma for 40 days. It seemed he would die or, at best, remain in a persistent vegetative state. \"Even when I woke up in a different body,\" Watson says, \"I couldn't open my eyes. That was frightening. I can still hear my mother and the doctor today. The doctor said, 'Mrs Watson, I don't think your son will live.' It was like hearing them on TV. But I just lay there \u2013 like I was dead.\" The damage can be heard in Watson's slurred speech. But his words are jolting and lucid as he recalls a terrifying ordeal. \"In my self-consciousness,\" he murmurs, dragging a long and slippery word from his mouth, \"I said, 'God Almighty, if you save my life, I'll give my life to you.' Nothing happened for days. But I kept asking: 'God, show me a sign. Bring some feeling into my body.' I was persistent. One day I felt a tingling and my hand just moved.\" He smiles blissfully; but his struggle was tortuous. \"You can't describe it,\" Watson says. \"But my breakthrough was when Muhammad Ali came. I knew it was him, big time, and he was so humorous.\" Watson cackles as he imitates Ali's ravaged voice. \"He said, 'You're a fine-looking young man.' Ali was real close and said: 'But you ain't as good looking as meeeeee \u2026' I laughed and it was the first happy sound I'd made in months. It was like breaking a rock. From there I escalated. I was a big problem for the nurses \u2013 chatting them up.\" He still had to learn how to talk again and, hardest of all, walk again. \"I got to stand up one day, holding the standing frame. I was in control for the first time since I gave Eubank a beating.\" His fighting talk sounds curiously uplifting. Even more movingly, this weekend's London Marathon evokes memories of Watson's epic feat in 2003. Inspired to walk the marathon on behalf of the Brain and Spine Foundation, the fighter overcame seemingly impossible odds. Six months before the marathon he could barely shuffle across his living room in Chingford. In April 2003, however, he completed the slowest London Marathon in history after walking 26.2 miles in six days, two hours and 27 minutes. Watson raised \u00a3200,000 and, eight years on, he's full of anecdotes. \"Ashley Cole was driving up and down, with this lovely blonde girl in his spanking new Mercedes. He came to the back of the crowd and handed over fifty quid before speeding off. But then some dirty old van pulled up and this guy gave me \u00a3200 \u2013 four times as much as a famous footballer.\" The fighter's dedication was illustrated again two days ago when he represented the Teenage Cancer Trust in its role as official sponsors of the Brighton Marathon. Watson welcomed the winning runner at the tape, encouraged the stragglers and then, on Sunday night, led a Q&amp;A session. He seemed to be on fire and he and his equally committed publicist, Geraldine Davies, have promised to be involved again next year in Brighton. \"I really come alive,\" Watson says simply, \"helping others.\" He will also be at the London Marathon this Sunday. As a non-participating captain, he leads a charity team for the Brain and Spine Foundation. Watson is considering the possibility of walking the marathon again next year \u2013 as he confronts another problem in north London. \"You won't believe what's happening outside,\" he says. \"Kids are running in gangs, carrying Uzis and drugs. They call them 'the young 'uns', kids of 14, and they're selling drugs. You got their mums and dad smoking crack, or hooked on heroin. It takes them into a fantasy world because they got no hope.\" A new ambition now drives him, echoing the desire and focus he brought to the ring. Watson plans to raise enough money to build a centre across the road from the Blue Legume for \"the young 'uns\" coerced into working for gangs. \"We need to do something for them,\" he says, stressing his willingness to work with established political figures to ease a deepening social crisis. \"I can talk the same language as these kids and link them to the outside world.\" Has he met any of the \"young 'uns\"? Watson glances at his great friend and carer, Len Ballack. \"You have, Michael,\" Len says quietly. \"You met those kids from the Lordship gang \u2026\" How did they react to a damaged former fighter? \"They were shouting out 'Champion' when they saw Michael,\" Len says. \"They were ready to listen.\" Watson curls his hand into a fist and his knuckles touch mine. \"We're the Carrot Cake gang. We're old enough not to fear these kids. I see their potential. I come from the same streets as them. They know they haven't been through what I been through. So that's why I want to talk to them about hope.\" We meet again on another day, in Finchley, outside Spencer Oliver's gym. Watson, inadvertently, saved Oliver's life after the super-bantamweight suffered a blood clot against Sergei Devakov at the Royal Albert Hall in 1998. Oliver received medical attention in the ring and without that immediate care he would have died. He now highlights the debt he, and all British boxers, owe to Watson. \"You're looking good, Mike,\" Oliver says, as the old fighters embrace. After negotiating the ramp leading down to the gym, leaning on Len's arm, Watson walks inside. The gym is deserted, and the light streaming through the shuttered windows above the ring makes it look hauntingly beautiful. Watson trudges past the heavy bags hanging from the steel girders. His happiness is plain \u2013 as it is when he picks out James DeGale as the current fighter whose skill interests him most. His stiff-legged walk assumes a little more snap as he confirms that Barry Hearn, his former promoter, has arranged a charity dinner for him at the Dorchester in September to mark the 20th anniversary of his second fight with Eubank. Both boxers will be there, alongside other former world champions. Watson relishes the glittering chance to relive a dark past. I ask him again about Eubank. \"The difference between me and Chris Eubank is I know who I am. I don't think, even now, Chris knows his identity. Chris shows me respect now. He tries to be humble. It's the guilt element but it's OK. I forgave him a long time ago. But I feel sorry for him. He couldn't talk to those kids in the Lordship gang. He's a lost soul.\" Watson is anything but lost. He agrees with alacrity when the Guardian photographer, Tom Jenkins, suggests we climb into the ring, where the light is at its softest. It's not easy and, with Tom and I hoisting him up, we worry that he might totter and fall. But, somehow, Watson lifts his damaged left leg over the middle rope while ducking beneath the top one. As if he has reached home, he playfully pushes Tom into a corner and feigns some body-punches. The old fighter turns to me. \"Twenty years?\" he says. \"It feels like yesterday.\" Watson drops back into a fighting crouch and snaps out a jab. \"Just like the old times,\" he says, laughing wistfully. \"Just like the old times \u2026\" Support Teenage Cancer Trust runners.
