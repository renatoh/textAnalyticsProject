After being quoted as saying he regretted joining Udinese in the summer and calling it \"an extremely strange club\", the nomadic English coach was called to account by Udinese's furious owner Giampaolo Pozzo. The upshot was that the 54-year-old Hodgson is now looking for another club after Pozzo said he was \"shocked\" and \"hit in the heart\" by the coach's remarks. \"The club does not deserve those criticisms,\" he added. Udinese initially would not comment on the crisis talks but later issued a statement confirming the Englishman's departure. It said: \"After the meeting today, Mr Roy Hodgson and the Bianconeri [black and white] have decided by mutual consent to break the agreement they had in the month of July. The new manager will be announced tomorrow.\" Hodgson was quoted in the English report as saying: \"Obviously I'm very happy to be back at this level of football but I could have chosen a better club to come back to.\" He also said that he and the players were \"not as well supported as we should be\". Although Hodgson had a tense relationship with certain club officials and with fans, he said he was committed to the Udinese cause and to keeping them in Italy's top flight. \"Nothing that has happened in my time at the club has suggested that we aren't going to be able to stay in this division,\" he said. Indeed Udinese are ninth in Serie A, five points clear of the relegation places after 13 games, and they staged a dramatic late fightback to defeat Verona 2-1 on Sunday. The former Switzerland national manager and Internazionale coach, who endured an unsuccessful spell back in England with Blackburn Rovers in 1997-98, joined Udinese on a two-year contract after leading FC Copenhagen to the Danish championship . In the future, Hodgson said, \"I'd like to have another crack at the Premiership. I regard myself as a European but the great advantages for me going back to England would be the language and the culture. \"I'll just have to wait and see if an offer comes my way.\" Udinese's goalkeeping coach Alessandro Zampa will take charge for the Italian Cup match against Parma tonight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
