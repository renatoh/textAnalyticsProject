The first category, which stretches from Winston Churchill through Harold Macmillan to Gordon Brown, talks the biggest game. It is summed up by Tony Blair's speech at a White House dinner in 1998 quoting Harry Hopkins's wartime biblical remark to Churchill that \"thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God \u2013 even to the end\". The second category, arching from Clement Attlee via Harold Wilson to John Major, is scarcely less committed to the importance of the transatlantic alliance, but takes a notably less romantic view of the relationship. Judged by his recent remarks, David Cameron is using his first visit to Washington as prime minister to audition for membership of this second group. Smart fellow. Mr Cameron rightly pointed out this week that a preoccupation with the health of the Anglo-American \"special relationship\" is a peculiarly British obsession, annoyingly symptomatic of the continuing existential insecurities of a country that the prime minister recognised, with refreshing honesty, as the \"junior partner\" in the alliance. In particular, he said, it is frustrating \u2013 although pathetic would be a better word \u2013 that so much over-analysis is devoted to the atmospherics of the relationship: the body language between a president and a prime minister, whether a meeting is a \"brush-by\" or a full bilateral, how long it lasts, which part of the White House it takes place in, and so on. Last night, Mr Cameron's meeting with Barack Obama triggered yet another bout of that glumly predictable silliness. Conservative prime ministers often have fewer hang-ups about the transatlantic relationship than Labour ones, at least in recent years. It is certainly a relief to hear Mr Cameron dismissing any notions of \"idealistic dreaming\" about the special relationship and giving short shrift to any \"blind loyalty\" towards Washington. Yet the truth is that Mr Cameron \u2013 and indeed Mr Obama \u2013 is being driven by events as well as responding to the mood of the voters. They are leaders during an era in which large transnational projects of any kind, whether led from Washington or not, have failed to deliver as well as gone out of favour. The shadow of the failures in Iraq and Afghanistan remains a long one. So does the failure at Copenhagen. More recently, not least in the European Union, the search for co-ordinated responses to the international financial crisis has been frustratingly feeble. It is not surprising that the overlapping networks of national self-interest of the kind that William Hague has recently discussed in his keynote foreign policy speeches have become more attractive. In some ways this national state pragmatism is very welcome after the hubris of the recent past. But it also comes at a cost in effectiveness and progress. Mr Cameron is in Washington not as an Atlanticist visionary, but as another visiting leader with interests to defend, projects to advance and problems to solve in talks with a president who has no special empathy, though no special hostility either, for Britain and Europe. The visit's timing has been shaped by BP's horrors in the Gulf, perhaps now abating on the sea floor but still politically neuralgic on land, and is dominated by unassuaged US indignation over the release of the convicted Lockerbie bomber. Mr Cameron has had to take those on the chin by rearranging his schedule and promising to review the files. The more lasting concern is that on complex issues like Afghanistan, Iran and the international economy, he is more concerned with how they play domestically than with how effectively they should be dealt with. Mr Cameron's low-key pragmatism makes a welcome change of tone after the moralising and boasting of the recent past. But big problems still have to be solved, not merely managed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
