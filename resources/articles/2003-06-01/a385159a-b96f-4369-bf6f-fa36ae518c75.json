Michael has not taken the stage yet, but I believe he performs worship songs that the audience sing along to.\" Excellent. I do love a good singalong. Will there be accompanying arm-swinging and finger-clicking? Or will it be more: \"ARE YOU READY FOR A MIRACLE? READY AS I CAN BE!\" Whatever your views on the gospel, you can't help but enjoy the singing. Unreasonable request dept: \"Can you keep us updated with the Ireland v Georgia score as I can't seem to find any where offering a minute-by-minute coverage,\" enquires Mark Murphy. No problem Mark. After all, it's not as if I'm busy enough keeping you abreast of one match - you want me to let you know what's going on in one I can't see as well. No problem! Warm-up news: Lots of England players stretching and jogging on the Riverside turf. Fairly bogstandard (nice turf pun there), as limbering up goes. National anthems: An attractive, raven-haired, surprisingly slim opera singer dressed in a lovely white dress sings the anthems. If this wasn't the Guardian where such misogyny is frowned upon, I'd give her an 8. (Feel free to insert your own \"I'd give her one\" gag here. I'm above that, obviously.) 1 mins: Well, I have to hand it to whoever does the \"probable\" line-ups in a certain newspaper I won't mention for fear of recriminations - they've got the Slovakia team spectacularly wrong. Still, we'll figure it out as we go along. The visitors, playing all in blue, go forwards. England win possession, Gerrard plays a lovely through-ball to Owen who, with nobody else to beat, allows the goalkeeper to save and put the ball out for a corner. A dreadful miss - he was clean through 3 mins: Frank Lampard attempts to play Michael Owen through but the Liverpool striker is penalised for offside. 5 mins: England are bossing the match early doors, which doesn't bode well for my small bet on a Slovakia win. I've a feeling in my bones England might get caught napping tonight. 6 mins: Michael Owen loops a cross into the Slovakia box and Lampard heads it down to Scholes. It bounces awkwardly and the ginger midfielder is unable to capitalise. 8 mins: Gerrard takes on Michalik in midfield, beats him and tries to find Rooney on the edge of the Slovakia box. His pass is poor and Slovakia clear. 9 mins: England's goal is threatened for the first time when slack defending allows Janocko to latch on to a cross and shoot low and hard. James gets down quickly to smother his tame effort. 10 mins: Gerrard crosses from a deep angle, trying to find Rooney in the air. Petras beats him in the air and heads clear. 11 mins: The England defence fall asleep, Vittek loops the ball over Southgate's head from a throw-in and shoots at James at the near post. The goalkeeper parries and, unfortunately for Slovakia, there's nobody there to capitalise. In Istanbul, Turkey have equalised with Macedonia. This from Rolf-from-Sweden: \"Alison Jeeves? Is that the same Alison Jeeves with whom I shared a slightly snot-intrusive snog in Marble Hill Park, Twickenham, circa 1977-79? If so, any chance of preferential access to tickets for forthcoming gigs (or did said snog not warrant same?).\" I certainly hope it isn't Rolf, but there's only one lady who can tell us. Say it ain't so Alison, say it ain't so. 16 mins: Gerrard whips in a cross to Scholes at the near post. Corner for England. Scholes takes it and a Slovakian defender puts it out for another one on the far side. On BBC1, John Motson and Trevor Brooking appear to be having a competition to see who can say the name D**** B****** the most often. He's not f****** playing you f****** t*******, so get over it. I'm sorry, but I've had it up to my eyes with the transfer hullabaloo surrounding that man. He's not even that good. Incidentally, the reason he's not playing tonight is because he's suspended. 19 mins: Slovakia win a free-kick a good distance out. A Slovakian have-a-go hero swings his boot at it. Wide. England are very poor at the moment - they can't keep possession, their defence looks ropey in the extreme and they appear bereft of ideas in midfield. 22 mins: Labant squanders another chance for Slovakia. Moments later, an England player - Lampard, I think - is caught offisde. Rooney cleaves Labant in midifeld and concedes a free-kick. 24 mins: \"I don't know anything about Macedonia or this Upson fellow? Please enlighten me,\" writes Emmett Williams, as Hakan Suker puts Turkey 3-2 ahead against Macedonia in Istanbul. Sorry Emmett - I'm on a go-slow tonight so I'm not giving any free history or Birmingham City central-defender lessons. You'll have to look them up yourself. 26 mins:GOAL!! England 0 - 1 Slovakia Calamity James strikes again. Well, sort of. A mixture of dire defending and poor goalkeeping allow Slovakia to score with a freak free-kick. Janocko crosses it in from distance, no strikers or defenders get a touch on it and James lets in a soft one at the far post. Comedy. 27 mins: About 25 different people have sent in 25 different websites that are broadcasting the Republic of Ireland v Georgia match, for Mark Murphy's benefit. Although I'm grateful, I'm not going to tell him any of them, because they're all completely obvious and it's about time some of you started using your initiative and finding things out for yourselves. I'm sick of spoon-feeding you all. 31 mins: Slovakia narrowly miss an opportunity to go 2-0 up when James claws a close-range header from Hanek out. 34 mins: It was dull earlier, but I'm loving this match now. 35 mins: While I think of it, I should let you know that Jonocko's goal was almost identical to the free-kick scored by David Beckham in Slovakia. Emphatically a cross, it evaded everyone in the box, bounced in front of James and went past him. 36 mins: Unbelievable. A Slovakian player latches on to a cross and with only James to beat from about 10 yards, wellies the ball wide. A shocking miss from Demo. England's defence is an absolute shambles. At the far end, Owen misses a sitter. It's woeful defending from both sides ago-go and England are on the ropes. 38 mins: Debnar replaces the injured Labant on the Slovakian team. 39 mins: Another Heskey-esque first touch from Owen sees him notch up his hat-trick of near-misses. Slovakia break and - with Ashley Cole gone AWOL again - Nemeth misses a sitter. England are an unspeakable mess at the moment. Dire in all departments. Even wonderboy Rooney is having a shocker. 42 mins: \"Take your blinkers off, Noddy,\" writes Peter Young, one of those geeks who watches on telly and reads the minute-by-minute, just so he can mail in and point out errors. \"Either of the two defenders, who blinded James as they went for the ball, should have cleared the free kick.\" A fair comment Peter. Very inconsiderate of defnders to stand in front of their goalkeeper when the opposition is attacking. Somebody should have words with them. I should add that Peter is in LA. 45 mins: Sven rattles his box of tactics and Danny Mills makes way for Eoin Hargreaves. He slots into midfield and Phil Neville goes into defence. England launch an attack which breaks down when Rooney gives the ball away in the Slovakia box. Half-time 46 mins: This stinging and hilariously witty critique of my abilities from Vanessa, who is too cowardly to leave her surname: \"Barry! Barry! Barry! Twat! Twat! Twat! F*** off back to Ireland or whichever not-as-good-as-England shite hole you came from. You're not even that good.\" Nice try Vanessa, but I'm afraid Ireland are winning their match against a very poor Eastern European team. The second half starts. 47 mins: No changes on the England team at half-time, which is extraordinary. Lampard gives the ball away deep in Slovakia territory. England win it back, the ball finds its way to Gerrard and he blasts a wayward shot over the bar. 48 mins: Scholes shoots from distance and the ball fizzes just wide. Ireland are beating Georgia 2-0 in Dublin, if anyone's interested, while Northern Ireland are drawing 0-0 with Spain. England go forward again, Lampard gives the ball away again. He's playing particularly badly tonight, although none of the England players are covering themselves in glory. Michael Owen gets - unjustly - penalised for offside. 53 mins: England are finding it very difficult to get any sort of momentum going. Owen attempts to cross from the right hand side of the Slovakia box and Petras cuts it out. Slovakia clear and Demo gets the ball on the half-way line in acres of space. Where the hell is Ashley Cole? 54 mins: Mintal replaces Demo, the man responsible for two of the worst misses I've ever seen. England win a free-kick on the edge of the Slovakia area, which Hargreaves cannons into the wall. 56 mins: Michael Owen finds Lampard on the edge of the Slovakia box. He squares it for Gerrard, who sends it over the bar. After a poor display, Wayne Rooney is substituted. Darius Vassell replaces him. 59 mins: A long Frank Lampard pass bounces in the Slovakia box in front of Darius Vassell. He attempts to loop the ball over the on-rushing Konig, but succeeds only in hoofing a boot-full of fresh air. 60 mins: Oh dear. A trademark dive from Michael Owen cons the referee. Penalty for England. Owen's nothing if not consistent: when in trouble - cheat. 61 mins: GOAL England 1 - 1 Slovakia Owen rolls the ball past the goalkeeper, who he sent the wrong way. He's a cheating little toe-rag. It was an even more blatant dive than that one against Argentina in the World Cup. 63 mins: Vitek gets booked for protesting after a foul on Hargreaves to the right of the Slovakia box. Free-kick for England. Gerrard whips it in, Southgate gets pulled down. It's a blatant penalty, but England don't get one, which is only fair. Moments later, Konig nudges a Lampard shot inches wide for a corner. Slovakia are in complete disarray now. 65 mins: Gerrard whips in a corner. Frank Lampard knocks a free header over the bar. 67 mins: England have a goal disallowed after Frank Lampard helps a Southgate shot over the line from about three feet out. He was onside and the goal should have stood. I believe the word for that is karma. 70 mins: This lavish praise from Paul O'Toole, who appears to have a profound knowledge of our readership: \"I'm half Irish so I understand you're obvious hatred of the English, but maybe that should also diqualify you from reporting on England games for an English newspaper in England where the majority of readers are English and who support England. You twat.\" I don't hate the English Paul. They're as mixed a bag as any other nationality. If I did hate them, I'd hardly be living among them, now would I? I simply find it amusing when their football team loses, that's all. Anyway, for your information: this isn't an English newspaper. It is in fact an Internet site on the World Wide Web. 72 mins: GOAL! England 2 - 1 Slovakia Gerrard crosses, Owen leaps between two central defenders and buries the ball with a superb header. A brilliant goal from the stand-in captain. That's more like it. 74 mins: Slovakia have completely disintegrated since Owen flung himself theatrically to the ground to win the penalty that led to England's equaliser. The ineffectual Nemeth goes off and is replaced by Reiter. 76 mins: An absolutely unbelievable series of misses from some of England's finest. Cole crossed to Owen, whose toe-poke was well parried by the goalkeeper. The ball spun up in the air, prompting Owen to crash a header off the crossbar. The goalkeeper just beat Vassell to the bounce and scrambled it clear. Fine goalkeeping and bad luck conspired to keep England at bay there. 78 mins: Ireland 2 - 0 Georgia is a final score. Scholes plays Owen through but a Slovakia defender clears. Alison Jeeves has mailed to say she was only three in 1977, so she's fairly certain it wasn't her that was snogging Rolf from Sweden in Twickenham. However, she's prepared to concede that if it was her, her tender age would go some way towards explaining the preponderance of snot that dogged said embrace. 80 mins: The charming Vanessa is back: \"Oh dear, defending the bogland by virtue of their footballing prowess - I ask you,\" she says. \"Why don't you stick to the usual drivel about the disproportionate number of literary geniuses, the friendly folk and the Lithy water, like most of the sad displaced Micks who justify themselves by slagging off their adopted country?\" Lithy water? I don't know what she's on about either. Maybe she meant Liffey. Or Shannon. And as for literary geniuses - how could Ireland possibly compete with the likes of Dominic Mohan from The Sun and Jeffrey Archer? At least you kept it clean this time Vanessa. 83 mins: Turkey 3 - 2 Macedonia is a full-time in this group. Meanwhile back at the Riverside, this second half has finally settled down. 87 mins: Johnny Slovakian appears to have decided the game is up and has obviously thrown in the towel. Meanwhile, my thanks to the many of you who have written in to point out that Paul O'Toole (70 mins) doesn't know how to use an apostrophe. Well spotted. 88 mins: Vassell does well to skin Debnar on the right and side. The defender upends him and gets booked for his trouble. Vassell has been very impressive since he replaced Rooney. 89 mins: Paul O'Toole is back: \"Fair point,\" he says. To be honest, I love my punters. I can never stay mad at them for long. 90 mins: A lovely through-ball from Paul Scholes finds Owen Hargreaves. His run was brilliant but his finish is poor. Over the bar. One attack later, Gerrard finds himself one-on-one with the keeper. He tries to place it beyond him, but the keeper saves well. The referee blows for full time. Turkey top the group with 15 points from six matches. England have 13 from five. Thanks for your time and your emails, that's definitely it until the new season.
