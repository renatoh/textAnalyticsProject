At the height of this summer's riots, there were days when the political class and the BBC appeared to have swallowed the Major dictum. With Tottenham and Croydon ablaze, condemnation was of course required, but there should also have been space on the airwaves for interrogation about why this was happening; instead, the patriotic duty was dismissing \"random acts of criminality\". While criminal the rioting indubitably was, random it was not. Individual whims can't explain looting and burning which was clustered in particular places, at a particular moment in time. There may be a reason why the chaos spread to Gloucester but not Taunton, and why it never reached Scotland or Wales. It would be good to know. Happily, the curiosity worm is starting to turn. The Financial Times yesterday mapped the poverty afflicting the rioters, and now a joint Guardian/LSE project will dig deeper still. Inspired by an earlier link-up between reporters and scholars after Detroit's outbreak of anarchy in 1967, Reading the Riots will assemble hard facts of the disorder, by trawling court records, analysing tweets and talking to offenders themselves. The thoughtful right will look out for the fragility of families in afflicted communities, while the left will instinctively turn to the local dole queue. But all sides will learn if the heat of riot flames makes way for explanatory light."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
