The Brazilian made his debut as a 73rd-minute substitute in last weekend's defeat by Liverpool and Ancelotti will give the 23-year-old his first start on Monday against Fulham as he seeks to integrate him rapidly into the team. David Luiz's versatility means he could slot into any of the positions but Ancelotti pointed out that one of the player's most appealing attributes is his ability to initiate attacks \u2013 to an even greater degree than Ricardo Carvalho used to for Chelsea before he moved to Real Madrid last summer. \"Carvalho is fantastic man-to-man and tactically, David Luiz has more ability with the ball,\" said Ancelotti. \"He has very good technique and can help us build our play from the back.\" Ancelotti believes this is important because, when opposing teams have successfully stifled Chelsea, it has usually been by shackling their midfielders. \"Sometimes the opposition give more space to our backs while they maintain good control of our midfielders, so now we can have space to build the play from the back.\" Ancelotti is also continuing his search for the right tactics to get the best out of Fernando Torres and Didier Drogba, who hardly thrived together against Liverpool. \"Step by step we are trying to find the right solution to put them together,\" he said. \"Didier Drogba and Torres are fantastic strikers and we have to try to do everything to put them together to play.\" The Italian feels that, if there are times over the coming weeks when they do not play together, that will not be because he has given up hope of ever finding the right formula. \"Sometimes I will choose one player or another but that will not be a sacrifice, it will be because in the future we will have very important games, so I want to use rotation of players in the next games. We have very important aims to reach.\" Ancelotti accepts that, realistically, those aims no longer include the Premier League title. \"For us it is difficult to think that we can come back and fight for the title, we have to be honest about that. But we absolutely have to reach fourth place at a minimum. The best thing for us now is to take it game by game.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
