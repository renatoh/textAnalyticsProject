Even when she was described as Queensland\u2019s \u201caccidental premier\u201d in 2015, Palaszczuk\u2019s political successes \u2013 now as a three-time election winner \u2013 have been built carefully, taking few risks. \u201cI think she\u2019s like the mayor of Queensland,\u201d one senior Labor MP tells Guardian Australia. The comment is not meant to diminish her role, or the significance of her office. But it explains her enduring warm and personal appeal to voters of all stripes, ages, and in all corners of the state. \u201cShe says all the time \u2018With me, what you see is what you get\u2019 and that\u2019s a great political line, but the reason it works so effectively is because voters can see that it\u2019s true,\u201d the MP said. Before Saturday\u2019s Queensland election, much of the analysis had suggested neither major party would be likely to win a majority \u2013 a quirk of a deeply complex state, where voters differ from region to region, and where policies pitched in one electorate might backfire in another. Labor built its campaign almost entirely on Palaszczuk\u2019s popularity and her broad appeal, and in doing so brought together an unprecedented coalition of voters. Townsville seats \u2013 which were predicted to swing to the LNP over concerns about employment and crime \u2013 held firm. In central Queensland, coalminers stayed in the Labor camp. In Maryborough, manufacturing workers returned to Labor from One Nation. And in south-east Queensland Labor won heartland Liberal National party areas for the first time in more than 100 years on the back of increased support from retirees and older voters who backed Palaszczuk\u2019s pandemic management. Labor had run a safe, \u201cuninspired\u201d campaign that took few policy risks. Insiders believe it was not the party\u2019s platform \u2013 it was the premier, who straddled the state\u2019s ideologic and regional divides. \u201cI know that during this election, there are many people out there in Queensland who have voted Labor for the very first time,\u201d Palaszczuk said while claiming victory at the Blue Fin Fishing Club in her southern Brisbane electorate of Inala. At a press conference on Sunday, Palaszczuk again spoke to voters who might not typically align with Labor. \u201cI know that was a very tough call for people, but a lot of people stopped me in the street, they stopped me and said thank you for keeping us safe,\u201d she said. Older voters who more strongly supported border closures and tougher measures to contain the spread of the pandemic were key to Labor\u2019s victory, particularly as it made ground in areas with large populations of retirees. Many of these are the same voters who deserted Labor at the 2019 federal election over concerns about franking credits and a scare campaign about a death tax. Pumicestone includes Bribie Island, which has a large population of retirees. It was won by Labor with a 5.2% swing. Further north, Hervey Bay has an average population 10 years older than the rest of the state. Almost 30% of the population is over 65. Labor was leading narrowly on Sunday having won a swing of 11.5%. The cohort \u2013 \u201cPalaszczuk\u2019s pensioners\u201d \u2013 has helped deliver Labor a majority, solidify Labor MPs across Greater Brisbane and its surrounds, and sandbag the regions. Such a campaign could not have been built around a divisive leader. Palaszczuk\u2019s appeal has endured despite attacks from prime minister Scott Morrison, home affairs minister Peter Dutton and others. Susan Harris Rimmer, the director of Griffith University\u2019s policy innovation hub, said Palaszczuk\u2019s political success has given her the opportunity to create a legacy during the next term. \u201cI always thought that whole \u2018accidental premier\u2019 thing was compete rubbish,\u201d Harris Rimmer said. \u201cIt was nothing accidental. She stood up when the party was at its lowest point, when they could meet in a phone box, and volunteered and made the absolute best out of it. \u201cIf you look at the way she\u2019s gone from building them into a viable opposition, then winning government and making a minority work, then getting her own majority, and now to being able to really govern with a bit of comfort. It\u2019s quite something.\u201d Harris Rimmer was at university about the same time as Palaszczuk and recalls her \u201cstrong sense of service\u201d was evident even then. \u201cEven at uni, she was very driven,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause she\u2019s so heavily identified with Inala [a working-class area in south Brisbane] she\u2019s never going to be an elite politician, and because she entered at a time when no one wanted [the Labor leadership] she\u2019s never been seen as a party machine person. \u201cShe\u2019s got this real pride in her working class, multicultural background. She doesn\u2019t play the gender card very often, but she just [promotes gender equality] in what she does. She has quite a radical social policy legacy that she\u2019s done quite quietly and without a lot of fuss. \u201cShe has a very self-contained way about her. She\u2019s not fazed by anything. She can also display empathy.\u201d Labor has won 11 of the past 12 Queensland elections. Wayne Goss won three elections and Peter Beattie four. \u201cIf she serves a full term [she] will overtake Wayne Goss and Peter Beattie, who are Labor heroes,\u201d senator Anthony Chisholm told the ABC on election night. \u201cAnnastacia Palaszczuk is now on that same pedestal.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
