The prime minister, who was moved out of intensive care on Thursday evening, was said to be in good spirits on Friday, according to a No 10 spokesman. Johnson was \u201cenormously grateful for the care he\u2019s receiving,\u201d the official added, saying \u201che was waving his thanks towards the nurses and doctors that he saw as he was being moved from the intensive care unit back to the ward\u201d. A No 10 spokesman added later on Friday: \u201cThe prime minister has been able to do short walks, between periods of rest, as part of the care he is receiving to aid his recovery. \u201cHe has spoken to his doctors and thanks the whole clinical team for the incredible care he has received. His thoughts are with those affected by this terrible disease.\u201d Matt Hancock, the health secretary, told the daily briefing that Johnson\u2019s condition continued to improve. \u201cHe wants to personally thank the whole clinical team at St Thomas\u2019 for the incredible care he has received,\u201d Hancock said. The updates came after the prime minister\u2019s father, Stanley, spoke of the improvement in his son\u2019s condition, saying he was \u201camazingly thankful\u201d for the efforts of the NHS and appreciative of the nation\u2019s outpouring of support. But he insisted his son \u2013 who is still being treated at St Thomas\u2019 hospital in London \u2013 must rest, warning that he cannot get \u201cstraight back to Downing Street and pick up the reins\u201d. He added: \u201cTo use that American expression, he almost took one for the team. We have got to make sure we play the game properly now.\u201d There will be just one daily update about Johnson\u2019s condition now he is out of intensive care, the spokesman said. Asked what contact Johnson had had with No 10, he added: \u201cThe PM is just beginning his recovery and he will be taking advice from his medical team.\u201d On Thursday evening, Downing Street said Johnson, 55, had been moved from intensive care back to the ward \u201cwhere he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery\u201d. He was taken into hospital on Sunday after his coronavirus symptoms, including a cough and high temperature, persisted and he was moved to intensive care on Monday evening. The foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, who has been deputising for the prime minister, earlier said Johnson was making \u201cpositive steps forward\u201d. Johnson\u2019s pregnant fiancee, Carrie Symonds \u2013 who has also had a bout of suspected Covid-19 \u2013 responded to the news by posting a rainbow on Twitter and a series of clapping emojis to show support for the NHS. On Friday morning Johnson\u2019s 79-year-old father also issued thanks. \u201cRelief is the right word,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, adding: \u201cI feel tremendously grateful obviously on behalf of the family, Boris\u2019s family, my family, family members all over the place, and also, of course, amazingly thankful as well. Thankful for the tremendous outpouring of which we have seen.\u201d But he warned his son must rest. \u201cThis is pretty straightforward now. He must rest up. As I understand it ... he has moved from the ICU into a recovery unit but I don\u2019t think you can say this is out of the woods now,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has to take time. I cannot believe you can walk away from this and get straight back to Downing Street and pick up the reins without a period of readjustment.\u201d He also explained his son\u2019s illness had highlighted the seriousness of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cI do think about this whole event of Boris going into intensive care, and now ... coming out, it has actually served an amazing purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a sense it\u2019s got the whole country to realise this is a serious event. If it can hit the prime minister, for heaven\u2019s sake, well it does come close to home.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
