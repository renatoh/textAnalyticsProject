French photographer Gis\u00e9le Freund once described it as \u201cmelodious and warm\u201d, but thanks to the National Sound Library of Mexico, we may now know for sure. The library have unearthed what they believe could be the first known voice recording of Kahlo, taken from a pilot episode of 1955 radio show El Bachiller, which aired after her death in 1954. The episode featured a profile of Kahlo\u2019s artist husband Diego Rivera. In it, she reads from her essay Portrait of Diego, which was taken from the catalogue of a 1949 exhibition at the Palace of Fine Arts, celebrating 50 years of Rivera\u2019s work. \u201cHe is a gigantic, immense child, with a friendly face and a sad gaze,\u201d she says, as translated by Agence France-Presse. (A different English translation of the text can be found on Google Arts &amp; Culture.) \u201cHis high, dark, extremely intelligent and big eyes rarely hold still. They almost come out of their sockets because of their swollen and protuberant eyelids \u2013 like a toad\u2019s. They allow his gaze to take in a much wider visual field, as if they were built especially for a painter of large spaces and crowds.\u201d It is estimated that the recording was made in 1953 or 1954. In the press release, Mexico\u2019s secretary of culture, Alejandra Frausto, said if it is indeed Kahlo\u2019s voice \u2013 a claim which authorities continue to investigate \u2013 it could be the only audio recording of the artist that exists. The library\u2019s role is to preserve and make public documentary sound archives for Mexico. Its collection, amassed over a decade, features the voices of some of the country\u2019s most important historical figures \u2013 but library national director P\u00e1vel Granados said Kahlo\u2019s voice was the \u201cmost requested and sought-after\u201d by visitors. \u201cFrida\u2019s voice has always been a great enigma, a never-ending search,\u201d Granados told a press conference. \u201cUntil now, there had never been a recording of Frida Kahlo.\u201d The radio show the recording was taken from, El Bachiller, was named for its host \u00c1lvaro G\u00e1lvez y Fuentes \u201cEl Bachiller\u201d, who has been described by the ministry of culture as \u201cthe main documentalist of the voices of his time\u201d. The sound library has 1,300 El Bachiller tapes among its collection, which will need to be digitised and cataloged in order to ascertain if more of Kahlo\u2019s voice is among them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
