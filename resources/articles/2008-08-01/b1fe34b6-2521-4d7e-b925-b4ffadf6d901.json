That's how it's felt in the past few months. Today was very special. It was one of those days when everything went my way and certainly a day I'll never forget because it's been tough over the past couple of months. \"Professional sport is a tough industry when you're not doing your job and as a batsman you've got to go out and score runs and I haven't been doing that.\" Collingwood is not the type to indulge in Oscar-style shows of gratitude but he revealed how a crucial piece of advice from his friend and captain, Michael Vaughan, had helped him get his mind right ahead of the most important innings of his life. \"He said something important to me before I went out to bat: 'Don't be reckless but be aggressive.' I quite enjoyed having that freedom from the skipper, to go out there and take the bowlers on. That's how I play my best cricket.\" Most observers wondered if the 32-year-old Collingwood's best cricket had become the great oxymoron of the England dressing room. The Durham batsman arrived in the middle yesterday on the back of eight single-figure dismissals in 10 first-class innings this summer and a Test average that had dipped below 40 for the first time in two years. On Wednesday he looked simply awful and he was willing to admit that one more mistake could have provoked a second selectorial farewell in little over a fortnight. \"I've had that situation before, against Pakistan in Lahore,\" he said. \"But I played a similar kind of innings then. It's not the first time I've been under that kind of pressure. \"Everyone realised how difficult it has been over the past few months and they've been saying a score is just round the corner. Today proves that. Everyone is thrilled to bits for me but we've still got a massive job to do.\" Collingwood defended his decision to go down the wicket on 94 to Paul Harris's left-arm spin after Kevin Pietersen had perished trying the same thing earlier, pointing out that he had reached his only Test double-century at Adelaide with a lofted boundary. He did admit that Brisbane, where he was stumped for 96 off Shane Warne, had been on his mind, but said: \"I wasn't going to change my way. From ball one I said I was going to go out there and be aggressive, give it a good go. I just wanted to continue in that manner, whether I was in the 90s or we were six down. I like to get it over and done with, get the satisfaction of getting to three figures. I guess you've got to risk it for a biscuit. \"We certainly need a few more [runs], I think. Hopefully Monty [Panesar] will get a few to turn out there but we'll have to wait and see how long we can bat.\" While England dreamed of setting South Africa a target of 280-plus, the tourists' coach, Mickey Arthur, described his side's performance with the ball as \"very, very disappointing. It simply wasn't good enough. We played with emotional energy rather than intelligent energy, but we've got a gift with the second new ball first thing and the game's still on a knife edge. Hats off to Colly, though. He was written off before this knock. \"We asked the guys to forget about outcomes and we actually forgot about everything else we spoke about,\" said Arthur. \"You can set up the most brilliant plans in the world but you still have to execute them. We wanted to have Colly feeling outside off-stump and he got off the mark pulling - that said everything about our performance. But he played unbelievably well under the pressure.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
