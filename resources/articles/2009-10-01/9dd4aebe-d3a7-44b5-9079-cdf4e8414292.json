But apparently not: it takes a certain amount of guesswork, and two wrong tries \u2013 Stormont House, for much of the century official residence of the Speaker of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland, and Parliament Buildings, a shining white edifice perched at the top of a sweeping, horse-chestnut-lined drive \u2013 before the photographer and I eventually find ourselves at Stormont Castle, where the first joint act of first minister Ian Paisley and deputy first minister McGuinness was to ask the British direct rule minister Peter Hain to leave. Within four days he and his staff had gone. Apparently, they even took the light bulbs. One of the great surprises of those first few months in 2007 was, of course, how famously the two men got on, how rapidly they became poster boys for the possibility of rapprochement. But Paisley stepped down in May 2008, and his successor, Peter Robinson, seems to have less interest in maintaining such appearances. Relations in the past few weeks have been increasingly fractious \u2013 over plans for increasing community cohesion, for example (the irony is lost on no one). Robinson launched his proposals without telling McGuinness, in a speech at Ulster Hall in Belfast; McGuinness has accused Robinson and the Democratic Unionist party of \"spending too long in Disneyland\", a jibe Robinson called \"cheap and nasty\"; the Chuckle Brothers, some say, seem to be being replaced by the Brothers Grimm. \"I had a good working and personal relationship with Ian Paisley, and I also have a good personal relationship with Peter Robinson,\" says McGuinness, pointedly. He is strikingly still in his maroon armchair, tight-wound; all the energy that in other people might be dissipated by punctuating sentences with hand movements, for example, seems concentrated in his eyes. \"Over the course of the summer period the DUP appear to have hardened their position in relation to Sinn F\u00e9in. I believe that's directly related to the European election result, when Sinn F\u00e9in emerged as the largest party in the north and the unionist vote split three ways. I think it is a serious mistake on their part.\" Robinson's speech, he says, \"effectively called for the binning of both the Good Friday and the St Andrews agreements \u2013 certainly the cross-community voting arrangements. It was harking back to an age when a unionist block could dictate the pace at parliament here, and in government.\" No doubt Robinson would disagree with this interpretation, but both men know the stakes are high \u2013 and that they are not really, at the moment, about community cohesion. At issue is when, exactly, and how, the devolution of policing and justice (McGuinness, almost robotic in his concentration, says it all as one word \u2013 \"thetransferofpowerofpolicingandjustice\") as promised in the St Andrew's agreement, is to occur: before Christmas, according to Sinn F\u00e9in, or at an indefinite point after, according to the DUP, who have been employing various foot-dragging tactics. Gordon Brown was at Stormont on Monday; McGuinness and Robinson at Downing Street on Thursday \u2013 the sixth such meeting in three weeks and the third this week. Late Thursday night a \u00a3600m-plus package was hammered out; each party now has to sell it to their rank and file. If they fail, and negotiations drag on until the British general election, Sinn F\u00e9in may well have to deal with a less congenial Conservative government (in which, it has been suggested, ex-Ulster Unionist party leader David Trimble may be offered a cabinet post). How would he deal with that? \"I think whatever government is elected has a bounden duty to stand by the entirety of both the Good Friday and St Andrew's agreement.\" A pause. \"The Conservatives don't have a good track history on the north of Ireland, but that's not a judgment on David Cameron or those he would appoint to represent him. I think that Tony Blair showed himself to be the first British prime minister in the history of Britain's relationship with the north of Ireland to seriously make the effort to understand what was wrong here and what was required to put it right. The Conservatives will do a grave disservice to this process if they don't make a similar effort. \"All I know is that I have had a number of conversations with Owen Paterson, who is the shadow secretary of state for Northern Ireland, and on each occasion he has reiterated that the Conservative party would stand solid behind both the Good Friday and the St Andrew's agreements. So I take people at their word. If they break their word, then we're in a different ball game.\" It is hard to imagine now, but McGuinness grew up in an unpolitical household in relatively unpolitical Derry \u2013 \"in the late 1960s,\" as Ed Moloney puts it in A Secret History of the IRA, \"the number of republicans in Derry could be counted on the fingers of one hand.\" The provisional IRA was mostly a concept, the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the British army not necessarily enemies. McGuinness was one of seven children: six boys and a girl; the family house in the Bogside had only two bedrooms, an outside toilet, and, he says, laughing for the first time in our interview, \"the tiniest kitchen you ever saw in your life, with what we call a jawbox in it, which would now be known as a Belfast sink\". McGuinness's mother was from Donegal, but moved to Derry to work in a shirt factory. Until she died last year, he called her every day, whether he was on the run, in prison, or travelling on government business; she hemmed the trousers he wore on his first day as education minister (they had belonged to his taller brother, an all-Ireland football star). His father, who died in 1973, worked at an iron foundry, \"which was like coal-mining, only above ground. He'd come home from his work covered in dirt and dust as a miner would be, and wash himself down and go off to half-seven mass every day of his life\". McGuinness is still a practising Catholic, though his job means he can't attend mass quite as often. He is abstemious \u2013 he once said that the last time he was drunk was in 1972 \u2013 enjoying, instead, chess, and fly-fishing, and, occasionally, writing poems: his gift to Paisley when he stepped down as first minister was a framed copy of a poem about disappearing sea-trout: \"The lilac creature lay silent and unmoving / As the peaty water flowed over the last of the mohicans. / Stones were the wigwam in a Donegal river / For a decimated breed of free spirits.\" He will not, he admits, be giving Seamus Heaney a run for his money any time soon. School, run by the Christian Brothers, could be brutal, and he left as soon as he could. In 1965 he applied for a job as a mechanic. He has said the interview consisted of three sentences: \"What's your name?\", \"What school did you go to?\" and \"Out the door.\" So, in a move that has made for some predictable headlines over the years, he became a trainee butcher. But then came the civil rights movement, increasingly quashed, in Northern Ireland, by the RUC and the B Specials (volunteer officers of the Ulster Special Constabulary). Membership of the Provisional IRA stayed small for a while \u2013 a dozen or so people, McGuinness once estimated \u2013 but the British policy of internment, introduced in 1970, changed that. Applications to join doubled, tripled, quadrupled by the week. McGuinness says he was radicalised by seeing the dead body, in July 1971, of 19-year-old Desmond Beattie: British troops had claimed that he and a friend, Seamus Cusack, had been about to throw gelignite bombs; their Bogside neighbours knew this was not true. He joined the Officials, then, in frustration, the more active Provisionals, and rose swiftly: shortly after Bloody Sunday he was made OC, or officer commanding, for Derry; in those years the IRA killed 27 soldiers and Derry came to look as though it had been bombed from the air. An informer who was a member of the Derry IRA at the time later told a British newspaper, that \"he demanded total commitment and support from subordinates, and he got it \u2026 once he'd made up his mind, that was it \u2013 he might be all smiles but nobody ever crossed Martin twice.\" Although the British government insisted it would never negotiate with terrorists, McGuinness \u2013 then only 22 \u2013 and Gerry Adams were flown to London for secret talks. Nothing came of them. McGuinness served two prison sentences for running arms (250lb of explosives and nearly 5,000 rounds of ammunition) and for membership of the IRA; he married Bernadette Canning nine days after one of these stints. They have four children and five grandchildren and are coming up to their 35th wedding anniversary. How did his family feel about his activities? \"I worried my parents sick. And I would say I worried my wife sick also.\" For every slightly surreal pilgrimage to his home \u2013 Jane Fonda once dropped by; he made her dinner \u2013 there were many more raids by the British army and RUC, \"and in many cases I was taken off to interrogation centres in Belfast for a week at a time. It was traumatic for my children to see the British army en masse coming into our home and searching the house. I recall on one occasion when our home was raided my youngest son was standing at the top of the stairs \u2013 he would probably have been only three years of age \u2013 in his pyjamas. The soldiers came up the stairs and he peed himself. He was so frightened. \"But these were experiences that many families had to endure, all over the north. I always comfort myself by knowing that although it was bad for us it was an awful lot worse for a lot of other people. Many people have lost their lives at the hands of the British army and the RUC \u2026\" and many people lost their lives at the hands of the IRA, I point out. \"Absolutely. I understand that, and I know that there's an awful lot of hurt in every section of our community. I know that the families of many British soldiers who came to Ireland and lost their lives here \u2013 I know that they hurt too. There isn't a lot I can do about that. All I can do is to try and make the future better.\" Does he feel guilty? \"I do have a very deep sense of regret that there was a conflict, and that people lost their lives, and you know, many were responsible for that \u2013 and a lot of them wear pinstripe suits in London today. So I think if people want to apportion responsibility and blame for all of that it's going to have to be apportioned and shared out all over the place.\" Monday is the 25th anniversary of the Brighton bomb, which targeted Margaret Thatcher and the Tory party conference, killing five people, and injuring many more. Did he cheer? \"No, I didn't cheer. I don't cheer when people lose their lives. But at that time it was in the aftermath of a terrible hunger strike, when Thatcher effectively murdered 10 defenceless prisoners, whose only weapon was hunger strike. So there was little or no sympathy within the broad nationalist and republican community for Margaret Thatcher or her party.\" What's the moral difference, then, between his activities in the early 1970s and those of groups like the Real IRA, who earlier this year killed two soldiers and wounded two pizza delivery men in Antrim town, and the Continuity IRA who killed a Catholic policeman, Stephen Carroll, 48 hours later? Dissident activity is increasing: last month police defused a 600lb bomb on the northern side of the Louth-Armagh border; in August police had to retreat from a roadblock near the village of Meigh, to avoid a gun battle; this Thursday three masked men fired a volley of shots over the coffin of a Real IRA man who died in police custody in Derry on Saturday. After Carroll was killed McGuinness stood with Robinson and the then chief constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Hugh Orde, and called these splinter groups \"traitors\". \"They have betrayed the political desires, hopes and aspirations of all of the people who live on this island and they don't deserve to be supported by anyone.\" They feel the same about him: that he has betrayed everything he once stood for. \"The difference,\" he insists, \"is that in those days when I was a member of the IRA in Derry, there was huge support for the IRA. There is not huge support for these activities. People want these activities to cease. They want these groups to recognise that they cannot recreate the old days. They obviously give themselves these names \u2013 Continuity, Real, \u00d3glaigh na h\u00c9ireann \u2013 but they're imposters. None of these groups will ever have the support let alone the capability that the IRA had.\" But he used to claim that armed resistance would not cease until there was a united Ireland. \"I believe a united Ireland is inevitable. Absolutely. But I believe it can only happen by peaceful and democratic means. What we did was try to rid the roads and towns and villages of the presence of the British army. What these people are trying to do is to bring tens of thousands of soldiers back on the streets, and that is not an agenda that the people of Ireland are prepared to sign up for.\" There are those who argue that what the Real and Continuity IRAs actually intended was to force Adams and McGuinness even closer to the unionists, and that they have succeeded. McGuinness has a different view. \"No conflict, anywhere in the world, would be resolved without leadership from people who are at the heart of the conflict. And to find ourselves in the position we are in at this moment requires leadership. Courageous leadership. It wasn't easy for me to stand behind Hugh Orde and Peter Robinson and say what I said. But I would like to say I was providing leadership. It wasn't easy for Ian Paisley and Gerry Adams to decide, as they did, that the institutions would be restored. That was leadership. And what we now need to see is the same kind of leadership as we move forward. And I believe it can be done.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
