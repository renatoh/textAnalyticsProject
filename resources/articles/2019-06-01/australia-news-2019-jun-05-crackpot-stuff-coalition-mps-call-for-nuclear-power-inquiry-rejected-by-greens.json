As conservative MPs move to establish a Senate inquiry into nuclear power when parliament returns next month, the Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young has invited the former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce to debate her in the \u201ctown he thinks it should be built\u201d. \u201cTalk of overturning the ban on nuclear power in Australia is crackpot stuff,\u201d Hanson-Young, who is the party\u2019s environment spokesperson, said. \u201cAside from being a dangerous technology, nuclear power is wildly expensive and would take a decade or more to build. \u201cIt would be a funny joke if it wasn\u2019t so embarrassing to have the Nationals, who are in government and who sit around the cabinet table, pushing for this. \u201cThese people are meant to be in charge, and they\u2019re running around like a bunch of lunatic cowboys.\u201d The comments from the Greens come after Queenslanders Keith Pitt and James McGrath indicated they would push for a select committee into nuclear power in the first week of parliamentary sittings in July, saying technology has changed since the country last reviewed its prospects in 2006. Pitt said nuclear energy was used by more than 30 countries around the world, and Australia\u2019s adoption of the technology could boost economic activity and lower power prices. \u201cI think we should look at every chance we have to provide those benefits to the Australian people,\u201d Pitt told ABC on Tuesday. When asked where the plant should be built, the Queensland MP said the first step was to consider whether it was \u201cactually feasible\u201d. \u201cScare campaigns from the Labor party are always focused on whose backyard will it be in. We need to stop that and have an adult conversation with the Australian people.\u201d The New South Wales deputy premier, John Barilaro, has also thrown his support behind the nuclear push, saying despite the debate over emissions reduction the nuclear \u201csolution\u201d was seen as too \u201cpolitically risky\u201d. \u201cNow is the right time for Australia to begin a mature and fact-filled conversation on the benefits of nuclear energy,\u201d Barilaro said. The Australian Nuclear Association has supported the new inquiry, saying deep cuts to emissions would be best achieved with nuclear power, with the technology cost competitive with coal and gas if carbon pollution is priced. The association\u2019s Robert Parker said removing the ban on nuclear power that currently exists in the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act would enable industry to start negotiations with suppliers about building a nuclear power plant at the lowest possible cost. But Hanson-Young said the Greens would be pushing to strengthen the EPBC Act and would fight any moves to water down the ban on nuclear. \u201cWe need stronger environment laws that continue the ban on nuclear energy,\u201d Hanson-Young said. \u201cNuclear energy is an old technology that Australia doesn\u2019t need and has outgrown. We are moving toward a renewable energy future. It\u2019s happening, it\u2019s here and the government should be enabling it, not trying to revisit a dangerous and outdated technology.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
