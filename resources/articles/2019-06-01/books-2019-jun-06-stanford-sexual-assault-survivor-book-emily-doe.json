Publicly known only as \u201cEmily Doe\u201d, the then 22-year-old was unconscious when she was sexually assaulted by Turner behind a dumpster on campus in 2015. The case made headlines around the world when Turner repeatedly claimed alcohol was to blame and that the encounter was consensual, while his father called the attack \u201c20 minutes of action\u201d. Eventually convicted of three counts of felony sexual assault, Turner faced a maximum of 14 years in prison, and state law prescribed a minimum of two years for his convictions. But the judge, Aaron Persky, used a Calfornian law that allowed him to make an exception for \u201cunusual\u201d cases and Turner was sentenced to six months in a county jail. He was released after serving half of his sentence, sparking accusations that his lenient treatment was due to his being a white athlete from a well-respected university. At his sentencing, Doe delivered a 7,000-word victim impact statement that made headlines around the world. \u201cThe fact that Brock was a star athlete at a prestigious university should not be seen as an entitlement to leniency, but as an opportunity to send a strong cultural message that sexual assault is against the law regardless of social class,\u201d she wrote. Doe\u2019s statement was republished in full on several news websites, read on the floor of the US House of Representatives, and translated into five languages. After the case, California\u2019s sexual assault laws were amended to make it mandatory for rapists to serve time in state, not county, prison and to allow victims to use the word \u201crape\u201d in court even if their attack did not meet the technical definition under state law. In 2018, Persky was recalled by voters, making him the first judge to be removed from office in the state in 80 years. Viking, the publisher of the forthcoming book, called it \u201ca singular journey that will change the way we talk about sexual assault forever. Emily Doe will reclaim the story of her sexual assault, expose the arduous nature of the legal system, and emerge as a bold, unifying voice.\u201d Viking US editor-in-chief Andrea Schulz said: \u201cEmily Doe\u2019s experience illuminates a culture built to protect perpetrators and a criminal justice system designed to fail the most vulnerable. The book will introduce readers to the writer whose words have already changed their world and move them with its account of her courage and resilience.\u201d The as-yet untitled memoir will be published around the world in September."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
