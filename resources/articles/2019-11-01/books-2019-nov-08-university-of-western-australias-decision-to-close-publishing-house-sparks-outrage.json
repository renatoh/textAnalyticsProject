The fate of the 84-year-old publishing house, UWA Publishing, was communicated via a \u201cproposal for change\u201d circulated by the university\u2019s senior management on Tuesday, blindsiding staff. UWAP publishes literary fiction, including works by multiple Miles Franklin award winners, alongside non-fiction, poetry and scholarly works for an academic and general readership. It is known for the diversity of voices on its list. But the proposal from UWA\u2019s deputy vice-chancellor (global partnerships) said that as \u201conly a small proportion of the authors and content published by UWA Publishing relate directly to the university and its work\u201d, the university was planning to embark on a \u201cprogressive close down\u201d of UWAP\u2019s activities from the end of November this year. The objective was to \u201calign the output of this area\u201d to the \u201cstrategic vision\u201d of the university in providing \u201copen and digitised access to information and knowledge in support of the University\u2019s academic writing and research\u201d, the proposal said. The wording echoes University of Melbourne\u2019s arguments regarding the controversial realignment earlier this year of its own publishing house, Melbourne University Publishing, to focus on scholarly works over commercial publishing. That decision prompted a mass resignation of the university publisher\u2019s board and its chief executive, Louise Adler. Five staff at UWAP will either have their contracts terminated or be made redundant as a consequence of the proposed shut down. Publishing director Terri-Ann White said the decision came \u201ccompletely out of the blue\u201d. \u201cIt was really surprising when we found out on Tuesday and we were delivered a document that outlined the next steps and intentions for the future,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. White said that UWAP had been \u201cvery open\u201d to embarking on open-access and digital publishing alongside its print priorities, but that the university\u2019s preference appeared to be to \u201cclose off one path and start another\u201d. White said she was very concerned about the lack of provision in the proposed shutdown for servicing the 350 authors on UWAP\u2019s backlist, and for the future of the 35 books scheduled to be published in 2020. One of UWAP\u2019s most recent successes was Josephine Wilson\u2019s novel, Extinctions, which won the 2017 Miles Franklin award. Wilson\u2019s novel had also won UWAP\u2019s Dorothy Hewett award for an unpublished manuscript two years earlier \u2013 an incentive the publishing house had put in place to excavate and elevate new Australian literature. UWAP also publishes an array of Noongar language books by dual-Miles Franklin award-winner Kim Scott, as part of the Wirlomin Noongar Language and Stories Project. News of the publishing house\u2019s imminent closure began circulating publicly on Thursday night. By Friday morning, a petition had been established and was collecting signatures. Its creator, Melinda Smith, who won the prime minister\u2019s prize for poetry in 2014, called the decision \u201cshort-sighted\u201d. \u201cUWAP under current director Terri-Ann White is a national treasure and its cessation would leave an enormous hole in the Australian literary landscape,\u201d Smith wrote. At the time of publication, the petition had nearly 1,200 signatures. Responses to the news on social media have centred around White, who has been at UWAP for 14 years, calling her \u201cindefatigable\u201d, full of \u201cvision, energy, imagination and intellect\u201d. Academic and editor of Australian Literary Studies, Julianne Lamond, told Guardian Australia she was \u201cappalled\u201d by the news. \u201cUWAP is a small scholarly press that has had a huge impact on Australian literary culture and Australian culture more generally,\u201d Lamond said. Lamond said UWAP had been particularly important for nurturing scholarship on Australian writing, and especially writing from the west. \u201cTerri-Ann White is a brilliant publisher who has done fantastic work both in the big scholarship on Australian literature and in Australian writing.\u201d White has a reputation as a committed supporter of Australian literature. When a number of small poetry presses folded after former arts minister George Brandis removed funds from the Australia Council for the Arts in 2015 to create the short-lived and controversial parallel funding body later named Catalyst, White and UWAP established a poetry series specifically to support those works that would have otherwise gone unpublished. White told Guardian Australia that the response from the literary community had been \u201cheartwarming\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m so delighted that our authors are coming out to support us but also that people we haven\u2019t published are rallying to support us,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had messages from all of the funding bodies, agents, publishers and other people involved in the literary business.\u201d White said the UWAP community planned to fight back hard against the closure. \u201cWe\u2019ve been mobilising some key voices to write to the university and put the case, and we are very, very pleased about the petition which has only been up for a short time and is going like the clappers.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 11 November to clarify a reference to Melbourne University Publishing\u2019s board resigning"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
