Zouk Capital is the largest shareholder in charge point builder Instavolt, having made an \u00a318m investment in the company. Now Zouk has chosen Instavolt as the charge point fund\u2019s first beneficiary, a decision criticised by the Labour party. The Conservative government announced its intention to establish a charging infrastructure investment fund in the autumn budget of 2017, amid plans to encourage drivers to choose electric cars, which emit lower or zero carbon dioxide . The \u00a3400m government-backed fund initially aims to deliver 3,000 additional rapid-charge points for electric cars, more than doubling the number of electric car charging points in the UK. However, the fund\u2019s rollout, which hoped to match \u00a3200m in private-sector investment with public money, was delayed by almost two years, amid difficulties in recruiting an investment manager. The government finally awarded the mandate to manage the fund to Zouk Capitalin September. It also announced that the fund had raised the first \u00a370m, with half provided by the government and half coming from Abu Dhabi-based renewables investor Masdar. Zouk declined to say exactly how much of the first \u00a370m had gone to Instavolt. However, Samer Salty, Zouk\u2019s founder and managing partner, said it was \u201cless than 50%\u201d. Salty expects to invest more of the fund into other companies by the end of the year. The government faced criticism from a Labour MP for allowing the arrangement. Rebecca Long-Bailey, Labour\u2019s shadow business secretary, said the UK needed urgent and significant investment in charging infrastructure, rather than deals between private companies. She added that a future Labour government would invest \u00a33.6bn in publicly owned charging infrastructure. The government said that Zouk\u2019s choice of Instavolt allowed the fund to \u201cput capital to work quickly\u201d, and that an \u201cindependent fairness opinion\u201d by accountancy firm PwC had been \u201cpositive\u201d. The government and PwC declined to provide the opinion or its reasoning to the Guardian. A spokesperson for the The Infrastructure and Projects Authority, the government body in charge of major investments, said: \u201cInstavolt has ambitious plans for rolling out well-needed rapid chargers across the UK, and has a strong track record in this. \u201cThe government has followed a transparent and due process in the selection of its fund manager for the charging infrastructure investment fund, and all investment decisions have been taken in line with industry best practice.\u201d In payment for managing the fund, Zouk will receive a percentage of the assets under management, plus a significantly higher performance fee if the returns beat a benchmark. Salty declined to comment on the fees charged, but said it was lower than the \u201c2% and 20%\u201d model \u2013 2% of the assets under management and 20% of the profits \u2013 common in the private equity and hedge fund industries. Zouk will wait for at least five years before trying to recoup its equity investment in Instavolt, either by finding a buyer or floating it on a stock market, Salty said. Salty said similar deals were common within private equity and there had been the \u201cright transparency\u201d throughout. The arrangement was made after \u201cvery extensive due diligence\u201d by both Masdar and the government, he added. \u201cThere is a conflict of interest but conflicts are there to be managed,\u201d Salty said. \u201cThey are constantly being managed across the board.\u201d Zouk holds sole responsibility for deciding future investments from the fund, which could go to Instavolt or competitors. Instavolt was founded in November 2016 by energy industry executives Tim Payne and Adrian Pike with backing from Zouk. It has not yet made a profit. It lost \u00a34.3m in the year to 31 March 2019, up from \u00a33.2m the year before. Providing 3,000 charge points will represent a significant step up for Instavolt. The company only built its first charging station in September 2017, and has so far installed about 400."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
