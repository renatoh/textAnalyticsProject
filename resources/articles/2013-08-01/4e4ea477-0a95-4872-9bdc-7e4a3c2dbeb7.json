In a candid interview with the Guardian, Burnham voiced concern that time is running out to mount a coherent challenge to the coalition. The party under Ed Miliband still had time to present a distinctive economic alternative, but he warned that waiting longer would mean that the window will be closed. \"I think there's definitely a need to shout louder, and speak in a way that captures how people are feeling and thinking. There's definitely a need to put our cards on the table,\" he said. Asked how long the window would last, he said it would not stay open \"much beyond next spring\". Burnham claimed that many voters have \"decided the coalition is a failure as a government\", but \"what they aren't yet convinced is that we have the answers\". Burnham's comments follow last week's withering remarks from former Labour whip George Mudie who accused Miliband of being hesitant and cocooned in a bunker. Mudie himself said he could not describe the party's current policies on education and welfare. Asked if he was echoing Mudie's comments, Burnham said: \"No, this isn't a criticism of Ed \u2026 I'm making it a criticism of modern politics.\" Burnham, who was health secretary in the last Labour government, also confirmed internal shadow cabinet conflict over his proposal to integrate social care into the NHS, a policy which would make care of the elderly free at the point of use and universally available. \"If we were to make that shift to fully bring social care within the NHS, I think we could genuinely set the NHS up for the 21st century.\" But he has faced strong resistance from the shadow chancellor, Ed Balls, and Miliband remains undecided. \"I'm saying to Ed [Miliband], I will give you an NHS policy that is one nation to its core, people will say that's what one nation means, all people covered for all of their care needs in a system that is based on the values of the NHS. \"What better way for Labour to say it's relevant to the 21st century than to bring forward a policy as bold in this century of the ageing society as the NHS was in the last? \"That's the way that Ed Miliband wins, by having policies that just knock the others off the pitch basically. And, that's what I want to give him.\" Burnham, who stood against Miliband for the party's leadership, stressed he had \"the utmost respect\" for him, but criticised Labour creating a culture of \"retail politics\" which fails to connect with voters' real concerns. \"We're the professional politician generation, aren't we? I was schooled in this, kind of, how do we make a press release today that embarrasses the opposition? That's the kind of politics that everyone was doing, and the kind of culture developed where you're scrabbling over a bit of the centre ground with micro-policies that are designed to just create a little couple of days' headlines and create a feeling, but not change much else.\" It was a mistake, he also admitted, for the last Labour government to allow the private sector into the NHS. \"Once the market takes a hold on the system it will destroy what's precious about it. We had been building a policy that had been saying it doesn't matter who provides healthcare as long as it's free at the point of delivery. But I'm saying it does matter.\" He maintained he was proud of Labour's overall NHS record, and accused the coalition of trying to exaggerate problems in the health service in order to damage Labour. Burnham accused the prime minister's strategist, Lynton Crosby, of orchestrating the Tories' recent attack, in which the health secretary, Jeremy Hunt, had presented the Keogh report as an indictment of Burnham's record. He has previously declined to comment on reports that he had received a personal apology from Sir Bruce Keogh for the way in which the health secretary had misrepresented his report, but Burnham confirmed these reports were accurate. The Tories had shown they \"were prepared to spin against the NHS and troubled hospitals to get at us, which I think takes them over a line basically. That is unforgivable in my view.\" Anxiety has spread across the party since its poll lead started to shrink and it became clear growth is likely to be higher than forecast this year. There is also anger over decisions to confront the unions over their role in the party and to accept the coalition spending totals for 2015-16. Grant Shapps, chair of the Conservative Party, said: \"This shows that even senior members of Labour's top team think Ed Miliband doesn't have what it takes to stand up for hardworking people. \"His lack of leadership and his lack of ideas shows he's a weak leader of a party that just hasn't changed. It's the same old Labour Party and hardworking people would pay the price of its failure to face up to the mess it created.\" Last month, the Conservatives surged to sit level with Labour for the first time in nearly 18 months, on 36%, largely owing to a sharp fall in support for Ukip, according to an ICM poll for the Guardian."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
