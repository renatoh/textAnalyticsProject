He first became famous across West Africa back in the 60s, when he was championed by his country's then-president, L\u00e9opold Senghor, and his song Talene Lamp Yi (re-recorded for this set) was chosen as the theme for the 1966 Arts N\u00e8gres festival in Dakar, where Thiossane impressed Duke Ellington. Later he sang with the magnificent Orchestra Baobab and enjoyed a successful career as a painter. Now he has returned to music with help from the celebrated African producer Ibrahim Sylla, who has brought in a celebrity cast to provide the backing. The band includes the great Congolese guitarist Papa Noel, along with Orchestra Baobab's sax player Thierno Kouat\u00e9, and five singers, including three current or former members of Baobab. The result is a set that often echoes Baobab's charming and lilting Afro-Cuban style, but is still a showcase for Thiossane. His voice has clearly lost some of its power, but he is on fine form in the gently sturdy Lat Dior and the stately then upbeat Laye Woyena Laye."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
