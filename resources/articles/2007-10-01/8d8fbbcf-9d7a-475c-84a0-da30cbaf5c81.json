The national side was a shambles, drawing against the Faroe Islands and losing to Lithuania in European qualifiers, the Sky TV deal for the Premier League had collapsed and clubs throughout the country began a panicky rush to get rid of mediocre overseas players whose lavish contracts they could no longer afford. In hindsight, losing Sky's cash was a well disguised blessing and one that laid the foundation for a rare boom. Scotland stand on the verge of qualifying for the European Championships from a group that includes the World Cup finalists and a quarter-finalist from 2006, and last week Celtic and Rangers defeated, respectively, the best sides in Europe and France in the Champions League. Scotland's success, in part at least, can be attributed to the high level of competition their leading players now enjoy regularly, but that is not the whole story. When Setanta Sports eventually stepped into an empty broadcasting breach in 2004, the reduced revenues had a profound effect on the number of home-based youngsters featuring in the SPL. More Scotland-born players, 13 in all, have played in the Champions League for Rangers and Celtic within the past 10 days than the Englishmen who turned out for Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool, 11. The Old Firm managers, Walter Smith and Gordon Strachan, are united in a belief that the success the national side are hoping to continue against Ukraine tomorrow is directly linked to the increasing number of Scots operating among Europe's elite. Yet the revival goes beyond Rangers, Celtic and Alex McLeish's Scotland. Aberdeen are only the second Scottish club to qualify for the group phase of the Uefa Cup, and Hibernian topped the SPL for 24 hours last weekend. These clubs are not alone in being rightly praised for the number of talented Scots within their ranks. England's Premier League is also sprinkled with Scottish players, for the first time in two decades. In 2002, Kilmarnock paid their French striker Christophe Cocard an annual salary of \u00a3350,000; that is the combined wage of 10 of the club's current first-team players, but the on-field product at Rugby Park and other grounds has improved. \"Young players were lost amid the number of foreign imports before the television deal collapsed,\" explained John Collins, the Hibs manager. Scotland is now arguably the best-equipped nation in Europe to deal with Uefa's rapidly evolving home-grown player initiatives. Proof of progress goes beyond high-profile results such as Scotland's win over France last month, Rangers' demolition of Lyon and Celtic's win over Milan. The Under-20 team reached the final of the European Championship last year. Tommy Wilson, their former joint manager, said: \"People used to say Scotland could produce good coaches but not good players. That is no longer the case. The success at all levels of our game shows there have been no one-offs.\" Mark McGhee returned north only four months ago, having previously spent his entire managerial career in England. He admits to being pleasantly surprised by what he has discovered since taking over at Motherwell. \"What has struck me is the excellent preparation done by coaches,\" he said. \"There are teams in the SPL who are tactically sound, tactically advanced in fact. There was previously a negative perception towards Scottish football, and for a number of years that was fair. I watched the likes of Aberdeen and Dundee United signing players who had failed in the Championship. Now if players come to Scotland they are of a far better quality.\" McGhee played for Aberdeen when they won the European Cup Winners' Cup under Alex Ferguson in 1983, a period in which the national team also regularly qualified for major tournaments, and could perhaps be expected to urge caution. But there is no such temptation. \"There is a little bit of wishful thinking going on just now, that we have a renaissance in Scottish football, that the good form will continue,\" said the Motherwell manager. \"The recent achievements of Celtic and Rangers shows people are not wrong to think like that, and not wrong to think that we may be on the verge of something similar to the Eighties.\" SPL coaching standards will be highlighted again on Sunday, when the league's coaching seminar - attended by Ferguson and G\u00e9rard Houllier, along with the Premier League's 12 managers - is held at Hampden. \"There is an international recognition of what we are doing in Scotland,\" said Lex Gold, the SPL chairman. \"When the SPL was established in 1998, one of the key areas we recognised that had to be improved was youth development. When Berti Vogts took over as the Scotland manager [in 2002], I told him he was probably in the job three or four years too early. I think we are seeing the proof of that now.\" That young players were afforded first-team experience at an early stage owes much to the SPL's prescient ruling that three members of every team's matchday squad must be under the age of 21. \"The impact that rule has had cannot be underplayed,\" said Pat Nevin, the former Scotland international and current BBC Scotland pundit. \"But if we get tangible success and generate more money, I just hope we do not go back down the road of expensive foreign imports again. We've seen what damage that can do.\" The best of Tartan times 1928 Scotland's forward line was short of stature but high on class when they beat England 5-1 to earn the soubriquet the Wembley Wizards. With Hughie Gallacher leading the line and the dazzling wing play of Alex Jackson on the right and Alan Morton - the \"Wee Blue Devil\" - on the left they ran England ragged. Jackson scored a hat-trick and Alex James a brace. 1967 Jim Baxter ridiculed England at Wembley, nine months after they had won the World Cup, by playing keepy-uppy as Scotland became the first side to beat Alf Ramsey's men since their victory over West Germany, ending a 19-match unbeaten run. Scotland won the European Championship group game 3-2 with Denis Law, right, Bobby Lennox and Jim McCalliog scoring their goals. 1974 Scotland went to the World Cup in West Germany in high hopes and left it unbeaten. Their failure to score more goals against Zaire in their opening group match - they won 2-0 - cost them dear. They would have beaten Brazil, the defending world champions, had Billy Bremner reacted better to their best chance but they were held 0-0 and a 1-1 draw against Yugoslavia, who had beaten Zaire 9-0, saw them go out but with heads held high."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
