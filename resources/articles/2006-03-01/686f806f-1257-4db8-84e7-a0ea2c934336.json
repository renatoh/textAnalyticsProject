The celebrity couple were due for high court showdown with the tabloid over allegations they were \"cynically and hypocritically\" trying to pretend their marriage was perfect. But the Beckhams and the News of the World have come to a settlement over the case, which would have seen the England footballer and his pop-star wife's personal lives laid bare in court after this summer's World Cup. A statement issued by News Group Newspapers, publisher of the News of the World, said: \"The defamation proceedings by David and Victoria Beckham against the News of the World have been resolved on a confidential basis. There will be no further comment.\" The Beckhams' action stemmed from a News of the World article published in September 2004, headlined \"Posh and Becks on the Rocks\", which contained allegations about the couple's marriage made by their former nanny Abbie Gibson. The Beckhams are still suing Gibson for breach of a confidentiality agreement. The settlement is thought to include several resolutions between the two sides. It is unclear whether the paper has agreed not to revisit its allegations that David Beckham was unfaithful to his wife with his former personal assistant Rebecca Loos. The England captain has consistently denied being unfaithful. During pre-trial applications for disclosure of documents in the case in October 2005, Mr Justice Gray was told the Beckhams said there was no truth in a series of allegations made by the newspaper and believed that they had been defamed. Hugh Tomlinson QC, for the couple, said: \"The case being put against us is that we are promoting a false image of ourselves as a happily married couple. We do not deny that we promote ourselves as a happily married couple. We say that's because it is true.\" Richard Spearman QC, for News Group Newspapers, told the judge the defence would be justification - that the article was true. The newspaper would argue that the article meant that \"because their substantial fortunes depend upon their public perception, the claimants have been cynically and hypocritically trying - for financial reasons - to convince the public that they continue to enjoy a happy marriage\". \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
