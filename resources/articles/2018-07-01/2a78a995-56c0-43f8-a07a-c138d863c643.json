The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation (Naccho) released its submission amid increasing chatter from the federal government about a new trial of the welfare quarantining card in Tennant Creek. Naccho said the more than $12,000 spent per person in the trials \u2013 which quarantine 80% of a person\u2019s welfare income onto a card with restricted spending \u2013 would be better diverted to early intervention and primary healthcare. \u201cNaccho is strongly opposed to the current cashless debit card trials as well as any proposal to expand,\u201d it said. \u201cWe also note that Aboriginal people are disproportionately affected by the trials and that they are in and proposed for locations where the majority participants are Aboriginal. Whilst it is not the stated intent of the trials, its impact is discriminatory.\u201d Naccho cited a recent report by the National Audit Office, which determined it was unclear whether the program was actually reducing social harm. The federal social services minister, Dan Tehan, said the government would push ahead regardless, and the identified concerns were being addressed. An amendment bill, currently being examined by a Senate inquiry, seeks to expand the trial to the Bundaberg and Hervey Bay region and increase the number of participants to 15,000. The trial sites are in or proposed for locations where the majority of participants are Indigenous. \u201cWhilst it is not the stated intent of the trials, its impact is discriminatory,\u201d said Naccho. \u201cNaccho is strongly of the view that this funding could be more effectively spent on early intervention and primary healthcare strategies targeted towards reducing alcohol, drug and gambling-related harm. \u201cNotwithstanding our primary view that the trial funding should be redirected, a robust cost-benefit analysis should be undertaken prior to any expansion of the trials and this should be made public.\u201d Local support for a trial in the Bundaberg region has dropped amid revelations of the cost, and the mayor has withdrawn his support for a trial in the region. On Sunday the prime minister visited Tennant Creek to hear about the town\u2019s struggles with homelessness and overcrowding, alcohol and related violence and child-protection issues. He and Tehan flagged active conversations around the town being a future cashless welfare card trial site. However, Tennant Creek residents who receive welfare are already subject to the BasicsCard. The BasicsCard was introduced across the Northern Territory as part of the federal government\u2019s 2007 intervention. It quarantines a smaller proportion of funds than the cashless welfare card being trialled, and can only be used at approved shops. The audit office report found in 2012-13 that the direct cost of the BasicsCard couldn\u2019t be isolated but the Department of Human Services estimated it was about $6,600 to $7,900 per person a year. Some Tennant Creek residents have previously expressed concern to Guardian Australia the federal card would make it more difficult when they needed cash in the isolated and remote town. Greens senator, Rachel Siewert urged the government \u201cnot to add another layer of stress\u201d to Tennant Creek and instead to address underlying causes of trauma and crisis. \u201cTo consider the cashless welfare card in a community that really needs support would be particularly dangerous,\u201d Siewert said. \u201cWe know that those struggling with addiction will find ways around the card, meanwhile carers, people on the disability pension and jobseekers will have their sense of independence taken away and further harm could be caused.\u201d On Sunday the social services minister, Dan Tehan, said the cashless debit card \u201chas been raised with us by the local community\u201d and the government would \u201ccontinue to have those conversations\u201d. \u201cIf the local community thinks it\u2019s a part of the suite of measures that are needed here, then obviously we would go forward with that, but that would very much depend on the local community being a willing partner in that process.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
