Tasker tapped out the post in her iPhone notes first and, 10 minutes later, found herself pressing share. \u201cI went back in and edited it for five minutes and then sat poised, waiting for the comments.\u201d Tasker has a public account, with more than 200,000 followers. The post wasn\u2019t going to sit in an internet vacuum; it would be seen by strangers, friends, the other parents at her daughter\u2019s school. \u201cThis year I made over \u00a3200k,\u201d she wrote, \u201cmainly whilst sat at my kitchen table, drinking gin &amp; doing what I love\u2026 It\u2019s all possible, friends.\u201d Tasker knew there would be a reaction: \u201cIt was terrifying \u2013 I felt very vulnerable.\u201d But she wanted people to know it was possible to make a very good living in her multi-hyphenate role of influencer, photographer and coach. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t know what I did,\u201d she says. \u201cThere was no evidence that it was possible to do this well.\u201d Despite the cynicism in some quarters about influencer culture, the response to her post was overwhelmingly positive. Tasker\u2019s success story is the palatable kind: she\u2019s a self-made northerner, who before going all-out on Instagram worked as a speech therapist in the NHS, earning \u00a321,000 a year. She believes this coloured the response to her new, six-figure salary. \u201cYou can\u2019t just say, \u2018This is what I earn,\u2019 and it be a neutral fact,\u201d Tasker admits. \u201cIt has to be contextualised.\u201d But despite all the raised-hands emojis in the comments, Tasker couldn\u2019t sleep, knowing the post was sitting there. \u201cI took it down two days later,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like I\u2019d had the conversations I needed to have. I didn\u2019t want to feel like a target. It\u2019s exposing in ways that I haven\u2019t quite processed yet. The post felt bigger than me.\u201d *** Talking about money is complicated. In March this year, YouGov research found that 50% of UK adults believe that sharing personal money matters with others is taboo \u2013 although 61% of people said they feel better when they do. However, there are signs of a new openness, much of it led by personal revelations \u2013 from individuals sharing their salaries, to money diaries going viral, to the rise of \u201cdebtstagrammers\u201d, people who are happy to post their credit card bills to Instagram in the hope that their followers will make them accountable when it comes to paying back their debt. Even Lloyds bank\u2019s latest TV ad campaign has featured family members having halting conversations about their finances, ending with the tagline: \u201cIt\u2019s good to talk about money.\u201d Tasker is not the only influencer to have revealed what she earns publicly. In May, the food writer and activist Jack Monroe disclosed her salary of \u00a321,000 to a Guardian journalist reporting on the squeamishness British people still feel about discussing what they earn. Earlier this year, fashion blogger Alex Stedman, AKA The Frugality, posted to her blog: \u201cMoney, it\u2019s something we never have enough of, right?! But it\u2019s also something, I believe, we\u2019re not talking enough about.\u201d Stedman started her blog, which champions affordable fashion and sustainability, because she \u201cwanted to take away the stigma of not having tons of money\u201d. She revealed that she currently pays herself a salary of \u00a330,000 \u2013 the highest she\u2019s ever earned. Legislation that in 2018 made it mandatory for all UK companies with more than 250 staff to publish their gender pay gap \u2013 the disparity between what male and female employees earn \u2013 has helped propel what was once private information into the public domain. Suddenly there was no denying that our reticence to talk about money was protecting unfair pay gaps and, in some cases, illegal discrimination. On 2018\u2019s Equal Pay-Day (the day in the year that women effectively begin working for free), the Fawcett Society launched a campaign calling on people to \u201cend the culture of pay secrecy\u201d by \u201ctalking to your colleagues and asking what they earn\u201d. Last month it was reported that Samira Ahmed, presenter of Newswatch, is taking the BBC to an employment tribunal over alleged unequal pay. It follows the high profile case of broadcaster Carrie Gracie, who in early 2018 resigned as the BBC\u2019s China editor, citing gendered pay discrimination. She is passionate about why we need to get more comfortable with talking about money. \u201cHowever difficult that first conversation might seem, you\u2019ve got to have it,\u201d she tells me. \u201cIt\u2019s like gym work, isn\u2019t it? You build muscle and you get stronger.\u201d Gracie recently published a book on the subject, Equal: A Story Of Women, Men And Money. \u201cOne of the reasons I\u2019ve written it is to say to women: \u2018You really have to be vigilant.\u2019 It is imperative for women to talk about this because, if they\u2019re not careful, over their working life they could lose out on hundreds of thousands of pounds.\u201d So how do you start a conversation about equal pay at work? \u201cIt\u2019s obviously very important to start off in a friendly manner,\u201d says Gracie, who ultimately won an apology and a payout from the BBC. \u201cYou need to be professional, businesslike, and show that you\u2019re serious and take yourself seriously, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to be angry or emotional.\u201d And if your emotions or nerves get the better of you? \u201cIf you emerge thinking, \u2018Ugh, I wish I\u2019d handled that better\u2019, then don\u2019t worry about it: you should be proud of yourself and know that you\u2019ll get it better next time. It\u2019s a learning journey.\u201d Talking and sharing in this way has helped people fight other money injustices. Now that 15% of the UK workforce are self\u2011employed, more people than ever are finding themselves without the protection of HR departments or trade unions; instead, they are self-organising on social media. Campaigners Seyi Akiwowo and Gabby Edlin recently set up a Facebook group titled Fuck You Pay M\u00a3 where women and non-binary people could discuss rates and give each other money advice. \u201cWe\u2019re sick and tired of being asked to work for free,\u201d wrote Edlin. \u201cTo do panels for free, run a workshop \u2018on love\u2019, or create art for companies with only the offer of \u2018exposure\u2019.\u201d Anna Codrea-Rado started her campaign, #FairPayforFreelancers, in February this year. It began with an open letter demanding an end to unfair and slow payment practices, which was signed by 800 journalists. \u201cThe closure of the Pool [an online women\u2019s magazine that entered administration in January, leaving many unpaid] was the final straw,\u201d she says. \u201cI realised that no one was protecting us.\u201d When the columnist Laura Craik went public about the \u00a37,250 that she says The Pool owed her, she wrote that the magazine only seemed to stop commissioning new writers \u201conce they [were] outed first on Facebook and then on Twitter by a mounting number of freelancers who [hadn\u2019t] been paid\u201d. In August 2019, Ben O\u2019Brien, an illustrator with more than 15 years\u2019 experience of making art for clients including the BBC, tweeted to his 25,000 followers: \u201cLame start to the week when I find out the job I was in line for (16 illustrations for one of the biggest smartphone brands with a major ad agency) was to be paid for with\u2026 a new phone worth \u00a31k. No thanks mate.\u201d The first time O\u2019Brien had asked about the budget, his question was ignored. \u201cI had no reason to be suspicious,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge agency, so I presumed they were finalising details.\u201d But a week away from starting the job, which O\u2019Brien estimated would take a month working full-time to complete, he asked again. They replied: \u201cNo, the phone we sent you, that is the payment.\u201d Frustrated, O\u2019Brien aired his grievances on Twitter. \u201cAlthough I have great clients, illustrators are often underpaid and undervalued,\u201d he says. \u201cBy calling it out, I hope people will realise that it\u2019s not OK to presume someone will work for no actual pay.\u201d Another illustrator, Niki Groom, aka Miss Magpie, has founded a collective of illustrators who are open with each other about pay, allowing them to enter negotiations with clients knowing the market rate. She also took the step of posting her illustration earnings over the past 10 years online. Through beautifully rendered pie charts, she reveals that she went from earning just \u00a3160 from illustrating in 2012 to \u00a359,548 in 2018. \u201cIf people think I\u2019m showing off, then they have misunderstood,\u201d says Groom. \u201cI wanted people to know that it takes time to build earnings, but that it\u2019s possible to make a living. It\u2019s amazing how helpful a data point of one or two people can be to knowing your own worth. The most surprising thing is that even those who I\u2019d have considered my competitors have been positive and thankful.\u201d *** Pay is not the only hot topic in the new, more open money conversation. Last year the UK\u2019s unsecured debt \u2013 which includes store cards, credit cards, overdrafts, payday and personal loans \u2013 reached its highest ever level compared with income. Kirsty Good, head of campaigns and forums at MoneySavingExpert.com, says it is vital we learn to talk about debt, adding: \u201cIt\u2019s why financial education is needed. If people could feel more knowledgeable about their finances, they might feel more comfortable openly talking about how they\u2019ve managed to, say, shift their debt on to a 0% credit card, or how they\u2019re planning to pay for a big event, like a wedding.\u201d Once again, though, a shift does seem to be under way. On MoneySavingExpert\u2019s Debt Free Wannabe forums, members display an almost cultish devotion to openly discussing money. Each contributor signs off their posts with the amount of debt they owe and their predicted debt-free date. While no substitute for formal, one-on-one advice, the platform is an opportunity to speak to someone who knows how it feels to be \u00a315k in debt while earning the minimum wage. \u201cThe threads are non-judgmental places for people to swap their experiences, celebrate even the smallest of wins and, in some cases, save lives,\u201d says Good. I speak to a woman called Anna (not her real name), who in March this year posted a list of her debts on Instagram. From a Next credit account to an American Express card, they totalled \u00a325,438.11. She named the account @myfrugalyear and publicly announced her intention to be debt-free by March 2021. \u201cIt was a pretty rough moment, actually,\u201d she says. \u201cI felt like the protagonist of a 1990s debt consolidation advert, sitting head in hands at my kitchen table. I\u2019d just had a really difficult conversation with the bank, as we were in an unarranged overdraft. They were asking when I would be out of it, and I had to say, \u2018I don\u2019t know. We were just paid last week and there is no money left.\u2019 I realised in that moment: enough is enough. I knew I needed to sit down and add up all my debt.\u201d The bank offered Anna an adviser, but she turned the offer down: \u201cI didn\u2019t want to be patronised or belittled in a meeting about my finances.\u201d But if she couldn\u2019t talk about it in a private room, why post it to Instagram? \u201cI had always been influenced to spend by Instagram, and it felt like poetic justice to use it as a vehicle out of the situation,\u201d she says. Anna is not the only one looking to social media for a way out: the hashtag #debtfreejourney has now been used half a million times on Instagram. For Anna, it\u2019s working: in six months she\u2019s paid off nearly \u00a35,000 and has 20,000 new social media followers to hold her accountable. She\u2019s also found that her relationship with Instagram has changed. \u201cThe illusion has been shattered,\u201d she says. \u201cI look at the interiors accounts I used to follow and think: what was so seductive about them? I look at my old feed and see it\u2019s just pictures of stuff. Going public has forced me to be honest with myself.\u201d The popularity of money diaries, where people document their outgoings, is another sign of the new openness about spending. The Guardian\u2019s regular How I Spend It column, in which readers discuss their finances, has been running since January 2018 and has proved hugely popular with people who are curious about how others save or spend. For many would-be contributors, though, the sticking point is the need to declare their earnings. \u201cThose willing to share their income details usually come from the public sector or are self-employed or on benefits,\u201d says Patrick Collinson, editor of Guardian Money. \u201cIf you are a nurse or teacher, then your salary details are already in a sense publicly available, as there are agreed scales.\u201d On the website Refinery29, anonymous female social workers, accountants and paediatricians have broken down their spending in minute detail; one writer included everything from their rent, to their New Year\u2019s Eve cocaine bill, to paying their flatmate back \u00a31 for a packet of crisps. Last month the BBC launched its own version, in which a 27-year-old wrote of her guilt over spending \u00a31.50 on a can of tuna. The story went viral, with readers debating whether her frugality was commendable or depressing, and the woman, who wasn\u2019t anonymous, found her spending trending on Twitter. \u201cMoney is a window into our society, so people enjoying the voyeurism of the series isn\u2019t a surprise,\u201d explains Gillian Orr, head of content at Refinery29. \u201cMillennials came of age during the financial crash, so they have a different perspective on money to other generations. Whereas their parents kept conversations about finance behind closed doors, young people today are much more relaxed discussing this previously \u2018sensitive\u2019 issue with friends, partners and even strangers online.\u201d For the 25 million UK customers now managing their banking though phone apps, keeping your own digital money diary has never been easier. With banks like Monzo and Starling displaying spending by category and retailer, it\u2019s impossible to ignore what is draining our bank accounts, whether it\u2019s Starbucks or Asos; and that in turn is prompting conversations between friends about spending habits. But while apps are making us more accountable, there is a downside. \u201cThe positives of being able to see your bank balance and have your spending itemised is being outweighed by the detrimental effect contactless payments and one-click checkouts have on our spending,\u201d says Jason Butler, an FT columnist and host of the Real Money Stories podcast. A 2014 report by the Journal of Economic Sciences found that contactless payments have led to an 8-10% increase in spending at the point of sale. \u201cThere\u2019s still a way to go on the money conversation. Right now we\u2019re at the awareness stage: yes, more people are sharing, and we\u2019ve started to realise the positives that can come from talking about money. But it doesn\u2019t mean everyone is ready.\u201d A year after that Instagram post, I ask Sara Tasker if there have been any negative consequences of revealing her salary. \u201cIt\u2019s been really positive \u2013 my friendships are definitely more honest,\u201d she says. \u201cI guess it\u2019s slightly strange when I go out for dinner with my family, and my mum and dad will pay for my siblings and not me, but that\u2019s also totally OK.\u201d I ask Anna of @myfrugalyear how her friends reacted to her honesty. \u201cThey were surprised,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019d put on a good act over the years, and no one realised quite how much debt we were in. Afterwards some friends revealed that they are in the same situation, and having that chat was such a relief \u2013 a bonding experience.\u201d She adds that not every conversation has been that easy. \u201cOne friend who is sorted financially said, \u2018Well, now I don\u2019t feel I can talk to you about the house I\u2019m buying.\u2019 And in truth it does make me feel jealous. But at least we can work through those conversations together now, with a bit more empathy.\u201d Honesty box: how to be straight about cash 1 You might not be ready to chat openly, but don\u2019t deceive yourself. Look at your bank account and be mindful when spending. No one should get to the end of the month saying, \u201cI don\u2019t know where all my money went.\u201d 2 Don\u2019t just accept that you\u2019re \u201crubbish with money\u201d. As MoneySavingExpert.com\u2019s Kirsty Good says, \u201cIt\u2019s crucial a consumer can do the maths on a discount, or know how to split the bill with a friend \u2013 it stops them being ripped off.\u201d 3 Try to have casual chats about money with friends, colleagues and your partner \u2013 that way, when you have to talk about it in a high-stakes situation, you\u2019ll have the vocabulary to advocate for yourself. 4 Money is a topic for everyone, not just for rich people. There is no one who wouldn\u2019t benefit from a conversation about it. 5 Talk about how you\u2019re paying for things, not just how much things cost. It\u2019s a chance to educate each other about good and bad sources of credit. \u2022 Alex Holder is the author of Open Up: Why Talking About Money Will Change Your Life (Serpent\u2019s Tail) If you would like a comment on this piece to be considered for inclusion on Weekend magazine\u2019s letters page in print, please email weekend@theguardian.com, including your name and address (not for publication)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
