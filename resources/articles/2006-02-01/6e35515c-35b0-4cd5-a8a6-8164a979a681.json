If the Chicago Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law lawsuit is successful, Craigslist will be forced to comply with the same anti-discrimination rules as US newspaper publishers. Craigslist must respond to the lawsuit by 15 March. The group cites more than 200 adverts from Chicago Craigslist which it claims discriminate against prospective tenants on various grounds including race, gender and religion. They quoted ads from the previous six months which state restrictions including \"no minorities\" and \"clean, Godly Christian male\". \"Discriminatory housing advertisements contaminate the housing market, stigmatise the people who are discouraged or excluded from housing, and mislead people into thinking that it is normal and acceptable to select tenants on the basis of race, gender, religion or family status, \" said Laurie Wardell, a CLCCRUL representative. But in an emphatic defence of Craigslist, the chief executive, Jim Buckmaster, said the site had actively worked to support the fair housing movement and added that he expected the lawsuit to be dismissed. \"Craigslist is not a publisher, but rather a community-moderated commons run by and for its users, who self-publish and manage their own ads and use a flagging system to police the site,\" Mr Buckmaster said. He said that the site is protected by the \"well-established immunity\" offered by the US legal precedent that websites cannot be held responsible for content posted by their users. Mr Buckmaster added that discriminatory postings are rare and dealt with quickly, expressing surprise that CLCCRUL objected to ads which stated \"great apartment for graduate students, married couple, or small family\" and \"wants one nice quiet person\". \"Though possibly well-intentioned, this lawsuit ignores the essential nature of Craigslist, demanding that we cease treating our users with trust and respect, and instead impose inappropriate, mistake-prone, and generally counter-productive centralised controls,\" said Mr Buckmaster, adding that Craigslist's 2 million monthly ads outnumber the combined number placed placed in US newspapers. Local newspapers have become increasingly threatened by the Craigslist network, which allows users to place almost all classified ads for free. The online venture started in San Francisco in 1995 and now has more than 180 sub-sites worldwide. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
