Bose, who had planned to interview leading Zimbabwean cricket figures about the possible cancellation of England's tour to the region later this year, was told he did not have the correct accreditation. He was escorted to the airport in Bulawayo and watched until he departed for Johannesburg. Bose, who was told he would be imprisoned if he did not leave the country, blamed his expulsion \"on a combination of being a journalist and holding a British passport\". \"An immigration officer came to my hotel on orders from Harare and asked me to leave,\" Bose told Sky News. \"I hadn't written a single word, but they told me in order to remain and write about cricket I needed accreditation, and in order to get it I should have applied a month earlier in London. But other journalists who arrived with me were also late with their accreditation.\" Asked why he thought he had been expelled, Bose said: \"First of all I am a British passport holder and Robert Mugabe has almost a pathological hatred of the British. I think the feeling was here is a British journalist who is going to talk to various people and cause more trouble and we don't want him. It's the combination of being a journalist and being a British citizen which has led to this.\" Bose's expulsion comes as officials from the Zimbabwe Cricket Union travelled to Lord's to plead with the England and Wales Cricket Board not to scrap the tour. Zimbabwe's only independent daily newspaper, the Daily News, stopped publication in February after the country's supreme court stated it was a crime to publish a newspaper or work as a journalist without a government-issued licence. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
