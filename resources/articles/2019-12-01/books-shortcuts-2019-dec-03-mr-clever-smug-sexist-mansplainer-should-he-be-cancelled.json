Should he be cancelled?", "bodyText": "Name: Mr Clever. Age: 41. Status: Cancelled. Really? I could see this coming with Mr Tickle, but not Mr Clever. Calm down, none of the Mr Men have been #MeToo-ed yet. So why has he been cancelled? Mansplaining. That pig. I know. Tell me what happened. In the book Mr Men in Scotland, Mr Clever explains that the Forth Bridge is named after the River Forth, to which Little Miss Curious replies: \u201cSo what happened to the River First, the River Second and the River Third?\u201d. Then Mr Clever sighs. And then what happened? A student who shared a picture of the book on social media said: \u201cThe Mr Men books are intended for children and it\u2019s telling them, \u2018Girls, you need to be stupid, and men, it\u2019s your job to explain things.\u2019\u201d And I\u2019m guessing this has caused something of an outrage? Yes, and it is long overdue if you ask me \u2013 children\u2019s books have a long history of playing up sexist tropes, so it\u2019s great that someone is finally calling them out. Well, this certainly sounds like the most important thing going on in the world right now. There\u2019s no need to be rude. As the student pointed out in a subsequent interview: \u201cIt\u2019s an example of these tiny things that build up to create a whole patchwork quilt of sexist iconography that every child of any gender is going to internalise.\u201d That isn\u2019t the Mr Clever I know. Oh, don\u2019t go defending him, you patriarchal cog. No, really. Go and read the original Mr Clever book. It\u2019s a study in hubris. Mr Clever\u2019s intelligence has made him smug and hard to love, and we watch as he gradually alienates himself from the world with his sense of superiority. Right! So you\u2019re saying that the character was always intended as a means to demonstrate the importance of empathy over intelligence? Yes! And you\u2019re implying that, by making the same assumptions without having the necessary understanding of context, those now calling out Mr Clever have effectively committed the same act of hubris that scuppered their archenemy Mr Clever? Yes! And you would furthermore like to state that their real ire should be directed towards Egmont UK, the Sanrio corporation and Roger Hargreaves\u2019 estate for removing the subtlety from the original series as part of their posthumous rebrand? Sure. Good, I\u2019m glad we agree. I tell you who is a mansplainer, though. Don\u2019t. Little Miss Brainy. She mansplains all the time. I mean it. Don\u2019t. Why not? Well, how does that book end? Her intelligence sends her to Africa where she is eaten by a lion. So now you\u2019re saying that intelligent women deserve to be eaten by lions. You\u2019ve just made everything worse. Do say: \u201cThe Mr Men series doesn\u2019t live up to the vigorous standards of today.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201c#NotAllMrMen\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
