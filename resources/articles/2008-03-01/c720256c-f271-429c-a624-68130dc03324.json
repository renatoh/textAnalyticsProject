In this new work for the Royal that ventures into the world of technology, he looks like a man determined to experiment with freedom. The logic of the work is all in its title: Electric Counterpoint. On the one hand, Wheeldon is pushing his work into the realms of the virtual by having his four dancers shadowed by digital images of themselves on screen. At the same time, he is using taped interviews with the dancers to let them speak directly to us about the very real-life pressures of performing on stage. Wheeldon and his team of designers conjure fascinating contrasts. The ballet's first half is a series of intimate confessionals, including a solo for Zenaida Yanowsky in which she dances with a ghostly avatar of herself while musing on the magical realm she enters while in character. The second half is catapaulted into a world of blazing electrification. Propelled by Steve Reich's titular score, the dancers move between multiple criss-crossing patterns of their digital twins. At moments, the accumulated energy levels are thrilling. However, what is disappointing about this work is that they should be even higher. Wheeldon's dance invention is rarely as drastic as it needs to be, its pulse too cautious and its language is too familiar as a recycling of his sculpted moves. The rest of the programme is mixed in every other way. While Marianela N\u00fa\u00f1ez is witty in the eccentric, deconstructed gypsy flourishes of Balanchine's Tzigane, Alexandra Ansanelli is out of her depth in Ashton's A Month in the Country. Her Natalia Petrovna is all declamatory emotion without the connective tissue of character. \u00b7 In rep til March 19.
