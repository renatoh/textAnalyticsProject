The contemporary dancer is also deeply interested in reading queer theory \u2013 with a bit of self-help on the side. What\u2019s thrilling I\u2019m a sample girl. I will go to Mecca and Sephora and be that annoying girl, who takes a million samples because I don\u2019t want to spend hundreds of dollars on product. I just suck it up and I do it. Sometimes I take my own little empty containers and I will fill them up so I don\u2019t have to ask. That\u2019s how I get through. Omorovicza cleansing foam from Mecca is amazing, because you can literally have less than a 5c piece and it will foam so much in your hand. It has lasted me almost a year and a half and I still have it. I use the cleansing foam morning and evening and I always wash my face twice, that\u2019s my little tip. Leanne Betasamosake Simpson is an academic and writer, and she\u2019s also a musician. I just picked up her book, As We Have Always Done. It\u2019s about Indigenous freedom through radical resistance. I love to jump between really corny self-help into intense political First Nations canon writing. Going between those two feels nourishing to me. I like her perspective on reframing resistance and knowledge systems in terms of how we understand our culture and ourselves and prioritising our pedagogy \u2013 like learning from the land and learning from what we have always done to survive \u2013 as First Nations people. I\u2019m First Nations from the Philippines, and I\u2019m constantly thinking about how I framed myself in the colonial west. She really looks at all the things that have affected our First Nations, whether that be white supremacy or hetero-patriarchy, or capitalist structures. Every single page you read, you\u2019re like, I get it, and she talks about queerness. It\u2019s really looking at the depth of what it means to resist in an Indigenous way. What\u2019s nostalgia-inducing My mum would always have these weird tips around facial beauty and ageing. Getting older, I somehow turned into her, which is very fascinating. Right now I\u2019m obsessed with facial yoga, lymphatic drainage and I just watch these old Japanese women on YouTube massaging their faces for 30 minutes. I will copy it and it\u2019s because I grew up watching my mum washing her face in this very ritual way, with intense focus. Now, I am embodying that in a way. I feel like every time I do those kind of rituals, whether it be face yoga, or massaging my face or even making sure that I sleep on a certain side, I just feel like I\u2019m my mother. Oh my God, everything is just coming back to my mum now. My mum was very evangelical. We weren\u2019t allowed to read anything. Even Harry Potter was banned in my house when I was a small. I would have to buy these books that were from the Christian bookshop and they would be about \u201cfinding God in the Matrix\u201d or \u201cfinding Jesus in The Simpsons\u201d. It was so weird and that\u2019s the only way I could understand pop culture. But now my mum has moved away from that and she\u2019s really into self-help and people like Eckhart Tolle. So a few years ago, she gave me Eckhart Tolle\u2019s A New Earth. And I can finally relate to what my mum is saying without being so attached to Christianity. It really looks at the experience of yourself and the ego, but also God and spirituality in this really expanded way. It\u2019s kind of like the 101 book for self-help. I actually carry it around with me everywhere and it has a lot of notes from my mum inside it. What I keep going back to Hyaluronic acid, I would say that is my go to. It continues that natural process of building collagen and also nourishing and moisturising skin. There\u2019s all these high end products on the market, like $400 serums but I\u2019m obsessed with the line The Ordinary right now. It\u2019s a really affordable option and it\u2019s really scientific. All of their products come in these cute little canisters that look very scientific. You can like mix them and blend it with other serums and once you understand the science of skin, you realise that luxury products are amazing and feel good, but at the end of the day, you\u2019re just putting a chemical on your face. And you should really just understand how much you should put on and when to put it on. I always re-read bell hooks\u2019 All About Love. For me that was really helpful as a young trans woman of colour growing up and not really having an understanding of my own relationship with love. The book has really helped me map out my history and journey. It offered a perspective in terms of love in a body that has endured trauma or love in bodies that maybe don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re worthy of love. She does an amazing thing where she looks at healing and social justice and love as inseparable parts of your identity, that always have to be in relationship to each other. There\u2019s one copy that just keeps on getting passed around within my community and I don\u2019t know who has it at the moment. But somebody has it, it\u2019s kind of like the Bible, it\u2019s going around. I hope it comes back to me one day, but it\u2019s communal, it\u2019s what I go back to. It\u2019s what a lot of people around me go back to and we always refer to it as it offers such deep healing in this climate. And I love it when it comes back andyou see people will be highlighting the things that they like, or things that jumped out to them. That\u2019s a nice little thing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
