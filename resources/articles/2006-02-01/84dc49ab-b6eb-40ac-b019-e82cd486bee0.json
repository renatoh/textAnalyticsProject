No, not the 77 gold spray-painted figures who took to the stage with Kanye West. Why, it was Radio 2's very own Jeremy Vine, who was whirling like a dervish to Paul Weller's awards-closing rendition of A Town Called Malice. He is a shoo-in for the next series of Strictly Come Dancing. \u00b7 There was an unfamiliar face in morning conference at the Berliner Zeitung newspaper on Friday. Who was the unknown woman in the corner? Step forward Anne McElvoy, fluent German speaker, former Berlin correspondent and now advising David Montgomery, the German paper's new owner. Could she be heading for the editor's chair? If so, that could make things interesting for her husband, Sunday Times deputy editor Martin Ivens. \u00b7 The BBC knows all about Capita, the company to which it has handed its prized 10-year human resources contract. The corporation already pays it half a billion pounds to collect the licence fee. Rumours that Capita is introducing a new fleet of \"shirker detector vans\" are apparently wide of the mark. \u00b7 A bunch of bananas to OK! magazine, which led a resurgent women's sector in last week's ABCs with a 20% increase in sales. Jordan's wedding to Peter Andre helped, as did a follow-up issue the following week. But the Desmond title also had an unlikely secret weapon - the nuptials of GMTV presenter Kate Garraway and spin doctor turned psychotherapist Derek Draper, which Monkey hears sold around a million copies, twice its average sale. An ITV2 reality show surely awaits. \u00b7 The ABCs were rather less kind to the original lads' mag, Loaded. A 90p price cut helped boost year-on-year sales by 5.4%, but its sales fell 2.1% in the second half of last year. Unkind hacks have suggested the magazine has featured so many covermounts of late that they should turn it into a DVD with a free magazine attached. \u00b7 Overheard: \"I wouldn't bother - we're about to buy them.\" A member of the Sky customer call centre to a viewer who called to cancel their subscription and switch to Homechoice. \u00b7 There will come a day when editors and headline writers are able to write about female newsreaders in the same way as their male counterparts. But not just yet, it seems, given last week's response to Sophie Raworth's appointment as presenter of BBC1's One O'Clock News. Raworth was the \"blonde bulletin babe\" in the Sun and \"sexy Sophie\" in the Mirror, under the headline \"Babe B C\". She was \"sensible Sophie\" in the Times while her colleague Natasha Kaplinsky had \"Six appeal\" in the Daily Mail. The Express ran a \"battle of the autocuties\" and the Evening Standard's David Mellor moaned that \"beauty beats brains again\". Monkey is grateful to Mr Mellor for pointing out that the two are mutually exclusive. \u00b7 To the Independent now, where Monkey was grateful to learn the Evening Standard had lost \"xx%\" [sic] of its sales over the last 12 months, while the Scotsman was also down \"xx%\". They must have been right xxxx-ed off. \u00b7 Citizen journalism claimed a new first at the Bafta film awards yesterday when fans armed with mobile phones were given their very own press pen outside the Odeon Leicester Square. And the name for this new breed of amateur snappers? Why, the waparazzi, of course. Sponsors Orange say they will \"roll out similar events in the future to reflect how consumers are taking a much more interactive role in major news and events\". We are sure the professional snappers will welcome their appearance with open arms. \u00b7 Monkey's quote of the week: \"Can I just say you look much better-looking on a Saturday morning when you have got gunge all over your head.\" Triple Brit award-winner and Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson to ITV's rising star Holly Willoughby."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
