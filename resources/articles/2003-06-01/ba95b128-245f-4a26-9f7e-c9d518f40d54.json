He is one of those \"citizen of the world\" musicians, but it would be unfair to listeners and to players to call his new album world music. You might call it post-rock, because some of the tracks resemble some of the more pastoral outpourings of Thrill Jockey bands and spin-offs such as Tortoise and the Chicago Underground duo. There's even a touch of Lambchop, or the Brian Wilson band in instrumental mode, with Kang's quirky use of a large, non-classical, non-jazz ensemble. Virginal Co-ordinates (ReR, \u00a313.99), recorded live in Bologna, is performed by the winds, strings and rhythm section of the 16-piece Italian outfit Playground, augmented by vocalist Mike Patton, guitarist Tim Young, plus Michael White (who played with Sun Ra) and the composer on violins. But a term like post-rock implies that there is a \"rock\" to come after, and I'm not sure that's the case with Kang, whose musical roots and downtown track record (Bill Frisell, Laurie Anderson) give him a more complex and hybrid back story than most of the twangers and tweakers in the neighbourhood. His melodies tend to be stately and moving, sweet with a dash of sourness. Electronics are used to sustain the predominantly acoustic timbres, and Patton's breathy singing, on tracks such as I Am the Dead and Innocent Eye, Crystal See, is more like pop, evoking memories of Bowie's Low and Jim O'Rourke. The 19-minute Doorway to the Sun sounds a bit like Syd Barrett jamming along with the Shanghai Film Orchestra's version of Terry Riley's in C. It's typical - you wait all year for a new Henry Threadgill album, and then two turn up at once. Up Popped the Two Lips (Pi Recordings) by Henry Threadgill's Zooid and Everybody's Mouth's a Book (Pi Recordings, both \u00a313.99) by Threadgill and Make a Move are something of an event. When I interviewed Steely Dan, the normally languid Donald Fagen suddenly became very excited at the prospect of going to a pub in New York to see Threadgill. His bandmate Walter Becker added that his playing was \"a revelation\". This was a surprise. Talk to the Dan guys about jazz and they seem in mourning for the classic age of bebop, over a long time ago; most of their heroes are dead. Threadgill, seen as avant-garde in some quarters, is a good composer and a strong soloist on both alto sax and flute, but he is a long way from the groove-based, ear-friendly harmonies of Steely Dan or the gentle undulations of Eyvind Kang. Perhaps it would be better to say that Threadgill is an unapologetic modernist, continuing some of the 1960s initiatives of Eric Dolphy and Ornette Coleman into the 21st century and hammering them into a robust compositional and rhythmic framework. The music that results is less obviously \"American\" than that of many of his contemporaries, but it doesn't sound particularly European either. The Zooid set, recorded just a few months after the other, more electric album, is mysterious and spacious, using a line-up of oud (Tarik Benbrahim), acoustic guitar, tuba, cello and drums. There is a constant dialogue between Threadgill, playing snaky lead lines on sax or flute, and the restless young Cuban drummer Dafnis Prieto. The Prieto-Threadgill conversation dominates Everybody's Mouth's a Book, too, but the rest of the line-up is different, with Bryan Carrott, a fine vibes player, bassist Stomu Takeishi and guitarist Brandon Ross, whose skewed approach and sound is occasionally reminiscent of Frisell's earlier, thrashier work. This is probably the closest Threadgill will ever get to rock'n'roll."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
