She is Lesley Howell\u2019s daughter. We apologise for the error. (\u201cWhen true-crime TV drama only adds to the pain\u201d, last week, page 37). Seamus O\u2019Mahony, of University College, Cork, was confused with Seamus O\u2019Mahony of Cork University hospital when selecting an image of the author of \u201cWe doctors can\u2019t prescribe a \u2018good death\u2019\u201d (Comment, last week, page 36). Apologies. In our Books pages last week, we used a picture purporting to show Robert Coombes, convicted of murder in 1895, with his brother Nattie. However, the book, The Wicked Boy, does not include the picture as the identity of the boys cannot be verified (\u201cAnatomy of a little monster\u201d, New Review, last week, p37). In \u201cBallads for a lost Utopia\u201d (New Review, last week, page 12) some quotes about growing up in Skelmersdale were drawn from an article by writer Caroline Christie and inadvertently attributed to The Magnetic North\u2019s Simon Tong. Apologies.
