The commissioner, speaking in San Francisco ahead of Sunday\u2019s Super Bowl, said the NFL had made \u201cgreat progress\u201d around concussion, despite a flurry of recent research that underlines the link between football and long-term health problems. Goodell said: \u201c[The] concussion issue is something we have been focused on for several decades. We continue to make rule changes in our game to make our game safer and decrease the probability of injuries.\u201d Goodell said the barrage of negative headlines would not stop him encouraging his children to take up the game. \u201cFrom my standpoint, I played the game of football for nine years, through high school. I wouldn\u2019t give up a single day of that,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had a son, I\u2019d love to have him play the game of football. I\u2019d love to have him play the game of football because of the values you get. \u201cThere\u2019s risk in life. There\u2019s risk sitting on the couch. What we want to do is get people active. I want them to experience the game of football because the game of football will teach you the values \u2026 the discipline, the teamwork, the perseverance. Those are values and those are skills that will lead you through life, and I believe football is the best to teach that.\u201d \u201cThere will be a new helmet coming out this season,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cWhich I think is going to be a very positive step in trying to get better protection.\u201d Goodell also pledged \u201cto do everything possible\u201d to help teams in Oakland and San Diego work to get new stadiums in their current markets \u2013 and confirmed that a regular-season game will be played in Mexico City next season. He said he was trying to \u201cfind a solution that works for everybody.\u201d The Chargers and the Raiders have threatened to leave their current cities, with LA and Las Vegas among possible destinations. Goodell insisted the league has the Raiders\u2019 and Chargers\u2019 best interests at heart. \u201cThe league supports both of these teams, and we are working very hard with not only the teams but the communities,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has to work for the communities, and it has to work for the teams long-term.\u201d The Rams have moved to Los Angeles from St Louis starting in the 2016 season. The Chargers will play in San Diego in 2016, but chairman Dean Spanos has an option to join the Rams at a new stadium being built in Inglewood if the city and team can\u2019t work out a deal. The Raiders also wanted to move to Los Angeles, but owner Mark Davis may look at other cities if the franchise can\u2019t work out a stadium deal with Oakland. \u201cI think it\u2019s great that Dean Spanos and his family said, \u2018We want to make this work in San Diego,\u201d Goodell said. \u201cThey have an incredibly attractive option in Los Angeles but they decided that [they are] going to go and try to make this work in San Diego, and we will do everything we can to support that. The same\u2019s true for Mark Davis. Mark Davis has a lot of options.\u201d Goodell confirmed the Raiders and Texans will play a Monday night game on November 21 in Mexico City, the first regular-season game in Mexico since 2005."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
