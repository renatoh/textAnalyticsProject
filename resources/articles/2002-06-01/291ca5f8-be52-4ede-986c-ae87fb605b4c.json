There were about a hundred of them and they all wore red T-shirts and headbands. They chanted and sang with a kind of smiling ferocity that redoubled its vigour whenever anyone who looked like an English supporter came into view. Exactly a month ago, in the hours before England played South Korea in a warm-up game in a beautiful new stadium in Seogwipo on the island of Jeju, it was the first small sign of what this World Cup might be like. \"Be the Reds\" was the slogan emblazoned on their shirts and scarves. It seemed funny at first, just one of those mangled bits of misunderstood vernacular English so prevalent in these parts. Now we know better. Now we know that it proclaimed an existential truth. For one of the reasons the South Korean team have been able to lay waste to the dreams of grandees such as Portugal and Italy is the sheer single-mindedness of the players and their fans. They really are the Reds, every one of them. The second sign came an hour before the game, when the crowd was entertained by a couple of matches between teams of local 11-year-olds. And entertained was the right word, if you like football featuring neat and accurate passing, shrewd running into space, the odd backheel or dummy when absolutely necessary and high-grade finishing. If there is football of that quality being played by 11-year-old boys anywhere in England, then the Football Association's technical director would probably like to be told about it. Whoever is coaching these little Koreans certainly knows his job and understands how to instil discipline and technique without suppressing enjoyment. After that impressive demonstration it was no surprise to see the senior team come out and display similar strengths, writ large, in their 1-1 draw against England. The stars of the Premiership found themselves being hustled at every turn, and the impression made that evening by Korea's athletic and skilful pressing game was to be confirmed when the tournament itself began. Four weeks later, after watching them blast Italy's hopes to smithereens, the question has to be asked: who can stop the Fighting Reds? And, if it turns out that no one can, then what does this World Cup mean for the future of football? The looming presence of Senegal in the other half of the draw redoubles the significance of the question. The Lions of Teranga may not possess the overwhelming physical force of the Koreans but it would be no surprise to see them go further in this contest, thanks to their combination of a highly committed defence and talented, expressive individuals in midfield and attack. As the coaches of Senegal and South Korea respectively, Bruno Metsu and Guus Hiddink have clearly performed as brilliantly as any player here. Such is the unpredictable nature of this tournament, however, that it might just as easily be Turkey and the United States, the other two outsiders in the last eight, who continue to upset the old order by making further progress. Even if the final turns out to be between Germany and England or Brazil - in other words, between the only countries left in the contest who have won it before - the 2002 World Cup may still have marked a shift in the balance of power, away from the traditional powers and towards football's emerging nations. And why not? The game has been spreading ever since a British railway engineer named Charles Miller arrived in Brazil with a couple of footballs one day in 1894 and started a craze which caught on so widely that in time it came to define a vast nation's sense of its own identity. Even though there are many people who hope that the outcome of this tournament will not give the United States an excuse to extend its hegemony into one area of the world which has been resistant to its influence, in more general terms there is no reason for that spread to stop now. Facilities and resources - from balls and boots to goalposts and itinerant coaches - are now within the grasp of far more countries, thanks to Fifa's development schemes and to the reach of multinational corporations for whom new markets are more interesting than mature ones. There is more scope for selling trainers, replica shirts and isotonic drinks to two billion Chinese than to the nations of western Europe. In football terms even the United States counts as an area of underdevelopment. A bigger factor, however, is the levelling-up of standards at the professional level, for which there are several explanations. One is the number of players from nations like Senegal, Cameroon, Japan, Turkey and the US who are now working in the world's long-established major leagues. While spending time in Serie A, the Bundesliga, the French and Spanish leagues and the Premiership, they absorb an understanding of how the game works at the highest level and accustom themselves to the emotional climate in which it operates. This World Cup has been marked by an almost total absence of the sort of naivety that broke the nerve of Mwepu Ilunga of Zaire in the 1974 tournament, causing him to dash out of the defensive wall and belt the ball away before his astonished Brazilian opponents had time to take a free-kick. Another is the higher standard of available coaching. Football knowledge is shared around the world surprisingly freely, which is why Howard Wilkinson was able to pay visits to the advanced training facilities of Dynamo Kiev and the French football federation while planning the layout of the FA's forthcoming technical centre. As a result, young coaches of the present generation are the product of learning systems based on the best available models. Everywhere the emphasis is on pace, fitness, responsibility, a sense of tactical shape and an ability to make a quick decision when the ball arrives. What Hiddink's South Koreans are producing is nothing more or less than a new version of the late Valery Lobanovsky's doctrine of \"collective speed\", uprated to take account of better physical conditioning and mental preparation. In effect, the world is on the way to becoming one big Clairefontaine, which makes it particularly poignant that, having spent the last few years giving the world free lessons in how to prepare players and coaches for international competition, France itself should become the first victim of the new order. Five days before meeting Senegal in the fateful opening match Roger Lemerre gave an interview in which he claimed that his players were \"protected by a culture of victory\". Now the French coach knows exactly where that kind of complacent assumption gets you, and everybody with any sense has also absorbed the lesson - everybody, that is, except the wretched Italians, who will spend the next four years bleating about how they were robbed and failing to recognise the reality of a force that has galvanised the rest of the football world in these past three weeks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
