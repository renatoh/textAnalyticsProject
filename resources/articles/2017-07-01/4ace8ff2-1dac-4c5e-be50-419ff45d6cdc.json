Barry McGuigan, the fight\u2019s promoter, told the BBC: \u201cWe\u2019re all so disappointed, it was a freak accident. He slipped in the shower, smashed his face, the guy is concussed. He\u2019s a deep gash on his chin, his nose, lost two of his teeth.\u201d An earlier statement on McGuigan\u2019s Facebook page said: \u201cIt is hoped that the event will be re-scheduled but ticket holders are advised to retain their tickets and contact point of purchase for further information.\u201d The 30-year-old Frampton, once a world champion at featherweight and super-bantamweight, had been priming himself to fight in his home city for what might have been the final time. Earlier in the day he realised it would no longer serve as an eliminator for the WBC featherweight title for him after he came in one pound overweight at 9st 1lb. He is coming out of a six-month lay-off which followed his first professional defeat, by another Mexican, L\u00e9o Santa Cruz, in Las Vegas. Frampton has made no secret of his desire to face Santa Cruz for a third time, or to challenge Wales\u2019s IBF champion, Lee Selby. His trainer, Shane McGuigan, has said the \u201cfinish line\u201d is in sight for him despite only 24 professional fights. McGuigan, speaking to the Irish media before the now cancelled Guti\u00e9rrez bout, said: \u201cWe feel Saturday night is the next chapter in Carl\u2019s career and one I\u2019m excited about, because we can see the finish line now. \u201cIt\u2019s like running a marathon and you can see that 20-mile mark and you\u2019ve got around six miles to go. The legs are a bit heavy but we\u2019re going to finish strong with four or five big wins.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
