But it isn't. It's been raining since October, it's too cold to kiss outdoors and, instead of pretty paintings, Paris is being confronted with Under the Influence, Gillian Wearing's harrowing videos teeming with alcoholics and childhood traumas. Wearing's first French solo show starts with a self-portrait, with the artist in a mask that apparently closely resembles the real Wearing, thereby raising interesting questions about self-presentation and the consumption of images that recur throughout the show. It's oddly dislocating to see this Birmingham-born artist's work in Paris. One struggles not to unwontedly interpret her works as mere expressions of a very British malaise. That's how the French like to see us - two parts Ken Loach, one part barmy royal family, a dash of crazy livestock and an overwhelming sense that horrible things happen there without so much as a by-your-leave. Wearing's art fits into this image of Britain. But each installation confounds this interpretation and insists on Wearing's universality. For me, the best work is the trilogy made during her two- year collaboration with a community of south London alcoholics. In the first, a woman recounts the death of her alcoholic twin sister. It's sometimes tender, the disjunction between this woman's speech and her image a poignant way of underlining her own alcoholism without judgment. (She has since died of cirrhosis.) In a middle section, a gang of drunk men spar - another abject ballet that could happen anywhere but that Wearing was able to capture. In the last, one of the men lies dead drunk. The show is juxtaposed with the cunning video art of Swede Ann-Sofi Siden. In Britain, her interviews with prostitutes would make just another docusoap. Here, you sit in one of a line of booths listening on headphones to a prostitute's life story. You feel intimate with the subject and yet, at the same time, like a voyeur - not least because when you look down the line of booths where art lovers sit complicit, you realise the gallery has been transformed into a cultural peep show. Why do we come to galleries to feed on others' strife and give nothing back? Like Wearing, Siden makes going to see art a problematic, painful experience. \u0095 Until May 6.
