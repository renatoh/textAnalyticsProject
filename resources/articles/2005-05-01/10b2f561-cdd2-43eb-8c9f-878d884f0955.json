Instead, he seemed strangely silent on the subject, even when pressed. Finally, when he refused to deny I was the worst assistant he'd had in 30 years, I began to suspect he was not that impressed. Quietly horrified, it transpires. Thus assessed, I demanded a tutorial on the task I was performing: banging in nails. \"You have to hit them straight, right in the centre, whereas you hit them off to the side,\" said Karsan, clearly relieved to unburden himself. \"Like snooker - if you hit the ball in the middle, it goes straight into the hole. If you hit it to the side, it misses. You always hit them at an angle, which is why they bend.\" Admittedly, some nails were getting bent, but that I put down to knots in the wood. Knots are submerged follicles of branches, which Karsan blames whenever he bends a nail, which is rare. I bend them often. Sometimes while I'm huffing and puffing, trying to pull out a bent one, he takes my claw hammer, pulls it out like it's stuck in butter, straightens it, then bangs it back into the same hole with a couple of deft swings. Then he wordlessly returns my hammer. His technique is to swing the hammer with a loose wrist and starting at an angle of 45 degrees to the nail, finishing the swing with the head of the nail in perfectly square contact with the sweet spot - where the tool sings - of the hammer head. Two or three hits, and the nail disappears. Mostly, my nails wobble and shrivel until they are irretrievably crooked, but after a few days' practice, some were going in like Karsan's. \"You waste 10%, I waste 1%,\" said Karsan by way of encouragement. I just need another 30 years' practice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
