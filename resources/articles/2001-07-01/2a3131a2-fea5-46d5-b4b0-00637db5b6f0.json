Fast-bowling totem Glenn McGrath led the Antipodean charge, ably supported by his two underlings, Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie, to leave England 121-4 at the close. Sent into bat by Steve Waugh on a grey and gloomy day after losing their ninth successive toss, England had to battle against helpful bowling conditions, frequent interruptions in play and the potent bowling of arguably the best side ever to play the game. As the players left the field at 5:45pm on 91-2 they would have been satisfied with their days work, but, as ever, the Australian's had the final word. Forced to return by the improved light, McGrath struck a fatal blow, trapping Michael Atherton lbw for 37. Atherton had looked relatively untroubled in his 92 ball innings, hooking and driving with great authority, but was deceived into not playing a shocker by a ball that jagged to end his innings. His dismissal opened the latest chapter in Mark Ramprakash's England career and the Surrey man looked neat and well ordered as he always does, especially on the front foot. He did not get forward quickly enough to Brett Lee however, and the fastest bowler in world cricket knocked back his middle stump for 14, to leave Australia in command. Throughout the day England endeavoured to play positive cricket and all their batsman got starts. Only three overs were possible before lunch as rain and bad light combined to ruin the morning session. After resuming on 11-0 England continued to try and exploit Steve Waugh's ultra-attacking field. Marcus Trescothick, circumspect against the metronomic accuracy of Glenn McGrath, looked to dominate Jason Gillespie in particular, but was unable to repeat his second-innings heroics at Edgbaston. The Somerset opener, who gave a sharp chance to Mark Waugh at second slip in the morning, was lucky to survive as long as he did. He drove Gillespie within inches of Steve Waugh at gully in the fourth over and edged the Aussie paceman through the vacant fourth slip area two overs later; his luck ran out when he flashed at a wide one for Adam Gilchrist to take a straight-forward catch at the wicket. Trescothick's dismissal was a double blow for England. Not only was his shot unnecessary and irresponsible in the circumstances, but the replay showed the delivery to be a no-ball; Gillespie having overstepped. Once again England were victims of an umpiring oversight. Mark Butcher also tapped into this positive mindset and he drove Gillespie for two fours on either side of the wicket in his first over at the crease. Shane Warne's introduction into any attack is usually a sign that things are about to happen and it was no different today. His first delivery was short and wide, and contemptuously swatted away by Mark Butcher for four, while his second went for four byes. By his second over though, Warne had regained his usual control and began beguilling Butcher as he had done at Edgbaston. He failed to pick Warne's top-spinnner, edging past Mark Waugh at first-slip, and when the rain came for the second time it was Butcher who looked most relieved. The player's returned to the field at 4:50pm with 34 overs remaining, and Butcher immediately hit Lee for two fours, but the return of McGrath to the attack brought his downfall. McGrath's first three balls were straight enough but didn't move much off the pitch, but his fourth angled away down the notorious Lord's slope, leading Butcher to give Mark Waugh his second catch at second-slip. Waugh's clean take brought him his 157th catch in Test cricket, a world record for dismissals he shares with former Australian captain Mark Taylor. McGrath loves bowling at Lord's - he took a career best 8-38 here in 1997 - and he will be relishing the opportunity to England off tomorrow. Messeurs Thorpe, Stewart and Ward have a lot of work to do if the Ashes are to stay alive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
