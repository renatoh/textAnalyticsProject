I think it would be moving. But then, what do I know?\" \u2013 a question which, sadly, proves a little more apt than the writer intended: Peggy Archer isn't Ambridge's apiarist, as the writer had just suggested. Jill Archer is. As soaps go, The Archers goes slower than most. Last month, David Archer was counting owls. This month, worms. Next month, he may be counting his toes and, considering Ambridge's isolation, coming up with an unusual number. I find no fault with this innocent preoccupation. However, this month life burst in on Ambridge when Lee Mason, the volatile striker of Felpersham City, held his 21st-birthday celebrations at Grey Gables, a country hotel better known for its deathly quiet and paucity of customers. Football is unfamiliar territory to Ambridge, whose chosen sport (and don't we know it) is cricket, so they were wholly unprepared for a footballer's idea of a good night out. (\"They aren't half getting through the champagne and it's gone half past eleven!\") At this fraught point, Felpersham City's striker punched Grey Gables' chef in the eye \u2013 not, as you might expect, for his vol au vents, but for his sexual orientation. (Cries of \"What the hell's going on?\" \"Pass me the first aid!\" and \"I'm going to call the police!\") That faint clicking noise you can hear, barely audible above the raucous singing and the breaking glass, is the sound of Borsetshire Life's photographer taking pictures. It's all a sad change from the days when Jack Woolley owned Grey Gables and Borsetshire Life. Jack was the brightest businessman in Ambridge but his Alzheimer's is now so serious he must go into what Dame Edna calls a maximum-security twilight home for the bewildered. O dark, dark, dark. They all go into the dark. The captains, bankers, eminent men of letters . . . His wife Peggy keeps bees, and it's said you should tell the bees about any significant change in the family or they will take offence and leave. Peggy has loved Jack in sickness and in health and, when he goes, I'd like to hear her tell the bees about it. I think it would be moving. But then, what do I know?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
