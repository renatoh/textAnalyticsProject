While animated offerings such as Danish Hans Christian Anderson retooling The Ugly Duckling And Me! are easily re-dubbed into English, live-action fare is more problematic as studios seem to think that kids aren't willing to \"read\" a film. So a chance to prove them wrong comes with screenings of teen comedy Triple Dare and junior Da Vinci Code yarn The Lost Treasure Of The Knights Templar (both Danish), Thai school ghost thriller Dorm, and Dead In Three Days, a kind of Austrian teen version of The Ring. There's much more: a parents and babies showing of Dirty Dancing, workshops on anime and Machinima, a one-day film challenge, and the popular Leeds National Young Film-makers Awards. \u00b7 Vue Kirkstall and various venues, Thu 29 to Apr 6, www.leedsfilm.com A Rendez-Vous with French Cinema, London Twelve films in four days representing the best and most recent efforts of French cinema - with the added benefit of personal appearances from cast and crew.
