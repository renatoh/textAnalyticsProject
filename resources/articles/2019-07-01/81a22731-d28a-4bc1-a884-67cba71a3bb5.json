Darroch chose to step down as the country\u2019s envoy in Washington on Wednesday amid a diplomatic row over leaked diplomatic cables that showed him criticising Donald Trump. Johnson, a former foreign secretary, was accused of throwing Darroch \u201cunder the bus\u201d after he refused to say he would leave him in place if he became prime minister during a Tory leadership debate on Tuesday. At a Tory leadership hustings on Thursday evening, Johnson claimed he fully supports Darroch, saying he had spoken to him to convey his regret, adding that the former envoy had been the \u201cvictim of a very unpleasant stunt\u201d in the leaking of his memos. Asked about his refusal to offer such effusive support before Darroch chose to step down, Johnson said he did not think that \u201cissues of personnel in our civil service should become footballs in political conversations\u201d. Earlier he was heavily criticised by fellow Tory MPs over his role Darroch\u2019s decision to resign, with one backbencher saying the frontrunner in the Conservative leadership contest should come to the Commons to apologise. An urgent question in the Commons about Darroch\u2019s departure resulted in repeated condemnation of Johnson, and only one Conservative MP came to his defence. The criticism was based on Johnson\u2019s choice of language in Tuesday\u2019s debate, even as his leadership rival, the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, said he would expect the ambassador to stay in post until his planned retirement. In a shock move that prompted the senior civil servant at the Foreign Office to call an all-staff meeting to reassure \u201cshaken\u201d diplomats, Darroch announced on Wednesday morning that he could no longer continue in his role in the wake of the leak. Adding to the likely discomfort for Johnson, the Foreign Office minister sent out to respond to the urgent question for the government was Sir Alan Duncan, who on Wednesday accused him of \u201cthrowing Darroch under the bus\u201d. Asked about Duncan\u2019s comments at the Maidstone hustings, Johnson said: \u201cThere has certainly been an attempt to politicise this issue and to take the career prospects of Sir Kim and turn them into an issue in the Conservative party leadership contest, I notice that. I don\u2019t think that should happen \u2026 I don\u2019t think that issues of personnel in our civil service should become footballs in political conversation.\u201d In the hustings on Thursday, Johnson was also forced on to the defensive over whether he was too deferential to Trump. He said that there were reasons to believe Britain\u2019s relationship with the United States was the \u201csingle most important strategic fact of our times\u201d. But he said he had criticised Trump before and would do so again if needed. \u201cI criticised him as foreign secretary,\u201d he said. Earlier, in the Commons, the most vehement criticism came from David Morris, the Conservative MP for Morecambe and Lunesdale, who condemned Johnson for failing to fully back Darroch. Darroch is understood to have made the decision to resign after watching Johnson repeatedly declining to offer his support in the Tuesday\u2019s debate. \u201cDo you not feel that it is incumbent on every member of parliament in this place to back up our excellent diplomats and civil servants, and the honourable member for Uxbridge should come to the house and apologise?\u201d Morris asked. Other Conservatives expressed similar views, with Roger Gale telling the Commons: \u201cThe failure of the former foreign secretary to leap to the defence of Sir Kim shows a lack of leadership that is lamentable.\u201d The Tory MP Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Commons foreign affairs committee, was less direct, but made his feelings known, saying the loss of Darroch after Trump\u2019s comments amounted to the UK being bullied. Tugendhat said the government should \u201calways stand up for those we send abroad, military or civilian, and will back them to the point that is necessary in the interests of the British people, and no one else\u201d. The only support for Johnson came from the veteran Tory backbencher Peter Bone, who said: \u201cThe attacking of colleagues is completely wrong and people should be ashamed of themselves when they\u2019ve done that.\u201d The urgent question was tabled by Labour\u2019s Pat McFadden, who said the decision of Darroch to resign, despite having the full support of Theresa May and her cabinet, was \u201ca dark moment for our democracy and for the standing of the United Kingdom\u201d. McFadden said Johnson\u2019s lack of support for the envoy was \u201can appalling abandonment of someone in the firing line\u201d. He added: \u201cReal leaders protect their people. They don\u2019t throw them to the wolves because they can sniff a prize for themselves. His actions are a chilling warning of what is to come if he becomes prime minister.\u201d Duncan said he would not be responding to such views on Johnson: \u201cI hope the house will understand if I hold back today from making any further comment on the right honourable friend the member for Uxbridge. I said enough yesterday to make my position entirely clear.\u201d Duncan nonetheless managed to reiterate his condemnation of Johnson several times in ways varying from the coded to the open. Responding to one question, he replied: \u201cIt is everyone\u2019s duty, and everyone in this house\u2019s duty, to defend our ambassadors. They are our ambassadors, doing our duty. If they do something terribly wrong or break all the rules, that\u2019s altogether different.\u201d Duncan later drew laughter after the Liberal Democrat deputy leader, Jo Swinson, cited his description of Johnson\u2019s actions as \u201cthe behaviour of an utter wimp\u201d. \u201cI seem to recall that was one of the kinder words I used yesterday,\u201d Duncan told MPs, adding: \u201cI think what I would rather do is concentrate on the specific details of the question put, the merits of Sir Kim Darroch rather than the \u2026 merits of anyone else.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
