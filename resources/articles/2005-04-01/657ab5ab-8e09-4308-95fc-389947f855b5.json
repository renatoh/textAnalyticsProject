But two years after US troops pulled down the statue of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad, there are signs of hope that Iraq is finally turning the corner. The number of US casualties, the scale of militant attacks and the amount of civilian blood spilt have been reduced sharply from the peak in January and February ... \"Above all, the allies will have to know when to withdraw. If they leave too quickly, they will embolden the insurgents; if they stay too long, they will erode the legitimacy of elected Iraqi leaders who will be seen as American stooges. These matters will be debated by George Bush and the occupant of Downing Street next month. For the moment, let us celebrate the fact that this spring the buds of Iraqi democracy have a better chance of survival.\" USA Today Editorial, April 8 \"After two blood-soaked years, hopeful signs are finally emerging that the twin pieces needed for Iraq to begin functioning - a stable government and a grip on the insurgency - may still be salvageable ... \"[But] the US remains a long way from 'mission accomplished'. Training enough Iraqi forces to the point where they can take over security from the 130,000 US troops will take many more months or years. Still, there are signs the Iraqis have been performing better of late ... Good news can evaporate in a flash. But the toppled Saddam statue hasn't yet lost its positive potency ... A little luck, determination to stay the course - and a clear-eyed grasp of the realities - can restore the promise of that moment.\" Independent Editorial, April 12 \"There can be no doubt that the overall situation in Iraq is much improved ... Iraq [now] has a chance of becoming a democracy. [But] To conclude from this that military action was justified ... is a conclusion far too far. The war in Iraq was begun on intelligence that proved to be 'dead wrong' - in the words of the latest US investigation - and in defiance of the UN ... The price for our war in Iraq has been the lives of tens of thousands of Iraqis, more than 1,500 US servicemen and more than 80 Britons. The price has been the devastation of Iraq and the violation of the most basic human rights ... The price has been new hotbeds of terrorism ... \"In recent weeks, a Pakistani diplomat was kidnapped for ransom; two suicide attacks were carried out against US bases; there were assaults by insurgents on Abu Ghraib prison. That all this makes for a good month in Iraq is a sad commentary on all that went before.\" Gulf News Editorial, United Arab Emirates, April 10 \"Iraq remains ... a nation under siege. The decades-long dictatorship has been replaced with an endless cycle of violence. Iraq still reels under an occupation ... A quarter of the population, according to the UN, is totally dependent on food rations, 27% of children under five are malnourished, unemployment falls anywhere between 25% and 50%, and the total number of civilian deaths since March 2003, is estimated to be no less than 15,000 and may be in the range of 100,000 ... \"Two years on, the process of experimenting with democracy should end. Now it is time to move on to the next stage and the first step is to sustain peace and calm.\" Al-Quds al-Arabi Editorial, pan-Arab, April 9 \"The new Iraq is a corrupt, racist and sectarian Iraq which has done nothing but undermine its identity, divide its people, threaten their national unity and kill thousands of its children. The new Iraq was built on a lie, and the WMD fabrication. Anything built on a lie will be nothing but a lie.\" Via BBC Monitoring Wall Street Journal Editorial, US, April 12 \"We have made great progress toward achieving our original strategic goals in Iraq, with positive ripple effects throughout the Middle East ... [Yet] the US effort nearly came undone: not because of this or that tactical misstep, but because too many among America's elite lost their nerve when the going got tough ... \"As we wrote at the onset of war, in March 2003, 'Toppling Saddam is a long-term undertaking' and 'The largest risk is an imponderable: Whether Americans can generate the political consensus to sustain involvement in Iraq.' Two years later we know the answer to that question is yes, thanks to the fortitude and wisdom of a president, our soldiers and the American public. Maybe next time, our best and brightest will show the same character.\" Die Welt Editorial, Germany, April 12 \"The time is right not only to hold out the prospect of the gradual withdrawal but to begin it as well. An elected government is forming in Iraq, the training of Iraqi security forces is making good progress, and slowly the Iraqis are able to reassume control of their country and to take responsibility themselves ... \"Neither the US nor the new Iraqi leadership wants immediate total withdrawal. A carefully measured withdrawal, however, is not a triumph of the Islamist fanatics but would even take away the main motivation for their resistance.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
