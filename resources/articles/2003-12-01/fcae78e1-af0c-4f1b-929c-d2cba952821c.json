Desert Orchid was the even-money favourite for the King George VI Chase at Kempton, and no end of credit-card Christmases were riding on his stout grey back. But Doumen's chaser Nupsala beat him, at 25-1, and the trainer might as well have walked in front of the stands shouting: \"Hello Britain. I'm here. Get used to it.\" And over the course of another decade, we did. Doumen brought The Fellow across the Channel to win the King George in 1991 and 1992, and then Algan in 1994. When First Gold ran away with the race by 10 lengths in 2000, Doumen had secured the King George for the fifth time in 14 years. These days, British punters know and trust the clever, immaculate man from Normandy who once beat their great favourite, but now turns out winners at a strike-rate that everyone can appreciate. At last weekend's Ascot meeting he saddled two runners, Krach and the champion staying hurdler Baracouda, and both were winners. Year after year, the returns from Doumen's occasional trips to Britain confirm that his runners never go to post without a serious chance. A second King George for First Gold on Friday, though, would arguably be his finest achievement yet, if only because the horse lost his way so completely within four months of the first. On April 27, 2001, First Gold unseated his jockey when 8-13 favourite for a Grade One chase at Sandown, and his next seven outings over the course of almost two years brought nothing but disappointment. When he was tailed off and pulled up in the Gold Cup nine months ago, at odds of 33-1, it looked like the end. The transformation in First Gold's form since then has been remarkable, so much so that he will start as the solid second favourite behind his fellow French challenger, Jair Du Cochet, on Friday. Blinkered for the first time in the Martell Cup at Aintree, he made the running and won by 14 lengths. Four weeks later, he repeated the trick in the Heineken Gold Cup at Punchestown. Doumen is modest about his part in First Gold's revival. \"The blinkers may have been a plus, but it is simply that the horse had a muscle disorder that has now been put right,\" he says. \"Even when he ran at Cheltenham he was going very well and was just behind Best Mate when he made a bad mistake and Thierry [Doumen, his jockey] thought it was best to pull him up. \"He won the French Gold Cup at five, and the Martell and the Punchestown Group One at 10. Horses have problems sometimes, and you can't keep them top, top, top for five years.\" The immediate question for punters is whether First Gold will reproduce the same level of form at Kempton, and the only public evidence of his well-being since Punchestown is a running-on fifth place in a hurdle race at Auteuil late last month. Doumen, though, sounds confident. \"The horse is back to his best, as you will see at Kempton,\" Doumen says. \"The last two races last season were good enough for me to know that. \"There is no special reason why we have won this race so often, it is just a case of needing the right horse for the right race and the King George comes at the right time for French horses at the end of their season. For First Gold, this is the right race.\" Doumen arrived in training relatively late, at the age of 37, though his father, Jean, was a jockey and trainer for more than 50 years. In the 1970s, the desire to train thoroughbreds called his son back to France from South Africa, where he was running a clothing business, having previously studied veterinary science. One long-standing client at his yard is Sir Peter O'Sullevan, who first met Doumen on his initial visit to Kempton with Nupsala. \"Francois is a very bright man who has been associated with horses all his life and has learned everything that one can assimilate on the way,\" O'Sullevan says. \"He's very patient, and he's very fond of his horses, he has a great sympathy and feel for them. \"I think that's important in his success. He's very attached to his horses, and he's very much inclined to do the right thing by them. \"He has had widespread international success too, and it's amazing the way that he gets them to adapt to travel. These horses that come over from France don't come by any luxury route, they come on a ferry when the sea can be rough, and when Jim And Tonic won three big races in Hong Kong, that emphasised Francois' talent for getting a horse to peak at the right time.\" O'Sullevan well remembers the reaction when the blinkered, unheard-of Nupsala strode away from Desert Orchid. \"At the time,\" he says, \"that was not a permissible action.\" Sixteen years later, though, tens of thousands of punters will place their faith in the Doumen magic at Kempton. This is one case where familiarity has bred anything but contempt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
