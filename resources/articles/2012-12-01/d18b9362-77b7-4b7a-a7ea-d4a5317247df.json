But as it was a gathering of newspaper editors, only a solitary cameraman waited while the Delaunay declaration was being agreed. Nevertheless, whatever the lack of fanfare, the outcome of the Delaunay meeting was rightly described as remarkable by the Independent's editor, Chris Blackhurst, afterwards. The judicial inquiry is over and despite the noise made by politicians, campaigners and industry representatives, it is the editors of normally vigorously competing titles who are taking the lead. These are people not used to having people speak for them, which is perhaps why Lord Hunt, the chairman of the Press Complaints Commission has been reined in. The Conservative peer-turned-regulator had seemed to be behaving as if the Leveson report was little more than a noisy interruption to his attempts to build a new regulator: some of those present were unamused to read in the Financial Times on Wednesday that Hunt was hoping to appoint board members and staff this week. Against that backdrop, it is hard to imagine Hunt continuing in the job once the new regulator is created. But because there is nobody else obvious to take on the work, he will have the task of creating the new body and maintaining day-to-day relationships with ministers. For now at least, Hunt has a template to work to \u2013 a menu from the judge as endorsed over the bacon rolls and ketchup. That template amounts to what could be the beginning of the end of the discredited model of self-regulation, and the agreement in principle is to create an independent body, with a chair appointed by a board \u2013 a majority of whom are separate from the press. The proposed body will have the power to handle complaints, direct corrections, initiate investigations, levy fines of up to \u00a31m and, if the government can play its part, run a cheap libel and privacy tribunal system that takes over the functions of the courts. Editors even agreed to allow the new regulator to set up a whistleblowing hotline for journalists who believe they are being asked to breach the editors code of practice, and for the industry to consider introducing a \"conscience clause\" to the effect that no journalist would be subject to disciplinary action if they refused to breach the code. Whether these will be an effective restraint against over-mighty editors is debatable, but it is hard to argue there has not been a serious attempt at reform. There are issues to be resolved. How, for example, Oliver Letwin, David Cameron's fixer, proposes to audit the quality of the new regulator without resorting to a statutory body and how he can make the courts recognise the libel and privacy tribunal planned. There is considerable anxiety too about how far to allow so-called third party complaints, amid concern that the new regulator will become bogged down with politicised complaints from pressure groups. And most importantly, somebody of sane mind has to be enthusiastic enough to act as chair. Yet the speed at which a settlement has been reached risks leaving Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband and press reform campaigners trailing. Cameron's statute-free response to Leveson for the moment looks like the right one, as long as all major newspapers do sign up and until \u2013 or if \u2013 a fresh newspaper scandal comes along."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
