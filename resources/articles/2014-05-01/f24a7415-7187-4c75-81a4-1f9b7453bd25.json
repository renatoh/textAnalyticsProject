The Ukip leader tweeted that the attack on the home of Gerard Batten, in which a brick was thrown through his living room window, was a \"direct consequence\" of the media campaign against his party. Farage spoke out after Batten reported that a brick was thrown through his living room windown in the early hours of Tuesday morning. The Ukip leader tweeted a link to the Nope, Not Hope website which said that Batten and his wife were woken by a loud noise at 3.30am. They found nothing but were woken again 45 minutes later by another loud bang and the sound of breaking glass. The website reported: \"There was no mistaking the cause this time, as on coming downstairs to investigate they discovered a house brick in the middle of their living room and their living room window smashed. Police are investigating and reviewing local CCTV footage. This is just the latest in a string of increasingly heated attacks on Ukip supporters.\" The Nope, Not Hope website is a play on the Hope Not Hate anti-racism group. The group is consulting its lawyers after Farage alleged at the weekend that Hope Not Hate and Unite Against Fascism are threatening violence at Ukip meetings. In his tweet after the attack on Batten's house Farage said: \"The attack in @GerardBattenMEP's house is a direct consequence of the media campaign against Ukip.\" Batten was criticised earlier this year after the Guardian disclosed that he had called for believes British Muslims to sign a special code of conduct. Batten said he stood by a \"charter of Muslim understanding\", commissioned in 2006, which calls on Muslims to sign a declaration rejecting violence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
