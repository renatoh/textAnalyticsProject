The crown estate, which helps bankroll the Queen by giving the monarch 25% of its profits, has sought to evict 113 tenants in the past five years so it can sell its homes for profit. It comes after it has emerged on Tuesday that the taxpayer has footed a \u00a32.4m bill to renovate Frogmore Cottage, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex\u2019s official residence, according to royal accounts. While the royals have no direct oversight role in the crown estate\u2019s dealings, Prince William and Prince Charles have both spoken before about the importance of ensuring good quality housing is available for all. Figures obtained by the Guardian show that the crown estate has received more than 100 complaints about its residential properties in just two years, including grievances over rent hikes, leaks, delays in repairs and faulty electrical goods. One evicted tenant accused the crown estate \u2013 which made \u00a3329m profit last year \u2013 of \u201cgreed\u201d. The retired police officer, who said he was left thousands of pounds out of pocket after being evicted, told the Guardian: \u201cThe crown estate are custodians, they are not a bloody commercial estate agent. They are custodians and therefore they have a social duty to the public and their communities.\u201d An investigation using data obtained through Freedom of Information laws reveals that: The crown estate has made \u00a31.1bn selling off more than 700 residential and commercial properties since 2014, with one private firm subsequently hiking rent well above inflation. More than a quarter of a million pounds has been banked by the crown estate in housing benefit from just seven hard-up tenants. Four tenants have sued the crown estate for breach of contract, including one claim worth half a million pounds. The disclosures will be uncomfortable for senior royals who have previously expressed their concern over the state of private rental properties. In March, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge visited dilapidated housing in Blackpool and saw rain leaking through the windows of a property and holes in the ceiling. The third-in-line to the throne later said during the visit: \u201cThere is a sadder side to Blackpool,\u201d adding: \u201cAnd we shouldn\u2019t skirt around these issues.\u201d Prince Charles has also spoken out in the past in favour of affordable housing for low-paid workers. In 2003, he said in a speech that \u201cthe lack of affordable rural housing is one of the most important issues facing the countryside\u201d. But a catalogue of complaints to the crown estate since 2017 show that tenants of properties on land deriving profits for the royals have raised grievances about a host of topics. They include complaints about leaks in properties, faulty lights, noise and homeless people sleeping in a bin store in winter months. Other complaints include: a tenant being chased for arrears, rent hikes, delays in repairs, a defective gas cooker, \u201clarge volumes of flies\u201d at a resident\u2019s home and there being no hot water in the taps or shower at a property. The crown estate received 71 complaints about residential properties in 2017-18 and 38 in 2018-19. The crown estate said its records did not distinguish between whether a complaint was made by a tenant or visitor to a property. Over the same period, the crown estate received more than 300 complaints about its property portfolio \u2013 including commercial and residential leases \u2013 but pointed out the figure included grievances about visitor attractions, such as Great Windsor Park. The crown estate issued 113 \u201cnotices to quit\u201d to residential tenants from 2014 to 2018, including 97 in rural properties, nine in Windsor and seven in central London. Other figures also reveal that the crown estate gained more than a quarter of a million pounds in housing benefit from just seven tenants. People renting in Camden, Runnymede and Windsor and Maidenhead have let property on royal land using housing benefit paid directly to the crown estate. Since 2014, \u00a3253,092 has been paid to the crown estate in housing benefit. The majority of the payments were for five tenants in Camden, north London. The Guardian has also established that four tenants have sued the crown estate for breach of contract, including one claim worth half a million pounds concerning a breach of \u201crepairing obligation\u201d in central London. Retired police officer Peter Franklyn, 65, was evicted from the three-bed home he shared with his then wife in Taunton, Somerset, in 2014. He explained how he was forced to sell \u00a36,000 worth of woodwork tools well below market value as there was no space for them in the smaller property the couple moved to. \u201cTo me, the crown are not a commercial property company and have a duty to preserve and utilise properties for the benefit of society,\u201d he said. The crown estate, which runs the monarchy\u2019s land holdings, gives 25% of its profits to the Queen from funds two years in arrears as part of the sovereign grant \u2013 the remainder goes to the Treasury. The grant for 2018-19, which is linked to the crown estate\u2019s profits in 2016-17, was \u00a382.2m. It is set to rise to \u00a385.7m in 2020-21. The Queen has no role in managing the crown estate but its accounts state that \u201cthe sovereign is an important stakeholder as regards good constitutional management and the standards maintained by the crown estate in the undertaking of its business\u201d. The chief executive officer and chairman of the crown estate meet the Queen yearly to report performance. A Buckingham Palace spokeswoman said: \u201cThe crown estate is an independently run organisation. All profits are returned directly to the Treasury.\u201d A crown estate spokeswoman said: \u201cWe manage in excess of 9,000 leases across the country and we aim to maintain all our properties to high standard. We take customer feedback seriously and are thorough in recording all complaints \u2013 including minor issues \u2013 as part of continuing efforts to improve our service.\u201d In response to the eviction figures, the spokeswoman added: \u201cThe majority of all notices served were in 2014 as part of a rural residential sales programme. Although we worked hard to manage that process as well as possible for all those involved, we implemented a number of policies to help our tenants in any future sales, including \u2026 the opportunity to buy the property at market value; substantially increased notice periods \u2013 typically six months; rent deposits released early to assist with securing alternative accommodation; assistance and advice on locating new properties in the local area; flexibility to accommodate the specific circumstances of the individual.\u201d The spokeswoman said both commercial and residential properties are let at market rates, adding: \u201cAs we cannot borrow, we regularly sell both commercial and residential properties in order to raise capital to invest.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
