What is the matter with people? I\u2019m sick of the same old parties. I\u2019m an old man but I can\u2019t understand why young people can\u2019t support something a little bit new and more energetic.\u201d The Brexit party had been tipped to take the seat, made vacant when Labour\u2019s Fiona Onasanya was forced to stand down after a conviction for perverting the course of justice, but instead it was narrowly beaten. Labour\u2019s candidate, Lisa Forbes, received 10,484 votes, seeing off the Brexit party\u2019s Mike Greene by a margin of 683. \u201cI\u2019m completely foxed by it,\u201d Parkin said of the result. \u201cBecause I went to the bookies and it was six to one in favour of [the Brexit party]. The bookies don\u2019t usually get it wrong.\u201d As for Labour, \u201cI think they were very lucky,\u201d said Carol, a Tory-voting cleaner at a local school who had stopped to watch Corbyn. \u201cBecause I think the Brexit party has only been together for a few weeks and they only narrowly beat them.\u201d Samuel Sweek, 25, a Labour councillor in neighbouring Huntingdon who used to work for Onasanya, said the victory had a lot to do with the party\u2019s huge ground operation \u2013 500 activists were said to have descended on the city on Thursday to get out the vote. \u201cIt knocked everyone\u2019s confidence a little bit that the Brexit party were surging in the polls,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we had a solid agenda to focus on local issues because Peterborough has been disproportionally affected by austerity.\u201d Although Peterborough voted 60% in favour of leave in the EU referendum, people also cared about local issuessuch as violent crime, fly-tipping and cuts to services, Sweek said. \u201cI think [the message] resonated well with the voters. There is more to Peterborough than Brexit. Obviously the Brexit people were keen to make Brexit the headline, but people can relate to stuff that is happening on their doorstep.\u201d For Amjad Iqbal and Shabina Qayyum, two Peterborough councillors, the result highlighted the importance of Labour support in the Asian community. \u201cI would say the Muslim vote played a vital role in Lisa Forbes\u2019s success,\u201d Iqbal said. He said the circumstances surrounding Onasanya\u2019s removal from office had come up on the doorstep, but the party had been able to distance itself from her case. \u201cA lot of people said they were disappointed in Fiona\u2019s action and that they weren\u2019t going to vote for Labour. But we said look, that was her personal action, the Labour party has no responsibility or control over it.\u201d Iqbal enlisted the help of his cousin Shoukat Farid, a politician in Kashmir, who had been in Peterborough campaigning since 31 May. Farid said lots of Kashmiri people in the constituency knew him and he hoped he had helped to get out the Labour vote. With 7,243 votes, the Conservatives held up better than expected, which the Brexit party pointed to as one of the reasons for its disappointing night. Sue and Ray Robinett, a retired teacher and retired council worker, said they had both voted Tory for fear of splitting the anti-Labour vote by backing the Brexit party. \u201cI want Brexit the sooner the better but if too many people vote for the Brexit party, we\u2019ll probably end up with a Labour prime minister,\u201d Sue Robinett said. She had been outraged by Onasanya\u2019s failure to resign as an MP after her conviction and did not accept Forbes\u2019s apology for liking an antisemitic post on social media. \u201cShe says it was a mistake, but it\u2019s easy for people to say that afterwards,\u201d she said. Ray Robinett said he had been tempted to vote for the Brexit party. \u201cBut it\u2019s usually Labour versus Conservatives here, rather than the Brexit party. I clearly underestimated [the Brexit party],\u201d he said. The couple said they had voted to leave the EU because of issues of sovereignty. For Sweek, the result was a sign that the Brexit party\u2019s EU elections success may not translate in a general election. \u201cEven though they are playing it down this morning, they really thought they\u2019d win this,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if they can\u2019t win seats like Peterborough, which is the kind of place they\u2019re after, then I think maybe their new shine is wearing off.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
