City were deserving winners and produced some sparkling attacking play because Huddersfield forced them to. Tanking achieved! It came via a fine flowing move, started by Fernandinho - and finished by Iheanacho from an offside position. 87 min: Quander blems one over from 10 yards after the ball broke to him in the box! 86 min: \u201cBe fair,\u201d storms Jason. \u201c\u201dI didn\u2019t merely predict a City win, I predicted a tanking (which it now surely is) and implied that Huddersfield should\u2019ve have practiced more real-game-scenarios (i.e. defending) rather than kicks from the penalty spot.\u201d It\u2019s hardly a zero-sum scenario, though, is it? Wagner didn\u2019t say that all his preparation had been devoted to practicing penalties. The way his team has played here is proof that they do a hell of a lot more than that. They\u2019re a proper team, as even their second-string has given City a better game than several Premier League side have done this season. 84 min: Sterling skins his man down the right this time, then steadies himself and fizzes a low pass in to Iheanacho in the box. The Nigerian holds it up well with his back to goal and then plays a cute return ball to Sterling, who had zipped in from the wing to fire a shot at goal. Blocked by Coleman. 82 min: Huddersfield are beaten now, and pretty much bowed. It\u2019s just about avoiding the concession of another goal now. City substitution: Navas on, San\u00e9 off. \u201cReferring to De Bruyne a Flying Dutchman?\u201d blurts Peter Oh. \u201cDid I miss something? Is this just an honest mistake, or just part and parcel of the post-truth world? Not only is De Bruyne not a Dutchman, he also bears an uncanny resemblance to his famous countryman, the Belgian cartoon adventurer Tintin!\u201d It wasn\u2019t me, Peter, it was one of your fellow emailers, whose name I can\u2019t be bothered to go back and check. Let\u2019s call him Cuthbert, as in Calculus. City substitution: Iheanacho on, Aguero off. 78 min: Sterling slips on a pair of jetboots to skedaddle to the bye-line and reach a seemingly unreachable pass. He then clips the ball towards the near post ... where no one is awaiting it, because no one thought Sterling would be in any position to deliver a pass. 76 min: City are insatiable. They want to trample their visitors into the ground. Thoroughly admirable bloodlust. City substitution: Delph on, De Bruyne off. Now that\u2019s what you can all a like-for-like change. City are safe now! Fernandinho helped a cross-field pass on to De Bruyne, who flipped it wide to Sterling on the left. He pinged in a fine low cross, and Aguero did the rest, sweeping the ball into the net from eight yards. 72 min: Van La Parra makes a strong run down the left and then whacks in a low cross. Smith can\u2019t get on the end of it, however. 70 min: It\u2019s a tribute to how well Huddersfield\u2019s B team have played that Guardiola has not yet felt safe enough to make any substitutions. Huddersfield substitution: Hogg on, the splendid Billing off. 66 min: A splendid, cutting ball from midfield by De Bruyne. Sterling races around the blind side of Holmes-Dennis to try to get on the end of it, and appears to be shoved by the defender. Move along, nothing to see here, gestures the ref. 64 min: \u201cAm I too late to ask how The Flying Belgian is doing this evening?\u201d asks Rob. No, I think we can answer that within the remaining 26 minutes. Here goes: De Bruyne is playing well. Pulling City\u2019s strings from a central position. 62 min: De Bruyne curls a freekick over the wall from 25 yards. Easy save for Coleman. Hudddersfield substitution: Smith on, Lolley off. \u201cBe nice to think that somewhere on the field a Huddersfield player with a finely tuned sense of historical perspective, is whispering in a Mancunian ear \u2018You\u2019ll never win three titles in a row though,\u2019 chortles Ian Forth. 56 min: Cranie sends a long ball over the top for Quaner to chase. The striker does exactly that, and wins the race before veering into the City\u2019s box. As he cuts past Stones the defender catches his foot, sending Quander tumbling to the grass. Penalty? No! Not according to the ref. A case of the forward running into the defender\u2019s foot, rather than an overt foul. 54 min: After Huddersfield take a short corner, Quaner curls in a low cross. Lolley meets it at the edge of the six-yards box. What a chance! But he nods wide and then puts hits hand to his mouth, presumably to conceal profuse swearing. Profuse swearing being the only sensible reaction to a miss like that. Huddersfield substitution: Van La Parra on, Bunn off. 51 min: Quaner robs De Bruyne in midfield and then bounds forward. He tricks his way past one defender and then tries his luck from 20 yards. It deflects over the bar for a corner. 49 min: Quaner, who\u2019s pretty elusive for a giant, skips past Stones before being illegally felled. Thats a freekick to Huddersfield wide on the left. They float it into the box but Stones nods away, Otamendi clears it farther, all the way to Aguero on half-way. The Argentinian races deep into Huddersfield territory before slipping a nice pass through to San\u00e9, who looks sets to scamper into the box and let fly with a shot ... until he over-runs the ball. He\u2019s been mostly brilliant today, San\u00e9, but that\u2019s the second time he\u2019s lost control of the ball when in an excellent position. Youthful exuberance, I guess. 47 min: Tricky interplay by Huddersfield down the left ends up with them winning a throw-in near the City corner flag on the left. From there they produce yet more fine play ... until Holmes-Dennis wanders offside. 46 min: Off we go again. \u201cI\u2019m checking in from time to time,\u201d announces Jason [see chat before kick-off]. \u201cThat blitz by City has me looking PRETTY smart right about now.\u201d Yep, you were pretty smart to predict a City win and suggest Huddersfield were prats for thinking they could compete. Speaking of works of art, check this out. I\u2019ve just been admiring a replay of the San\u00e9 shot that hit the post in the opening minutes. It was a sumptuous effort, not entirely dissimilar to Nelinho\u2019s unmatchable oeuvre: Huddersfield\u2019s second-string have been pretty good, but City have been better. Given their movement, skill and precision, the hosts look set to run away with this unless Huddersfield can do something special in the second half. 43 min: Excellent through-ball by Billing to Payne, who suddenly finds himself one-on-one with Bravo. He tries to curl a low left-footer into the far corner ... but he got his angles wrong and rolls it at Bravo. Who saved! 40 min: Coleman hares out of his area to head a ball clear. Meanwhile, Lolley and Fernandinho are lying on the ground at the other end of the pitch after hurting each other in a legitimate challenge for the ball. There\u2019ll be a break in play while they receive treatment and Huddersfield try to come up with a way of turning the tide that is in danger of completely overwhelming them now. City have moved into overdrive and Huddersfield can\u2019t handle them. Coleman saved Aguero\u2019s first shot but the Argentinian retrieved the ball near the bye-line and played a simple pass to his compatriot at the near post. Zabaleta swept it gratefully into the net from close range. 37 min: Cranie is hassled by Clichy into losing possession in the right-back area. The balls pops out to Aguero, who scurries into the box and sends a low sidefooted shot past the keeper. But it bounces out of the same post that San\u00e9 hit earlier! Coleman goes one way, Aguero slots it the other way. Stankovic is ruled to have pushed over Otamendi as he tried to connect with a cross from Zabaleta. Lovely goal. De Bruyne spanked a long pass from the left over to Sterling on the far side. Homes-Dennis clips it with his hand - inexplicably, and inexplicably missed by the ref - but that doesn\u2019t matter, because Sterling collected it, flashed several lollipops to Holmes-Dennis and then laced in a lovely low cross that San\u00e9 tapped home from two yards. 28 min: Huddersfield have enjoyed a spell of play in the City half. They really are pesky opponents and City are not enjoying the experience of playing them even though they have created several chances. \u201cWhy has Pep got one of those coats that you wear so you don\u2019t have to pay for a bag on Ryanair?\u201d wonders Ian. 25 min: San\u00e9 starts a searing run deep in his own half and leaves defenders floundering in his wake. As he races towards the box a whole range of possibilities open up for him - he could play in either Aguero or De Bruyne or try to continue his dribble himself - but as he tried to make up his mind he over-ran the ball, enabling Cranie to nick it off him and clear the danger. 23 min: Huddersfield have barely been outside their half in the last seven or eight minutes, and they\u2019re using a hell of a lot of energy as they try to keep City at bay. This match is far from done. \u201cThat Wagner has his team running Rings round City,\u201d offers William Hargreaves. \u201cHe Tristans them on the counter, when Bunn sees Bravo Isolde dummy to score.\u201d If there are any more of these high-brow Wagner puns, I\u2019m going to ask someone to have a word with you. A real Hart to Hart conversation. 20 min: The pressure is building from City, to the point that Huddersfield are reeling. Cranie has just made a last-ditch block from a shot by Fernandinho. The result is a corner but City players are complaining that they should have had a penalty for another handball. 17 min: City are gifted a chance by a slack pass in midfield. They work it quickly to De Bruyne, who scampers into the box and then uses a sly feint to send one defender sliding away in vain. Then, from six yards out, he does the same again, and this time the ball hits the hand of the sliding defender. City appeal for a penalty by the referee rules that the handball was accidental. 15 min: De Bruyne fires a wobbly freekick over the wall. Coleman stops it, drops it, and then picks it up. Danger over. 14 min: Freekick to City because Hudson pulled down Aguero to stop him connecting with a return pass from Sterling. A yellow card, too, for the veteran defender. And a shooting chance for De Bruyne, from about 25 yards and a little to the left. 11 min: Huddersfield\u2019s vivacity is annoying City, who are starting to mislay passes under pressure. 8 min: City started very strongly, plainly keen to put the underdogs in their place early doors. But that goal has shocked them and they\u2019ve lost a little of their swagger. They\u2019re certainly not panicking, however, just trying to knock the ball around a bit to compose their thoughts. 6 min: Wagner punches the air in the stands while thousands of Terriers fans go even wilder in another part of the ground - all celebrating a lovely goal by their team. After they swept down the on the counter-attack, Billing helped the ball through to Bunn with a subtle flick. Bunn took a touch and fired a low shot under Bravo and into the net! That seems to be Bravo\u2019s weakness: shots on target. Moments after Aguero forces a save at the other end, Huddersfield take the lead with a well-worked counter-attack! 4 min: A tremendous attack by CIty concludes with a brilliant shot by San\u00e9. He received a pass by De Bruyne near the left-hand corner of the Huddersfield box and immediately cracked a viciously swerving shot with the outside of his foot past the keeper ... and out off the far post! 2 min: Already it is clear that, to no one\u2019s surprise, Huddersfield intend pressing vigorously. They don\u2019t plan to let City have tie on the ball anywhere on the pitch, and that seems a shrewd policy with Stones and Otamendi manning the opposition\u2019s defence. 1 min: Off we go. Huddersfield survive the first minute without City having so much as a shot. Are you watching, Jason? The players are where they need to be. City are dressed in sky blue kit with the now-familiar darker blue shoulder cladding. Huddersfield are in black and luminous lime stripes, a homage to Wagner\u2019s Dortmund roots. Pep has also been quizzed by the BBC and he wasn\u2019t impressed by any of the questions so provided answers that I\u2019ve already forgotten. Sorry about that. David Wagner has just been speaking to the BBC. Asked whether his team can win today, he replied: \u201cYes, why not? Everybody knows we are the underdog and we have to get a lot of details right but we showed in the first game that we can make things hard for City.\u201d As for his team\u2019s approach, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s the Cup so it\u2019s live or die - and we\u2019d like to live. It\u2019s a great occasion \u2013 the oldest competition in the world - and we\u2019re still in it, so go out with freedom and be brave.\u201d CIty fans might be interested to note that Monaco are also in Cup action today (at Marseille) and, unlike City, have omitted most of their regular starters. City prepared for this match with a spot of warm-weather training no Dubai. I\u2019d like to think that Guardiola took a leaf out of David Wagner\u2019s book (as described here) and told Yaya Tour\u00e9, Sergio Aguero and the lads to share tents and hunt and cook their own food, but I guess their agents would have told us about that already if such an outrage had taken place. \u201cIn your preamble you say that David Wagner has had his side practising penalties!?\u201d snorts Jason. \u201cOn that note of hubris from Wagner, i\u2019m switching this mbm off, as Huddersfield will get tanked and won\u2019t get near a kicks-from-the-penalty-spot situation.\u201d Are you sure you\u2019re being dismissive enough, Jason? Wasn\u2019t it quite arrogant of Huddersfield to even get on the bus to Manchester? Now that the uppity sods are here, they should just sit on the sidelines and ask Pep if he\u2019ll let them watch the Premier League stars train. Wagner, by the way, has made nine alterations to the side he sent out for Huddersfield\u2019s last (contemptibly lower) league match. Which means that today\u2019s lineup is very similar to the one that had the temerity to draw with City in the first match. Hello. The last time Manchester City played, on-lookers wound up gibbering like eejits as they tried to explain the fun, as Pep Guardiola\u2019s hot-fangled troupe exchanged digs and slips with Monaco. And the time City played before that, they served up a belting match with Huddersfield. How belting? About as belting as 0-0\u2019s get, that\u2019s how belting. It was almost freakish that there were no goals in that game and it\u2019s highly unlikely that today\u2019s encounter will remain scoreless \u2013 mind you, David Wagner has had his side practising penalties just in case the teams remain inseparable by the end of extra-time. That suggests that Wagner, although he will rotate his team, is deadset on advancing to an FA quarter-final bout with Middlesbrough despite the fact that Huddersfield already have a humungous promotion challenge on their plates and a high-stakes Championship bout with Newcastle United this weekend. Wagner, then, just loves winning (and sometimes struggles to contain his celebrations, which is why he\u2019s banned from the dugout today) and wants to add to Huddersfield solitary victory in the FA Cup final, which came way back in 1922, when Huddersfield\u2019s goalkeeper famously wore glasses and the referee famously didn\u2019t, Huddersfield\u2019s winning goal coming from a penalty awarded for a foul that took place outside the box. Pretty sure that\u2019s when the use of video technology was first mooted. We can expect City to be hellbent on victory, too, and they may even field a full-strength side, as they come into this game on the back of a couple of weeks off and are only playing Sunderland this weekend. During their break they swung over to Dubai, where Guardiola had a natter with the club\u2019s owners, where discussions presumably included summer transfer targets and the urgent need to find a goalkeeper with flawless heading skills. It wouldn\u2019t help the manager\u2019s cause if his first match after that chat was a defeat to lower-league opposition. Or maybe it would. All in all, this has the makings of an entertaining show.
