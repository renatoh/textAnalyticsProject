Last season he scored 342 against Surrey in Guildford, his highest score in first-class cricket. But he may beat that today, for he is 303 not out against Middlesex, his old county. The new captain of Somerset, grimly acquisitive as ever, has started with a big statement, hitting 37 fours in his 9\u00bc-hour stay, but the most entertaining batting yesterday came from James Hildreth and Cameron White as the county responded to Middlesex's 600 for four by scoring 683 for five. In an attempt to make Taunton a little more bowler-friendly Somerset have recently spent \u00a310,000 on pitch alterations. These have been so effective that 1,283 runs have been scored in this match for the loss of nine wickets. Phil Frost has a reputation for producing some of the best batting surfaces in the land and is a regular winner of the groundsman of the year award, though he has often found himself at loggerheads with his county. This year he has cut an inch off the top of the square in an attempt to inject more pace into it and save Andrew Caddick's creaky legs. But so far, counting the early-season friendlies, 10 centuries and two double centuries and one treble have been scored and Caddick's only success has been against the students of Loughborough University; in a championship season which is only thee days old he has aged visibly. Somerset chased down the vast Middlesex total with few mishaps. The only surprise was that the first six of the match did not come until the last ball before tea yesterday, when White pulled Nick Compton's gentle twirl over midwicket. Somerset had resumed on 215 for two and Langer and Hildreth took their third- wicket stand to 242. They were in such command that it came as a surprise when Hildreth's back-foot force sent Chris Silverwood's delivery to Compton at point. Hildreth's is a real talent. He times the ball with rare sweetness and there were 18 fours in his 200-ball 116. When he was out Langer and White put on 227 for the fourth wicket. Middlesex have an experienced seam attack, with Silverwood, Alan Richardson and Richard Johnson, but they looked helpless yesterday, even when they took the new ball."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
