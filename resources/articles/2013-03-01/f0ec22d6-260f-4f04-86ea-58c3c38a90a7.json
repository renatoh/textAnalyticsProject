Still others were caught in two minds between staying in the queue for rapidly emptying bars or seeing the \"Usain Bolt of the turf\" win by 19 lengths. A small but growing band of refreshed punters in \"The Sun Pub\" in the Best Mate enclosure remained entirely oblivious, some more concerned with working out who had spilled their drink than the outcome of the race. Over the past two decades the Cheltenham Festival has evolved to become one of the most popular and best-loved sporting events in Britain and Ireland. On Wednesday 53,295 streamed through the gates, a record crowd as it had been on the opening day, and Friday's Gold Cup day is already a sell-out. But as attendance figures have soared from 70,000 over three days to 230,000 over four, it also now more than makes its contribution to that other stereotypically British obsession: queueing. The human snake at Wimbledon long ago became an object of fascination in its own right, so much so that it gained its own definite article and is self-importantly referred to within its own publications as The Queue. And anyone who has tried to get home from Twickenham station after a major rugby international knows that it is easier for an investment banker to pass through the eye of a needle than to get on the train to Waterloo in a hurry. But in recent years, as attendances have soared, Cheltenham has laid its own claim. The festival of queuing begins long before you reach the gates and is particularly acute on Gold Cup day. Queue for the train at Paddington, queue for the bus when you get off the train at Cheltenham Spa, queue to get into the course. Then queue for a drink, queue for some food, queue for a bet. Repeat until it is time to queue for a taxi or a bus home. Not that the giddy crowds thronging the beautiful Cotswolds bowl on a crisp, sunny second day seemed to care. The Cheltenham experience might have racing at its heart but, like any major summer event from Wimbledon to The Open, it is about so much more than just the sport. Certainly the enjoyment of the crowd gathering round the stage in the Guinness Village to watch a topless man dancing erratically to a band banging out The Irish Rover had little to do with racing. The challenge for the Jockey Club, which owns the course, is to retain the unique atmosphere of the Festival while overhauling facilities that all agree need to be improved. Ian Renton, the new managing director, has acknowledged as much and planning permission for a major upgrade of facilities will be submitted this year. Like those other great festivals of the sporting summer, Cheltenham is in reality several events in one \u2013 the well-turned-out guests of the sold-out corporate hospitality chalets mixing cheek by jowl with the lad dressed as a baby on his stag-do in Tattersalls. Renton had declared war on the touts that ply their trade on the path that leads to the entrance to the course but on the frontline it appeared there was only one winner. As quickly as a man in a fluorescent G4S jacket warned punters through a megaphone not to buy tickets off touts and tried to force them down the hill, they crept back up it like lichen reclaiming a rock. Ollie, one typically vocal tout in a tweed flat cap, said: \"They want to bring the bankers down to size rather than worrying about us trying to earn a living. G4S are just trying to earn back the money they lost on the Olympics. \" Another innovation in recent years has been to market the four days of the Festival as distinct attractions in their own right. On Ladies' Day that meant \"scouts\" roaming the crowds for well-dressed women to photograph. The crush was greatest not in the \u00a330 Best Mate enclosure (where The Sun has plastered its branding on every available surface) but in the \u00a345 Tattersalls. In the Best Mate enclosure one thing you do not have to queue for is to put a bet on as row upon row of on-course bookies ply their trade. Despite the rival attractions of online bookies, all still attract a steady queue of punters seeking the visceral thrill of swapping a betting slip for a fistful of notes. Danny McNab, one of dozens of bookmakers in the Best Mate enclosure who has been every year since 1958, says that it remains by far his busiest week of the year. \"The punters still come to us. They want to have a bet in person. They want the atmosphere. At the big races at Aintree and Epsom they still want to bet in person,\" he said, admitting that he sometimes got carried away with the atmosphere. \"You want to see great racing; you're cheering them home. Then you realise it's losing you money. But when you see scenes like Tuesday and the crowd welcoming Ruby Walsh, it's like a football match.\" The atmosphere and the sport might be very different but the comparison to SW19 is apposite \u2013 there, the All England Club has over recent years managed to upgrade its facilities without losing the core of its appeal. Now Cheltenham must pull off the same trick. In the opening race, when the sea of used slips in the betting hall was still shallow, Drawn N Drank fell off the back of the field. One or two of those staggering their way back down the hill to the queues for buses and taxis at the end of the day must have known how he felt. But most were still smiling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
