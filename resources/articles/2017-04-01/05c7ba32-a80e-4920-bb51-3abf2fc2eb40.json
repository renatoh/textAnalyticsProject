He was 83. With Andy Warhol and Roy Lichtenstein, Rosenquist was a pioneer of pop art, the 1960s movement that made high art out of flat, bright representations of everyday items and images, often plucked from advertising and media. Such works proved immensely popular and helped to change the nature of contemporary art. Rosenquist was born in Grand Forks, North Dakota, in 1933 and studied art at the University of Minnesota. He found work in industry and in advertising before moving to New York in the mid-1950s, there to mingle with the giants of abstract expressionism. He shared a lower Manhattan studio with Ellsworth Kelly and Agnes Martin and mixed with other artists of the next generation, including Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns. More work as a billboard painter contributed to the look and scale of his work as an artist, in which signature forms included writhing pasta, cars and home appliances. In his 2009 autobiography, Painting Below Zero: Notes on a Life in Art, Rosenquist wrote: \u201cI painted billboards above every candy store in Brooklyn. I got so I could paint a Schenley whiskey bottle in my sleep.\u201d About the label of \u201cpop art\u201d, he wrote that he had \u201cnever cared for the term\u201d but was \u201cresigned to it\u201d. He also sought to distinguish his work from that of Warhol and Lichtenstein, writing: \u201cI was never concerned with logos or brand names or movie stars, like Andy, for instance. Unlike Roy, I wasn\u2019t interested in ironic simulations of pop media; I wanted to make mysterious pictures.\u201d In one well-known work from 1960-61, President Elect, he painted John F Kennedy\u2019s face alongside a yellow Chevrolet and a piece of cake. \u201cThe face was from Kennedy\u2019s campaign poster,\u201d he told The Art Story. \u201cI was very interested at that time in people who advertised themselves. Why did they put up an advertisement of themselves? So that was his face. And his promise was half a Chevrolet and a piece of stale cake.\u201d Speaking in his 1997 TV history of American art, American Visions, the Australian critic Robert Hughes said: \u201cGenerally there\u2019s no politics in Rosenquist\u2019s fantasies of desire, but in 1965 he produced an exception to that, an enormous panorama about Vietnam.\u201d The painting in question, Rosenquist\u2019s most famous, is the 86ft-long F-111, a sequence of 23 panels named for a US military jet and a gallery-wrapping critique of the military-industrial complex and the American public\u2019s complicity with it. Rosenquist, who wrote that the size of his works \u201cgave steroids to pop art\u201d, spoke to Hughes for the programme. The angel\u2019s food cake in the painting was \u201ca metaphor for a missile silo\u201d, he said, adding: \u201cI thought of this plane going through all this flak, of household items, lightbulbs in particular, imagery of things during peacetime. \u201cThe little girl with blonde hair under a hairdryer is the pilot of this bomber, an aviatrix, and then on to a rendering of a hydrogen bomb in a red grisaille with an umbrella over it \u2026 like a view from a resort on to a nuclear bomb.\u201d The painting, Hughes said, \u201csummed up Rosenquist\u2019s vision of America as an Eden compromised by its own violence\u201d. Writing in Time magazine in 2001, about an exhibition at the Whitney Museum in New York, Hughes said that though F-111 \u201cmay not be, as has sometimes been claimed, the Guernica of the 60s \u2026 it affected people in a way few works of political art had done since the murals of Diego Rivera in the 1930s. \u201cIt suited its time, just as Rosenquist\u2019s lusher paintings of the 80s, with their candied colors and peculiarly deceitful overlays of motif \u2013 the sumptuous presentation of dying fetishes of American culture, like the space program \u2013 suit theirs. \u201cRosenquist, in short, is one of the few former pop artists whose work continues unabatedly to have something to say, however elliptic the mode of saying it turns out to be.\u201d In 2003, Rosenquist was honoured with a full retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum in New York. In 2009, he lost paintings \u2013 including a huge mural commissioned by the French government \u2013 and property to a brush fire in Florida. His wife, Mimi Thompson, told the New York Times he died at his home in the city, after a long illness."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
