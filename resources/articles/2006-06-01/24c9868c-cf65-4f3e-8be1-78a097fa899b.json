While former industry experts - sorry, independent academic scientists - were gloating to the UK press that the Sustainable Development Commission had praised atomic stations as \"low carbon\" (in a report that, you may remember, also labelled the technology as being uneconomic and unnecessary), Greenpeace USA inadvertently issued a draft \"fact sheet\" that left plenty of room on the moral high ground. Preparing for George Bush's visit to a plant in Pennsylvania, the group's release said: \"In the 20 years since the Chernobyl tragedy, the world's worst nuclear accident, there have been nearly [FILL IN ALARMIST AND ARMAGEDDONIST FACTOID HERE].\" Oh, dear. Fixed income Situations vacant: leading water company seeks temporary staff for its customer service centre, and also technicians to help fix leaks. Would suit unemployed window cleaners and car-wash owners facing financial ruin because of pending drought order. Apply to Thames Water, which, we can reveal, is \"considering\" such a move to ease the hardship of those hit by possible severe restrictions this summer. Turning the tide Visitors to Hammerfest, northern Norway, are strongly advised to visit the excellent energy museum on the site of the nation's first hydropower plant. In a series of exhibitions, it displays the past, present and future of Scandinavian power, featuring a working water-wheel and a scale model of the new natural gas plant set up in the town by Statoil. Also included is a replica of a new tidal-power generator currently deployed in the nearby harbour, the first in the world. What does it say about the potential of this emerging technology, we wonder, when the model only rotates because of a cleverly-concealed motor? Closed net Eco Soundings always enjoys receiving CCNet - the electronic \"scholarly network\" distributed by Benny Peiser, social anthropologist and climate-sceptic-in-chief at Liverpool John Moores University - if only to see what fantasy headline will be placed over his daily round-up and distribution of pieces that appear in these pages and elsewhere. Yet we are concerned about the omission of a widely-reported story that, at first glance, appears classic CCNet territory. It included big business, government action on climate change and the possible future of both the Kyoto protocol (boo!) and the European Emissions Trading Scheme (hiss!). Can it be related to the inconvenient truth that, as the stories made clear, the heads of some of Britain's biggest companies were acknowledging the threat of global warming and arguing for tighter targets and more severe restrictions on their carbon pollution? Probably not. Let's just put it down to sunspots and cosmic rays. Well-earned cuppa The National Trust has set up an admirable scheme whereby visitors arriving at dozens of its properties by public transport or under their own steam receive discounts. Eco Soundings, for one, intends to take advantage. And first up is Claremont Landscape Garden in Surrey, home of a \"unique 18th-century grass amphitheatre\" and \"one of the finest Lebanese cedars in England\". The cycle lanes have been scouted and the puncture repair kit is packed. Let's just hope the promised \u00a31 tea room voucher is worth the effort."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
