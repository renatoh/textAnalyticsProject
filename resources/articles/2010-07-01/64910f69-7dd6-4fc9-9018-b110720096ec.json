He has never held that role. He was wrongly quoted as saying: \"The purpose of a corporation is to be selfish.\" His actual words were: \"The purpose of a corporation is its own self-interest.\" (Soulless firms a cancer on environment \u2013 UN, 12 July, page 5.) \u2022\u2008A commentary about the government's budget measures predicted: \"The cutting of 10% off the weekly \u00a365 jobseeker's allowance for anyone out of work for a year may become the equivalent of Gordon Brown's 10p tax-rate abolition.\" This particular cut is, rather, to the housing benefit (also known as local housing allowance) of those on the jobseeker's allowance for a year. With the average housing benefit at about \u00a384 a week, a 10% cut would represent a bigger loss than a cut to the jobseeker's allowance. (Public backing for cuts will dissolve when reality strikes, 26 June, page 33). \u2022\u2008Editing changes to an article about the Church of England's debate on women bishops resulted in a proposal put forward by the archbishops of Canterbury and York being confused with a voluntary code of practice they sought to amend. The archbishops suggested that the church's General Synod should legislate to provide a special class of bishop to look after parishes that do not wish to have female bishops.
