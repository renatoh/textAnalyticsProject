A friend had bought an art deco apartment and was looking for period fittings. I had free time: my father was in hospital so I\u2019d taken leave to dogsit for my folks while my mother stayed with him in the city. I\u2019d never had much use for online shopping: a book here, a pair of Birkenstocks there. Then an eBay search for \u201cart deco lights\u201d became one for \u201cart deco ring\u201d \u2026 and it began. That fortnight, with a cat and two labradors for company, I swooned over rings around the world. I\u2019ve since found out that deco is old bling\u2019s gateway drug. (I\u2019ve also discovered that nearly every \u201cart deco ring\u201d on a popular online auction platform is reproduction or rubbish, but more on that later.) Over the next few months I drew my sister into this new interest. We bought bits and pieces \u2013 it turns out that handcrafted, solid-gold jewels from the past can be cheaper than mass-produced, gold-plated tat from the present \u2013 but that wasn\u2019t the main game. It was Instagram\u2019s antique jewellery community who enthralled us \u2013 a passionate, politically engaged, occasionally batshit-crazy bunch of adornment adorers, posting about purchases, precious heirlooms, old paintings and pets. It wasn\u2019t flashy, soulless modern brilliant diamonds they admired but wonky old mine cuts. Who loved this jewel before, they asked. And who loved them? I now believe that an appreciation for adornment is part of being human. Sure, big rocks can signal status, but many of life\u2019s milestones \u2013 matches, hatches, dispatches \u2013 are marked by jewellery, given to us by those we love. To join the Insta gem gang \u2013 50-odd regular commenters \u2013 it seemed you needed to post plenty of bling, something I balked at from my personal account. So we lurked a while; scrolling became an escape from stress during days hanging around in hospitals, then a nursing home, as Dad slipped away from us. My main memory of that terrible time is love. In Dad\u2019s final, agonising weeks he didn\u2019t get enough oxygen to his brain. But no matter how confused he seemed he always knew how loved he was \u2013 and told us again and again how much he adored us. Within weeks of his death my mother, my sister and I bought our first diamond rings: vintage three-stones that became our version of mourning jewellery. Mum said they stood for three strong women. My sister had a better slogan: \u201cLife is short. Diamonds.\u201d We liked this so much we used it to name a new Instagram account. Alongside brooches and bracelets seen at antique shops we started putting up pictures of beaches, then opals bought on road trips with Mum as she crossed Australia in a campervan. The gem gang welcomed us immediately. I\u2019d never before been part of an online community, or DMed into the night with strangers. First we had hundreds of followers, then thousands. But devotion tipped into obsession when I walked into a small Sydney shop after spying a hand-hammered, featherlight, gold Georgian chain in its window. I asked its owner, Karen Deakin, if she\u2019d heard of Instagram. And would she mind if I photographed that necklace? An Instagrammer in LA snapped up the chain; I went back to shoot more of the shop\u2019s wondrous stock. Karen, a dealer since 1978 with vast knowledge, a keen eye, and a spiky shyness that makes her at once sweet and formidable, had never ventured online. I coaxed her on to Insta then helped set up a website. She\u2019s now family to me: we talk most days and I visit once a week to take photos. I\u2019ve long given up any pretension of being a jewellery collector. Instead I collect images \u2013 and am grateful for occasional antique gifts from my friend. In this unexpected late-life apprenticeship I\u2019ve learnt all the boxes that must be ticked for a jewel to be judged \u201cgood\u201d and hold its value: design, condition, materials, workmanship, rarity, wearability and authenticity. On the latter, I\u2019ve been horrified to realise how much repro is out there \u2013 it\u2019s said there are many more Georgian rings for sale than ever there were Georgians \u2013 and to see how many Instagrammers are being taken in. But I\u2019ve also held an old ring and felt a shudder run through me, the thrill of \u201crightness\u201d \u2013 of knowing that this tiny, bejewelled, slightly battered but ravishingly beautiful talisman has been worn and adored for more than 200 years. Dad\u2019s still here, on my hand \u2013 in my art deco ring from the decade he was born. I wonder who\u2019ll love it next? \u2022 Do you have a story about the moment of discovery when a pastime became a passion?
