I hope you heard something you loved over the last three days, and the rest of the year brings you more pleasures. And now the countdown to Fleetwood Mac next year (will they?) begins. Thanks for your company, even when you disagreed with me. There\u2019ll be loads of Glastonbury in tomorrow\u2019s G2, words and pictures, so give it a look. Goodnight! Our own Alexis Petridis weighs in on the festival-closer by these goth-pop veterans. Well, I could go on for hours \u2013 although perhaps the biggest story of this year\u2019s Glastonbury was how they really grasped the scale of the climate crisis. Hannah Jane Parkinson\u2019s feature on it is well worth reading. Other highlights? Slowthai\u2019s attempt to deal with Saturday\u2019s heat \u2026 in nothing but his pants. So that\u2019s it for the big performances, although the debauchery and dancing goes on at least until sunrise. Highlights? Kylie\u2019s showmanship \u2013 and the hits! \u2013 proved she deserves a promotion from legend slot to headline. Here\u2019s Laura Snapes\u2019 review from earlier in the day. Janelle Mon\u00e1e closed out the West Holts stage in a typically inspired outfit, looking like a deconstructed piano. Brief Cure story. Some time in the late 90s I saw them at the Astoria. Before they came on, I was chatting for quite a long time to a chap in a hat that cast his face in shadow. He was very pleasant: we were just talking about this and that. Eventually, I asked: \u201cWhat do you do?\u201d He looked up, and said: \u201cI\u2019m Martin Gore. I write the songs for Depeche Mode.\u201d And then he stormed off. The Cure were very good. Last one of these. I absolutely promise. But overall QPR rating: Adel Taarabt. Sublime at times. Great finishing. But I was frustrated. It\u2019s three years since Christine and the Queens made her Glastonbury debut on the Other stage, performing in a downpour hours after the Brexit bore came through and offering a radiant blast of European cosmopolitanism to a field of damp and downtrodden Brits. Since then she\u2019s released her second album, Chris, a more challenging record than her self-titled debut and one that didn\u2019t quite reach its predecessor\u2019s commercial peak. But just as it took an appearance on this very stage to mint her star, so does her headline performance tonight galvanise the field: there\u2019s the saucy funk of Girlfriend with its outrageous body rolls, the flowing bodily undulations of The Walker, and a refresh of Paradis Perdu that swaps its original sample of Kanye West\u2019s Heartless for Luniz\u2019s I Got 5 on It; her clear lineage to pop history, made manifest in a brief sample of Janet Jackson\u2019s Nasty and a stunning a cappella rendition of Bowie\u2019s Heroes. I can\u2019t lie \u2013 I\u2019ve seen her do this show enough times that I could do the choreography, and I can\u2019t dance. But every time, it yields something new: the dances are of course choreographed, as in any high concept pop show, but the emotion always feels immediate \u2013 the pain on her face during What\u2019s Her Face, a song about being exiled by mainstream culture, the vulnerability she exudes when she removes her shirt, faces the back of the stage and flexes her back muscles in a balletic display of strength. She\u2019s in tune with the festival\u2019s spirit, too \u2013 she aptly labels it \u201cGlastonfreaky\u201d, says she\u2019s been craving a return ever since 2016, and clubby closer Intranquilit\u00e9 is the perfect bridge for those heading to the South East corner for one last night of debauchery. Sorry, was just fetching the pictures below while they raced through Why Can\u2019t I Be You? like they were the Ramones, and finish with Boy\u2019s Don\u2019t Cry. That\u2019s why the Cure are what they are: they can play a run of hits that rival anything you will hear at any festival. It reminds me of seeing Madness here a few years ago, and you realise how tightly wound they are into the fabric of British pop music. But what makes them loved profoundly by many \u2013 and I\u2019m in the camp that knows how can great they be but does not love them \u2013 is the stuff that left me chilly, and means they are the hugest cult band in Britain, possibly the world. It\u2019s an amazing thing, to generate love like that, but it is wonderful when they let absolutely everyone in with those incredible hits. Here\u2019s some more of David Levene\u2019s pictures. And Close to Me. The most sceptical must be won over by this rush of songs. And now everyone in front of the Pyramid stage is dancing and singing, and even watching on television it\u2019s electrifying: to see the faces of the crowd and the happiness on them is like a rush of joy. The interlocking guitars of Friday I\u2019m in Love simply blossom, and you can feel the serotonin levels shoot off the scale. And another of Christine \u2026 A great Caterpillar and into The Walk. Like the Killers last night, the Cure are rolling out the big guns one after the other, and suddenly all the rest seems like the necessary preparation for the big release of joy. And here\u2019s a pic from Christine and the Queens\u2019 set \u2013 the little bit of which I saw looked great. \u201cTen minutes to put my pop head on,\u201d says Robert Smith. Then after a pause says: \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to translate what we do \u2026 But this is Glastonbury.\u201d Suggesting half an hour of pop hits, beginning with the gorgeous Lullaby. Of course, what makes the Cure such a significant band is their ability to shuffle between songs that make a profound connection to the devoted and those the non-committed love. Smith\u2019s remarks suggest maybe he found switching between the two tricky tonight. Sauntering on to the John Peel stage in an all-black tracksuit, Mike Skinner still exudes the excitable geezer vibe of his Original Pirate Material days \u2013 an everyman for the Carling-toting crowd. Launching into the UK garage-infused classics from that debut, Skinner sets the punishingly busy tent off into an immediate mosh pit, one that does not relent throughout their headline set. Despite a supposed retirement in 2011, The Streets re-formed in 2018 and are on word-perfect form, Skinner\u2019s now-gravelly voice shouting through numbers like his anti-mindfulness manifesto Geezers Need Excitement and Don\u2019t Mug Yourself. The live band is a nice addition, embellishing sparse tracks like It\u2019s Too Late and allowing Skinner the space to ad lib (mainly about said mosh pit) to the crowd and even have \u201cthe most chilled out crowdsurf\u201d during sad-boy anthem Dry Your Eyes. The momentum lags on the slower numbers though, especially the guitar-led balladry from 2011\u2019s overly-introspective Computer and Blues. Instead, it\u2019s the jumped-up energy of their breakout hit Fit But You Know It and dancefloor regular Has It Come To This which cements Skinner\u2019s position as the pioneer of the lager-spraying school of UK hip-hop which has now spawned talents such as Slowthai. Skinner may be older and somewhat slower than his early-2000s heyday but it\u2019s an aptly energetic close to the John Peel stage, providing enough enthusiasm for the punters to at least get through the gruelling journey home. Shake Dog Shake sounding simply immense. Intoxicatingly good. I\u2019m not going to retreat from saying it was a slow start, but this set is starting to fly for me now. Yes, I know it was flying for plenty of you earlier. I\u2019ve not seen any of Janelle Mon\u00e1e\u2019s set, but hearing great things about it. Looks like it was a bit of a spectacular, too. And now the Cure are on to A Forest, which I would be happy to have last hours and hours, droning on brilliantly and moodily. I wonder if Wipers and the Cure were listening to each other, because A Forest sounds very much like what Greg Sage was doing several thousand miles away in Portland at the same time, this strange, haunted, arid music. QPR rating: Adel Taarabt. South London rapper Flohio may be one of the most hyped by \u2013 ahem \u2013 metropolitan media types, but that doesn\u2019t always translate into popularity. Up against other rap and hip-hop in the east side of the site, like Tion Wayne doing megahit Keisha and Becky about 50 metres away, and the Streets headlining the John Peel stage not too far beyond that, she\u2019s got competition, and when I turn up there are about 12 people watching. She still gives it her all, throwing her expert club flow into a series of trap tracks underpinned with headnodding dub energy. By the time her track Bands comes round, she\u2019s grown her crowd to 100 or so \u2013 still small beer, but the kind of performance whose word of mouth will keep her star rising. Clearly, I\u2019m in a minority among commenters (and Twitter people) in not thinking this is one of the great sets. *Shrugs* I can live with it. Again, I think it would be fantastic in an arena, surrounded by people who are really, really into it. I\u2019m interested to see what the Guardian\u2019s review will be like, whether it felt overwhelming in the crowd or not. Dorian Lynskey interviewed Robert Smith for the Guardian when he curated Meltdown last year. Have a read if so you wish. And now Just Like Heaven. The neutrals \u2013 yes, I am a neutral \u2013 are going to come back on board for this. The fact is that at festivals, hits buy you goodwill. Most of Disintegration doesn\u2019t. Back to the Cure for In Between Days, being taken at a brisk clip. And now there are flares alight in the crowd, and visible dancing a long way back. QPR rating: introduction of Bradley Allen as a late sub for Devon White. If you want to read what Robert Smith\u2019s week was like back when he was younger, try this diary piece he did for the late, lamented Flexipop. The Guardian\u2019s David Levene was in the pit at the start of the Cure\u2019s show. I\u2019ll be honest with you. I wanted something that sounded a little less like living in a damp bedroom in a shared house. Christine sounds sharp and tight. Pop that is seductive and disruptive, and lets you in even if you\u2019re not a superfan. The cheers from the Other Stage are louder on the iPlayer than the ones from the Pyramid are on the telly. I lost track of the set, because I was tying, but we\u2019re back with a single, Fascination Street. Guess which album it\u2019s from. Go on, guess. OK, so here\u2019s the question. What should bands do at festival headline sets? Should they do whatever they please, or should they play the hits, given the crowd is largely made up of the curious rather than the devoted. I used to think the former. More unpredictable, more exciting. I changed my mind at Glastonbury in 2016, standing in the mud, watching New Order, when they played a set that eschewed the hits until the end. Indoors, at a New Order show, I would have loved it. Outdoors, in a big crowd, I wanted to feel part of something bigger. And a set that delivers to the committed fans does not make you feel part of something bigger. I felt the same away when Springsteen played here \u2013 he shouldn\u2019t have played a Boss set; he should have gone outright for everything that neutrals know, whether or not he wanted to \u2013 he should have given them Born in the USA and I\u2019m on Fire and so on. Something can be brilliant and unsuited to its environment at the same time. It\u2019s back to Disintegration for Lovesong. I suppose it\u2019s not surprising they\u2019re leaning heavily on that album so far: they\u2019ve been playing it in full in various places around the world. It\u2019s a fan favourite, and it was their highest charting record. But this is shaping up to be a set that devotees hail as a masterpiece, while neutrals shrug. And Lovesong is followed by Last Dance from \u2026 Disintegration. High gets a QPR rating of Jan Stejskal. Solid performer. Now on to A Night Like This, from The Head on the Door, which sounds fantastic. I bet the fans are in raptures: this isn\u2019t a greatest hits set, but it\u2019s creating a solid mood \u2013 not of euphoria, but a kind of relaxed intensity. Bet it sounds amazing just a bit stoned. This is swelling and flowing like an ocean. Giving it a QPR rating of Shaun Derry: deserves more recognition. It all sounds lovely, but as Jeff observes: \u201cThey\u2019re not giving it the full Kylie, are they?\u201d Still, they\u2019ve left Disintegration behind. High is from 1992\u2019s Wish. Behold Jeff Goldblum and his trousers and shirt. It will not surprise you to learn this man consults a stylist every day. It\u2019s a one-two from Disintegration, with Pictures of You. I was joking yesterday when I said I hoped he played two hours of the gloomy stuff. I\u2019m giving this opening duo a QPR rating of Simon Barker and Ian Holloway: solid, and they very much do a job, but the neutrals don\u2019t come out for them. Plainsong \u2013 the QPR rating: Toni Leistner \u2013 solid, but lacking in pace. Dave is a gifted storyteller. His set on the Other Stage kicks off with flames and bombast, but some of the most spine-tingling moments are when he\u2019s at his most stripped-back \u2013 whether performing his profound, politically charged single Black against a monochrome backdrop, or delivering an impromptu motivational speech and a capella verse detailing his journey from selling mixtapes at school, to making his number one album, Psychodrama. A calm and crisp performer, his poignant lyricism can easily command the stage. But the set crescendoes with a run of three warm, melodic summer singles, perfect for the final night of this sweltering Glastonbury: Location, No Words, and his biggest hit to date, Funky Friday, featuring Fredo. Unexpectedly, the set also turns in one of the best surprise guests of Glastonbury. Before performing his AJ Tracey collaboration Thiago Silva, Dave calls up to the stage a member of the crowd named Alex, who is wearing a Thiago Silva shirt and a bucket hat. Alex gets mic\u2019ed up by the crew, and \u2013 improbably, as these stunts almost always end in secondhand embarrassment \u2013 knows every single word to the song, and performs it like a champ. The crowd is roaring, and it\u2019s one of the most feel-good moments of the festival so far, to see a superfan performing side by side with his favourite artist. Props to Alex, who is definitely absolutely buzzing right now. Obviously, I\u2019ll be flipping between things, but in honour of Robert Smith\u2019s support for QPR, I shall be rating each song I see as QPR player. Stan Bowles will be the highest rating, Shaun Wright-Phillips will be the lowest. As for the others, you\u2019ll have to work out what I think from the name of the player concerned. And they\u2019re opening dark, with Plainsong, from Disintegration. One for the purists, rather than the people who want to hear the it (ie me). Here\u2019s a picture of Years and Years for you. Those of you said it was Channel 4 in 1994 are right. But none of you got the right band. Let me hand you over to Saint Etienne\u2019s Bob Stanley: \u201cWe played Glastonbury. I didn\u2019t go. It was the first one that was on telly, and we were the first band that appeared on telly from Glastonbury. That was a minor claim to fame. They were pretty good. Better than Marion. Marion went to introduce a new song with a long, rambling introduction. And they cut to an ad break, so you never heard the song. That was Marion doomed. You knew it wasn\u2019t going to happen to them at that point.\u201d The geeks will inherit the earth. A decade on from when many assumed their natural sell by date would be, Vampire Weekend are the last blog rock band standing. Second down on the Pyramid stage seems a unlikely space for a band whose brand of studied naffness bears no relation to much of the rest of this year\u2019s line up \u2013 and yet here we are. The further they shift away from current trends \u2013 latest album Father of the Bride is their uncoolest yet \u2013 the more popular they become. Of course, it helps that they\u2019re a pretty formidable live band \u2013 precise and buzzing with energy. A-Punk and Cousins are irrepressibly busy bounce-alongs and the new tracks \u2013 Harmony Hall in particular \u2013 slot in seamlessly. Even their lamest indulgence \u2013 a duelling guitar solo \u2013 makes a strange amount of sense. Much has rightly been said this festival of the new British jazz scene, but unquestionably the hottest star in jazz right now is Kamasi Washington. Two years ago, he played a mid-afternoon slot on West Holts, now he\u2019s been elevated to second on the bill, and as the sun sets the LA saxophonist and his band provide a perfect scene \u2013 storming to a close with a Fists of Fury that is a funky as any blaxploitation cut, politically charged and as all-round magnificent as any big band could hope to sound in 2019. Roll on a headline slot next time round. Glasto 2019 has been a vintage year for mid-2000s indie bands: The Killers, Vampire Weekend, Foals and Interpol have all played to the masses, and now it\u2019s the turn of Friendly Fires, another band who have managed to transcend that era of indie student discos, hanging around Camden, and poring over NME. Their tropical pop-euphoria is just the kind of sundown set that\u2019s needed after a weekend of having it in the dank South East Corner. There are flavours of Chic by way of George Michael (there\u2019s a lot of George Michael) with plenty of sexy sax and congas. New track Heaven Let Me In \u2013 from their just-announced album, Inflorescent \u2013 is another blissful homage to uplifting house, like the riff on Jamie Principle\u2019s Your Love that made their name. And their old emo-Balearic hits like Jump in the Pool and Paris still sound suitably epic and as bright as their Hawaiian shirts. Ed Macfarlane, meanwhile, is an underrated frontman \u2013 he\u2019s got crystal-clear pipes and excellent trouser-snake moves, as during Jump in the Pool when he wiggles his hips to fanatical screams. It does make you wish more people threw shapes like that on stage and looked as if they were truly in the moment. They end on Kiss of Life, another glorious reminder that Friendly Fires are the party band you almost forgot you needed in your life. But they\u2019re back, and more brilliant than ever. So, BBC Two has now gone live, with highlights from earlier, as we wait for the Cure. And here are some top Cure facts: 1: Robert Smith doubles up as the artists Bob and Roberta Smith. 2: Simon Gallup\u2019s dad set up the Gallup polling company, and for several years the Cure chose their singles based on private polling from the Gallup organisation. 3: Boris Johnson started calling himself Boris, rather than Alexander, in tribute to 80s Cure drummer Boris Williams. I\u2019m now in Jeff\u2019s kitchen. That\u2019s how seamless this operation is. You didn\u2019t even notice I\u2019d gone, did you? With the release of her third album, Grey Area, this year at the age of only 25, Little Simz has marked herself out as a prodigiously talented rapper and storyteller, specialising in verbally dexterous, introspective verses that take in everything from mental health to gender politics. It is testament to the broad musical span of her releases \u2013 including the likes of trap-influenced bass to soulful melodies and dancefloor-focused rhythms \u2013 that her crowd at the Park stage is one of the most pleasingly diverse of the festival. Backed by a full band and dressed in white, Simz\u2019s set is polished and muscular, featuring most of the tracks from Grey Area. Highlights come on the gunshot verbal scatter of Venom, the sweetly melodic Selfish and early cut God Bless Mary, dedicated to Simz\u2019s nextdoor neighbour who tolerated her loud, late-night early bedroom productions. The show takes an incongruous turn when Simz takes up a bass to play along to her DJ\u2019s selections of Erykah Badu\u2019s Bag Lady and the Notorious BIG\u2019s Juicy, dissipating the crowd\u2019s energy. Yet, things soon pick up with the gospel-backed Flowers and here Simz demonstrates the wide-ranging talent of today\u2019s British rap. It is a field that has space and, crucially, an audience for everything from Stefflon Don\u2019s tongue-in-cheek sauciness to Slowthai\u2019s hedonism and Simz\u2019s pensive lyricism. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any great secret to Dave\u2019s success: he\u2019s smart, raps well, he\u2019s approachable and relatable, and he\u2019s got some great hooks. He maybe doesn\u2019t have the same level of charisma as Stormzy, but I wouldn\u2019t be in the least surprised to see him top of the bill on one of the big stages next year. OK, here\u2019s a quiz question. Who were the first band ever to be shown live from Glastonbury on television? Tweet me your answers, to @michaelahann In case you wanted to read more about Dave, here\u2019s an interview with him from earlier this year, by Miranda Sawyer. It was really good of Miley Cyrus to get Fields of the Nephilim up on stage with her (ask your granddad, or anyone who worked for Melody Maker in the 1980s). Really pleased to see overwhelmingly positive thoughts about Billie Eilish in the comments. I think she\u2019s great. Turned over to Dave, just in time for 100 Ms, which \u2013 pop fans \u2013 had a video filmed in the streets around my house, and extensive segments filmed in Phoenicia, the excellent Middle Eastern deli on Kentish Town. I commend to you their whole roasted chickens, their baklava, their spinach flatbreads, their excellent range of pastas, and much more besides. I don\u2019t know if Dave tried the chicken when they filmed the video. That\u2019s the end for Vampire Weekend, so I\u2019ve popped over for a look at Kamasi Washington. Honestly, I\u2019m unlikely to be hanging around long. I can see he\u2019s brilliant, but it doesn\u2019t really float my boat. I went to see him earlier this year, and was slightly horrified that we got a six-hour drum battle in the middle of the set. Not least because talk of drum battles reminded me of my horrific experience interviewing Ginger Baker on stage, when he replied to my first attempt at conversation with: \u201cThat\u2019s a fucking stupid question.\u201d Yesterday I gave you the story of Chris Martin and the KP crisps at London Zoo. Today, the tale of Miley Cyrus\u2019s first gig in London. She was appearing at Koko, in a filmed Hannah Montana special, and I procured two tickets for my wife and daughter (I must have been watching some tawdry indie band in a pub), and along they went. When they got home, my wife reported that they had been ushered to the VIP area, where she spent the evening chatting some old fella who seemed to have brought along his granddaughter. He must have been famous, she said, because people kept coming up to him and being very respectful. She described him, and I Googled some photos and showed her. \u201cYes, that\u2019s him.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s PETE BLOODY TOWNSHEND! How can you have spent the evening talking to PETE BLOODY TOWNSHEND without recognising him?\u201d Here\u2019s someone famous watching Billie Eilish. There\u2019s an knowing wink in the Stella McCartney outfit that Billie Eilish wears to take to the Other stage, with the Beatles\u2019 logo emblazoned on her back. Greeted by a crowd of fizzing, enraptured teenage girls, she wastes no time launching into one of her most snarling singles right out of the gate: Bad Guy is an incongruous goth-pop rager, which partway through flips into a chopped and screwed coda. The moment she embodies the transition, fixing the crowd with intense eye contact, is magnetic. And that\u2019s just the first song. Eilish was bumped up to the Other stage in recognition of the fact that the last two years have been explosive for her, going from the viral Soundcloud hit Ocean Eyes to her massive 2019 debut album, When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go. Her strange allure is the way she can flip seamlessly from maximal rage to quiet intimacy. She\u2019s captivating when she lies motionless on the ground, singing the distorted and sleepy When I Was Older, just as she is when she\u2019s leaping around and kicking the air to the drop in Bellyache. And, after a set full of gnarly moshing, it\u2019s surreal to watch her play the song that started it all, Ocean Eyes \u2013 a gentle whisper of a ballad. The mood is momentarily sad when she expresses a moment of jealousy of the crowd, saying: \u201cThis looks fun to go to \u2013 I would love to go to this shit, my God.\u201d Still only 17, she\u2019s coming of age under scrutiny, and will possibly never get to experience what it\u2019s like to attend a festival like Glastonbury as anything other than a celebrity. But throughout the rest of the set, it\u2019s heartwarming to see the obvious joy she takes performing with her brother, Finneas O\u2019Connell (who writes and produces all of the music with her). She wields her mic like a rock icon, styles herself like an emo SoundCloud rapper, and sings like an angelic indie songwriter \u2013 but unmistakably, performs with the pull and charisma of a pop star. My kids often tell me, a ginger man, \u201cGingers have no soul.\u201d Vile little sods. Well, if you don\u2019t love Diane Young, YOU HAVE NO SOUL. \u201cOur outfit co-ordination started a few months ago. We all live in south London, we were going to Glastonbury, we knew Kylie would have the best dancing, so we had a fight over who got to be Kylie. Part of me thought it was because I was the short girl but I like to think it was because I was the fiercest. My costume was easy, the Internet sells this shit. The hardest was the backing dancers \u2013 guys were trying to borrow red dresses they couldn\u2019t fit into, a teacher taped acetate sheets to her head. We tried to plan a dance routine and we settled on Steps\u2019 Tragedy but a bit more wavy. We were about 10 rows back. I claimed that Especially for You was dedicated to me. My friends said it really fucking wasn\u2019t. Pushing to the front is so much easier in costumes \u2013 people are like, you dick! Then they see your costume and welcome you through. The only other people wearing it I\u2019ve seen have been very camp men.\u201d Vampire Weekend are doing my favourite song of the year so far, Harmony Hall, the only song that crosses early Fairport Convention with Italo House. Can I be honest with you? This song makes me cry. It really does, every time. I have tears in my eyes right now. Sadly, Vampire Weekend are ignoring my sage advice and have gone into New Dorp. New York. NO JAMMING! Laura Snapes reports that the Other stage is \u201cinsanely busy\u201d for Billie Eilish. While we\u2019re on the subject of teenage pop, readers last night might recall my mention of my son\u2019s \u201cdrill crew\u201d, Dartmouth Spartanz. He wanted me to mention his \u201cOG Spartan\u201d Hugo \u2013 this is not a crew who are going to strike fear into the gangs of north London \u2013 and makes this baffling observation: \u201cDARTMOUTH SPARTANZ C TOWN HOLD IT DOWN BABY RUNNING SHIT IN THE NORTHWEST NO CAP 6 2\u201d. Evs, sonny. Rapper Stefflon Don, whose song titles include Tight Nooki and Lil Bitch, is maybe not who you\u2019d expect to be following the mum-friendly singer-songwriter Tom Walker, but such is the near-random nature of the programming on the John Peel stage. With the Walker fans far from the vicinity, Don starts her set to a criminally small crowd \u2013 one of the sparsest I\u2019ve seen on a main stage all weekend. No matter though as she shells the front rows with venomous lines taken from her two mix tapes and last year\u2019s debut EP, Hurtin\u2019 Me. The sub-rattling French Montana-featuring title track of that EP is a highlight of the set \u2013 Don\u2019s most recognisable tune and one which she performs accompanied by a slick dance routine in front of the gargantuan mirrored lettering of her name. The only setback is that since so many of her tracks are guest verses on other artists\u2019 releases \u2013 Shot and Wine with Sean Paul, Bum Bum Tam Tam with J Balvin and Future \u2013 her otherwise smooth flow lags as she waits for her bars to come along. As she closes her set, though, the tent is three-quarters full, the bemused crowd hanging off her every word on the dick-pic-inspired Ding-a-Ling. Don can scatter through grime, wile out to dancehall and put on a dance routine to rival tonight\u2019s Other stage headliners Christine and the Queens. She is one of British rap\u2019s most captivating new talents. Here\u2019s a picture of Billie Eilish at the Other stage. I\u2019m just praying the constraints of a festival set mean Vampire Weekend decide to drop the Horchata/New Dorp. New York medley they\u2019ve been doing for the last year or so, because \u2013 to be honest \u2013 it\u2019s bloody endless, testament to the eternal desire of American bands to unleash their inner Grateful Dead. I suspect now they\u2019ve got Brian Robert Jones playing lead guitar \u2013 and he can, like, really play, maaaan \u2013 they feel the need to give him some chance to show off. Don\u2019t do that. Play the songs! It\u2019s all about the songs! NO JAMMING! I\u2019ve switched over from Billie Eilish to Vampire Weekend, who I think are one of the great modern guitar pop groups. I think they are funny, tuneful and clever, and that\u2019s quite enough for me. Also, I think they are good guys. They headlined End of the Road last year, a gig that was supposed to have postdated the release of their new album. Obviously, the album didn\u2019t arrive in time, but they still came over to Europe to do that one-off show, at a festival that can\u2019t afford to pay huge fees \u2013 my bet is they lost money on honouring that booking. So all hail to them. It also had one of my favourite festival moments, when some kids at the front were pleading to come up on stage. Ezra Koenig, laughing, helped them up, and said they could sing Wolcott to close the show. At which point it became apparent that they had no idea about any Vampire Weekend songs, which Koenig thought was hilarious. One of the kids was in a wheelchair, and just did wheelies back and forth across the stage. It was great. Here\u2019s the Guardian\u2019s VW interview from last week. As Glasto this year has shifted focus to the climate emergency, there has only been a whiff of political skewering from the performers in 2019. Stormzy wore a stab vest for his headline show; Joe Goddard shouted \u201cFuck Boris\u201d at the end of Hot Chip\u2019s set; there are a few other examples here and there; but it does feel a bit like the malaise has well and truly set in. Damon Albarn senses this and uses his show with The Good, the Bad &amp; the Queen to remind people not to lose faith. \u201cThree years ago we came here and opened on the Friday with the Syrian National Orchestra. It was the Friday after the referendum, and we were really shocked. It became a mission to work out what\u2019s going on here.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t engage with it enough,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, simply: don\u2019t give up politics. You might give up on politicians but don\u2019t give up on democracy itself,\u201d before launching into deranged vaudevillian dub tune The Truce of Twilight. It was to be expected from a band \u2013 comprised of, among others, Paul Simonon of the Clash and the godfather of Afrobeat, Tony Allen \u2013 whose last album was on the theme of Brexit. The group marries Albarn\u2019s two majors \u2013 Britishness and African music \u2013 with a rowdy Dickensian flair, Albarn as the Artful Dodger acting up to the crowd. It\u2019s fun to see him being cocky, as if he has a new lease of life, and amusing to see how his bandmates blithely ignore his antics \u2013 falling down to the floor in mock shock being one. But then he is serious again. \u201cInteresting fact,\u201d he says. \u201cDo you know what they call England in Iran? Englishtan. Fill in the rest of the essay. Can\u2019t have any of that terrible xenophobic attitude in England. This is been a great festival to dispel that,\u201d and then he plays a \u201chealing song for a healing festival\u201d, the Dylanesque acoustic number Ribbons. He\u2019s right: it\u2019s been the most diverse Glastonbury yet, and it\u2019s all the better for it. Here\u2019s a nice pic of Kylie and Nick Cave discussing which battered halloumi stall they think is better. OK, here\u2019s the plan, and it\u2019s one I\u2019ve carried out before. So I know it works. I\u2019m going to be on my sofa until nine. But Sunday night is the evening I go to the pub with my friend Jeff. Always. Unless he\u2019s in court on the Monday morning (he\u2019s a barrister, not a criminal). Obviously, taking my laptop to the pub would be a little impractical. So instead, at nine, I will be taking a five minute break and walking round to his house, where I will set up again, and drink his beer, and eat the remains of whatever takeaway he and his family had earlier (the problem with liveblogging is that you can\u2019t stop to make your tea). So this is, genuinely, the only TWO LOCATION GLASTONBURY LIVEBLOG in British media. And do they ever give me prizes for this groundbreaking approach to journalism? Do they buffalo! Billie Eilish is doing Wish U Were Gay now, which is the single song with the biggest discrepancy between the awfulness of the title and the goodness of the song of the entire year. And also the one I compared to Cole Porter. I had to review Kylie doing a little club show at Cafe de Paris not very long ago, when she launched her country album. I was sitting in the balcony, scribbling in my notebook as she sang. She was, I guess, 20 feet away. Now, when arena stars go to clubs, they don\u2019t usually change their gestures. They\u2019re still projecting to somewhere 100 yards away. And they do all the big point-and-wave gestures they do to anonymous space in arenas, except in a club, there\u2019s actually someone there. I looked up from my notebook, having been scribbled, to be confronted with Kylie doing the arena point-and-wave. At me. With all the people on the floor, turning to see what she was pointing and waving at. It was EXCRUCIATING. Not least because I wasn\u2019t wearing any glitter or feathers. Rounding off my Glastonbury Gastodyssey with that classic, super healthy festival snack, battered halloumi \u2013 and because I\u2019m a food geek, I got two from competing stalls, just to nitpick. Number one, from the English Indian, is encased in featherlight pakora batter and stayed nice and juicy though I\u2019m deducting points for the sweet chilli sauce because Kylie or not, it\u2019s not 1997. Opposite, Mr Hamid served his with pomegranate molasses and mint, which makes them definitely post-Ottolenghi, but the fries themselves were a bit overcooked and tough. Still feel pretty lucky, lucky, lucky though! Off to have a heart attack on the train home \u2013 see you next year! It\u2019s Sunday night, England have won the cricket, I\u2019ve been dozing most of the day (couldn\u2019t sleep last night: too hot, or I was buzzing too hard after watching the Killers on TV. You decide), but now I\u2019m here for five hours of watching the television with you. You can tweet me your observations: @michaelahann. Or you can just watch TV. At the moment, I\u2019ve got Billie Eilish on the iPlayer \u2013 her album is pretty great, so have a look. Though I accept that comparing her to Cole Porter in print, which I did, was perhaps pushing it. Thanks to everyone I spoke to for my tour of Glastonbury\u2019s fashion \u2013 we\u2019re ending on a high with Ian Kenton and his mankini. \u201cI got this from Amazon. There\u2019s been a lot of selfies. I had to get a bumbag because I have no pockets. The festival is one of the times I work really hard \u2013 we do the sound and light. We were all meant to wear outfits like this \u2013 but no one else got the memo.\u201d The narrative around Miley Cyrus has always been about how she picks up one sound \u2013 hip-hop, pure pop, gnarly authenticity \u2013 and then \u201crejects\u201d it as she moves on to the next thing. Her current styling is \u201chard rock karaoke at a gritty midwest bar\u201d, and she has her fair share of grungy belters, but her latest EP also features a fairly self-explanatory rap track called Catitude that she performs while crawling across the Pyramid stage, and that you imagine was written expressly in the hope of scoring a Drag Race sync. At this point in her mercurial, often controversial career, it\u2019s pretty clear that these things reflect the many multitudes of Miley, who stomps around the Pyramid stage in wet-look leather and a tiny skin-tight vest, yet spouts new-age wisdom (\u201cthe Killers fucking rocked and it scared the fuck out of me, but I ask the universe every day, show me something that scares the fuck out of me\u201d) and cries as she sings The Most, a song about her mum. The glorious thing about Miley is that she doesn\u2019t really make any sense, and her chaotic energy is the thing that binds it all together and keeps everyone goggling even when she makes moves that would traditionally result in shedding followers \u2013 the Pyramid field is packed, surprisingly. She covers Amy Winehouse and Dolly Parton, brings out her dad Billy Ray and rapper Lil Nas X for the latter\u2019s Old Town Road, and wears a lilac wig to play On a Roll, the \u201chit\u201d from the episode of Black Mirror where she plays ill-fated pop star Ashley O. Played half in its original synth-pop style, half as the Nine Inch Nails song it riffs on, it becomes a hard-rock battering ram yowled so mightily that she makes Steven Tyler sound like Aled Jones. As insane as it is brilliant. Miley Cyrus lets Lil Nas X do his new single Panini, which sadly isn\u2019t about the very bad mozzarella paninis you can buy over near the Other Stage. It\u2019s reminiscent of when Pharrell awkwardly played Move That Dope a couple of years back \u2013 the folding chair-toting masses aren\u2019t massively familiar with US rap bangers. It allows Miley a chance to change into a new outfit \u2013 of her Black Mirror character Ashley O \u2013 to perform On a Roll, which interpolates Nine Inch Nails\u2019 Head Like a Hole. She then reverts back to her earlier outfit to cover the original in full. And then does Wrecking Ball. A totally blockbuster ending. Another day, another bewilderingly massive singer-songwriter at the John Peel stage, though Tom Walker\u2019s syrupy sad-lad balladry couldn\u2019t be further from the chirpy folk of Gerry Cinnamon. That said, the Glaswegian by way of Manchester balladeer is a sensible fit for Sunday afternoon at Glastonbury, a time when the prospect of a return to stultifying normality is casting a deep pall over punters. Most are here to wallow in the gloom of Leave the Light On (241m listens and counting on Spotify), a maudlin but sincerely felt ballad about a friend\u2019s drug addiction. Walker is stronger when he sticks to this sort of lived experience \u2013 it\u2019s when he aims for state-of-the-nation stuff that things go badly wrong. \u201cThis is my middle finger in the air to the news,\u201d he says, introducing Dominoes, a muddled broadside against the mainstream media that feels like an unintended companion piece to David Brent\u2019s Equality Street. Miley Cyrus just played a cover of Jolene, by her godmother Dolly Parton, then rolled into Party In the USA, and then brought out her dad Billy Ray and Lil Nas X to do Old Town Road. Incredible scenes! Laura Snapes has done us a five-star review of Kylie\u2019s performance, concluding thus: \u201cThe showmanship, the incredible run of hits \u2013 it is absolutely phenomenal. So much so that the crowd keep bursting into chants of \u201cKylie! Kylie!\u201d and bringing her to tears. Never mind the legends slot; next stop, headliner.\u201d Loyle Carner is picking up the anti-Boris baton from Stormzy and running with it. He wore a T-shirt that read I Hate Boris, and ended his set by saying: \u201cMy name is Loyle Carner. Fuck Boris Johnson. Thank you!\u201d Miley Cyrus is giving the Pyramid stage a potty-mouthed pep talk. \u201cIn many ways, this show has changed my fucking life drastically, a lot of hard work, dedication and sacrifice,\u201d she tells the Pyramid stage crowd, adding that she saw the Killers last night on telly. \u201cThey fucking rocked, so it scared the shit out of me. You know what? I ask the universe every day: give me something that scares the fuck out of me, and I\u2019m going to fucking do it. So today, that\u2019s motherfucking Glastonbury.\u201d Here\u2019s the view from the \u2013 extremely large \u2013 crowd for Kylie. Miley Cyrus has taken to the Pyramid stage, and kicks off with Mark Ronson collabo Nothing Breaks Like a Heart, joined by Mark Ronson on guitar. With wet-look trousers and cap plus a vast Chanel pendant, the look is very much \u201craunchy traffic cop\u201d. Miley\u2019s, not Mark\u2019s. Ashuvini Mahendraun: \u201cI like catsuits \u2013 I have three with me for this trip. They\u2019re really good for hot weather. I go to a lot of festivals - I went to Primavera earlier this year \u2013 but I don\u2019t wear these kinds of things at other festivals. It\u2019s more T-shirt and shorts. At Glastonbury everyone is a bit more out there.\u201d Fat White Family look like they\u2019ve been at Glastonbury since at least last Tuesday when they take the stage at the Park, but then Fat White Family always look like that: sleazy but chic. Like all the best bands, they give the impression of being fellow reprobates well met, the last gang in town. Easing themselves into their set like they\u2019re easing themselves into a spandex trouser suit, they slowly pick up the pace and by the time they hit Feet, the crowd squinting through the late afternoon haze are firmly into their stride too. One of the singalong moments of the festival comes with the chorus of one of their big tunes, Touch the Leather. It might make more sense to see them in the small hours in Shangri-La, but anyone who has got lost en route to or from Kylie and ended up here by mistake will be taking away some kind of strange but important life lessons. Eve Lazarus: \u201cThese leggings are from Puckoo Couture, a Bristol designer, and I got the earrings from a market stall. The rest of it is Pretty Little Thing, I got told at the last minute I had to wear green. I usually wear a lot more colour and when I am not wearing colour, I don\u2019t feel like myself. Amy Winehouse said the same thing about her beehive.\u201d Met with equal parts bafflement and joy over on the Other stage, it\u2019s kawaii metal group Babymetal! Here\u2019s another shot of Kylie and Nick Cave. *Screams in gothic* This is a fantastically buoyant and brilliant performance by Kylie, and clearly an emotional one after she had to pull out in 2005 following a breast cancer diagnosis. Chris Martin covered Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head that year with Coldplay, and so there was a poignant edge to his guest appearance today. All weekend Hannah Jane Parkinson has been looking at how Glastonbury is addressing the climate emergency. Kylie update: she\u2019s had another costume change and is now wearing a gold glittery number while rattling through Better the Devil You Know. The angular-haired pop-metal posers have upped their game since they played Glastonbury\u2019s Other stage three years ago. They are by now Britain\u2019s biggest metal band, as well as the festival\u2019s token heavy main stagers. Their show is arena-sized, with a catwalk along the back for them to grind their axes along and Janet Jackson-rivalling dancers, who mosh around the musicians, and a song in which they appear to duet with the film character The Crow, who looms on the visuals behind. But though they have the heaviness to reign supreme in the metal world, they also have an appealing commercial edge, straying into EDM at points. As such they seem seem stuck between the two realms, perhaps condemned to the Other stage for life. Their show, with the bombast of Queen, is a spectacle at least. Maybe next year the Pyramid could be theirs. Another special guest over on the Pyramid: Chris Martin has joined Kylie\u2019s backing band, strumming away on an acoustic guitar for I Just Can\u2019t Get You Out of My Head! The Coldplay star appeared with Stormzy during the grime star\u2019s Friday Pyramid headline set. Ben Beaumont-Thomas just watched Jeff Goldblum charm the pants off the West Holts and had a fun time, even if the Jurassic Park star\u2019s ivory-tinkering left something to be desired: Goldblum himself plays the piano like a man driving an unfamiliar hire car away from an airport, peering at his sheet music and poking experimentally at chords. But he is game enough to admit his own frailties. \u201cI\u2019m known for the glissando,\u201d he says wryly; he relies on cascading note runs, one-note solos and vamping chords rather than virtuosity. But his magnetism is its own instrument. As his band close out with the Jurassic Park theme, the crowd at the West Holts stage has swelled massively, everyone basking in a beam of starlight. Flags. Glasto\u2019s got a ton of them. Plenty are bad but some are worth your attention. Here are a few of our faves from this year: As widely hoped, Nick Cave has joined Kylie for the pair\u2019s sensual and dark duet, Where the Wild Roses Grow. The pair enjoy a light canoodle midway through. Phwoar! Within about five minutes Kylie has declared herself speechless, brought out a Klaus Nomi lookalike and is already on to her second costume change - from silky white trousers to a ritzy red dress. Time for another of our artist Q&amp;As. This time it\u2019s multi-instrumentalist Georgia, who tells Kate Hutchinson about coming to Glastonbury aged seven (her dad was in Left Field!) and a close encounter at this year\u2019s fest with a Love Islander: NYC Downlow, Glastonbury\u2019s venerable gay club, has been commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall riots at this year\u2019s festival. Alex Needham spoke to its creators about what they had in store, including \u2013 rather wonderfully \u2013 a communal listen to Somewhere Over the Rainbow: Judging from the hearty roar we just heard in the Guardian Glasto office, Kylie has emerged on the Pyramid stage. In previous years, grime and UK rap has often been confined to a particular corner of Glastonbury. This year, it\u2019s joyful (and pretty tiring on the legs) to discover that there\u2019s a huge variety of rap artists spread across the whole site. There\u2019s scarcely a stage that hasn\u2019t seen a moshpit this weekend \u2013 yesterday Slowthai was demanding his crowd create the biggest of the festival at West Holts, and today Octavian was insisting that his at John Peel had to be even bigger. But perhaps unlike other rappers on the bill, Octavian\u2019s dreamlike music isn\u2019t always the most obviously mosh-able. Drenched in acid trip-emulating cartoon visuals and delivering elegiac auto-tuned vocals over skippy beats, Octavian\u2019s mid-afternoon set had a \u201cheartbroken in the rave\u201d vibe. At one point, he announced that he broke up with his girlfriend last week, and got everyone in the crowd who\u2019s going through a break-up to give a mournful cheer. His vocals shone on sad bangers from his most recent mixtape, Endorphins, but the true highlights of the set were his off-kilter breakthrough hit Party Here (including his lithe, wiry footwork) and the boisterous Skepta-featuring single Bet \u2013 a song so infectious that even the security staff were spotted skanking. Oh. Dear. Freed from the shackles of indie also-rans Slow Club, Rebecca Taylor is now known as Self Esteem, and specialises in emotionally lacerating DIY pop. If in her previous life she was in the shadows, here she\u2019s gloriously front and centre, rolling through tight choreography with her two backing singers while wearing a sequinned bra and an oversized lilac suit. Steady I Stand, like most of the songs on debut Compliments Please, starts small before morphing into an anthemic chorus skyrocketed by Taylor\u2019s swollen vocals. Girl Crush, meanwhile, is a 60s girl-group bop updated for 2019 complete with choreographed handclaps, while the urgent In Time (\u201cI\u2019m going to get drunk and slag you off then go home and eat my feelings\u201d) morphs hip-hop\u2019s booming beats into something endearingly lo-fi. A sweaty set ends with The Best, a throbbing electro stomper revolving around the chorus: \u201cI did the best that I could babe.\u201d You did more than that, if anything. Ocean Wisdom is a man of firsts: he\u2019s the first rapper to dethrone Eminem as the fastest MC in the world and he\u2019s possibly the first rapper to get his name from a 90s indie band. He tells a story about how his parents came to Glastonbury in 1992 and liked Ocean Colour Scene so much that they gave their son the same name. Ocean\u2019s sound throws the old-school back to the future. He raps like a cross between a junglist MC and Busta Rhymes, over beats that hark back to the golden era of UK hip-hop (think Roots Manuva), drum\u2019n\u2019bass and Boy Better Know-era grime instrumentals. But while the tunes are decent and he\u2019s drawn a large crowd to Sonic stage, his rapid-fire delivery can come off, at times, as jibberish wibbling away over a party track. And while he brings on a hype man to help out, he lacks stage presence of some of his peers (he shouts out Stormzy) \u2013 his set comes off a little like People Just Do Nothing. It\u2019s a promising debut at Glasto, but there\u2019s work to do before he gets anywhere near the Pyramid stage. Time for another of our occasional catch-ups with the stars performing at this year\u2019s festival. George Ezra spoke to Jenny Stevens about how nice his tent is and why he\u2019s not ready to headline Glasto just yet: Environmental protests, blunts in the air, roots reggae chirruping over the park: its almost as if it\u2019s 1970, except that Koffee is completely of her time. The young Jamaican star brings playful, combative rap energy and nifty electronic sheen to her debut Glastonbury performance, unspooling her wickedly tangled flow so vigorously that she appears to vibrate, a wiry thing in sleek black Nike. Her revolutionary spirit is also totally of her generation, not focusing on governments and politics but existential stresses: in Jamaica, she tells us, obstacles in life are known as pressure, the name of a song that has the same sense of lived-in stress as anything off Rihanna\u2019s Anti. \u201cWe all have to make it, she insists in a laid-back acoustic number that she describes as \u201ca cry for the youth\u201d. She has songs for their triumphs, too: Blessings shimmers with joy, as does Koffee when the crowd sing every word back at her. Another career-making Glastonbury performance. And here is our report of David Attenborough\u2019s appearance on the Pyramid stage, with some more detail on Glastonbury\u2019s plastic-free initiative: Over on the West Holts stage Ben Beaumont-Thomas is watching Jeff Goldblum\u2019s jazz set. He\u2019s not even started yet and he\u2019s already killing it, it seems: Jeff Goldblum is just doing his soundcheck and he already has the crowd in the palm of his hand: he\u2019s fielded questions on his zebra trousers, flirted outrageously with Kate the TV runner, and sung La Marseilleise. His mic gets cut off ahead of the performance \u2013 the crowd respond with boos, then chants of \u201cwe want Jeff!\u201d, and then the Jurassic Park theme. Banter levels are already dangerously spiking. Laura Snapes was at the Pyramid for David Attenborough\u2019s rockstar appearance, and here are her first impressions: There\u2019s almost a Corbyn-sized crowd assembled for David Attenborough, but where the atmosphere for the Labour leader was one of punk community, the vibe today is more reverent \u2013 a moment of respect for the nature we\u2019re losing thanks to human destruction, for sure, but also for Attenborough, this single-minded constant in everyone present\u2019s lives, from the infants to the elderly. His speech is brief but powerful, highlighting humankind\u2019s relative insignificance in comparison to its massive footprint, and the comparatively little effort \u2013 \u00e0 la Glastonbury\u2019s plastic-free initiative \u2013 it takes to make a difference. Here\u2019s the trailer for One Planet: Seven Worlds for those at home. Attenborough announces One Planet: Seven Worlds, a new BBC TV series aimed at fighting climate change. And now we have a trailer from the programme. And with that he\u2019s off! A short but sweet appearance from the broadcasting veteran. Attenborough is talking about Blue Planet 2 and the scene where the damage done by plastic to the ocean was starkly shown. He thanks Glastonbury for removing all plastic from the festival and the attendees for using less plastic themselves. In voiceover David Attenborough asks the assembled to \u201clisten to the songs of the ocean depths\u201d, followed by some rather soothing whale noises. A huge roar greets his arrival to the stage. Shades of Jeremy Corbyn in 2017 here. Opening with a snippet of portentous dialogue from Dame Judi Dench and a burst of glittery ticker tape feels like the perfect encapsulation of Years and Years\u2019 highfalutin\u2019 but banger-loaded synth-pop. This is also pop music with a message. The opening Sanctify, about frontman Olly Alexander\u2019s toxic liaisons with straight men, is augmented by messages from trolls such as \u201cWhy does he have to be so gay?\u201d and \u201cAnybody cringe at the gayness?\u201d flashing up on the screens. That the song\u2019s central lyric is \u201cI won\u2019t be ashamed\u201d says it all. From there it\u2019s a quick sprint through the undeniable Shine and recent album Paolo Alto\u2019s highlight Karma, Alexander slinking around the stage in what looks like a tartan S&amp;M two piece complete with LOVE choker. When the jacket comes off to leave a mesh vest and bare chest before gay sex anthem Meteorite, the crowd whoop in approval. \u201cAhh thanks,\u201d Alexander laughs, his euphoria at being a pop star palpable. Later he\u2019ll suggest he wants to bathe everyone, before a lovely piano-led Eyes Shut causes an outbreak of swaying. Then he announces his loosely buttoned trousers are about to come off before a suitably sultry Desire. Just as the song is hitting its groove, a siren rings out, the beat disintegrates and dancers rush the stage as stats flash up on the screens. \u201cHomosexuality is illegal in 72 countries\u201d one reads, before the show ends with \u201cQueer is beautiful\u201d and Alexander snogs a male dancer to vast cheers. He then gives a very emotional speech, peppered with tears, about everyone working together to change the future for LGBTQ+ people. If a good Glastonbury performance is about seizing your moment then this is that in excelsis. There\u2019s always been an admirably activist edge to the shimmering pop of Years and Years, and during their Pyramid Stage set they took over the big screens to broadcast damning facts about the prejudice faced by the LGBTQ community both at home and abroad. Lots of people mentioning the Authentic Lebanese Mezze stall in the Park Area (which also happens to be next to the place I got my second breakfast, but I have moved since I promise). Haven\u2019t spotted a lot of Middle Eastern stuff here, certainly not in comparison to Mexican and Indian, so I was looking forward to this. The best bit was definitely the spinach and feta fatayer pastry, which was unusually spinach-heavy, and the hummus and baba ganoush \u2013 but again, had to get out my trusty tin of salt as it all lacked for a bit of oomph. Doing a roaring trade though so clearly Glastonbury disagrees. The Guardian\u2019s Alex Needham had a quick chat with Smiths ledge Johnny Marr about this year\u2019s Glasto heatwave, the festival\u2019s political element and his memories of seeing Zep at Knebworth. Read the whole interview here: The rumour that Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper would play a secret A Star Is Born set at Glastonbury may have been promptly scotched by Emily Eavis, but there\u2019s another multi-hyphenate performing hits from her own musical drama in their absence. Irish actor Jessie Buckley starred last year in Wild Rose, a charming Brit drama about a Glasgow girl\u2019s attempts to break into the Nashville country music scene. It was a premise bolstered by the fact that Buckley has the lovelorn voice of a Broadway veteran, as she proved here. A barnstorming, belted-out cover of Randy Newman\u2019s Guilty is the highlight, but there\u2019s also a chiming cover of Emmylou Harris\u2019s Born to Run too. \u201cThis is fucking insane \u2013 I can\u2019t believe it,\u201d she yelps at one point, a line it\u2019s difficult to imagine Gaga ever delivering, but on this evidence Buckley is every bit at home here as the Hollywood heavyweights. Hi, Gwilym Mumford here, taking over liveblog duties for the next few hours. We\u2019ve got Kylie, Miley and a certain D Attenborough coming shortly. Stay with us! Situated in the Greenpeace field near a skate park and a 20ft rave tree lives BEAM, a site-specific wooden sculpture by Wolfgang Buttress that aims to highlight the plight of bees in the wake of the climate crisis. \u201cBEAM is a conversation and symphony between the insect world and us,\u201d Buttress explains, with the centre of the vast wooden structure a \u2013 wait for it \u2013 hive of soundscapes and flashing lights triggered by a live feed from Worthy Farm\u2019s bee colony. \u201cThese live signals are sent to the sculpture via a dedicated internet link,\u201d continues Buttress. \u201c[The] algorithms will be used to convert these vibrational signals into lighting and sound effects, enabling the life of the black bee colony to be visually and aurally felt as a live experience. No two moments will ever be the same.\u201d If the sound of bees pushed through an ambient filter sounds a bit one-note, then the drones have also been augmented by musicians including Spiritualized, Kelly Owens, Camille Christel, Matt Black and Coldcut. As with most things in Glastonbury, its uses are multipurpose: some are using the central space to do yoga or just escape for a bit, while the giant wooden struts that surround it act as a makeshift maze to get lost in. It\u2019s also not going anywhere. \u201cI\u2019m delighted that Michael Eavis will keep BEAM as a living bee hotel on his farm so it can be reimagined for Glastonbury,\u201d Buttress says. As the Beat Hotel retires, the bee hotel buzzes to life. Lauren Cochrane has been out and about snapping the most stylish looks in the field. Alice Fry, 28, social media executive \u201cCycling shorts \u2013 it\u2019s just the look everyone is going for, isn\u2019t it? I guess it\u2019s born from Kylie Jenner and those people. I showed this to my friend who is really fashion-forward and she loved it. It\u2019s Glastonbury so anything goes. Stormzy was a highlight \u2013 I think there\u2019s a lot of truth in what he says.\u201d Heather Doughy, 26, PR \u201cOur group has a different outfit theme every day \u2013 this time it\u2019s sexy sweetcorn, a really niche reference from an obscure musical. We also have a Billie Eilish lyric and Disco Needs You for Kylie on Sunday. This is the third time I have been. It\u2019s special because everyone is super-kind. We\u2019re a big LGBT group and everyone feels safe here.\u201d Laura Rietdyk-Johnson, 26, works in social media \u201cI am volunteering for Oxfam \u2013 usually I have a faceful of glitter. Glastonbury really inspires me to be who I want to be. I have a different look for each day \u2013 on Saturday, I was in all green. I plan what I am going to wear for months.\u201d From the spiritual awakening of Langa Methodist Church Choir to a social awakening. Anyone can spout empty bromides about peace and love from a stage, but 79-year-old Mavis Staples gives hers real meaning and power in this absolutely magnificent Pyramid stage set. Delivered in a throaty holler, her songs about love and social justice are full of simple, digestible, but poetic truths: \u201cWhat good is freedom if we haven\u2019t learned to be free?\u201d she asks early on. These open-hearted questions harden and galvanise on Who Told You That: \u201cWe don\u2019t wanna rock the boat \u2013 who told you that?\u201d she asks, brilliantly sly and lupine. Via classic 12-bar electric blues and a cover of activist anthem For What It\u2019s Worth by Buffalo Springfield, she warms her heart back up, imploring the crowd in a glorious, ferocious yell to \u201ctouch somebody!\u201d English reserve melts as strangers gingerly reach out to each other. She ends by castigating \u201cthat \u2013 I don\u2019t know what to call it \u2013 that one in the White House\u201d, pleading for gun reform and an end to the imprisonment of migrant children at the US border. \u201cI might just run for president!\u201d she decides. She has 10,000 or votes secured here already. Writer and activist Reni Eddo-Lodge made very clear at the beginning of Left Field\u2019s banner debate this afternoon that the panelists would not be discussing \u201cwhy racism is bad\u201d. The speakers \u2013 Matthew Collins from Hope Not Hate, Faiza Shaheen from the think tank Class, Sheffield\u2019s enigmatic Lord Mayor, Majid, and Amos Schonfeld, founder of youth movement Our Second Home \u2013 have done enough of that in the past. Instead, this discussion was geared towards action and solutions, exploring what resistance means in an age when far-right ideology is becoming ever more mainstream. On banning or no-platforming as a tactic for fighting back, Majid spoke on his headline-grabbing move to ban Donald Trump from the city of Sheffield during a state visit: \u201cYes, America are our friends, but when my friend\u2019s being a prick I say, \u2018Mate, get your shit together.\u2019\u201d Others spoke on the importance of compassion and celebrating difference. Shaheen, who is standing against Iain Duncan Smith in Chingford in the next general election, partly as a protest against his \u201cincredibly cruel\u201d welfare reforms, said that she had found herself redressing her assumptions about people when doorstepping Ukip voters, and finding them open to changing their minds. \u201cJust in having that conversation, and being humanised \u2026 You\u2019d be surprised by how far you can engage with some people.\u201d The most important point iterated by each panelist, though, was a need to challenge hateful rhetoric wherever and whenever we see it, even if that means responding to \u201cendless abuse, diet tips and death threats\u201d on Twitter, as it does for activist Matt Collins. \u201cWe have to stand up for what we believe.\u201d For Majid, just being visible and consistently true to his core beliefs is a way of fighting hate. When his appointment as mayor instigated abuse, he says: \u201cI suddenly realised my mere existence was a form of resistance.\u201d Despite facing racist hate mail, he refused to tone down his politics. \u201cI\u2019m a black Muslim refugee immigrant \u2013 how can I not be political? If you\u2019re trying to be anyone\u2019s cup of tea, you might as well be a mug.\u201d If Glastonbury needed a wake up call on its last day then Finland\u2019s Alma is here to deliver it: her brand of brash agit-pop, delivered in a throat-lacerating roar, could resuscitate the dead. \u201cDance, fucking dance,\u201d she sings within the first two minutes, prowling the stage like an off duty Cyberdog employee \u2013 all lime green hair, matching silk shirt and skull jewellery. \u201cYou\u2019re crazy for being awake this early,\u201d she says correctly, before she performs the pulsating Cowboy and a giant picture of her with two middle fingers raised flashes up on the screen. At times the angst feels a little forced \u2013 the appropriately named Good Vibes is too buoyant to be delivered angrily \u2013 but the congregation of young girls in the front row can\u2019t get enough. It\u2019s also perfect pop for a genre-agnostic new generation with the self-aggrandising Legend fusing hip-hop and big crunchy rock guitars, while EDM drops are sprinkled throughout M\u00d8 collaboration Dance Wiv Me. If occasionally on record it can veer a little too close to generic radio fodder \u2013 and there\u2019s still a sense that she\u2019s scrambling for a hit \u2013 in a live scenario it\u2019s emboldened by Alma\u2019s untiring stage presence. Cas, 54, and Sue, 60 Sue: \u201cThis is a once in a lifetime experience \u2013 I\u2019ve wanted to come forever and luckily a mate got tickets at the last minute. I\u2019m celebrating my 60th birthday this year and I can\u2019t think of anything better than being at the front for Kylie. It\u2019s sad that she had to cancel her last performance here because she was ill so it\u2019ll be emotional having her back \u2013 I can\u2019t wait to dance along with her.\u201d Gemma, 34 \u201cKylie\u2019s been my idol since I was really young \u2013 I used to dress like her when we had mufti days at school! This is my first Glastonbury and I just can\u2019t believe my luck that she\u2019s playing \u2013 I want to get as close as possible. I love everything about her.\u201d Joanne, 35 \u201cKylie just doesn\u2019t do bad tunes, does she? She\u2019s a true legend and I want to be front and centre when she\u2019s on. There\u2019s something so special about being at the front of the Pyramid Stage \u2013 last time I saw the Jacksons and shed a tear, so I\u2019m sure Kylie will be just as special.\u201d Michelle, 53, Shona, 44 Michelle: \u201cWe\u2019ve come all the way from Australia for Glastonbury and it\u2019s amazing that Kylie\u2019s playing. I\u2019ve seen her three times and each time she\u2019s totally smashed it. I once did a Kylie flash mob at the Royal Opera House in Sydney. How amazing that she\u2019s come back to perform after she cancelled because she was ill before \u2013 she\u2019s going to get all the love she needs from us and this crowd.\u201d Luke, 25 \u201cI just don\u2019t want to go home \u2013 everyone\u2019s feeling the blues today so I\u2019m really excited to dance to Kylie, it\u2019ll be a massive pick-me-up. She\u2019s got such a great back catalogue of fun bangers \u2013 her performance is going to keep me going through the next week when I\u2019m back home and just want to be back here.\u201d Anyone stumbling back to their tent after an all-nighter at the stone circle must have thought they were experiencing a divine intervention: the sound of beautiful choral music spilling across the Pyramid stage field. It\u2019s emanating from Langa Methodist Church Choir, a Cape Town choir that the Eavises met during a charity trip and subsequently invited to play this year\u2019s festival \u2013 a serious logistical undertaking involving dozens of artist visas and the kind of effort that very few other festivals would make. Their songs, which ask God to see them and not leave them stranded \u2013 sentiments that will no doubt chime with plenty of hungover festivalgoers \u2013 swell and rise to the back of the field. Dressed in black robes with beautiful detailing like green lipstick and beaded headpieces, they\u2019re accompanied by a single hand drum, which gives these devotionals heft and swaying rhythm. This hit of absolute beauty spiritually realigns the entire site \u2013 leaving it ready to be undone again for one last time tonight. \u201cHad a mooch round the Healing Fields and then decided the most healing thing I could do for myself was to get a vegan masala chai and raw brownie from the cafe at the entrance to the tipi fields and go and lie in a hammock for a bit. Correct decision: the brownie was good, especially for something with no butter in it \u2013 very fudgy and fruity with a decent sprinkling of nuts \u2013 and the chai nicely spiced and not too sweet. They look like they take their coffee pretty seriously too.\u201d One from last night: Earlier on Saturday, Liam Gallagher referred to his set as part of his \u201congoing Glastonbury residency\u201d. Headlining the Other stage, the Chemical Brothers could easily make a similar claim. For anyone who grew up watching Glastonbury on TV, the sound of Hey Boy, Hey Girl throbbing across montages of Worthy Farm is a familiar one. So there\u2019s a built-in nostalgia to their set, amplified by the dusky sky, the constant smoky pop of flares being lit and a high density of Glastonbury\u2019s iconic flags \u2013 but not to the degree that the crowd are twiddling their thumbs waiting for the hits. The material from new album No Geography is just as joyfully chaotic as the stuff from their heyday \u2013 chemical explosions of bright synths girded by twisted robot yowls. They pull off bold, breathless transitions, from ravey sirens that bark like an orchestra of seals into sharply overdriven, twinkly brightness, the effect akin to being dropped off a cliff. Saturate, from 2007\u2019s We Are the Night, is luscious and overwhelming, a powerful jazz drumbeat thrashing amid its hopeful ascending synths. With Tom Rowlands and Ed Simons ensconced in a flight deck\u2019s worth of synths, the visuals transmit the playfulness at the heart of their music \u2013 a new song, Got to Keep On, has the best of the lot, a kind of silky pink Michelin man made of petals swaggering along a treadmill. Nothing, obviously, is as visceral as their admirably spare deployment of the hits: they tease Hey Boy, Hey Girl with a flirty intro, then trigger that roiling beat and helter-skelter cry \u2013 \u201cHere we go!\u201d; Galvanise still sounds regally intimidating. It\u2019s easy to overlook the Chems as their hipper, more avant-garde successors take over \u2013 as they should \u2013 but in their spiritual home, they prove why they\u2019ll always be Britain\u2019s beloved rave dads. Tara Asher Tara Asher went viral this weekend for her BSL interpretation of Stormzy\u2019s headline slot. Speaking to the Guardian before the set, she explained how being a lifelong grime fan prepared her for the show: \u201cSign language is my first language \u2013 I\u2019ve got family members who are deaf. But I never even considered going into [interpreting music] until going to a couple of festivals with my deaf friends, and then I saw the need for it. There\u2019s not many interpreters who interpret music and do festivals, there\u2019s a shortage nationally. Not all deaf people are into music, there are some who are and some who aren\u2019t, the same way that not every single hearing person wants to go to a music festival. I know that a couple of Stormzy\u2019s biggest deaf fans are here, so it\u2019s really nice to know that they\u2019re going to get a wonderful experience. \u201cI\u2019ve listened to grime music since the Risky Roadz days, since the very beginning, so it\u2019s easier for me, because I understand the context, the slang, all that stuff. Yes, grime is often faster, but sometimes you may get a rock song that\u2019s very difficult to convey in sign language. But each to their own. I like to stick with grime.\u201d Benjamin Gorman DeafZone volunteer Benajmin Gorman is the first deaf BSL interpreter to work at Glastonbury. On Friday, he interpreted Bastille\u2019s Pyramid stage set for a deaf audience. He told the Guardian: \u201cGlastonbury is a fantastic music festival, but it\u2019s not just about the music; it\u2019s about the atmosphere, it\u2019s about the camaraderie, and also the lovely food we\u2019re surrounded by, and the bit too much sun we\u2019re experiencing. Festivals aren\u2019t always just about the music, it\u2019s about the overall experience of being part and parcel of the festival, and [interpreting is] about a deaf person being able to take part in that. There are various levels of hearing a person might have. Some deaf people have some residual hearing and can hear quite well; some have no residual hearing but they can experience music through vibrations. Also, the atmosphere really makes you connect with the acts and the artists. So a festival is an experience in itself. \u201cThe important thing is access. For deaf people, they deserve to have the same experience as anybody else who pays for a ticket to go to a festival. For myself, I think we need to show that deaf people are capable of [interpreting] as well.\u201d Good morning from the blessedly cool Guardian cabin where constitutions are slightly fragile but morale remains high. On a scale of \u201cStone circle dweller\u201d to \u201cBrandon Flowers on the main stage\u201d, our appearances may hew closer to the former, but we\u2019re doing our best to bring some of the Killers\u2019 Vegas razzle-dazzle to today\u2019s liveblog. Before that kicks off in earnest, let\u2019s revisit their five-star performance \u2013 with its guest spots from Pet Shop Boys and Johnny Marr \u2013 which Alexis Petridis declared a bona fide Glastonbury Moment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
