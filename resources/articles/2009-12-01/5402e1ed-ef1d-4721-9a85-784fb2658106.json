It was Worcester's third in a row, but this time they managed to score a try; sort of. They were awarded a penalty try, 12 minutes into the second half, after a series of five-metre scrums resulted in Irish being penalised, first for collapsing and then for boring in. Boring was the word on a grim, gruesome, ugly afternoon. The law states a penalty try is awarded on the basis that a try would probably have been scored but for the offending team's indiscipline. But there is little probable about Worcester scoring tries: they had not managed one in the league since October \u2013 more than five hours of nothing but Willie Walker penalties. Irish are feted for their uninhibited approach, but even they have been strait-jacketed in this season's defensive deadlock. That they started the day in second position in the Premiership was more down to their defence than attack: they had not conceded a try in the league for more than six hours. Scoring sequences in multiples of three beckoned, only for a frenzy of action in seven second-half minutes to break the pattern. First, Irish's peripatetic wing, John Rudd \u2013 who has agreed a contract to remain with the club for the rest of the season \u2013 came into the midfield and, spotting a second row and a prop in front of him, ran between Craig Gillies and Tevita Taumoepeau on his way to the line. The unexpected score gave Irish the lead for the first time and, in past seasons, it might have been the cue for Worcester to collapse. But, having held the leaders, Saracens, the week before, they forced a five-metre scrum and rumbled their way to the line before \u2013 with the referee playing advantage \u2013 Johnny Arr picked up the ball, a yard out. A second scrum went down and the third resulted in Irish being penalised for boring in and sent under their own posts. The opening period had given no indication of the excitement to come. Even though Irish twice had a man advantage, with Greg Rawlinson and Tom Wood given stints in the sin-bin, they only threatened once, when Ryan Lamb jinked into the Warriors' 22, only to throw what would have been a try-scoring pass to Peter Hewat, on the right wing, into touch. It was closer than Worcester came. They were presented with an opportunity when Elvis Seveali'i, his mind numbed by the general lack of brain activity, took a quick drop-out on the edge of his 22 and immediately lost the ball, only for Worcester to concede a penalty in the scramble for possession. Otherwise, it was kick and chase, with the Worcester full-back, Chris Latham, showing how a working knowledge of Australian Rules is a considerable advantage these days. He twice rose higher than his opposite number, Jamie Lennard, and his kick returns were more effective than anyone else's, but his team-mates struggled to hold on to the ball. With the scrum again a sickly smorgasbord of resets, penalties and free-kicks, and the breakdown a mess of players off their feet, play was generally condensed into a narrow channel. Irish lost the aerial assault, but won the battle on the ground. After Lamb had tied the scores with 16 minutes to go, Irish missed the chance to regain the lead when Hewat missed a 30-metre drop goal and Worcester finished the stronger. They won an attacking line-out, only to be penalised for charging over a ruck, and they were on the attack in the final minute after Lamb's kick presented Latham with the chance to kick Irish to within seven yards of their line. Then, after the home side had secured the ball with time up, Paul Hodgson opted to chip, rather than boot, the ball dead. The Warriors reclaimed possession, but, rather than manoeuvre themselves into position for a drop goal, they took play through four phases before Arr chipped into the Irish 22. Miles Benjamin reacted quickly, but the ball bounced over his head.
