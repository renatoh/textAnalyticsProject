Jack Airey was hired as a special adviser against the backdrop of Dominic Cummings\u2019 shake-up of the Downing Street apparatus. Yet a report co-authored by him and published in January by the thinktank Policy Exchange is regarded as a precursor of the overhaul announced on Thursday. In Rethinking the Planning System for the 21st Century, Airey sketched out plans for a bonfire of red tape and a future in which \u201cdevelopment rules should be clear and non-negotiable\u201d. Throwing out the notion that specific uses should be attached to individual private land plots, he wrote, \u201cMarket conditions should instead determine how urban space is used in the development zone.\u201d Before that report, he had also been regarded as one of the drivers of a \u201cbuilding beautiful\u201d agenda, co-authoring in 2018 a Policy Exchange paper with the late Conservative philosopher Roger Scruton. Thursday\u2019s white paper owes much to the recommendations of a Building Better, Building Beautiful Commission subsequently chaired by Scruton, which called for measures to \u201cend ugliness\u201d and a planning \u201cfast track for beauty\u201d. Though coming from a thinktank known for its rightwing tilt, and as a platform for strongly pro-Brexit positions, Airey himself does not fit with the caricature some on the left might be tempted to paint. He has, for example, pushed back at the notion that immigration has been at the centre of the housing crisis and called for the building of new homes rather than \u201cpulling up the drawbridge\u201d. Nevertheless, he has spoken of his surprise at feeling what he described as the \u201cfull throttle of some parts of the architectural community\u201d, following his work with Scruton. \u201cI knew it existed but I was taken aback by some of the things some people have said,\u201d he recalled in one interview with an architect\u2019s podcast, in which he spoke of his proposals being labelled \u201cfascistic\u201d. Judging by the initial reaction to the government\u2019s white paper, his latest ideas might yet become the focus of even greater heat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
