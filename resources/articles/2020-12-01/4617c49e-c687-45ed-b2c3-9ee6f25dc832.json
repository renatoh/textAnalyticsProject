Le Carr\u00e9 explored the gap between the west\u2019s high-flown rhetoric of freedom and the gritty reality of defending it, in novels such as The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy and The Night Manager, which gained him critical acclaim and made him a bestseller around the world. On Sunday, his family confirmed he had died of pneumonia at the Royal Cornwall Hospital on Saturday night. \u201cWe all deeply grieve his passing,\u201d they wrote in a statement. His longtime agent Jonny Geller described him as \u201can undisputed giant of English literature. He defined the cold war era and fearlessly spoke truth to power in the decades that followed \u2026 I have lost a mentor, an inspiration and most importantly, a friend. We will not see his like again.\u201d His peers lined up to pay tribute. Stephen King wrote: \u201cThis terrible year has claimed a literary giant and a humanitarian spirit.\u201d Robert Harris said the news had left him \u201cvery distressed \u2026 one of the great postwar British novelists, and an unforgettable, unique character.\u201d Adrian McKinty described Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy as \u201cquite simply the greatest spy novel ever written\u201d, while historian Simon Sebag Montefiore called him \u201cthe titan of English literature up there with the greats \u2026 in person, captivating and so kind and generous to me and many others.\u201d Born as David Cornwell in 1931, Le Carr\u00e9 began working for the secret services while studying German in Switzerland at the end of the 1940s. After teaching at Eton he joined the British Foreign Service as an intelligence officer, recruiting, running and looking after spies behind the Iron Curtain from a back office at the MI5 building on London\u2019s Curzon Street. Inspired by his MI5 colleague, the novelist John Bingham, he began publishing thrillers under the pseudonym of John le Carr\u00e9 \u2013 despite his publisher\u2019s advice that he opt for two Anglo-Saxon monosyllables such as \u201cChunk-Smith\u201d. A spy modelled on Bingham, who was \u201cbreathtakingly ordinary \u2026 short, fat, and of a quiet disposition\u201d, outwits an East German agent in Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s 1961 debut, Call for the Dead, the first appearance of his most enduring character, George Smiley. A second novel, 1962\u2019s A Murder of Quality, saw Smiley investigating a killing at a public school and was reviewed positively. (\u201cVery complex, superior whodunnit,\u201d was the Observer\u2019s conclusion.) But a year later, when his third thriller was published, Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s career surged to a whole new level. Smiley is only a minor figure in The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, but this story of a mission to confront East German intelligence is filled with his world-weary cynicism. According to Alec Leamas, the fiftysomething agent who is sent to East Berlin, spies are just \u201ca squalid procession of vain fools, traitors, too, yes; pansies, sadists and drunkards, people who play cowboys and Indians to brighten their rotten lives\u201d. Graham Greene hailed it as \u201cthe best spy story I have ever read.\u201d According to Le Carr\u00e9, the novel\u2019s runaway success left him at first astonished and then conflicted. His manuscript had been approved by the secret service because it was \u201csheer fiction from start to finish\u201d, he explained in 2013, and so couldn\u2019t possibly represent a breach in security. \u201cThis was not, however, the view taken by the world\u2019s press, which with one voice decided that the book was not merely authentic but some kind of revelatory Message From The Other Side, leaving me with nothing to do but sit tight and watch, in a kind of frozen awe, as it climbed the bestseller list and stuck there, while pundit after pundit heralded it as the real thing.\u201d Smiley moved centre stage in three novels Le Carr\u00e9 published in the 1970s, charting the contest between the portly British agent and his Soviet nemesis, Karla. In Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, he unmasks a mole in the highest echelons of the British secret service, while in The Honourable Schoolboy he goes after a money laundering operation in Asia, before piecing together Karla\u2019s Swiss connections in Smiley\u2019s People. The world of \u201cferrets\u201d and \u201clamplighters\u201d, \u201cwranglers\u201d and \u201cpavement artists\u201d was so convincingly drawn that his former colleagues at MI5 and MI6 began to adopt Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s invented jargon as their own. As the cold war came to a close, friends would stop him in the street and ask: \u201cWhatever are you going to write now?\u201d But Le Carr\u00e9\u2019s concerns were always broader than the confrontation between east and west, and he had little patience for the idea that the fall of the Berlin Wall signalled any kind of end either for history or the espionage that greased its mechanisms. He tackled the arms trade in 1993 with The Night Manager, big pharma in 2001 with The Constant Gardener and the war on terror in 2004 with Absolute Friends. Meanwhile, a steady stream of his creations made their way from page to screen. Actors including Richard Burton, Alec Guinness, Ralph Fiennes and Gary Oldman relished the subtleties of his characterisation even as audiences applauded the deftness of his plotting. Le Carr\u00e9 returned to Smiley for the last time in 2017, closing the circle of his career in A Legacy of Spies, which revisits the botched operation at the heart of the novel that made his name. Writing in the Guardian, John Banville hailed his ingenuity and skill, declaring that \u201cnot since The Spy has Le Carr\u00e9 exercised his gift as a storyteller so powerfully and to such thrilling effect\u201d. After decades of being painted as a shadowy, mysterious figure, mainly for his uninterest in publicity or joining the festival circuit, Le Carr\u00e9 surprised the world in 2016 by releasing a memoir, The Pigeon Tunnel. Detailing his fractured relationship with an abusive, conman father and a lonely upbringing after his mother abandoned him aged five, Le Carr\u00e9 detailed the strange life of a spy-turned-author, being asked to lunches by Margaret Thatcher and Rupert Murdoch. Having spent four decades living in Cornwall, married twice and raising four sons, including Nicholas, who would write novels himself under the name Nick Harkaway, Le Carr\u00e9 conceded: \u201cI have been neither a model husband nor a model father, and am not interested in appearing that way.\u201d The consistent love of his life was writing, \u201cscribbling away like a man in hiding at a poky desk\u201d. \u201cOut of the secret world I once knew I have tried to make a theatre for the larger worlds we inhabit,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFirst comes the imagining, then the search for reality. Then back to the imagining, and to the desk where I\u2019m sitting now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
