Tension between corporations and their institutional owners is on the rise. Subliminally, at least, industrialists' ire at the intrusions of investors must be stoked by the sorry state of much of the investment industry. Fund manager, heal thyself. It has long been a beef of business people that the professional investors who control their destiny have rarely experienced life at the coal face. That they are often young, well paid and opinionated only adds to the sense of injustice colouring executives' attitudes towards them. The righteous indignation of some industrialists has flimsy foundations. They also may have wielded a pen at business school rather than a spanner on an assembly line on the way up the corporate ladder. Their ability to analyse investment opportunities dispassionately, and to compare them across industries and geographies, may be slight. Investing in and running a business are two very different jobs, even if the financial ratios employed in both constitute a common language between those who pursue them. Every industry is prone to promoting its best practitioners to its positions of greatest power, regardless of their ability to manage. Indeed, such is the propensity to reward success on the floor with the keys to high office, that senior executives without direct experience of their industry are viewed with great suspicion. The difficult economic, and investment, climate of recent years has exacerbated the tendency to prize industry-specific knowledge above general managerial skills. It is no coincidence that the value of an MBA is in sharp decline. Business schools which turned out cookie-cutter MBA graduates by the score in the 80s and 90s are struggling to find sources of revenue to replace the income from young thrusters, who no longer see an MBA as a prerequisite of success. The danger for corporates is that they allow the pendulum of power to swing too far back towards the practitioner-managers. There is evidence that the fund management industry encourages this trend, insisting that a great retailer be at the helm of a troubled high street chain or that an oil sector veteran rescue an ailing exploration company. Too frequently, a deep understanding of an industry is considered sufficient to cope with complex managerial and financial challenges. When these hurdles trip the industrial expert, a reputation is sullied and fund managers are left tending the scar on their portfolio performance. The main battleground between industry and investors at present is corporate governance. Companies are asked not merely to deliver good financial performance, but to do so within a prescribed organisational and ethical framework. Fund managers poke away at perceived miscreants and backsliders. These non-conformists, by return, perceive themselves to be persecuted for minor technical offences when they should be applauded for their industrial success. Some of the most vocal critics of companies who fall short of the highest standards of governance work for fund management organisations whose own workings are impenetrable or that are palpably failing as businesses. Most of these are unlisted companies with no obligation to explain their workings in public or apologise for poor commercial performance. However, formal and moral obligations may be very different. It is one thing to verbally skewer an industrialist while at the same time managing one's own business autocratically and/or poorly. It is quite another to expect said industrialist to treat your assault with the respect you think it merits. Traditional fund managers are in a state of disarray. Their star employees are leaving to set up hedge fund boutiques. Many have failed to deliver satisfactory investment performance, losing assets to low cost index-tracker managers as a consequence. The majority are either unprofitable or are producing an unsatisfactory return. One chief executive of a leading fund manager this week told me his business only had to stand still to be a clear winner in the current climate. He cited Deutsche Asset Management's attempted sale as only the high profile tip of an enormous industrial iceberg. In the case of DeAM, the fund manager said that those leading the sale are not, by background, fund managers. This, though, is not an advertisement for more practitioner-managers in asset management - there are more than enough already. Rather, it is a wake-up call for an industry that is in the managerial dark ages, but which continues to insist on telling others what good management looks like. \u00b7 Edmond Warner is chief executive of IFX Group edmond.warner@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
