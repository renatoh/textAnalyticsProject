If English rugby is suddenly thriving again now the choke grip of a home World Cup has been released, Saracens are the standard bearers. After this eight-try demolition of Oyonnax, featuring a hat-trick for Chris Ashton, they will enjoy their Christmas unbeaten at the top of the Premiership and unbeaten at the top of Pool One in Europe \u2013 39 tries for, seven against. No wonder Eddie Jones has been watching. Even then they were perfect. Where Bristol and Northampton railed at the way the RFU has gone about putting together a coaching panel for England, Saracens released their man, Paul Gustard, with no complaint and an outpouring of love and affection. Among those players at the top of their game is Jamie George, Saracens\u2019 powerful hooker, who gallivanted around against Oyonnax as if he were a three-quarter. And here is what he had to say on the news that Gustard would be joining England at the end of January. \u201cWe\u2019ve all got a huge amount of respect for Guzzy. All the work he\u2019s done here is a huge part of what this club is. It\u2019s very disappointing for us but we\u2019re so happy for him. He massively deserves it. Defensively we\u2019ve been one of the best teams consistently in the last six seasons of the Premiership. We\u2019re renowned for our defence and Guzzy is the main part of that. I have no doubt he\u2019ll have every success with England.\u201d George might have reason to be miffed with some of the mischief and rumour that has been following Jones round like a bad smell. The latest whispers have it that England\u2019s new head coach is interested in Dylan Hartley as captain. George would be forgiven if he demanded to know just what he had to do to muscle past the hookers who always seem to be ahead of him in the national team\u2019s pecking order despite his consistently superior form. But even here, like his club, he is immaculate. \u201cI\u2019m pretty used to it,\u201d he says with a shrug and a laugh. \u201cI can\u2019t worry about that. It\u2019s completely out of my control. Nothing\u2019s been announced yet. Dylan\u2019s a great player but I\u2019m happy with the way I\u2019ve been playing. I\u2019ve just got to make sure that I keep playing well and hopefully selection will come off the back of it.\u201d If he is good off the field George crowned his performance on it with a turn of pace for Saracens\u2019 seventh try which compared with the one he scored in the Premiership final last season. Charlie Hodgson picked him out with a pass so perfect the Oyonnax midfield opened like a department store on Boxing Day. George galloped to the try line 30 metres away. \u201cI blacked out, I think. It was a great pass from Charlie. I just closed my eyes, hoped for the best and managed to make it.\u201d That try, bringing up a 48-6 scoreline on the hour, set the stage for Ashton\u2019s hat-trick score, claimed with four minutes remaining, but everyone was in on the carnival act. Supporters thought they saw a goose-step from Brad Barritt at one point; Mako Vunipola kept stepping in at fly-half with no noticeable disruption; Owen Farrell shimmied and ghosted as if he were Phil Bennett. Farrell\u2019s father, Andy, has made way for Gustard as England\u2019s defence coach. Farrell Jr, though, has not been consoling the old man. \u201cI don\u2019t need to,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough bloke. He takes it for what it is and he moves on.\u201d He may yet move on back to Saracens, to the role he left for his England job. \u201cWe\u2019ve a very clear idea of what we\u2019ll do,\u201d said Mark McCall of how to replace Gustard, \u201cbut we think it right that we wait for that to be confirmed and share it with the players first.\u201d A job at Saracens just now would feel very different from the one Farrell Sr has left behind.
