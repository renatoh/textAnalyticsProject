That\u2019s globalisation for you, but that\u2019s also the grip that our favourite TV characters have on our wardrobes. Anyone who has been watching the second series of Killing Eve cannot fail to have noticed the bold, stylish and often bizarre outfits worn by Jodie Comer\u2019s Russian assassin character, Villanelle. Many of the items she wears, from her velvet jumpsuits to satin coats to silk dressing gowns, are selling out despite the designer price tags. And there\u2019s a trickle down. The internet is awash with advice on how to replicate her \u201cto die for\u201d looks in a way that\u2019s kinder to purses, while websites such as Etsy are coming up with lookalike clothes. This is nothing new. Debra McGuire spent 10 years designing the popular outfits on Friends. She cites Mary Tyler Moore, Lucille Ball and Hitchcock films as evidence of the small screen\u2019s impact on style. Fans of My So-Called Life have sulked and yearned in plaid shirts; The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air viewers have stuffed their wardrobes with tracksuits and Air Jordans; Twin Peaks aficionados will have knotted cherry stalks in Audrey Horne\u2019s daywear, while Gossip Girl fans might have hatched plans in Blair Waldorf headbands. In the past decade, there has been Scandi-noir knitwear, the power-suits of The Good Wife and maximalism \u00e0 la Cookie Lyon in the hip-hop drama Empire. What is relatively new, however, is being able to shop from our sofas which is blurring the line between watching TV and consuming. Hands can slip from remotes to mobiles \u2013 and buying a bikini just spotted in the Love Island villa is little more effort than turning the volume up. And, just as it has become easier to contact our favourite authors to tell them how that one line made everything slot into place, so too can people tweet costume designers directly. \u201cI get asked about the Fleabag jumpsuit and red floral dress a lot,\u201d says Ray Holman, the costume designer behind Fleabag and Doctor Who. McGuire \u2013 perhaps in part down to the Netflix effect as Friends is the world\u2019s most streamed show \u2013 gets about 10 emails a week from people wanting to know where they can find the guys\u2019 T-shirts or Rachel\u2019s yellow dress. She answers when she can: \u201cI just get such a kick out of it.\u201d Traditionally this interest in TV threads was something Holman saw in science fiction, with its links to cosplay, where people dress up as their favourite characters. The first time he noticed mainstream audiences clamouring for his clothes was when he worked on the BBC One drama Apple Tree Yard. \u201cEmily Watson played a well-dressed woman in her 50s \u2013 suddenly I was doing interviews about where her clothes were from.\u201d Then there was the \u00a338 black jumpsuit worn by Phoebe Waller-Bridge\u2019s character in Fleabag, which sold out in the space of a day after appearing on the show. Holman thinks a lot of the cacophony over female characters\u2019 costumes \u2013 he does get some chat about men\u2019s, but not as much \u2013 is because of the \u201ctype of woman that\u2019s being written about. Their lives resonate with the viewers\u201d. He remembers the chatter around the professional women he dressed in Abi Morgan\u2019s gritty divorce drama The Split. If there are more female characters living the kinds of lives viewers are living, so the costumes will influence what could actually be hanging in women\u2019s wardrobes. The fashion psychologist Shakaila Forbes-Bell understands the lure of a fictional character\u2019s look. She identified with one of the central characters, Molly, on Issa Rae\u2019s American comedy drama series Insecure \u2013 \u201ca very powerful woman, very true to her culture and roots \u2013 as a black woman I really identify with that\u201d. Forbes-Bell soon found herself on a \u201cwhat this character wore\u201d website. \u201cI thought, \u2018I need to find this\u2019. I followed her stylist on Instagram.\u201d When, in line with the character, she on occasion dressed in a more tailored way, it worked: \u201cI definitely felt like I embodied that confidence.\u201d Even when characters seem a far cry from anyone we know, borrowing an aesthetic becomes an attempt to borrow some of their traits. Comer\u2019s character may enjoy killing people, but she also has something many women more typically aspire to. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to fade into the background any more,\u201d says Forbes-Bell. With her clothes, Villanelle is making the point that she refuses to go unheard. Don a frou frou pink frilly frock such as the standout Villanelle outfit from the first Killing Eve series and you might just borrow a slice of her up-and-at-them spirit. \u201cThe easiest way to take charge is through your clothing,\u201d says Forbes-Bell. When we identify with someone on TV, \u201cthey are more easily absorbed into our sense of self because they are animated and have lives and characters we can aspire to,\u201d says Carolyn Mair, author of The Psychology of Fashion. Take the Friends characters Monica, Rachel and Phoebe. They are, relatively speaking, rounded. We know how Monica likes her tomatoes: Julienne; how many sub-categories of towel she has: 11; and that she once ate the macaroni off a homemade jewellery box. Which means that to those who empathise with her, her stonewashed denim and crop tops will pack a specific punch. We buy into telly characters\u2019 clothes because we buy into them as \u201cpeople\u201d. To get us to believe in characters\u2019 costumes, designers will go to great lengths. When Kimberly Adams was planning outfits for Stranger Things, she trawled through middle school yearbooks from near Indiana, where the show is set. She says: \u201cI made sure all the influences in people\u2019s closets didn\u2019t seem like a fashion magazine version of clothes people wore.\u201d This is how she explains the \u201cBarbara effect\u201d, in which the bad jeans, big glasses-wearing character, who was only briefly on screen, became a style sensation. But along with accessibility, the most irresistible wardrobes often belong to those with the most out-of-reach lifestyles. How could Sex and the City\u2019s Carrie Bradshaw afford that flat and all those shoes? \u201cShe had a lifestyle many aspired to but would never be able to experience in reality,\u201d says Mair. This goes a long way to explaining why TV characters can have such a potent effect \u2013 more so than the people paid to make us want to buy clothes: models. \u201cTV characters will become a fashion icon if they represent something we can become,\u201d says Aurore Bardey, a lecturer in consumer psychology at London College of Fashion. \u201cIf we want to be happy, our ideal self needs to fit with our real self.\u201d Take Killing Eve: \u201cAs beautiful as she is, she\u2019s a character \u2013 she\u2019s a funny serial killer, which is intriguing. She has a lack of social skills that we can identify with.\u201d Unlike with most models, we have ample opportunity to really buy into TV characters. \u201cIf you want to spend the entire day watching Friends and looking at your ideal self,\u201d says Bardey, \u201cthen you can.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
