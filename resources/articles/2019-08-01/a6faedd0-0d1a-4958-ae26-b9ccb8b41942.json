On the eve of Thursday\u2019s friendly against Belgium, the manager said: \u201cI wanted to win so badly. I think that had an effect on me personally when we went to the third- and fourth\u2011place play-off, because I was always brought up to believe that winning was everything and I still believe that now. \u201cBut coming back with a win is better than a defeat. So that game is probably something I didn\u2019t handle well. I was probably the worst out of anybody, because I was judging us against first. So on reflection, looking at the Olympics and beyond that, we want to win, but going to the Olympics and getting on that podium has to be something that we look at.\u201d Neville still believes the extra game should not exist. \u201cI\u2019ve never liked third- or fourth-place games. It was 1990 and Italy were dancing on the stage after; it wasn\u2019t a final. I don\u2019t like the game and neither do my players \u2013 we\u2019ve spoken about it. We wanted to win gold. Should I have said \u2018nonsense\u2019? Probably not, but it was my feeling at the time.\u201d Neville\u2019s drive to instil a winning mentality has meant that, for his players, bronze would not have been good enough, and the goalkeeper Carly Telford is open about that. \u201cAs a collective we felt we were a failure,\u201d she said. \u201cI think Phil was quite open about that when he responded to the bronze\u2011medal match. \u201cI don\u2019t think he worded it correctly but I think he meant we came to win a gold medal and we didn\u2019t and therefore anything else wasn\u2019t going to be good enough. I think even if we had won bronze it wasn\u2019t better than what we had done previously.\u201d Nonetheless Telford thinks England have progressed since their third place at the 2015 World Cup. \u201cI\u2019d say arguably yes, we\u2019ve played a better style of football, we beat opposition that were good quite comfortably but when it came to those final margins and hurdles we weren\u2019t good enough.\u201d For Telford the Olympics is a different story, with a medal of any colour meaning more. \u201cAs a footballer you never really think of being an Olympian because it\u2019s not on our agenda or within our sport. But now to be classed, if you\u2019re selected, as an Olympian is one of the greatest honours in sport and to have the opportunity to represent Great Britain and women\u2019s sport in Tokyo would be an amazing opportunity and help keep people watching women\u2019s football.\u201d With England hosting Euro 2021, they have no competitive fixtures before then. The fight for an Olympic place, though, adds much needed competitiveness to the game here and the match next Tuesday in Norway. \u201cFor the Olympics I can only pick 18 players \u2013 and that\u2019s not 18 England players, that\u2019s 18 home nation players,\u201d Neville said. \u201cSo they know they are going to have to hit certain barometers, certain testing, certain levels, to actually make an 18-player squad. So they can\u2019t waste a minute. I\u2019ve seen my players come back with incredible desire to do better. The hurt, the anger, they are going to use that as their fuel.\u201d Neville, having brought in Aoife Mannion, recalled the 170-cap Fara Williams and included the youngsters Sandy McIver and Anna Patten (with more young players also to get a chance in the next three camps), is preparing to fill the gaps in the squad made evident to him at the World Cup. \u201cWe\u2019re building now, a 23-player squad \u2013 18 for the Olympics \u2013 that I can trust to put on that field,\u201d he said. \u201cTournament-ready footballers, it\u2019s really important. And I\u2019ve got to say those characters are the ones that ultimately are more important than ones with unbelievable ability, and that\u2019s ultimately the route we\u2019re going to go down. I pick characters, the durable players, the ones that when the going gets tough, they get up.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
