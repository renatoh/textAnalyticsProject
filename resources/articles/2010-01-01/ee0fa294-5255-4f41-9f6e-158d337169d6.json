Debutant Katie Jarvis is in virtually every scene as the elder daughter of a feckless mother in an Essex tower block. It's the vulnerability in Jarvis that is so impressive, the almost-suppressed pleasure she can't help showing when she gets a little encouragement from Mum's new boyfriend, the versatile Michael Fassbender. This is Wasp writ large, and as good as you'd hope."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
