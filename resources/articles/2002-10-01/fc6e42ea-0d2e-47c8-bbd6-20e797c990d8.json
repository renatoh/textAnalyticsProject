For the first time this season, we've won two league games on the trot. After coming back to beat Torquay at York Street, the lads pulled off a 3-2 win at Darlington with our on-loan midfielder Lee Thompson hitting a hat-trick. I saw him score the winner against Torquay but I'm with the family in La Manga on holiday so I couldn't be at Feethams. I was in constant touch with friends at the ground via phone and text messages. When I heard we were 3-0 up, I was sure we'd win but a couple of late Darlington goals produced an anxious last five minutes. We're now fourth from bottom and although there's a long way to go, those two results are just reward for all the effort that's been put in. I'm particularly delighted for our manager Neil Thompson and his assistant Neil Redfearn. Neil took over at a very difficult time and I was so pleased when he told me after Saturday's game that he would be signing the contract we've offered him. We've still got a few financial problems but the base for a sound and successful \"pilgrims' progress\" has been laid. In a month's time, we're unveiling a plan to restructure the share capital of the club. It's taken a lot of time to prepare and, if it's approved, there'll be an opportunity for anyone with Boston running through their veins to buy shares and help the club move forward. There's scope in the budget for new players when Neil off-loads a few of the current squad. While it's unfortunate that last season's top scorer Daryl Clare wants to go, he'll leave quickly if we receive the right offer. To round off a memorable weekend, the rugby club of which I'm chairman achieved a breakthrough too. After being promoted last season, Ashfield lost all of their three league games but on Saturday won for the first time by beating Leesbrook in the cup. Saturday marked a real turning point for Boston. It's been a long time coming but we're now on our way."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
