The 36-year-old began 2019 with a best supporting actor Oscar nomination for BlacKkKlansman and will end it as the star of three of the year\u2019s most talked-about movies \u2013 The Report, Star Wars: The Rise of Skywalker and Marriage Story. In the months between, he has won rave reviews for his performance in Burn This on Broadway, earning a Tony nomination (he missed out to Bryan Cranston), and been the focus of a series of adoring profiles. An article in the New Yorker alluding to Girls, the TV show that made Driver\u2019s name, branded him the \u201cOriginal Man\u201d. But none of this has happened by chance. Over the past six years, Driver, who has been compared to the great actors of the 70s from Robert De Niro to Dustin Hoffman, has been sought out by some of the world\u2019s most celebrated directors, including Martin Scorsese, Steven Soderbergh, the Coen brothers, Jim Jarmusch, Noah Baumbach and Spike Lee. Scorsese called him \u201cone of the finest, if not the finest [actor] of his generation\u201d. Lee kept it simpler still, saying he cast Driver in BlacKkKlansman because \u201cgame respects game\u201d. Nor does it hurt that those glowing magazine profiles have a propensity for shooting him with his shirt off. An infamous Annie Leibovitz shoot for Vogue in 2013 saw him topless with a goat draped around his neck, his pecs appeal is regularly debated online while a writer on US website the Cut became \u201cso flustered by his quads [in Burn This] that \u2026 I spilled all of the contents of my purse on the floor\u201d. No wonder then that he is increasingly hailed as Hollywood\u2019s latest, if most unlikely, heartthrob. Not that Driver sees it that way. Instead, he has repeatedly stressed he has no interest in being a sex symbol, has no social media awareness and had no desire to court the kind of celebrity that a rapid rise to the Hollywood A-list brings. He has described himself as a very \u201cNew York actor\u201d, lives a low-key life in Brooklyn with his wife of six years, Joanne Tucker, and their son, and is increasingly picky about the work he accepts. \u201cThe stakes are different. It really has to be worth it, because you have to be gone a lot,\u201d he told Rolling Stone this month. That\u2019s true to an extent. But, as with most things involving Driver, there is an interesting ambiguity at play. Thus he might not wish to be seen as a heartthrob but he has never shied away from those close-ups of the hyper-buff, 6ft 2in body he first honed as a young man in the US Marines. That earlier career intrigues too. Driver has talked openly of the fact that he signed up to serve in the military after 9/11. admitting that \u201cI was not thinking of politics at all. That enemy was faceless in my mind \u2026 I put my faith in institutions. I wasn\u2019t until later in life that I had perspective.\u201d Born in San Diego, Driver\u2019s family moved to Mishawaka, Indiana, following his parent\u2019s divorce, a difficult experience which the actor has admitted he drew on for his performance in Marriage Story if only because that film\u2019s protagonist, Charlie, behaves in the opposite way to his own father, fighting for custody and making every effort to stay in his young son\u2019s life. His mother\u2019s second marriage to a Baptist preacher saw the young Driver increasingly rebelling against his upbringing. He chafed against the restrictions of the church, dreamed vaguely of becoming an actor and hung out with a similarly bored group of friends making camcorder action movies. Throughout all the teenage ennui, he watched movies made by the likes of Scorsese, Jarmusch and David Fincher, which told stories that challenged him and suggested that there was another world. \u201cThe first time I saw it I felt kind of sick,\u201d he would later say of Fincher\u2019s Fight Club. \u201cIt made me feel very strange. But then I watched it again almost immediately.\u201d Having repeatedly bristled against the authority of religion, he embraced the discipline of the marines, only for his career to end in an early discharge following an injury sustained while off-duty. At a loose end again, he decided to take another chance on those acting dreams (an early audition at 17 had come to nothing), trying out for the prestigious Julliard school in New York. He was accepted \u2013 and became notorious for five-mile runs to college and endless push-ups in the hallways. And there was no holding back his talent. In Girls, his Adam Sackler could have been the archetypal bad boyfriend, a man with a propensity for pushing sexual boundaries while avoiding commitment. Yet Driver gave him a desperate yearning that transformed the character into something far more interesting. Similarly in Jarmusch\u2019s Paterson, his titular character commands the screen while barely uttering a word, his stillness creating an almost claustrophobic intimacy. Alongside the intriguing vulnerability that drives his best performances is an impressive versatility. He has convinced as a doubting Jesuit priest in Scorsese\u2019s Silence, as a goofy Jewish police officer in BlacKkKlansman and as the needy Kylo Ren in the Star Wars saga, a bravura turn which leaves you pitying a villain as much as despising him. In Marriage Story, an updated Kramer vs Kramer which follows playwright Charlie and his actor wife Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) as their marriage disintegrates, he delivers a performance both incredibly precise and beautifully loose, his heartbreaking performance of Stephen Sondheim\u2019s Being Alive arguably the cinematic moment of the year. Far more than a pretty chest then, even if Driver remains agnostic about his success: \u201cDoubt is part of being committed to something,\u201d he told the New Yorker. \u201cI feel that with religion. I feel that with acting. I feel that with marriage. I feel that with being a parent. I\u2019m constantly filled with doubt, regardless of what I\u2019ve accomplished \u2026 You still don\u2019t know anything really.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
