Police had to close roads surrounding St George\u2019s Plateau in the centre of the city when the event, which was organised with only two days notice, attracted large crowds. Carrying banners reading \u201cScousers for Corbyn\u201d and \u201cWe chose Jez\u201d, the Labour leader\u2019s supporters clambered on statues and railings to catch a glimpse of him as he spoke. \u201cI don\u2019t see this leadership contest as a distraction,\u201d said Corbyn. \u201cI see it as a massive opportunity to reach out to people all across this country and have the strength and confidence [to stand up to] those who tell us that nothing we\u2019re trying to do is possible, that what we have to do is compromise with the Tory philosophy and free market ideas and all will be well.\u201d Corbyn told the audience that it was the biggest crowd he had had yet at one of his campaign rallies. \u201cThis is a campaign about, on one level, the leadership of the Labour party, but it\u2019s also a campaign about how we do politics in our society. Is it to be a politics of an elite [\u2026] or is it to be a politics of people expressing their views, their hopes, their aspirations for this generation and the next generation?\u201d In a wide-ranging speech, touching on mental health services, workers\u2019 rights and homelessness, the Labour leader paid tribute to all those who supported the Hillsborough families and \u201cbraved the abuse, the nastiness, the horror of what the Murdoch press can do\u201d. \u201cA year ago, I\u2019m sad to say, our party abstained on the welfare reform bill,\u201d said Corbyn. \u201cNo more are we going to go down that road, no more is that going to be the politics of our party. Our party wants a society that works for all, that reduces inequality, that provides opportunity and hope for the next generation. That is what we\u2019re about.\u201d The rally came on the same day that the Communication Workers Union (CWU) formally endorsed Corbyn\u2019s leadership of the Labour party, his third union endorsement after Aslef and Ucatt. Welcoming the announcement, Corbyn said he was committed to reaching out beyond the party and rejected the idea that he existed in a \u201cremote bubble of adulation\u201d. Taking questions after a speech in which he was introduced as \u201cthe next Labour party leader and the next prime minister of this country\u201d, Corbyn emphasised the importance of interacting with people who did not automatically think like him. \u201cI make sure that I spend usually three days a week travelling around the country campaigning, supporting local parties, meeting people in factories, other workplaces, universities, schools, hospitals, all those places,\u201d Corbyn said. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be effective in politics you\u2019ve got to listen to people, some of whom may not agree with you, some of whom may have criticisms, some of whom may have constructive suggestions for you. The idea that I live in some kind of remote bubble of adulation is nonsense.\u201d Corbyn\u2019s speech came as Owen Smith launched his manifesto for fairness at work, which he said would give working people \u201ca voice, strengthening collective bargaining, tackling exploitation and delivering greater equality\u201d. \u201cThese measures are part of my plan to take Britain from the shameful position of having some of the worst workplace protections in Europe, to having workers\u2019 rights that are the envy of the world,\u201d he said. Smith pledged to repeal the Trade Union Act 2016 immediately upon taking office and to outlaw exclusively foreign recruitment. The plans also include a commitment to restore full collective bargaining powers and end pay freezes in the public sector, as well as the modernisation of union balloting, such as permitting e-balloting in order to increase participation. \u201cAt the core of my radical vision for Labour\u2019s future is a commitment to making tackling inequality the focus of everything our party does,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThis simply can\u2019t be achieved without fairness in the workplace and to make this a reality we need nothing short of a revolution in workers\u2019 rights. Delivering that requires more than just rhetoric, it needs a credible plan.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
