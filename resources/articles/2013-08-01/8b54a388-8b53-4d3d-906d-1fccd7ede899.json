The unsavoury scenes at Deepdale occurred when hundreds of home fans ran out of the stands at the final whistle to celebrate a 1-0 win secured by Tom Clarke's 87th-minute header. It led Blackpool's manager, Paul Ince, to call for a clampdown by the authorities. The Football League and Football Association can be expected to investigate. Several police horses were deployed to restore order and one knocked over and then stood on a steward who was attempting to hold back a supporter in one of the goalmouths. Lancashire Police confirmed it was looking into the incident. The steward was attended to by police and medics, and then taken for an x-ray on an injured shoulder, a Preston spokesman said. \"It's an absolute joke and I wondered if we have enough stewards,\" Ince said. \"You see enough situations where fans run on a pitch and I can understand fans' excitement but there have been enough frightening things that have happened to players that we need to stamp down on it. \"There were three or four hundred Preston fans, so who knows what could have happened? Has it got to take something else to happen before we listen? That's not just Preston but it's the whole football community in general. We need to knuckle down on this. \"We're disappointed as our fans were absolutely fantastic and their behaviour was impeccable. There were no louts on the pitch \u2013 unlike Preston \u2013 and we conducted ourselves in the right manner. We have to take pride from that as a club.\" Clarke's goal gave Preston, who are a league below Blackpool, a first win over their rivals from the Championship since 2008. \"You don't want people to be running on the pitch and I would have preferred them to stay behind as the club might get in trouble over what's happened,\" the Preston manager, Simon Grayson, said. \"But hopefully there's not been too many people seriously injured. \"It was only supporters being boisterous and there was nothing too intense or damage done to anybody as you see how much it meant to everybody at the club. The result shows everybody what it means to the football club. I thought it was a cracking cup tie with a great atmosphere.\" Tom Ince, the Blackpool manager's son, had fluffed his lines when through on goal 18 minutes in and, soon after the interval, the Blackpool forward Angel Martinez just missed the target with a header. Michael Chopra had a golden chance to give Blackpool the lead but his 72nd-minute header bounced into the pitch and over the bar before Clarke headed in Lee Holmes's free-kick."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
