The Heritage Lottery Fund will announce on Thursday that the Dylan Thomas centre in Swansea has been awarded almost \u00a31m in the centenary year of the poet's birth. It effectively secures the centre's future and means a new-look and expanded exhibition can be opened in time to mark Thomas's birthday in October. Carter has been a lifelong fan and opened the centre in 1995. He said: \"Dylan Thomas was one of the greatest poets of the past century and I have always felt an affinity to his poetry and literature. I have continuously advocated the importance of commemorating his life and work and \u2026 it is great to see that this funding will ensure that the Dylan Thomas centre can continue to thrive in years to come.\" The centre hopes to put on display memorabilia normally kept in the archives such as a short, sweet love letter to his long-suffering wife, Caitlin, that was hastily scribbled on the back of a bank paying-in stub. He opens with \"My darling own dear dear Cat, I love you for ever &amp; ever\" and goes on to apologise for the lateness of cheques he has sent her, blaming work. \"I had no time, from the BBC, to get to bank between 10 &amp; 3.\" Also, as part of the project, the centre plans to take on loan Thomas's notebooks which, in 1941, he sold to the University of Buffalo; and an oral histories project is planned to capture the memories of the few people still alive who knew Thomas. Thomas's granddaughter Hannah Ellis said the centre housed the largest collection of Thomas-related material in the world providing \"a unique insight into who my grandfather truly was\". She added: \"I want young and new audiences to be able to learn about and discover my grandfather's poems, his stories and his plays. This grant from the HLF will bring the exhibition into the 21st century and open it up for future generations to enjoy.\" The money will help create a new learning space and expand the existing exhibition space. The centenary of his birth has heightened interest in Thomas, the writer of Under Milk Wood and the man who created some of the finest poems in the English language (\"Do not go gentle into that good night,/ Old age should burn and rave at close of day;/ Rage, rage against the dying of the light\"). A Dylan Thomas season on the BBC will include a new Andrew Davies-scripted drama called A Poet in New York starring Tom Hollander which will explore how he died in November 1953, aged just 39. Wales's first minister, Carwyn Jones, said: \"It's really important that young people are able to understand Dylan Thomas's legacy and to get inspiration from what he did. Here was a young man from Swansea who became one of the most well-known poets in the English-speaking world and it's important that young people draw inspiration from that and follow their own ambitions.\" The HLF is giving \u00a3935,700 to the Dylan Thomas centre which opened in the city's former Guildhall in 1995 and is run in partnership with the University of Wales."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
