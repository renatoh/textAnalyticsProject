And those are just the start of the perils facing the youngest animals in Animal Babies: First Year on Earth (BBC Two). The baby elephant has to contend with an irritated older brother attempting to kick it out of the way; the infant mountain gorilla has to be wary of rival silverbacks. They are so fragile, so vulnerable, it\u2019s a wonder they survive. Many don\u2019t, as we are often reminded. Half of the hyena cubs won\u2019t live to see their first birthday and 60% of macaque babies don\u2019t make it. But let\u2019s not spoil it \u2013 this is uplifting, emotional telly with a soothing narration by the actor Wunmi Mosaku, in whose voice you can often hear a smile. If you\u2019re the sort of person who wells up at One Born Every Minute (I am), you will find much to swell the heart here. In Kenya, a newborn elephant calf, Safina, skates on the mud, all wobbly legs \u2013 her mother scoots her along, trunk on bottom. The wildlife camerawoman, Sue Gibson, can\u2019t contain her delight (as well as the baby animals, we meet three camera operators). \u201cPoor little baby,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s so undignified.\u201d They are social animals, \u201cand survival depends on forming these bonds quickly\u201d. Safina and another baby elephant cuddle each other with their trunks. Then there\u2019s alarm as another herd approach, but it\u2019s fine \u2013 it\u2019s Safina\u2019s aunt and the older elephants greet each other warmly, trunks embracing. \u201cThey really look like they\u2019re happy to see each other,\u201d says Gibson. It\u2019s completely lovely. Next, we watch a clan of hyenas, where a dozen cubs have been born. Hyenas don\u2019t tend to come off well in nature documentaries, but here they are adorable and fascinating. They live in a \u201cfemale-led hierarchy\u201d and the alpha female Soup has 12-week-old twin girls, Bisque and Chowder (even their names are cute). They squeak, mewl and follow their mother, learning their place in the hierarchy \u2013 this basically means nipping other cubs, including an older, bigger male. \u201cIt\u2019s really great to see them with the other cubs,\u201d says the thrilled cameraman Vianet Djenguet, \u201cthrowing their weight around.\u201d But there\u2019s danger everywhere: lions will attack hyenas, as will elephants. An elephant charges and the cubs run and hide. \u201cI just have to remind myself that half of those cubs won\u2019t make it,\u201d says Djenguet. Spare a thought, too, for the baby southern sea otters picked off by great white sharks. Sharks don\u2019t tend to eat otters, but they will have a nibble to see if it\u2019s something they might like. And the otters are \u201ctoo small to survive the wounds\u201d \u2013 sharks are responsible for half of otter deaths. Here is a six-week-old sea otter, Limpet (so-called because he won\u2019t leave his mother\u2019s side; he must have an inkling that she plans to abandon him when he is six months old). If Limpet is going to survive, he must learn to dive. But he can\u2019t at the moment because the air trapped in his dense juvenile fur \u2013 more hairs on each square centimetre than on an entire human head \u2013 is acting \u201clike a little lifejacket\u201d. Facts such as this stop the show, the first in a series, feeling like a wasted \u2013 if enjoyable \u2013 afternoon spent watching baby animal videos on the internet. In Sri Lanka, a tiny, hairless toque macaque, named Jazir, has been born to an alpha female. He clings \u2013 a tiny, wrinkled Sm\u00e9agol \u2013 to his mother with little pink fingers. The great white shark equivalent here is lost habitat and its ills. \u201cWhere there are people, there are dogs,\u201d we are told \u2013 and they hunt baby monkeys. There is a panicked moment when the dogs attack, but the mother makes it up the tree in time with Jazir clinging to her. In Uganda, the beautiful Nyakabara, snoozing with her mother, is one of possibly only 50 mountain gorilla babies in the world. These apes climb trees to get to fruit, even though gorillas are heavy (some weigh more than 180kg) and falls kill many. There\u2019s a heart-stopping scene where Nyakabara has to cling to her mother, who is climbing a tree. Then \u2013 no! \u2013 the branch they are on snaps, and they plummet from view. It\u2019s not until the next day that Djenguet and the conservation team track the family and find Nyakabara and her mother have survived. They disappear, baby still clinging on, into the trees. By the time we finish with some Arctic fox cubs emerging from their den in Iceland, I feel I have gorged on sweetness. They gambol, play fight and practise pouncing. The threat of doom is never far away \u2013 the summer is short and so is the food supply \u2013 so you can never truly relax into the adorableness of it all, but there is something so cheering about the babies\u2019 determination and their mothers\u2019 care. Normally, I find the personal observations of wildlife camera operators irritating, but it works here \u2013 mainly because delight is an emotion best shared. When the young sea otter takes his first dive, the proud cameraman Colin Stafford-Johnson says, \u201cIt\u2019s almost like seeing your kid ride a bike for the first time.\u201d When a baby female mountain gorilla beats her chest, mimicking the alpha male, Djenguet says, \u201cYou can\u2019t get any better than that.\u201d I think he may be right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
