That, at any rate, is the thesis of Giles Radice's highly readable book linking the political careers of three Labour rightwingers: Tony Crosland, Roy Jenkins and Denis Healey. Born within three years of one another, these contemporaneous Oxford graduates were certainly academically top-drawer: firsts all round. All three achieved officer rank in the second world war, Crosland and Healey seeing perilous active service overseas and the number-cruncher Jenkins assiduously deciphering German Enigma codes at Bletchley Park. All got into parliament within five years of each other, all climbed backbench and front-bench ladders in opposition slowly but steadily, each in turn became the youngest member of Harold Wilson's 1964 cabinet. In attaining their respective offices in their mid-to-late 40s, however, they were far less precocious than Wilson himself (disdained by all three of them and by Radice, too), who was not only an Oxford first but was appointed to Attlee's cabinet at the age of 31. Jenkins had an impeccable Labour background in south Wales, his father being a miners' leader who eventually became an MP and parliamentary private secretary to Clement Attlee when he was prime minister, and young Roy himself was reverenced as a \"local prince\". Attlee was present at Roy's wedding and commissioned him to edit a volume of his speeches (reproving Roy for failing to acknowledge receipt of a \u00a350 fee). Healey (born in Kent, despite his carefully fostered image as a professional Yorkshireman) became international secretary of the Labour party, working closely with Ernest Bevin, at a time when holding such a post really counted. Crosland, with his \"matinee idol good looks\", became a proteg\u00e9 of the chancellor of the exchequer, Hugh Dalton, who embarrassed Tony with his cloying affection - even though, as an undergraduate, Crosland had shown signs of what Radice calls \"sexual ambivalence\". Yet none of the three achieved his ambitions within the Labour party. Healey and Jenkins both wanted to be prime minister but got nowhere near, each having to make do with being Labour's deputy leader in opposition. Crosland could not even attain his more modest aspiration, yearningly felt, to be elected to the constituencies section of Labour's national executive committee. Radice's thesis is that the three, by splitting support in their right-wing coterie within the parliamentary Labour party, became jealous of each other, got in each others' way and therefore negated the leadership prospects which should have been fulfilled for one or another of them. He thinks all three were better men than Wilson (or Callaghan) and that, if only the conspirators working for Jenkins in the 1966 parliament had had their way, Jenkins could have ousted Wilson and won the 1970 election that brought his Balliol confr\u00e8re Edward Heath to No 10. This analysis seems to me to be piffle, and not only because of the trio's character defects that Radice conscientiously chronicles. Healey is depicted by Radice as a name-dropping know-all (\"he had almost always met or read the book or the person whose name he is dropping,\" Radice comments tartly) and possessed a \"characteristic... confidence in his own views\". He irritated Jenkins by giving him guidance on how to get around Paris and what trains to catch in England when Jenkins knew Paris far better than Healey and had learnt the railway timetables by heart. In parliament Healey was a \"loner\". Prior to his second leadership bid, when I risked my own political career by actively campaigning for Healey in defiance of the hard-left cabal that controlled my constituency party, I sent a message asking him to take more trouble with newly elected Labour backbenchers; he flatly refused to do so. As defence secretary he had an almost suicidal propensity for insulting his own backbenchers during tricky Commons debates when Labour had an overall majority of only two. Jenkins had more of a following, though the gushing young rightwing MPs who trailed after him like schoolgirls with a crush on the hockey mistress did him no favours with the more horny-handed members of the PLP. He was without doubt the most brilliant parliamentary debater of his generation, able to triumph over the Tories in seemingly doom-laden debates, such as that on the escape of the spy George Blake when Jenkins was home secretary. The problem was that, despite his hereditary Labour credentials, he clearly had very little, if any, time for the party. Even Crosland, with whom he had a close friendship before they became rivals, said that \"Roy has actually come to dislike socialism\", was \"in the wrong party\", and, indeed, was a \"crypto-coalitionist\". It comes as no surprise to learn from Radice's book that, on the day when Jenkins (regarded at Balliol as \"nature's old Etonian\") led a Labour Commons split on Europe, he took lunch at Brooks's club and dined at Lockett's. Crosland himself (with whom I worked as a junior minister when he was secretary of state for the environment and for whom I had a deep affection) could drink uncondescendingly with miners' MPs - though not the miners themselves - in the Strangers' Bar at Westminster, yet was capable of insulting anyone within sight. Radice talks of Crosland's \"irreverent glamour\", which I for one found attractive - how could one not be drawn to someone who, when asked what was his greatest achievement in the war, replied, \"the liberation of Cannes\"? But he also quotes an admission by Bill Rodgers (an ally who later plotted to \"punish\" Crosland as a \"shit\" for failing to go with the pro-European right in Labour's Commons split) of Crosland's ability to be \"stunningly rude to women\". Crosland died at 58, having become foreign secretary but been denied the chancellorship of the exchequer for which he pined. Both Healey and Jenkins became chancellor, and Radice talks up their achievements. They were undoubtedly prudent housekeepers, but Jenkins denied Labour the electioneering budget it needed in 1970, while Healey in 1976 caved in to the International Monetary Fund on the basis of inaccurate Treasury statistics. What, then, were their achievements? Crosland, having written what at the time was the progressives' ur-text, The Future of Socialism , as education secretary, dedicated himself to reforming secondary education: \"I'm going to destroy every fucking grammar school in England...\" The grammar schools still stand, and comprehensive education has not always turned out as Crosland would have hoped. Jenkins, as a backbencher, drove through private member's legislation to reform censorship law and, when home secretary, assisted through parliament a raft of \"permissive\" legislation decriminalising homosexuality, legalising abortion and abolishing theatre censorship: all to his credit, but none of it possible without Wilson's authorisation. He subsequently (fulfilling Crosland's \"crypto-coalitionist\" jibe) went on to join the Social Democrats, thereby playing a cardinal role in the perpetuation in office of Margaret Thatcher. Healey's principal, and indispensable, achievement was - by a fraction of 1% - to defeat Anthony Wedgwood Benn for Labour's deputy leadership and thereby to save the party from destruction. Healey may have been the roughest diamond of the three, but without him there would today be no Labour party for Tony Blair to lead to repeated election victory. Yet, though each of the three had his personal merits and political gifts, not one of them comes remotely near Wilson's achievement in rescuing Labour from the failings of Hugh Gaitskell's prissy, elitist leadership to go on to win four elections. Radice is entitled to his view that these three failed aspirants \"in many ways... had more lasting impact than... Wilson and Callaghan\". Regrettably, the record provides no credence for such a fantasy. \u00b7 Gerald Kaufman MP is the author of How to Be a Minister (Faber)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
