What a sour way to end the season. Apart from a three-minute second-half burst, where Julian Savea and Kieran Read scored, and a late flurry, the All Blacks were on the back foot \u2013 make that pinned up against the wall by a raw and inexperienced English side. It was astonishing to watch. This test resembled a third former turning the tables on the head prefect. Steeled by close losses to the Wallabies and Springboks, youth and enthusiasm sparked the English. They did not fear this All Blacks team. Not one bit. Make no mistake, the Poms won't let you forget this history making occasion. And, as much as it pains to say, their effort today deserves some time in the sun. The New Zealand Herald \"The season has ended in stunningly bad fashion with England bursting into astonishing life at Twickenham\u2026 England looked a lot more like the All Blacks than New Zealand did. They were smart, they were committed and they were creative. And on top of that they were relentlessly physical. They won because they deserved it - it's been a long season for sure but the All Blacks were in London to win and didn't stand a chance, not because of fatigue but because they weren't allowed to play the game they wanted. The Dominion Post Dreams of an unbeaten season were extinguished in seven minutes of English magic at Twickenham. England tore into everything and presented immovable obstacles at the tackle \u2026 England presented by far the most physical challenge Richie McCaw's men have faced this season and thoroughly deserved their first win over the All Blacks since 2003."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
