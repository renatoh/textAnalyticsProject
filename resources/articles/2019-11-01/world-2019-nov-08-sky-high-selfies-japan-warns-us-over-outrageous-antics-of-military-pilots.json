A US military report on the investigation into the December 2018 crash revealed widespread misconduct among the unit\u2019s pilots, including some who had posted selfies from their cockpits on social media. One was shown combing his moustache mid-flight and another reading The Great Santini, a 1976 novel about a marine corps fighter pilot, with his hands off the controls. \u201cExamples of such unprofessionalism included prescription and over-the-counter drug abuse, excessive alcohol consumption, adultery, orders violations, and failures in following fundamental principles of professional aviation training and operations,\u201d the report said. Four officers were dismissed following the selfie revelations, Kyodo news agency said. They included the commanding officer, who had posted a photo on his WhatsApp profile showing him without his oxygen mask and with his visor up. Tsugumasa Muraoka, the governor of Yamaguchi prefecture, where the unit\u2019s Iwakuni base is located, described the pilots\u2019 mid-flight antics as \u201coutrageous\u201d, according to public broadcaster NHK, and demanded that the defence ministry urge US forces to take immediate safety measures. Jungen Tamura, a member of the Iwakuni city assembly, called for an immediate suspension of all flights from the base. \u201cThey\u2019re extremely dangerous behaviours,\u201d Tamura said, according to Kyodo. \u201cThey could cause an accident and (they) need to suspend flights immediately.\u201d The report said pilot error and an \u201cunprofessional command climate\u201d inside the unit, stationed at Iwakuni airbase in western Japan, had contributed to the 6 December crash. Six airmen died after a FA-18 Hornet jet fighter and a KC-130 Hercules refuelling aircraft collided during a nighttime refuelling mission. Five of the six victims were aboard the tanker, which belonged to a separate unit. The report added that a component of a sleep-inducing drug was found in the urine of two crew members on the jet, suggesting they were \u201cnot medically fit for flight duties at the time of the mishap\u201d, Kyodo said. Japan has expressed concern over the safety of US military aircraft several times in recent years. A month before the refuelling crash, a US navy fighter jet from the aircraft carrier USS Ronald Reagan plunged into the sea off Japan\u2019s southern island of Okinawa. Its two crew members were rescued alive. Earlier in 2018, a MH-60 Seahawk crashed on the Ronald Reagan\u2019s flight deck shortly after takeoff in the Philippine Sea, injuring a dozen sailors. The US military has also experienced difficulties with its Osprey aircraft, including emergency landings and a deadly crash. Two years ago, an object resembling a window frame fell from a US military helicopter on to the grounds of a primary school in Okinawa, home to a large number of US troops. A schoolboy suffered a minor injury. On Thursday, the defence ministry said a US F-16 fighter had accidentally released a dummy bomb several kilometres outside a bombing range in Japan\u2019s northeast. There were no reports of injuries or damage during the incident, which occurred this week over an unpopulated area of Aomori prefecture, US Forces Japan said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
