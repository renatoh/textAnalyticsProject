At the end of the corridor lies her dream of stardom \u2013 and only you stand in her way. Look at her eyes \u2026 That's got you in the mood for the coming nights of terror as your EPG teems with wanton wraiths and blood-drenched abomination in celebration of Halloween. Whether you self-soil at the mention of ghosts or look forward to graphic depictions of arse-to-face surgery, there's something on TV for you. The latter nose-to-tail regarders can finally see The Human Centipede (Sun, 11pm, Syfy), if they think it absolutely necessary. For proper film fans there's the almost perfect Ghostbusters (Sat, 4pm, Gold). And if you've yet to do so, try Ginger Snaps (Sat, 2am, BBC2), in which one girl's puberty manifests itself as full-on hairy-palm werewolfery. The other two in the trilogy, Ginger Snaps Unleashed (Sun, 1.15am, BBC2) and Ginger Snaps Back: The Beginning (Mon, 12.45am, BBC2), sadly lose much of the original's smarts. But if you crave a properly creepy old spine-chiller, don't miss Vampyr (Sun, 10pm, Sky Arts 1), Carl Theodor Dreyer's 1931 flick about a man called Allan (stay with me) who goes to a dark guesthouse and is quickly embroiled in blood-based badness before the whole thing climaxes in a denouement that actually makes flour scary. The highlight of the season is obviously Deal Or No Deal: Bankenstein's Monster (from Mon, 4pm, C4) \u2013 a whole week of poor contestants covered in latex, gore and bandages to give the opening of boxes that dread frisson it was otherwise missing. The only truly themed night on Halloween is on BBC4 and includes Andy Hamilton's Search For Satan (9pm), a repeat of the excellent Psychoville Halloween Special (10pm) and Mark Gatiss's splendid A History Of Horror (11pm). But if you're still not satisfied, there's a shocking new feature in which the spawn of Satan gets his own chatshow, then wedges his head up the bottom of James Corden. The Inhuman Centipede \u2013 aka Piers Morgan's Life Stories \u2013 is on Saturday night, ITV1 at 9.45pm. Don't have nightmares."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
