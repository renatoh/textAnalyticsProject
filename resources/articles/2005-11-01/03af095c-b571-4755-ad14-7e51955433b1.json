The place: the Cromwell hospital, west London. Professor Roger Williams is breezily telling reporters about George Best's successful liver transplant operation, when one wag asks whether Best will go teetotal. \"That's what we want him to do, and I think he wants to do it too,\" responds Williams earnestly. Fast forward three years, and not much has changed - same place, same professor, same patient - but there's a sombre tone to Williams's words. For Best is hours from death. \"George is coming to the end of the long road of his ill health,\" Prof Williams told reporters this afternoon. \"He's still alive. He's still having standard medical care and treatment, but I have to tell you that his hours are numbered now.\" Prof Williams revealed the internal bleeding Best suffered overnight has now affected his lungs. \"There is really no return from that situation. It is really not possible to recover from that episode during the night. I would be very surprised if he survives another 24 hours.\" Clearly upset, Prof Williams added: \"It's the final stage of this illness and I am afraid he could die at any time now.\" Best's son Calum, 24, his father Dickie, 87, and other family members are now at his bedside, but Best is no longer conscious or aware of what is happening. Alcoholism is a disease as difficult to fight as cancer, and it's about to claim another victim. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE(S) OF THE DAY Selected highlights of a row that broke out between Roy Keane's ghost writer Eamon Dunphy and fellow RTE pundits Liam Brady and John Giles during last night's coverage of Liverpool v Real Betis. ED: \"Niall Quinn is a creep ... a joke ... The man is an idiot.\" ED: \"Arjen Robben is a bird-brain.\" ED: \"All [Cristiano] Ronaldo can do is fanny about.\" LB: \"It was wrong of Keane to come out and criticise his fellow pros just so he could get a new contract\", to which an apoplectic Dunphy retorted: \"Get your facts straight. Henry's doing it, they all do it; last year Vieira fannied, flipped and flopped ... funny you forgot about that, Liam, with you working at Arsenal.\" ED (to presenter Bill O'Herlihy): \"Who are you to call Roy Keane a thug?\" BOH: \"I didn't. It was in the Sunday Times.\" ED: \"l tell you who said it, it was Rod Liddle. Let me tell you something about him, Bill. He left his wife and kid and ran off with some young one. That's the kind of guy he is.\" And, finally, ED: \"I'll tell you what Roy Keane is: he's a gentleman. He is right about everything.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * 10 FROM 39 JUST WON'T GO Life must be hard for Pompey chairman Milan Mandaric. You might laugh but you, you lucky swine, can go to bed fully expecting tomorrow to dawn. Not Milan. Oh no. He retreats beneath the duvet unable to sleep for wondering what the night will hold. You see, while others might comfortably foresee the next few months, Mandaric can imagine only the next few hours of his life. This morning he woke up, sacked Alain Perrin and enjoyed sausages for breakfast. Last night he had promised Perrin his job was safe \"for the foreseeable future\" and been vegetarian. All right, we can't be sure about the vegetarianism. Or the sausages - but he's definitely sacked poor Perrin, because assistant Joe Jordan is already feasting on the scraps. \"I am looking forward to taking the responsibility on,\" he said, after being handed a pair of overalls and a mop. \"This time I'll have the final say,\" he woohaha-ed. \"This time I will be getting help, then I will make my final decision on who plays and how we play,\" he went on, sounding as open to discussion as Brian 'then we decide I was right' Clough. Mandaric at least had the decency to show a little remorse, if only because he had no idea who might turn up at dinner tonight. \"This has not been an easy decision to reach,\" he said. \"Alain Perrin is a talented coach who has worked extremely hard. However, recent performances and the general morale needed improvement. I ask everyone connected with the club to stick together and give their usual loyal support to help turn things around,\" he cooed. \"It is no guarantee for survival but I had to make a decision,\" he added, carefully leaving the emergency exit open. NEXT POMPEY MANAGER ODDS SPECIAL, A FEATURE NOT IN ANY WAY CREATED BECAUSE WE FAILED TO MENTION SPECULATION ABOUT PERRIN'S SUCCESSOR IN THE STORY ABOVE Neil Warnock 9-4, George Burley 7-2, Robby Bobson 5-1, Iain Dowie 16-1, Roy Keane 18-1, Paul Merson 40-1. * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL For reasons Peter Crouch is best placed to explain, Rafa Benitez is on the prowl for a new striker; Valencia's Marco Di Vaio is his top target, but Internazionale want the Italian too. Vincent Kompany may have done absolutely nothing of note during last night's Anderlecht v Chelsea charade, but Jose Mourinho somehow saw something he likes: he's preparing a multi-million pound bid for the 19-year-old defender. * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Neil Lennon's no hollow badge-kisser: the Queen's Celtic captain has bought shares in the club to help fund a new academy. \"It's just a small investment but it's something I think is really worthwhile,\" explained the budding empire builder. Rock-bottom Championship outfit Millwall have captured 21-year-old Liverpool defender Zak Whitbread on loan until January. The lawyer representing the players of French first division club Metz has confirmed that Belgium-based \"mafia types\" attempted to rig the recent Metz-Lyon league match, which attracted unusually hefty bets on Lyon to win by three goals or more. Lyon won 4-0 but Jean-Damien Vicq insists none of the players accepted bribes. * * * * * * * * * * FIVER LETTERS \"I see theguardian themselves are at it again. From your Liverpool-Betis match report: 'Crouch is truly a team player who has much better technique than his gangly appearance might suggest' - Joseph Talbot (and many others). \"Did anyone else notice that one of the candidates for the Pompey job, German Gernot Rohr, has a questionable CV? It reads: managed Nice, Young Boys\" - Sean Coffey. \"Alain Perrin might not have been very good, but he was the best-looking manager in the Premiership, and he had a lovely French accent. Just thought you might like a woman's perspective on the matter\" - Sian Kennedy. \"Re: Michael Casagranda in Tuesday's letters. Overcome by curiosity, I too did a google search for Boris Mikhailov. How I wish I hadn't. Other Fiver readers beware\" - Graham Charlton. \"In case any Scousers stayed tuned to Sky after the match last night, and didn't immediately switch over to I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, they might like to know that Mrs Kewell revealed that her husband would really love to play in Spain or Italy. Good to see he remains loyal to the club he supported as a boy, eh?\" - Mark Gillies. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.
