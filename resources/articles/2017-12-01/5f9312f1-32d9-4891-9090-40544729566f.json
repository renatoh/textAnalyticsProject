They said even a closure of a few weeks would have significant impacts on the industry. The price of Brent, the international benchmark, briefly rose to a two-year high of above $65 (\u00a347) a barrel after the announcement, up from $63 at the start of the day. Wholesale natural gas prices for same-day delivery in the UK surged by nearly 30% to a four-year high. With Britain facing a cold snap, there is a concern that the higher fuel prices may filter down into more expensive energy bills for consumers. Ineos, which owns the pipeline, said that inspections had found a hairline crack that would require the Forties pipeline to close for weeks, which is expected to cause several oil companies to temporarily cease production. The pipeline system is 235 miles long and connects 85 oil and gas platforms and facilities to the mainland. Ineos, the owner of the Grangemouth oil refinery in Scotland, which will also be affected by the shutdown, said its contractors found the crack where the pipeline system runs over land near Netherley, south of Aberdeen. The petrochemicals firm said an oil spill response team visited the site last Wednesday. \u201cA 300-metre cordon was set up, a small number of local residents were advised to leave and the pipe was depressurised while a full assessment of the situation was made,\u201d it said. However, the crack has since widened and Ineos took the decision to shut the pipeline in the interests of safety and in an attempt to avoid a serious oil leak. Ineos did not specify exactly how many residents had been temporarily moved. The company said the closure would \u201callow for a suitable repair method to be worked up based on the latest inspection data, while reducing the risk of injury to staff and the environment\u201d. Ineos said a \u201cvery small amount of oil seepage\u201d had been reported, but insisted no oil had been detected entering the wider environment. Fiona Legate, a senior analyst at Wood Mackenzie, said the shutdown of the Forties Pipeline System, even if only temporarily, would have wide-reaching implications the UK oil and gas industry. Apache, a Texas-based company with operations in the North Sea, said it had ceased production as a result. The Health and Safety Executive said: \u201cWe continue to monitor the situation, as we have since we were made aware of the issues with the pipeline.\u201d The shutdown will be a serious blow for Ineos, which only completed its \u00a3200m purchase of the pipeline system from BP at the end of October. The company had said that it was now the only UK company with refinery and petrochemical assets that were integrated in the North Sea, and would serve as a platform for more investments in the region."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
