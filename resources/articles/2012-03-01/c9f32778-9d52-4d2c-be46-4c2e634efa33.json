Frontrunner Mitt Romney should win at least a plurality of states and majority of delegates up for grabs. Romney will emerge victorious in the Massachusetts, Vermont and Virginia primaries, as well as the Idaho caucus. I believe he will also take the close-fought Ohio primary and, potentially, the Alaska caucus. To understand why, let's look at the numbers. There are two methods we can use to project Tuesday's primary (not caucus) contests' popular votes. The first is to examine the polling data. In all the primary states, except for Massachusetts, polls have been conducted in the past five days. Polling accuracy this primary season has been above average, though not perfect. In Ohio, for instance, five primary polls taken over weekend show a Mitt Romney lead, two give Santorum a slight advantage, and one shows a tie. The second approach is to implement a simple linear model based on the projected share white evangelicals will make up of each state's electorate, as I did last week. So far, this primary season, the white evangelical percentage has done a fine job of explaining Mitt Romney's vote share, as compared to the conservative alternatives'. The model said Mitt Romney was favorite in Michigan, even when the polling disagreed. The problem with this procedure is that accounting for a past Romney performance is easier to do than forecasting the future Romney vote. In addition, we don't actually know what percentage white evangelicals will comprise in each state's voting population. In most previous contests this year, the evangelical percentage has been up, compared to four years ago; but Public Policy Poling is actually finding it down in Georgia, Ohio and Tennessee. The best technique may be to take a simple mean between the polling and evangelical model. In most states, the difference between the two is not great, but the evangelical prediction should provide a tiebreaker in the states that are close. Given the uncertainty about the percentage that white evangelicals will make up in each state's electorate, I've taken an average of the 2008 white evangelical proportion and the slightly higher percentage of participation seen in previous states' voting in this cycle. The evangelical model is more optimistic than the polling for Romney in Georgia (where Newt Gingrich has a home-state advantage) and in Ohio, but is more pessimistic in Oklahoma and Tennessee (the latter a potentially more moderate state than its evangelical percentage might indicate). Overall, Mitt Romney is expected to win three of the six competitive primaries and come in second in the other three. He should also win soundly in Virginia, where only Ron Paul and he are on the ballot. Translating the popular vote to delegates is a tough task. Each state has unique rules, and, as I discussed last week, thresholds make it especially difficult to predict. In Georgia, for instance, Rick Santorum is teetering on the cusp of 20% of the statewide popular vote. If he gets to 20%, he wins a proportional share of the 31 statewide delegates, but if he gets below 20%, he gets none. In caucus states, the ability to forecast is even tougher because we have no polls and no evangelical baseline. I do find comfort that my estimates line up fairly well with Larry Sabato and his team at the Crystal Ball and Nate Silver at FiveThirtyEight. Most of our estimates (as indicated by the three Romney columns) are in the same ballpark. There are four differences that deserve some discussion. Georgia: My Romney delegate count is higher than both. My guess is that has little to do with Romney's projected percentage of the vote, but more to do with Santorum's. I don't think that Santorum will reach the 20% threshold mentioned above; so I award him no delegates. Without going into the statistical weeds, the non-attainment of the threshold changes the denominator math and boosts Romney's percentage of the at-large delegates. Idaho: I agree 100% with Silver that Romney will capture all of Idaho's 32 delegates. The rules on Idaho's delegate allocation are somewhat difficult to follow. Each county performs a form of instant runoff voting until one candidate takes all of a county's delegates. Then, if a candidate has won a majority of the counties in Idaho, he wins all 32 statewide delegates. About 27% of Idaho's population identifies as Mormon, and Mormons have come out in droves to vote for Romney. In states like Arizona, Nevada and Washington, Mormons have voted at between double and fives times the rate of their percentage in the statewide population in each contest. I wouldn't be shocked if they comprised 40-50% of Idaho's electorate, and they will vote nine-to-one for Romney. Ohio: My Romney delegate count is, again, higher than Sabato and Silver. I believe the difference resides in the fact that my projected Romney percentage of the vote is larger than both. I expect Romney to win Ohio by 5-7 percentage points. With a victory that large, he should take the majority of congressional districts (where three delegates are allocated winner-take-all in each of the 16 districts). In addition, he has a good shot of winning two districts that Santorum would have won, but Santorum is not on the ballot because he failed to meet the requirements. My Santorum count is driven even lower because in another five districts, he didn't file full delegate slates; so he may be out another nine delegates in these districts. Vermont: There's no good polling in Vermont, but I agree with Sabato's projection. If Romney gets over 50% (which my evangelical model says he will), he gets all 17 delegates. Even if he doesn't, he still could pick up all 17 delegates. To cause Vermont's 11 at-large delegates to be distributed proportionally among more than one candidate, Romney not only has to finish under 50%, but another candidate has to finish over 20%. Social conservative Mike Huckabee only got 14.3% of the vote in 2008, and Santorum captured less than 10% of the vote in the similarly secular New Hampshire. Ron Paul did get over 20% in New Hampshire, but he performed far worse in Vermont in 2008, at 6.6%. Despite these differences, all three delegate forecasts are in the same realm. Mine is the most giddy for Romney at 244 (out of a possible 422). Given that Romney already has a current majority of delegates at 194 (or 136, if you don't allocate technically unbound delegates based on straw-poll votes in caucuses) and looks destined to take a majority tomorrow, he is now in a very strong position on his path towards to the nomination. \u2022 This article was updated at 12pm ET (5pm UK time) on 6 March to take in a fresh poll finding in Ohio"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
