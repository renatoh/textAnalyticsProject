It is tempting to take Carol Ann Duffy for granted, in rather the same way that Joyce Carol Oates is sometimes undervalued because of her productivity. But reading this small, icy, perfectly formed book \u2013 a ballad, a winter\u2019s tale \u2013 one is reminded of Duffy\u2019s consistent excellence. And here she is supported by David de las Heras\u2019s understatedly graceful illustrations. A solitary figure in rusty red walks through a sepia world of snow, flanked by feathery poplars. The ballad begins as an ordinary yarn: \u201cSo cold it was \u2013\u201d and then after you turn the page, becomes a singular story: by late December, ink had frosted in its well; my breath was tinkling on my lips, so everything I saw to tell I had to memorise. I saw birds fall from trees, too stiff to fly, like stones. I saw a lass, her tongue stuck to a spoon. I saw an ice-hare staring lifeless at no moon. The image of the frozen ink beguiles. The cold means the suspending of normal services for the imagined poet. Duffy\u2019s own ability to take us into a place of the past \u2013 London in the \u201cGreat Winter\u201d of 1683 \u2013 with minimum fuss is masterly and the detail of the tongue stuck to a spoon shows we are on no ordinary path. What a pity Heras\u2019s hare does not qualify as lifeless \u2013 he looks hale, furrily kempt, ready to run. Duffy is a curator of cold, and her penetrating transformations continue as if in a winter exhibition: \u201cMen\u2019s tears were jewels in their beards for wives to pluck.\u201d The poem is rooted in London and involves a walk from Spitalfields in which our \u201cpoet-spy\u201d is disguised as a boy \u2013 the gentle cross-dressing further enlivening the atmosphere. The poet spies St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. I found this line: \u201cLondon was snow. St Paul\u2019s, a talent of the snow/ to seem more grand\u201d a bit odd \u2013 the \u201ctalent\u201d top-heavy \u2013 but I loved the roll, a line or two later, of: \u201cI saw a clock too cold to tell the time\u201d. It rings out even if the clock doesn\u2019t. And there is a shivery moment (perhaps looking centuries ahead) when she writes: I mused on climate \u2013 how it could clench the greatest city in its bitter fist and squeeze. Later, comes a fleeting moment of romance: I met a wench who thought I was a man, or didn\u2019t care, and stole a salty kiss. I\u2019ve never seen her since. In lesser hands, a ballad of this kind might fall into repro folksiness, but Duffy knows how and where to let contemporary language ventilate the verse (\u201cTrees went to pieces; cracked\u201d). The rhymes are assured \u2013 and sometimes beautiful: \u2026 beside a bawd whose eyes were hard as gems. My mouth as wide as one at Bethlehem\u2019s. Bethlehem feels momentarily unlikely and then inevitable. The characters she describes share a strangeness and are never hackneyed. And she knows how to change tone at the end, without strain, to a final vision \u2013 a gift to us: Two swans alighted, swerving on the blazing glaze, then flew, creaking, away. I spoke a prayer. I saw my words freeze on the air and hang, preserved, to thaw now in your ear. \u2022 Frost Fair by Carol Ann Duffy (illustrations by David de las Heras) is published by Picador (\u00a37.99).
