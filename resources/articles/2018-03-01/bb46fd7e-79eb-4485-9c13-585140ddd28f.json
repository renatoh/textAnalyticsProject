Cahill has been left out of the England squad to face the Netherlands and Italy having not played in Chelsea\u2019s recent Premier League matches with Manchester United and Manchester City, or in the Champions League tie against Barcelona. Morata has not been picked by Julen Lopetegui for Spain\u2019s friendlies against Germany and Argentina, having struggled since arriving from Real Madrid in July and failing to score this year. \u201cThis is a question for the coach of the national teams, not for me,\u201d Conte said when asked whether Cahill\u2019s and Morata\u2019s omissions placed doubt over their involvement in the World Cup this summer. \u201cMy only worry is to have the players in best form for Chelsea.\u201d \u201cBecause of my past [as Italy head coach] it is difficult for me to speak about the decision of a manager of the national team. Maybe, the manager wants to try new solutions. There are a lot of thoughts in the mind of a coach.\u201d Conte described Cahill as a player with \u201cgreat quality\u201d and backed Morata to end his drought when Chelsea play Leicester in the FA Cup quarter-finals on Sunday but there followed blunt words from the manager regarding the duo\u2019s prospects of catching Gareth Southgate\u2019s and Lopetegui\u2019s respective eyes before the finals. \u201cThere is only one way: to work hard and show you deserve to play,\u201d Conte said. \u201cNot to complain.\u201d Having exited the Champions League in midweek, Conte is ready to put a greater emphasis on the FA Cup given it is the only trophy the champions can realistically win. \u201cWe want to fight [for it],\u201d said Conte, who looks set to play his strongest possible team at the King Power Stadium. \u201cIt won\u2019t be easy but we want to do our best.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
