This week we have: being chased by a falcon on a motorbike (that's them, not the bird); building an obstacle course (including rusty nails and a wall of razors) for slugs; and offering a choice of cheeses to an urban fox. Am I drunk? Or is this quite the oddest show of the week? (The answers, incidentally, are yes and yes.) Interesting facts: slugs love grapefruit while foxes favour top-of-the-range Somerset cheddar. Katie &amp; Peter: Unleashed 9pm, ITV2 Unleashed? Wouldn't it be better to see Price and Andre, the nadir of British celebutardity, tethered? To an anvil. And thrown off a boat. Far out to sea. Annoy-ingly, Price would likely float. Tonight's guests include Danielle Lloyd, she of Celebrity Big Brother racism, and singer Gabrielle. So that might be interesting. Or, you know, not. The Armstrong &amp; Miller Show 9.30pm, BBC1 If, \u00e0 la Ant and Dec, you've never quite established which is which, let me clear it up for you - Alexander Armstrong is the one who did the Pimms' ads while Ben Miller was the creepy civil servant in Primeval and starred in that sitcom with Sarah Alexander, The Worst Week of My Life. After some very dubious opening titles involving dodgy dancing, there are a surprising number of funny sketches, many of them rather risque for BBC1, including splendid skewering of those \"readers' emails\" bits on breakfast news programmes. Comedy Showcase: Free Agents 10.30pm, Channel 4 There's little funnier than other people's emotional damage and the consequent mess they make of things, so Chris Niel's tale of two colleagues - he an estranged dad, she lately availed of a dead fiance - who have casual sex and have to deal with the aftermath is very funny indeed. Sharon Horgan (Pulling and Five's upcoming Angelo's) and Green Wing's Stephen Mangan star as the pair, with Anthony Head their coke-snorting, sex-crazed boss (\"You've been bashing some gash, haven't you?\"). Who knew Rupert Giles from Buffy could be so foul-mouthed? To think he kissed Joyce Summers with that mouth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
