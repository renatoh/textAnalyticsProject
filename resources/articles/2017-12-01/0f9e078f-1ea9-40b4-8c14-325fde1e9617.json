But the curator of a forthcoming National Gallery exhibition on Claude Monet will be featuring a \u201cmissing\u201d painting that he found through a startlingly straightforward route \u2013 a Google search. The art historian Richard Thomson knew the painting, Effet de Brouillard, from a postage stamp-sized image in the definitive catalogue of works by the impressionist master. It was listed as being in a private collection. Thomson, who is Watson Gordon professor of fine art at Edinburgh University, told the Observer: \u201cIt\u2019s a picture that\u2019s been off the beaten track, off the radar, and we\u2019re going to have it in the show. Its whereabouts weren\u2019t known\u2026 It\u2019s exciting.\u201d Effet de Brouillard is an atmospheric scene that depicts Argenteuil, near Paris, the rural retreat where Monet lived between 1871 and 1878. It was here that he produced some of his most sublime masterpieces. Thomson thought that the 1872 painting, a hazy view of houses shrouded in fog, would be perfect for his exhibition, Monet &amp; Architecture. He had already secured loans from private and public collections, and this seemed like a missing piece in the jigsaw. To his astonishment, some Googling revealed that the painting had just been sold in America, by a New Orleans dealer. Art historians had apparently also missed its 2007 sale by Christie\u2019s, whose catalogue entry notes just three previous exhibitions, in 1874, \u201cpossibly\u201d in London, and in 1895, in Boston and New York. The New Orleans dealer put Thomson in contact with the new owners, who were happy to see their painting displayed in the National Gallery. According to Thomson, the work was featured in Paul Hayes Tucker\u2019s 1982 book Monet at Argenteuil, in black and white, and in a 1990s catalogue in colour, where it was \u201conly the size of a Christmas-card postage stamp\u201d. He joked: \u201cI\u2019ve done my time buried away in archives and libraries. Every now and then one has to use other options.\u201d Effet de Brouillard will be among 75 works in the National Gallery exhibition, which opens in April. It will include 10 paintings of Argenteuil and the Parisian suburbs, seven Rouen cathedrals and eight London paintings. A substantial proportion of the loans \u2013 about a quarter \u2013 are from private collections. \u201cThere are some fantastic unknown pictures,\u201d Thomson said. The exhibition will reflect how, through buildings, Monet explored \u201cthe play of sunshine, fogs and reflections\u201d. As the artist put it in 1895: \u201cOther painters paint a bridge, a house, a boat \u2026 I want to paint the air that surrounds the bridge, the house, the boat \u2013 the beauty of the light in which they exist.\u201d While Monet is typically portrayed as a painter of landscape, of the sea, and in his later years, of gardens, an exhibition focusing on his work in terms of architecture had not been undertaken until now, the National Gallery said. The artist is a huge draw for the public. The Royal Academy\u2019s 1999 blockbuster show, Monet in the 20th Century, attracted more than 700,000 visitors."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
