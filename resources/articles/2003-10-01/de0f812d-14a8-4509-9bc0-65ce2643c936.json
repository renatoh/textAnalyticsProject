The Fiver's mouse has been jiggered for days, but has Tizer-Swilling Fiver popped round to fix it? Put it this way: has Tizer-Swilling Fiver never enjoyed a non-stop 72-hour Risk session during which his bedroom door has remained firmly shut apart from the time he shouted down the stairs to ask Mum to pop the kettle on for a Beef &amp; Onion Pot Noodle? No. So even if we wanted to delete this paragraph on the grounds that Tizer-Swilling Fiver's department is probably chronically understaffed and none of this is really his fault, all we currently seem to be able to do is select arbitrary lu king place as we smash the recalcitrant piece of hardware down on the desk again and again and AGAIN in an intemperate display of pique. mps of text and accidentally paste them in the wrong fuc So we're sorry that we're already in the second paragraph (fourth if you're being pedantic) and we've yet to mention that rk McGhee has been appointed as the ne cked by MiBa stard mouse!llwall.

When the Fiver's American cousin, Chad Fat-Camp Fiver, let slip that KFC is launching a huge ad campaign to sell fried chicken as a healthy, high-protein snack, we nearly choked on our greasy drumsticks. But, incredibly, it's true. One ad shows two men bumping into each other in the street. \"Jack, is that you? Man, you look fantastic!\" one joshes to the other, before Jack reveals the secret of his skinny appearance: \"Eatin' chicken!\" Another ad shows a woman telling her husband: \"Y'know how we've been talking about eating better? Well, it starts today!\" before placing a bumper-sized bucket of KFC on the table. Surely no UK company would attempt such blatant fact massaging, thought the Fiver. But that was before we heard Professor John McKenzie brush aside Leeds's pre-tax annual losses of \u00a349.5m (FIVER VIDIPRINTER: FORTY-NINE-AND-A-HALF MILLION POUNDS). \"Leeds United lived the dream - and I inherited the nightmare,\" sobbed McKenzie, pointing at a photo of Peter Ridsdale. But then, to the shock of everyone everywhere, McKenzie suddenly predicted a glorious future! \"We have taken \u00a320m of costs out of the business and we are attempting to trade at break even, and we are pretty much there,\" he thundered to the heroic strains of Wagner. \"We are on the start of an upward curve!!!\" Really?

And that's one for new Leeds CEO Trevor Birch, the former Chelsea chief executive, to ponder. \"I specialised in dealing with under-performing companies, designing strategies and implementing them,\" he recalled today, speaking of his days at Ernst &amp; Young. Sounds like the perfect man for the job, no? * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Real Madrid fancy \u00a3150,000-a-week Michael Owen, though Big Ged claims he's staying put and not doing one. \"Suggestions that he has already decided he wants to leave are nonsense,\" insisted Ged today. \"Michael Owen is as committed to Liverpool as he has always been. He wants to win more trophies and Anfield is the place he wants to do it.\" Who else can see the flaw in this thinking? Liverpool, Arsenal and Manchester United fancy Auxerre's fancy French defender Philippe Mexes. Meanwhile Chelsea fancy Juventus beast Edgar Davids. And the Rumour Mill fancies a day off. * * * * * * * * * * * * CONTACT THE FIVER If you want to contact the Fiver, email the.boss@theguardian.com. * * * * * * * * * * * * IF WE COULD OPEN UP THE BACK, WE'D CLEAN THE ROLLERS OURSELVES!

Meanwhile, Paul Scholes is out for four weeks after undergoing groin surgery. Diddy David Dunn has had his yellow card for diving during Bolton v Bongo on Saturday rescinded by referee Chris Foy. Marseille have denied rumours that defender Daniel van Buyten has been approached by Manchester United. \"We received no fax, no offer whatsoever,\" sniffed manager Alain Perrin, as if that matters. \"It's only a rumour and it should really have been included in that Rumour Mill section up there,\" he partly added. Lazio's former Manchester United defender Jaap Stam is supremely confident he'll recover from a hamstring twang in time to feature in Holland's Euro 2004 play-off first leg against Scotland on November 15. \"I don't think I'll have to miss these deciding play-offs,\" he said, as if he knows something we don't. * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO ITV1: Carling Cup highlights (11pm) It appears we have literally opened up a can of worms by asking for your favourite examples of dirty language.
