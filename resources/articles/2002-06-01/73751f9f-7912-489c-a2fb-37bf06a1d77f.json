Victory against France's conquerors Senegal on 6 June would now all but ensure the Danes a spot in the second round, while their inventiveness and willingness to pour forward suggests that such a stage should not be the limit of their objectives. 'We started nervously, but for the last hour or so I thought we played the better football,' said their coach Morten Olsen afterwards. 'We were physically better too, and deserved our win.' Olsen was particularly pleased with the quality of his side's play, which recalled the side he himself played in that drubbed Uruguay 6-1 in Mexico 86 in the only previous meeting between the two teams. 'Today's match was a great game for the public, and a marvellous beginning for us,' Olsen said. Tomasson's double sandwiched a screamer of a volley from Dario Rodriguez - 'a wonder goal,' Danish keeper Thomas Sorensen said ruefully afterwards - which underlined the quality of a thoroughly enjoyable encounter. Both of the Dane's efforts came at the end of fluid passing movements; both were finished with aplomb. Uruguay showed flashes of inspiration, and a pleasingly positive approach, but now need to beat France if they are not to fade from the picture at the group stage. The first half started at a frenetic pace, and both Ebbe Sand and Tomasson spurned presentable opportunities before Alvaro Recoba bent a sublime free-kick inches wide. Denmark's riposte was as immediate as it was inevitable, and when Thomas Helveg's pinpoint centre found the usually lethal Ebbe Sand unmarked no more than eight yards out he really should have scored. Instead his glancing header zipped off the turf and onto the bar. So far so thrilling. With both teams committed to attacking football - 'we'll go for the win, period,' Uruguay coach Victor Pua had said before the match - and with attacking options of the quality of Recoba, Denis Rommedahl and Jesper Gronkjaer on display, little was missing in terms of flair or adventure. All that was needed was a goal. With a minute remaining before the break, it came, and in sublime fashion. Swift Danish interplay sent Gronkjaer into space on the left, and the Chelsea winger's first time ball was turned in at the near post by the onrushing Tomasson. Uruguay's 46th-minute equaliser was even better, an early contender for goal of the tournament. When the ball reached Rodriguez at knee height outside the left hand corner of the box, there was little apparent danger, but the defender's swinging left foot projected the ball at break-neck pace into the top corner. Such an open game was always likely to create more excitement, and with Denmark polishing attractive combinations and Uruguay's pace and directness threatening at every turn the match could have swung either way. Ultimately it was Uruguay who cracked. Right back Gustavo Mendez had a wretched evening, and in the 82nd minute the Danes cavorted down the corridor Mendez was supposed to be minding. Substitute Martin Jorgensen's swinging cross arrived at an ideal height for Tomasson, and his firm header bounced off the bar and into the net. Stats Uruguay (4-3-1-2): Carini; Mendez, Sorondo, Montero, Rodriguez (Magallanes 85); Varela, Garcia, Guigou; Recoba (Regueiro 79); Silva, Abreu (Morales 88). Booked: Mendez.

Referee: Saad Mane (Kuwait) - good game, unobtrusive and correct. Man of the match: Jon Dahl Tomasson. Scored two excellent goals, and his link-up play behind Ebbe Sand was smoothness itself.
