But what was it the Department of Local Government, Transport and the Regions was so keen to cover up? The press release at the heart of this controversy - referred to in Ms Moore's now famous e-mail as \"councillors' expenses\" - announced simply that \"key councillors\" in positions of particular responsibility might be eligible for pensions on the recommendation of an independent panel. The release dealt with two new consultation documents that also allow large councils to set their own travel and subsistence expenses and to pay a cycling allowance to local politicians. The issue of paying local politicians is certainly contentious. The local press likes nothing more than accusing councillors of greedily paying themselves high salaries with taxpayers' money. Legislation introduced last year means that councillors will be able to decide their own pay. With the introduction of executive city mayors and Westminster-style council cabinets, leading local politicians are taking on more responsibility than ever before - and look likely to gain higher salaries in return. An independent report commissioned by the Association of London Government, which represents the capital's boroughs, recently said that a council leader should be paid \u00a352,000, and a mayor \u00a365,000. Backbench councillors should get a basic \u00a38,500, the report found. Perhaps Ms Moore feared that her pensions announcement would re-awaken local controversy over paying councillors anything above their current allowance level. Or that local papers would argue against funding local pensions. The most charitable interpretation so far put upon her actions in the local government community is that Ms Moore simply has not had enough experience in council policy to realise that the press was perfectly capable of burying this story without any help from a spin doctor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
