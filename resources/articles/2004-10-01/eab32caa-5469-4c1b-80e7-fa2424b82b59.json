Connor, 47, who has been head coach of Athletics Australia since March 2001, has emerged as the winner of what became a two-horse race. Earlier yesterday it was revealed that only Charles van Commenee, who coached Denise Lewis to Olympic gold in 2000, remained on the shortlist to contest with Connor the pivotal position in the sport in Britain. Now both seem likely to return to their roots. Van Commenee is set to head back to his native Netherlands to take up a high-ranking position with the Dutch athletics federation. As an athlete, Connor won bronze in the 1984 Olympics, set a world indoor record of 17.31m in 1981 and was ranked No1 in the world with 17.57 in 1982. He remains third on the UK all-time rankings in the discipline, behind Jonathan Edwards and Phillips Idowu. Since his retirement he has established himself as the one of the world's leading coaches. When he moved to Australia he claimed that he had been denied a similar role in Britain because he was \"too feisty\", but his success since then has seen his reputation rise rapidly. In the Commonwealth Games in Manchester in 2002 his team won 28 medals. He also led the Australians in this year's Olympic Games in Athens, where rumours first started to circulate that he was being lined up for a return to Britain. Daley Thompson, the double Olympic decathlon champion, is understood to have applied for the role, which will officially be vacated by Max Jones in March, but the sport was looking for someone with greater coaching experience. Having settled on its chosen candidate, UKA is set to make an official announcement within days. The sport found itself under scrutiny in May when Sir Andrew Foster, the former chief executive of the audit commission, completed a review into athletics commissioned by Sport England and UK Sport. In his findings, he said that the position of performance director \"should be filled through international search. The aim should be to secure the services of the best available person in the world.\" Administrators will be confident that they have achieved that goal. When the position was advertised, applications were received from candidates across the world and David Moorcroft, the chief executive of UKA, said: \"We agree with the Foster report and want the very best available.\" Despite the wide range of applicants, Connor and Van Commenee have always been the favourites. At first it seemed the latter was in the better position, given that he was already working for UKA as technical director for combined events and jumps. He has an outstanding track record, his success with Lewis being followed by a bronze in Athens for his latest protege Kelly Sotherton, and is known for his no-nonsense approach to the sport. But in the end Connor has proved irresistible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
