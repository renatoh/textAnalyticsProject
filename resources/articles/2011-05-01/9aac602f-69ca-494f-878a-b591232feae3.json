The trust provides packages of food designed to feed a person, or a family, for three or four days. Its food sorting warehouse in Salisbury has the nostalgic feel of a 1980s harvest festival \u2013 you might find a crate of something unhelpful, such as piccalilli, next to a huge stash of longlife milk. The parcels themselves contain a very carefully thought-out, nutritionally balanced mix \u2013 but the sight of canned string beans definitely feels like a step back in time. More old-fashioned still is the fact there are so many people going hungry, and the problem is getting worse. Last year saw a 50% increase in the number of people helped by the trust's foodbanks, from 41,000 to 61,468. And in so far as you'd expect anyone to be hungry when there's a welfare state, these are not the people you'd expect to be hungry. They are working families, working couples without children, ex-servicemen, pensioners. We drop off two boxes to Margaret Stigling, who lives with her husband and two teenage daughters in a suburban close that looks like the executive bit of Brookside. Stigling had to give up work last year when she became ill; her husband had been made redundant the year previous. He has found work again since, in backbreaking quantities \u2013 at one point he was doing a 10-hour shift, sleeping two hours in his car, doing a night shift and then having one more hour's sleep before he started again \u2013 but his salary was far lower and they quickly got into debt. \"It's been devastating for my husband. He feels humiliated at not being able to provide for his children \u2026 I'm blessed with my children, they're not materialistic. But you can see they worry when there's not enough to eat.\" Fred Rees, a volunteer driver for the trust, says: \"I drop off to houses like that all the time\" \u2013 tidy, prosperous addresses where you'd think you'd be more likely to find a snow leopard than a person without enough to eat. The stories often involve crises in household debt, which is on a relentless surge upwards. Stigling never used a credit card except to clothe and feed her children, but still ended up at the mercy of spiralling repayments on credit cards, whose interest rates can jump tyrannically and without warning from 21 to 29% in a month (this really happened, this month, to this family). \"When you've had nine different creditors ringing you all week,\" Stigling says, \"and then someone like the Trussell Trust turns up, and they treat you with dignity, and park round the corner, and talk to you like a human being \u2026 we're very blessed to have people like this.\" The relentless hassle from creditors leads people to commit an unreasonable amount of their income to regular repayments, so there's no cushion at all when a crisis comes along. Claire and Pete, a stonemason, hit trouble when Pete had to take eight weeks off work with a spinal injury. His statutory sick pay didn't cover their monthly bills. \"I agreed to repayments that were more than I could afford,\" he explains. \"I should have just said what I could manage \u2013 then if they took me to court, they took me to court.\" It's not all debt \u2013 mistakes and delays in benefits account for a lot of financial emergencies. Most people who apply for government crisis loans don't get them, and those that do have \u2013 almost immediately \u2013 a fresh creditor waiting to hassle them. And the Department for Work and Pensions is a lot hotter on other people's debts than its own mistakes. Naturally, there are also people who just slip through the net. Wayne Branch was in the army and came out four years ago, having served five. He realised almost immediately he wanted to go back in \u2013 \"I missed everyone. I missed everyone a lot. I'm a bit lost out here\" \u2013 but the army wouldn't have him because by then he'd snapped his ankle. He was soon homeless, and had been for some time when he arrived at the foodbank centre on Wednesday. \"I had beans on toast and a cup of tea. They gave me a food parcel. They introduced me to the Salisbury Trust for the Homeless. I got a room in a shared house. Within a day, my life had been turned around. You'd never get that kind of help from the council. Or the army, for that matter.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
