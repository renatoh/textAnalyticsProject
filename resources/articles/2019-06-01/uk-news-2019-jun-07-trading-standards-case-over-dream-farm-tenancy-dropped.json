Dan Jones, 40, saw off competition from thousands of shepherds and farmers to take on Parc Farm, owned by the National Trust, on the Great Orme headland in north Wales. The farm is worth an estimated \u00a31m but the tenancy was priced at just \u00a31 a year to give him a chance to focus on conservation as well as animal husbandry. During a four-day trial in Llandudno, it was alleged that Conwy county borough council\u2019s trading standards officers discovered problems with some aspects of how the farm was being managed. On Friday the prosecution halted the case, saying it no longer believed it was in the public interest. As he left court, Jones said: \u201cIt\u2019s the end of a nightmare. It was a dream come true turned into a nightmare.\u201d His solicitor, David Kirwan, said: \u201cI am very, very disappointed with the attitude of the council. There has been no apology. They nearly ruined a very honest and well respected man.\u201d Giving evidence on Thursday, Jones told the district judge Gwyn Jones that he had been battling with the elements since taking over the farm and had fought to keep sheep away from cliff edges and out of people\u2019s gardens. He said it had been a struggle to deal with the competing interests of organisations involved in the land. Trading standards officers visited the farm after a complaint from a member of the public about dead sheep. It was claimed officers found three carcasses. There were no animal welfare concerns but Jones faced one charge of failing to dispose of carcasses, one of failing to keep a register of animal movements and nine of failing to notify the authorities of animals he had received between 2016, when he took over the tenancy, and 2018. He denied the charges. Dropping the case, the prosecuting barrister John Wyn Williams claimed it had been right to test the evidence in court, but he said: \u201cThe council are keenly aware Mr Jones is a man of impeccable good character.\u201d The district judge told Jones: \u201cYour good name remains.\u201d Kirwan argued in court: \u201cThe person who\u2019s suffered the most here is Daniel Jones. His unblemished life has been on hold and has been a hell and a nightmare \u2013 they are his own words. The nightmare is over but it will, unsurprisingly, probably affect him for the rest of his life. My client has suffered greatly. He hasn\u2019t slept, he\u2019s not a well man and it\u2019s cost him a fortune to preserve his good name.\u201d When the tenancy was offered in 2016, the National Trust called it an \u201cincredible life-changing opportunity\u201d and said its offices were dealing with more than 100 inquiries an hour, including from as far away as Australia, Brazil and Japan. Jones said at the time: \u201cI couldn\u2019t quite believe it when I got the call to say I was successful. I was in shock. My wife, Ceri, son Efan and I are just super excited. This opportunity will change our lives. Y Parc is a dream farm, it is such a beautiful location, the views are amazing and I\u2019m really looking forward to farming in a different way to make a difference for nature. With the tenancy at just a pound, it allows us to be able to farm far less intensively, focus on improving the habitats.\u201d The Great Orme is home to wild cotoneaster shrubs and two subspecies of butterfly, the grayling and the silver-studded blue, that exist nowhere else. No one from the council was available for comment on Friday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
