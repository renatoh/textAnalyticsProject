After four years spent alongside each other in various technical areas it will be strange for Newcastle United\u2019s interim head coach to see his former ally urging on renascent Crystal Palace from the adjacent dugout. Not that Carver is ruling out a working reunion a few years down the line. \u201cAlan didn\u2019t talk about England when he was here,\u201d he said. \u201cBut me, Andy Woodman [Newcastle\u2019s goalkeeping coach] and Steve Stone [the club\u2019s first team coach] would have a laugh and a joke about it. We\u2019d say \u2018do you think he\u2019ll take us to England with him\u2019. We\u2019d have a bit of craic in the golf club about it. We used to have a laugh and a joke about England but Alan always remained focused on managing Newcastle.\u201d If Carver was in light-hearted mode when he bantered about getting measured up for an England track-suit with Stone and Woodman, he is deadly serious about Pardew\u2019s credentials for the national job. \u201cThe England manager gets criticised by everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cThere would be big pressure on Alan but he could deal with it.\u201d Sceptics may suggest Pardew\u2019s headbutt on David Meyler at Hull last spring, not to mention his verbal abuse of Manchester City\u2019s Manuel Pellegrini during an expletive laden technical area tirade last winter could disqualify him but Carver regards those two incidents as isolated, entirely uncharacteristic, aberrations. \u201cWorking with him every day I never saw anything like that in Alan\u2019s character,\u201d he said. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t like that.\u201d Should Pardew defy the odds and keep Palace in mid-table the Football Association\u2019s head hunters seeking Roy Hodgson\u2019s eventual replacement may prefer to remember his fifth-place Premier League finish on a tight budget at Newcastle and his 2012 manager of the year award. Yet despite many objective observers believing Pardew did an excellent job in often difficult circumstances on Tyneside before leaving for Palace after Christmas, he became a hate figure for many Newcastle fans and withstood months of abuse during a torrid 2014. \u201cThe criticism Alan took was tough but he dealt with it,\u201d Carver said. \u201cI\u2019m not sure there are many people out there who could have dealt with it like he did. His personality helped him and he helped me become a little bit stronger and more thick-skinned. \u201cThe way Alan coped with it all taught me some invaluable lessons. He taught me it\u2019s important not to be around the training ground all the time \u2013 about the need to spend time with your friends and the need to make time for a round of golf. It\u2019s about not believing what you read in the newspapers and not getting yourself tied up reading blogs and things like that which was something I did when I managed Toronto because it does affect you psychologically. \u201cI thought some of the treatment Alan received was harsh but he was honourable and he stood up to it. He was as strong as an ox. His strength helped me and Steve Stone. He was a leader.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
