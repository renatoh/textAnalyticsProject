Anti-corruption campaigner Global Witness is urging ENRC to publish the results of an internal inquiry into allegations made by at least two whistleblowers at the firm, which is understood to include an investigation into the group's ties to Israeli tycoon Dan Gertler. Gertler has been dogged by accusations that a close relationship with DRC president Joseph Kabila has allowed him to buy interests in the country's mining assets on the cheap. The Global Witness report states: \"The offshore shell companies associated with Mr Gertler and paid by ENRC are obscure entities which have been registered in secrecy jurisdictions and have therefore not declared their full list of beneficiaries. Global Witness believes that these offshore structures could allow corrupt Congolese officials to benefit from these deals. If this is correct, ENRC may have poured money into corrupt transactions.\" ENRC has acquired stakes in mining concessions from Gertler at prices that appear to have delivered the Israeli's offshore companies handsome \u2013 and speedy \u2013 profits. The FTSE 100 group's purchases have also been criticised for being at levels significantly less than the true market value, meaning the company and its partner could have profited at the expense of one of the poorest populations on Earth. The call for more transparency at ENRC comes after the mining company's new chairman, Mehmet Dalman, refused to back Gertler in an interview with the Guardian last week. When asked if he has ever had any concerns about doing business with the Israeli, Dalman replied: \"You know that is such a leading question I'm not even going to respond to it, right? \u2026 Any comment I make, whatever you write down, it will not look right. Why would I answer that question? It is a no-win situation for me. Don't give me questions that I will look bad on, right? Come on. Be fair.\" The Global Witness report lists five deals it is concerned about that ENRC has completed in the DRC. Its questions centre on how Gertler's offshore companies \"obtained their licences in deals that were conducted in secrecy and not subject to public tenders\"; how the offshore entities \"have not revealed their full list of beneficiaries [so] there is a risk that these beneficiaries could include corrupt Congolese officials\"; and how \"in at least two cases ENRC bankrolled the initial purchases by Gertler-related offshore companies instead of doing business directly with the Congolese government\". Scrutiny of these deals \u2013 plus similar transactions conducted with Gertler by FTSE 100 commodity trader Glencore \u2013 have led to promises of a parliamentary investigation. Last month, Pauline Latham MP, a member of the international development select committee, issued a statement asking: \"Are London-listed firms using Dan Gertler and shell companies to navigate around anti-bribery legislation?\" Glencore, ENRC and Gertler deny any wrongdoing and say the transactions were properly conducted. In response to the Global Witness report, ENRC said: \"ENRC is committed to upholding the highest standards of corporate governance and implements a zero-tolerance policy to bribery and corruption across all of our operations. In bringing significant and much-needed investment to the DRC, ENRC has fully complied with regulations and disclosure obligations.\" A spokesman for Gertler's Fleurette Group said: \"Fleurette has continually stated that the only beneficiaries [of Fleurette Group] are the Gertler Family Trust for the family members of Dan Gertler.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
