It also needs to consider questions of accountability and trust. Giles, the opposition spokesman on cities and urban infrastructure and a former deputy chair of the joint standing committee on electoral matters, told a seminar at the University of Melbourne that policy agendas meant little to voters in 2019 \u201cif no one believes it could ever be delivered\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s the point, fundamentally, of all our campaigning if it\u2019s met with a resigned cynicism at best, or outright rejection at worst,\u201d Giles said. \u201cWe need to think about who\u2019s participating, and how. We need to think about whether all Australians\u2019 concerns are reflected and represented. We need to think about who\u2019s not involved \u2013 whether by choice or by having been excluded.\u201d The challenge was not so much executing a technical review but arriving at an understanding of why people were alienated from the system: \u201cI believe that the challenge is to reinforce and rebuild electoral and political institutions which support trust and confidence in our democracy.\u201d His comments come as the joint standing committee on electoral matters is inquiring into the conduct of the election, and Labor has urged the committee to investigate specifically whether the digital behemoths are having a negative impact on Australian democracy after Facebook refused to take down fake news about the \u201cdeath tax\u201d circulating during the May election campaign. He hoped the committee could make useful suggestions at the end of its inquiry if it was prepared to ask the right questions, and said that during the last parliament it managed \u201cto reach significant agreements on a multi-partisan basis\u201d. But fixing deficiencies in the system required politicians to understand trust and confidence was waning in democracies around the world, including Australia, for a range of reasons. \u201cOur accountability framework simply isn\u2019t what it should be,\u201d he said. \u201cThe very notion of a truly independent public service providing frank and fearless advice to government is under siege. Our freedom of information laws have become something close to a joke. \u201cIn this age of big data, it\u2019s getting harder and harder to obtain information about government decision-making. On a closely related note, the other declining institution we need to think about is the news media.\u201d There had been considerable attention in recent weeks on press freedom, he said. \u201cThreats to press freedom and the public\u2019s right to know are critical, but [are] only part of the problem,\u201d he said. \u201cOur democracy rests on shared understandings \u2013 being able to share in a national conversation. I\u2019m worried that the fragmentation of our traditional media, the pressures on journalists and the practice of journalism, as well as the encroachment of the social media giants, has eroded our capacity to carry on this conversation. \u201cCurated news consumption narrows our understanding of the world, and diminishes our capacity to engage in meaningful debate. Without restoring a genuine national conversation, I fear any other reforms to our electoral or political institutions may prove worthless\u201d. He hoped the committee would look at nuts and bolts, like recommending real-time disclosure of donations with an appropriate disclosure limit of $1,000, and consider expenditure caps. \u201cThe extraordinary role of Clive Palmer in May\u2019s election demands a response,\u201d he said. \u201cA billionaire spending $60m is a powerful reminder that the problem isn\u2019t just about party fundraising and disclosure. It\u2019s about dealing with an understanding that our politics can be purchased.\u201d Giles said the other side of that coin was \u201cthe sense of alienation felt by too many Australians\u201d. \u201cLet\u2019s think about those not enrolled to vote, those who didn\u2019t vote, and those whose ballots reflected frustration not inspiration,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s not lose sight of the main game here: restoring confidence in the possibilities of Australian politics [and] developing and committing to an institutional framework that we can all have faith in.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
