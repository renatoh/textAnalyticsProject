Those elections, usually seen as an important marker in the political calendar, have instead been postponed along with parliament and most of the UK economy amid the coronavirus pandemic. The leadership contest has gained little coverage as the NHS struggles with demand for intensive care beds. With Labour\u2019s support, civil liberties have been curtailed as Boris Johnson\u2019s government tries to eradicate the coronavirus and stem the spiralling number of deaths. If, as expected, Keir Starmer wins the contest on Saturday, he will lead the party in a world where he will be expected to hold ministers to account as they make momentous decisions about Treasury spending, NHS services, logistics, mass surveillance and food supplies. Far from being cowed by the challenge, Starmer\u2019s supporters believe his background as a former director of public prosecutions makes him an ideal potential leader at a time of national crisis. Angela Eagle, the MP for Wallasey and a former minister, said this was a moment made for a serious politician such as Starmer. \u201cThere are pivot points in history where leaders can remake the political weather and set the agenda. This is one of them. And I think Keir has the personal and moral authority and a strategic vision to rise to the occasion,\u201d she said. Andrew Fisher, a former head of policy for Jeremy Corbyn, said the next Labour leader would have to keep their focus on who the government will expect to pay for the \u00a3350bn of support for the economy in the face of the pandemic. \u201cWhenever this coronavirus crisis ends, the country is going to be in huge debt, spending will have gone up, there will be a lot more people claiming benefits, the Tories\u2019 economic plans will be ripped up and they will be looking for someone to pay,\u201d he said. \u201cLabour has got to be very strong at making sure it\u2019s not the most vulnerable who pay the price. We were quite weak on that in the five years after the financial crash.\u201d Fisher said it was important that if Starmer won he ensured the shadow cabinet reflected views across the party and not within a single faction. \u201cHe is obviously going to change the shadow cabinet ... but he does need to find a balance, a broad church in a Wilsonian way, so he does have a range of opinion in there,\u201d he said. He added that a new leader would have to react to the Conservatives\u2019 recent conversion to approving the partial nationalisation of transport. \u201cThe new leader will have to look at the measures put in place temporarily and work out which they want to continue and campaigning for those where appropriate.\u201d Society will have changed after the coronavirus, Fisher said, which may increase a Labour government\u2019s appeal as long as the party sets a radical economic agenda. \u201cPeople\u2019s values, people\u2019s experiences have shifted. We don\u2019t know what the level of unemployment will be or the level of people on reduced hours will be at the end of this crisis but it\u2019s clearly going to be substantially up,\u201d he said. \u201cLabour can tap into that at the right time. Trying to be too sharply political at this time when people are very anxious about their security, housing and income and their health would be wrong and I think Labour has got the tone right.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
