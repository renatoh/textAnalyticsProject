The world is an eerie, unfamiliar place, and for rugby league fans it will never be more obvious than on Good Friday when the traditional derby between two of the sport\u2019s most famous sides is absent. Separated by only eight miles across Billinge Hill, these two north-west towns where rugby league is akin to a religion can often guarantee entertainment when they collide. Never was that more evident than 16 years ago. \u201cI think if you were going to draw up all the ingredients for a perfect derby, Good Friday 2004 was the one,\u201d says the former St Helens full-back Paul Wellens, who played that day at the Saints\u2019 Knowsley Road stadium in the unforgettable 21-21 draw. His opposite number has equally fond memories. Kris Radlinski was celebrating his 28th birthday in front of a capacity crowd, the majority of whom were in no mood to pass on good wishes. \u201cPlaying at Knowsley Road was brilliant but at the same time, absolutely awful,\u201d he says. \u201cThey once painted the changing rooms a funny colour because psychologically it was supposed to send you out on to the field tired. It was a strange place.\u201d St Helens were unbeaten and preserved that run with a last-gasp drop goal from Sean Long that cancelled out an earlier effort from Andy Farrell. That was anything but the full story, though. \u201cIt was an unbelievable game, such a high intensity throughout \u2026 and obviously a bit of controversy,\u201d says Wellens. That controversy is what makes the 2004 derby perhaps the most indelible in living memory. With the score 20-20 heading into the final quarter, and tensions starting to brew amid driving rain \u2013 traditional north-west Easter weather, some might say \u2013 the moment many had perhaps quietly expected from a game of this magnitude materialised. There had been flare-ups throughout the opening hour but then St Helens\u2019 Jon Wilkin and Wigan\u2019s Terry Newton exchanged blows at the ruck. What followed was what many remember as a 26-man brawl, though one saw it slightly differently. \u201cI stayed well away \u2026 not a chance was I getting involved,\u201d Radlinski says. The iconic image is of Farrell and Paul Sculthorpe, two of British rugby league\u2019s greatest captains, hurling punches at each other as almost every player fought alongside them, and had it not been for Radlinski\u2019s opposite number it may have been even worse. Wellens was the man who managed to cool down the two Great Britain captains, though it was not a universally popular move. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I was thinking trying to break those two up \u2013 and I got some stick for it,\u201d he says. \u201cA few of my mates were in the pub afterwards and when I went in to meet them, I got booed. I asked what they were booing me for and they said they were annoyed I stopped the scrap because it was about to get properly tasty!\u201d Wilkin and Newton, the instigators of the brawl, were sent to the sin-bin; incredibly, no further action was taken against anyone else. Farrell and Long\u2019s respective drop goals ensured the points were split and with no live Super League at the weekend Saints and Wigan will replay the classic in full on their social media channels on Friday afternoon. It will serve as a reminder to many of how during testing times sport can provide an invaluable escape. Those in St Helens and Wigan will appreciate that pick-me-up especially. \u201cYou\u2019re told when you\u2019re filling your car up or going into the shops how beating Wigan is all people from St Helens really care about,\u201d says Wellens, who grew up a stone\u2019s thrown from Knowsley Road. Even when you play amateur games against that lot over the hill it\u2019s drummed into you how you\u2019ve got to beat Wigan.\u201d Radlinski, now Wigan\u2019s executive director, agrees. \u201cThe overseas lads that come in are reminded early on what this derby means to people in this town. Help us win one and you\u2019ll be remembered forever. I think with what\u2019s going on at the minute, we\u2019ll never take the enjoyment from that for granted ever again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
