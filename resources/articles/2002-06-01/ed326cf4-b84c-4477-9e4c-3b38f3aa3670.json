But she did a great deal more than that. Seven and a half years after her last competitive singles, when she lost to Gabriela Sabatini in the Virginia Slims Championship, 12 years after winning her last grand slam, 24 years after her first appearance here, and having had only one set of singles practice, Navratilova returned to beat a player close to the world's top 20. She won 6-1, 4-6, 6-2 against Tatiana Panova, the world No22 from Russia. The action contained a beautifully controlled display of how the old-style serve-and-volley game can beat the modern bash-and-run-from-the-baseline brigade, and the outcome, in Navratilova's own words, was \"something pretty amazing for the over-40 set\". She bridled, however, at suggestions that her win would be seen as a reflection on the poor state of the women's game. \"If anybody says the women aren't good I'll get really upset, because they are good. I can still play this game and I can certainly still play it on grass. Don't look at age, look at ability.\" If anyone wanted to make a comeback and be sure of looking youngish, there could hardly be a better venue, and yesterday even the grey-and-grizzlies perked up as the atmosphere built. But Navratilova was here not by choice but because she had lost a bet. That happened when her trainer Giselle Tirado said last month that she thought Navratilova and her doubles partner Natasha Zvereva were ready to win a title together. When Navratilova bet that they were not, the penalty for being wrong was she should play singles, and after victory in the doubles in Madrid extended her all-time record of titles to 167, Eastbourne was the first chance to keep her end of the bargain. There will be no further attempt at former glories at Wimbledon but yesterday's memory-jerker provided enough sentiment to last a long time. It also seemed to have been choreographed in contrasts. Panova wore a gold shirt and a skimpy blue skirt whereas Navratilova appeared in a white sleeveless top, slightly large white shorts and spectacles. The styles also traversed the eras. After a nervy first game with two double faults, Navratilova made such headway with her accurate serve and penetrating volleys that it seemed she might win by a mile. But Panova had not previously played against anyone who did this, and in the second set she started to get used to it. The passes began to thread down the lines and Navratilova had to find new ways to stop them. She did it by finding ways to play her way forward, often on the third shot, which worked quite well but at the cost of being dragged into long rallies with the 25-year-old. Once in the third set she stuck her tongue out painfully after a tough exchange, and at 2-2 she was trudging back to the baseline with ever shortening strides. The break she got in that crucial game and Panova's indifferent service game next time round possibly saved her. It was over after an hour and 36 minutes and triumph was tinged with relief. Navratilova completed it with some near-perfect serve-volley angles, then hit four balls into the crowd with a flourish, broke into a wide smile and tried to convince everyone she had not lost a yard of speed. \"I don't think I am any slower than eight years ago but I just had to remind myself to run,\" she said. The truth of that may well be better tested today when she may need to move up a level against the teenager Daniela Hantuchova, the world No13 for whom Navratilova is the WTA Tour personal mentor. \"She's going to be a great player,\" Navratilova said. \"But I won't be telling her how to play me.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
