Even if the rising tide of the far right Front National (FN) had been held back \u2013 temporarily at least \u2013 by tactical voting and a leap in turnout, the lessons were clear to see. The nationalist, anti-immigration, anti-European party was here to stay. There were no winners in an election that consisted of establishment parties running around at the last minute trying desperately to outwit what they warned was a racist, xenophobic, Islamophobic and overwhelmingly dangerous party. There was no serious examination of the reasons why voters were turning away from the parties of government and flocking to the FN not just as a mere protest vote, but as a political alternative. When the FN made a historic breakthrough and took nearly 28% of the vote in the first round of the regional elections, it was yet another moment in which the party was ranked as \u201cthe most popular in France\u201d after successively topping a series of polls from the European elections onwards in a steady rise. Even if the FN has failed to win overall control of a region \u2013 just as it had failed to win overall control of any smaller local d\u00e9partements earlier this year \u2013 its broad trajectory is on the up. A BVA poll during the campaign found that 57% of French people now feel the FN should be considered as a party like any other. Its voters can no longer be confined to a particular stereotype. It is true that it tends broadly to score higher among younger people or those with lower levels of education, that its reach has grown in areas of inequality, and that the further away a person lives from a railway station the more chance they have of voting FN. But it has also expanded its reach to public sector workers, more employees in private companies and is reaching every strata in society from Alpine villages to suburban towns. Crucially, France faces a presidential election in less than 18 months. The FN leader Marine Le Pen is predicted to easily make it to the second-round presidential run-off by knocking out one of her mainstream rivals. When her father Jean-Marie Le Pen did just this in 2002, it came as a thunderbolt of shock. He was squarely beaten when 82% of voters from all parties opted for Jacques Chirac to keep Le Pen bay. Fifteen years later, if Marine Le Pen makes the second round, it will not be a shock and she is likely to seriously narrow the gap. The parliamentary elections that follow could be painful and difficult for the mainstream right and left. It was clear from every muted regional election night speech on Sunday that the left and right that have swung back and forth in France\u2019s two-party system for years know they should look hard at reinventing themselves in order to counter the FN. The far right now occupies a centre space in the French political debate and claims to have won \u201cthe battle of ideas\u201d, as both the mainstream right and \u2013 since the Paris attacks \u2013 the left borrow from it. As in 2002, the buzzword of this election campaign has been exasperation. All parties claimed to have taken note of the exasperation and despair felt by FN voters who have come to loathe and mistrust the political class. France\u2019s high unemployment and economic stagnation have played their role. How deep the reforms and soul-searching, which failed to take place in 2002, will now go remains to be seen. But Xavier Bertrand, the rightwing former minister who beat Le Pen in the north thanks to tactical voting from the left, said it plainly in his speech: \u201cThis is our last chance.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
