South Africa are the Rugby World Champions for a third time, led by the inspirational Siya Kolisi. In rugby league there was a stunning upset as Tonga downed the reigning world champions Australia at the Oceania Cup in Auckland. 16-12 the final score, as the Pasifika hung on in front of a vocal, home-like crowd. Some belting games from the WBBL, Liz Lee showing her brilliance with bat in hand as the Stars won their first of the season, while Adelaide Strikers and Sydney Sixers also got Ws. A remarkable first ever Victory-Western United Melbourne derby in the A-League, as it took five goals to separate the two after a pulsating four-goal first half. And that\u2019s Sportwatch! That late batting collapse proves costly for the Heat, giving up five balls as much as anything as they failed to bat out their 20 overs. The Strikers doing it comfortably in the end - with eight wickets to spare - as Patterson and Bates both knock unbeaten 50s to get them there, and to send Adelaide back to the top of the table. In fairness it was closer than perhaps many would have imagined after that blitzkrieg opening knock from Lizelle Lee. They looked okay with Meg Lanning and Natalie Sciver knocking the ones and twos, but when the Southern Stars skipper fell they couldn\u2019t quite fashion any partnerships, the Scorchers. Kristen Beams and Erin Osborne turning the screws with some economical bowling - and Stars, at a fifth time of asking have their first WBBL win of the season! Full-time: Rugby World Cup final - England 12-32 South Africa My, oh golly my. What a result this is, and by all accounts - a performance to match. Congratulations to South Africa - they join New Zealand as three time winners of the famous Webb-Ellis cup! It was won in the forwards, it was closed by the backs. A full team performance, and deserving winners. Here\u2019s Lee Calvert: We\u2019re going to the wire in both the WBBL fixtures currently underway. Adelaide appear in a better position, they\u2019ve at 2-101 off 14 overs with the required runs 39 off 33 balls. Suzie Bates and Bridget Patterson with a handy partership, picking the ones and twos and getting the scoreboard ticking over. For Perth, it may just be slipping away, losing the wicket of Meg Lanning a key turning point in their run chase. It\u2019s not over - but 43 of 18 might require something special. Watch this space. A truly remarkable game of A-League football - and a key statement made by Western United. Could this be a fillip for the new club to really mark it\u2019s presence in the Melbourne football landscape? They did lose their first Melbourne derby last weekend against City, but you just sensed for Rudan and his players this was the big one. \u201cI\u2019m very happy that this.. is finished\u201d. Terrific from Besart Berisha post-match. \u201cAll week I have had this emotion. Coming back against this fantastic club. The reason I came to Western United was to win games and help the team - and we showed great mentality to win tonight.\u201d \u201cIn ten minutes they get two goals - you think, what is happening here. But if you play like this after two-nil at their stadium, I think then this is good team.\u201d That\u2019s all she wrote! It\u2019s a courageous win for the new kids on the block in the first ever Victory-United Melbourne derby. The hosts have NEVER lost from 2-0 up in the history of the A-League. They have now. What a game - what drama - and what a result for Rudad\u2019s Army! 90 + 4 min: The seconds are ticking over, it\u2019s glacial stuff for the Western bench - they can\u2019t wait for this to end. Toivonen looks to feed Athiu - Durante gets there first but is he fouled? Referee says no - corner to Victory, and up comes Lawrence Thomas the \u2018keeper! 90 + 2 min: There\u2019s five minutes added on. Victory look to lump it long and continue to probe the aerial threat of Athiu. Rudan brings Calver on for Diamanti. Another defensive change - they\u2019re really looking to shut up shot, Western United. Poulsen appeals for handball, but referee Faghani doesn\u2019t give it. 88 min: They\u2019re huffing and puffling, Victory, but they\u2019re not exactly finding a cutting edge in the final third. Berisha makes way for the youngster Dylan Pierias, a defensive change for Western United. Before Gulum stoops to head clear, and cops an Athiu high boot. Connor Pain tries to get in the big striker\u2019s face. Lol. It\u2019s like when Gary Neville thought he could stare down Peter Schmeichel. Jog on, son. 85 min: It\u2019s getting very hot on the touchline - I guess as you\u2019d expect in a derby. Durante goes down with an \u201cinjury\u201d and the hugely-experienced Iranian referee Alireza Faghani gives him a pretty curt \u201cget up, ya mug\u201d and play goes on. Donachie with a strong intervention, sparks a counter for Kenny Athiu, but Kurto intercepts well. 82 min: Cripes! Filip Kurto has come 35m out of his goal to contest a header after Victory fire a long ball forward for Kamsoba. It\u2019s a fine intervention in the end, but my. That was dangerous. He almost found himself in no-man\u2019s land! And it\u2019s Donachie who heads a ball goalwards - that was awfully close for the Victory, but was Toivonen held by Gulum in the lead up to that set piece? VAR doesn\u2019t choose to get involved. 79 min: And the Berisha \u201cequaliser\u201d has been officially recorded as a Donachie own goal, which frankly is just a sucker punch for headline writers. It was the Kosovan\u2019s presence that made the goal, though, even if the Victory defender perhaps got the final telling touch. McDonald jogs off as Max Burgess comes on. A fine showing from the former Socceroo. How relieved will he be to have notched his first goal. 74 min: Terrific work from Scott McDonald who continues to bustle and strive for his side. What a competitor, and what a character - no wonder he wanted the 36-year-old back in his side, Rudan. Fellow veteran Andrew Durante lopes forward out of defence, but the move peters out and Josh Risdon takes a yellow card to stifle the Victory counter attack. 68 min: So Dobras gives way for Kenny Athiu, but Toivonen returns to the pitch after some heavy strapping on that troubled ankle. Rudan urges his side on from the touchline - they need to lift, Western United, it\u2019s been all defence since their third goal. 63 min: It\u2019s Victory coming more and more into this game, as Western United begin to think about protecting their lead. Dobras tries to fashion a chance, but it\u2019s clipped over the bar. Concern for home fans though as Toivonen goes down with an ankle injury, and now Dobras is also down receiving treatment. My, oh my. Both Victory\u2019s goalscorers - and chief attacking threats - appear to be in the wars. Rugby World Cup final - England 6-12 South Africa, half-time: And an update from the big dance in Yokohama. It\u2019s the underdogs with their noses in front at the break. England have had the lion\u2019s share of territory and possession, but it\u2019s the Proteas who have looked brighter ball in hand. Two defences very much on top and working hard, as only the goal kickers have found any joy. Follow Lee Calvert for the latest: 56 min: So, we\u2019re coming up to hour mark, and after that early melee following Broxham\u2019s rash challenge, it\u2019s fair to say the intensity has in no way tailed off in this one. A close up of Marco Kurz on the touchline, and he\u2019s as \u201cengaged\u201d as you\u2019d expect him to be. What a night for the fourth official - stuck between him and Mark Rudan. And they almost draw level, Victory. Basha with a well-flighted freekick into the box, but Tommy Deng sends it wide - via the shoulder! WBBL - Brisbane Heat all out for 139 off 19.1 It\u2019s a late fightback from the Strikers who looked on the ropes at 5 for 120 after just 15 overs. But they\u2019ve fought back well to wrap up the Heat tail, Mooney the only key scorer with 73 off 49. It\u2019s still an imposing total - but have they bought themselves a lifeline, Adelaide? The wickets shared between five bowlers - hard to choose the pick of them, with the figures all pretty economic. Now over to the bats(wo)men. Goal! Melbourne Victory 2-3 Western United (McDonald) There it is for Scott McDonald! A first ever goal on Australian soil for the Socceroo who infamously could never score. It\u2019s a terrific pivot inside the box from the former Celtic sharp-shooter, and it bustles home courtesy a deflection, but it\u2019s more than fitting for his first-half work. Kone found the former Socceroo, and he turned sharply to fire goalwards. What more does this game have in store?! 48 min: Oh wow. Leigh Broxham has gone sliding into a tackle with Kone with two feet - he\u2019d already been booked, the Victory stalwart, and the Western United players are apoplectic as he just receives a talking to. We all applaud refereeing that keeps the game going, but wow. He\u2019s incredibly lucky to still be on the pitch, the Victory midfielder. A-League - second half! Right! We\u2019re back - any chance we can hope for another belting 45 minutes? Imagine if it finished 4-4. The message no doubt has been for both sides to tighten up. We\u2019ll soon see if that\u2019s filtered through these two sets of fierce competitors. WBBL - Lizelle Lee fires century as Stars blast 3-155 in first innings And what a knock in the WBBL. We foreshadowed the prodigious ability of the South African wicket keeper pre-match, but wow. 103* off 65 balls. She\u2019s single-handedly taken apart this Scorchers attack. Three early sixes and then thirteen fours. It was a more controlled innings as it went on, and they\u2019re in a commanding position now, Melbourne Stars, to win what would be, remarkably, their first of the season after five rounds. What can the Scorchers hit back with? A-League - Victory 2-2 Western United, half-time: A cracking half, that. It\u2019s almost like all the frustration from the earlier Wanderers-Roar fixture that finished 0-0, was released in an orgy of footballing excitement just then. What a wild first 45 minutes. A penny for both Mark Rudan and Marco Kurz\u2019s thoughts at half-time. Two of the more passionate coaches in the A-League, and they\u2019ll be delighted and concerned by that showing in equal measure. Perfect viewing for a neutral. A-League - Victory 2-2 Western United, 40\u2019: Post! It\u2019s Scott McDonald - and the man who has scored buckets for Celtic, has goals in the Champions League, has come agonisingly close to putting United ahead! Thomas had no chance, what a strike. And at the other end, it\u2019s the youngster Brandon Lauton, handed a start in Andrew Nabbout and Robbie Kruse\u2019s absence - who almost conjures a sublime effort! He clips a looping effort first time, and it only just flies over Filip Kurto\u2019s crossbar. End to end stuff. And a Melbourne derby in the NBL that\u2019s just concluded as well - here\u2019s the write up from Australian Associated Press: Melbourne United have scored their first win over new cross-town rivals South East Melbourne Phoenix with a 110-98 victory on Saturday night. Languishing near the bottom of the NBL ladder with a 1-4 record, United led from start to finish at Melbourne Arena to extract some revenge for the Phoenix\u2019s three-point win in their maiden derby clash in round one. United\u2019s import centre Shawn Long was the dominant figure in the contest as he collected 31 points and 11 rebounds, Chris Goulding (24 points) providing valuable support. Long stamped his authority on the game with 16 in the first quarter to propel United to a 13-point halftime lead before the Phoenix came charging back in the third quarter. But after seeing their lead cut to five, United steadied the ship before taking control of the match in the final stanza. Goal! Melbourne Victory 2-2 Western United (Berisha) Oh come on. What is going on in Melbourne?? It was written in the stars - but on his first return to Victory territory, Besart Berisha - the A-League\u2019s all-time greatest goalscorer has found the equaliser, against the club where he won so much silverware. It was terrific vision from Scott McDonald to pick out Josh Risdon, whose sharp cross picked out Bes. And did he miss? Did he $%^&amp;. What a game we have now - less than 30 minutes played! A-League - Victory 2-1 Western United, 26 min: So, you\u2019d have to say, a comparative lull after that frenetic start to this one. Mark Rudan will be chewing wasps on the sideline, both the Victory goals came from defensive errors, with centre backs Andrew Durante and Connor Chapman both turning over cheap balll with passes out from the back that failed to find their target. As we try to catch our breath, a quick update from the two WBBL games. We\u2019ve seen her go BANG before, but Lizelle Lee looks in imperious form once again for the Stars. They\u2019re 2-109 off 14, but it\u2019s the South African who\u2019s whacked three sixes and 11 fours, helping herself to 79* off 47 balls. They\u2019ve tried seven different bowlers already, the Scorchers, but they\u2019ve all received the same treatment. Whack. Meanwhile, after 10 overs in Mackay, it\u2019s the Beth Mooney show as the home side move to 2-79. 49 of those scored by the Southern Stars blaster, who eyes her half-century. Goal! Melbourne Victory 2-1 Western United (Diamanti) 15 min: Oh my! What a start to this match. It\u2019s a half-clearance that drops kindly to the Western United marquee on the edge of the box, and it\u2019s a brilliant improvised finish. Something from the highest draw of the futsal skillsets, and he arrows that home into Lawrence Thomas\u2019 bottom corner! What a moment of brilliance. Game on! Oh my. A lot happening at once, and I was thinking we\u2019d missed a few minutes of the inaugural Victory-Western derby, but golly gee. We\u2019ve just hit the 10 minute mark, and there\u2019s already been two goals! Marquee man and skipper Ola Toivonen the X-factor - it was the big Swede who opened the scoring on just six minutes, before a minute later turning provider for new visa signing Kristian Dobras! Melbourne Victory 2, Western United 0. Now - I mentioned elsewhere that minor matter of the Rugby Union World Cup final. That\u2019s not too far away from getting going, so join our eyes on the prize Lee Calvert for every moment of that one: Better him than me - I\u2019m probably still not over being the only Australian in a pub full of Englishmen in 2003, and that Johnny Wilkinson kicking show. Have to say it - the English: the worst winners in the world. (Outside Australians, probably.) I\u2019ll be honest, we\u2019ve had a few warnings over the past year or two (most notably at the Rugby League World Cup) that Pasifika nations like Tonga and Samoa are a real rising presence in Rugby League, but now they\u2019ve completed the clean sweep against the three top nations - England done, New Zealand done, and now the Kangaroos. Amazing stuff, and hopefully that\u2019s a fillip for Tongan rugby league to sort out it\u2019s administrative issues. 80 min: James Tedesco scurries from dummy half, and he\u2019s pulled down 1m short of the line. The Kangaroos besiege the Tongan line. They swing it on the last tackle - it\u2019s frenetic stuff, they go left, they go right. Latrell Mitchell almost gets caught, but he recycles. And suddenly, Australia have numbers right - it\u2019s catch and pass stuff surely - but Tedesco misses his winger! It\u2019s a ropey old pass, and with a match-levelling try begging, it\u2019s ball into touch - and they\u2019re home, Tonga! What a result - what an upset - what a night in Tongan rugby league! Rugby league - Oceania Cup, 78\u2019: Ooh! Australia get within five metres of the try line, and they\u2019ve butchered it! Ball to ground, and it\u2019s Tonga\u2019s to hold on. I have to say, the sound from this crowd is unbelievable. We\u2019re in Auckland, and it\u2019s fair to suppose there\u2019s a strong Tongan contingent in. They\u2019ve burst into a spontaneous hymn - and it\u2019s like a choir of angels. You don\u2019t associate that with rugby league every day, but there you go. Gorgeous stuff. Rugby league - Oceania Cup, 74\u2019: Tonga have earned a penalty, and they\u2019ll take their time lining up a shot at the sticks (even though the clock is off). Kotoni Staggs with a chance to put the World Number 4 ranked team ahead by six. But he\u2019s hooked it right! It remains 16-12. A note of the world rankings: it should read 1. Australia, 2. New Zealand, 3. England 4. Daylight - such is the gulf in world rugby, in resources, in history, in playing personnel. But could this be the night that marks the rise of nations like Tonga and Samoa? But forget all that - we\u2019ve got a possible boilover happening in the Oceania Cup clash between Australia and Tonga, where we\u2019ve just under 10 minutes to play - and the tiny Pasifika nation have just got their noses in front 16-12. Have they ever beaten the Kangaroos, Tonga? I don\u2019t believe so. This could be history in the making. Before then, a quick round the grounds. Two fixtures just underway in the WBBL, where it\u2019s the Stars batting first against the Scorchers. Elyse Villani and the South African power-hitter Lizelle Lee are 0-32 off six overs, so a steady start, although that said Lee\u2019s just cleared the rope with a thumping stroke, so could be warming up nicely. In Mackay it\u2019s the Heat hosting the strikers, and we\u2019re only one over in there with no loss - the home side batting first. We are about to head to a bumper clash in the A-League - a first ever Melbourne derby between new club Western United and the competition\u2019s historic benchmark club, Melbourne Victory, which for added spice also features the league return of former Victory star Besart Berisha for the new kids. Tasty business. It\u2019s finished nil-all in Parramatta as the high-flying Wanderers pass up the opportunity to go four straight wins to open the season. In truth it was a cagey old game - maybe the heat a factor, especially early on, as both sides failed to really grasp the nettle, put the pedal to the metal, play in fine fettle (and other such malapropisms/general language murderings). Despite their stunning derby win last weekend, they\u2019re still somewhat of a surprise table leader, the Wanderers who haven\u2019t quite clicked. Very little offered in attack, but new signings Dylan McGowan and Matt Jurman combining very well in front of new signing Daniel Lopar in goal, at the back to keep them resolute. A better showing from Robbie Fowler\u2019s Brisbane - they\u2019ll take the point, but will still be itching for their first regular season win. Hello! Terevist! M\u0101l\u014d e lelei! To you and yours wherever you\u2019re following our coverage today. Plenty still cracking on (and that\u2019s before we even mention that minor matter of the Rugby World Cup final), so we\u2019ll jump right into that. As always - we\u2019d love to hear your take on things, don\u2019t hesitate to fire us an email or tweet to join the conversation. Not sure what to write? Try high-grade comedy like this: Yes, it\u2019s never too niche for Sportswatch, where we are here solely to help boost your social media metrics. Well, that\u2019s me done for tonight, but I will leave you with the ever-reliable Richard Parkin who will take you through to the end of the evening. There are two more WBBL games about to begin, with the Scorchers coming up against the Stars at the Waca and the Heat battling it out with the Strikers, which should be a cracker of a game. The start of a Victorian derby between Melbourne Victory and Western United in the A-League isn\u2019t too far away either. See you next time! Rugby league: Only six minutes after the half-time break and Tonga have hit back, scoring in the corner to get within two points, but the conversion proved too much and Australia remain in the lead 12-10. Rugby World Cup: The countdown is on to the start of the final - will it be the hot-and-cold Springboks who triumph or the clinical (and possibly slightly evil) England who come out on top? Only time will tell. Lee Calvert is going through all the permutations right now, so please duck over and check those out, but then come back here because we\u2019ve got lots more to discuss here too. A-League: Checking back in on the game at Bankwest now and still no one has been able to break the deadlock, the score remains 0-0. Both keepers have been good this evening, impenetrable walls at either end of the field. It\u2019s an intriguing clash for 2v9 and we\u2019ll keep an eye on how it progresses. Rugby league: Australia 12-6 Tonga at half-time Six minutes after Tonga crossed the line, Australia replied through Jack Wighton, with Paul Vaughan following soon after in the 30th minute. Latrell Mitchell had no trouble with the conversions and the Kangaroos are looking comfortable so far. While Australia have only had 45% of the possession, their stronger conversion rate (88% to Tonga\u2019s 65%) is setting them up well for a strong second half. Not a game for the history books, but a solid win from the Sixers to give them their second victory on the trot and get them back towards their goal of taking out this year\u2019s competition. They made it look harder than it needed to, failing to accelerate enough to lock the game up before the final over, but they got the total in the end, winning by four wickets with one ball to spare. Disappointing for the Renegades, who looked capable of taking more wickets, but appeared to be playing to limit the total rather than a riskier attacking strategy. Maitlan Brown looked the most dangerous with the ball, finishing with 2-18 from her four overs. Dane van Niekerk was awarded player of the match for her 30 from 27 with the bat and 2-15 with the ball. \u201cIt was a tight chase, that 120 mark just got us a little there,\u201d she said after the match. \u201cI enjoyed my bowling, but it was just good to contribute with the bat after being off for a while. It was nice to hit the ball cleanly.\u201d Rugby league: Heading back over to Auckland and it\u2019s Tonga who have drawn first blood against the Kangaroos in the final match of the triple header. Will Hopoate was the try scorer, with Kotoni Staggs nailing the conversion to take the Invitational side to a 6-0 lead with 16 minutes remaining in the first half against their more fancied opponents. WBBL: Perry is still taking it fairly easy, but the lack of pace is going OK for her as she holds down an end while van Niekerk accelerates. It\u2019s an unfamiliar role for the skipper, who is usually the star of the show, but she\u2019s performing it admirably, demonstrating her capability to adjust to the circumstances of a game as needed. The Sixers 87-3 after 15 overs and need 34 runs from 30 balls for victory. The Renegades have done a good job keeping the run rate from exploding, but need to focus on taking wickets now if they want this win. A-League: Wanderers 0-0 Roar at half-time Still all locked up at Bankwest Stadium, with neither team able to score in the first half. This interesting stat might be a good omen for Brisbane in the second half however? Rugby union: This article from Bret Harris struck a chord with readers this week as he reflected on the changes that need to happen at the top to ensure progress and success for the future in rugby. Australian rugby will never achieve sustainable, long-term success until it fixes the key problem that is holding the game back in this country \u2013 the dysfunctional relationship between RA and the Super Rugby franchises. It is a relationship that has been characterised by mistrust and acrimony. The early success of Australian rugby following the advent of the professional era in the mid-1990s camouflaged the divisions within the game. In one brief, shining era the Wallabies held the Bledisloe Cup for five years in a row, won the 1999 World Cup and defeated the British &amp; Irish Lions in 2001, while the Brumbies lifted the Super Rugby title in 2001 and 2004. All of this was accomplished despite a lack of unity of purpose between RA and the Super Rugby franchises. Football: A big win for the Joeys, Australia\u2019s 17 and Under men\u2019s football side, who have progressed to the knockout stages of the World Cup. From AAP: Australia\u2019s under-17 men\u2019s football team have progressed to the knockout phase of World Cup after securing a 2-1 victory over Group B winners Nigeria at the Estadio Bezerrao in Brasilia. A brace from TSG 1899 Hoffenheim attacker Noah Botic - the former National Premier League striker\u2019s third and fourth goals of the tournament - ensured Australia defeated the five-time 17 and Under World Cup winning nation to seal progression as one of the competition\u2019s four best third-placed sides. Nigeria are regular powerhouses at youth international level, and the victory for Trevor Morgan\u2019s side marked Australia\u2019s first win over the African nation at the 17 and Under World Cup in seven attempts. Australia will now face either the winner of Group C (France, Chile or Korea Republic) or Group D (Senegal or Japan) in the last 16 of the tournament next week. \u201cWe came here to win games and, although Nigeria were fantastic, we got the result,\u201d Morgan said post-match. \u201cIt\u2019s a plus for the boys, for their commitment and belief to come here and play a top team and win. We played an excellent team with great quality and great physical capacity (but) the boys were able to keep concentrating, keep working, and in the end the result was fantastic for us.\u201d WBBL: The game is still in the balance after 10 overs with the Sixers at 59-3 and needing a run a ball to win, but the Renegades looking capable of taking regular wickets. While Perry remains at the crease, the Sixers will always be dangerous, but the Renegades have not allowed her to dominate the game as yet - she is currently 19 from 29 balls. Carly Leeson picked up her first wicket for her new club against her old club, tempting Erin Burns with a full toss that was caught on the boundary by Molly Strano. Leeson comes into the match day squad after picking up 4/4 in the Sydney Women\u2019s Premier Cricket league last weekend and will take confidence from her first wicket in red. Dane van Niekerk meanwhile was in no mood to muck around, smashing her first ball for four and nearly repeating the effort with the second ball. A-League: Checking in on the A-League now and it\u2019s 0-0 between the Western Sydney Wanderers and Brisbane Roar after 20 minutes. The Wanderers have lost Pirmin Schwegler to an injury, replaced on the field by Tass Mourdoukoutas. WBBL: It hasn\u2019t been the ideal start to the innings from the Sixers, who lost both Alyssa Healy and Ash Gardner early. But as the old adage about the Sixers WBBL team goes, \u201cAshes to ashes, dust to dust, if Healy don\u2019t get you, Perry must.\u201d The Sixers\u2019 captain is still in the middle, though hampered by a slow scoring rate at the moment with only 13 from 23 balls. However Perry knows how to accelerate and will be looking to put her pedal to the metal once the partnership with Erin Burns is established. Pink Sydney are 28-2 after six overs. England managed to cross that elusive tryline in the end, Daryl Clark managing the feat, but it wasn\u2019t enough. Desperate New Zealand defence held the Brits out and kept them scoreless for the final 12 minutes to take the match. Despite having 53% possession, more run metres and a far superior completion rate, Great Britain couldn\u2019t put the points on the board and it was the Kiwis who emerged victorious. Cricket: Catches win matches, as any Under 10s player worth their salt can tell you and this is one hell of a catch from India\u2019s Harmanpreet Kaur to dismiss West Indies captain Stafanie Taylor. Just... how? Sensational. Rugby World Cup: Some interesting thoughts here from Justin McCurry on whether Japan\u2019s newfound love of rugby will be the RWC\u2019s enduring legacy or if it was just a flash in the pan. \u201cJapanese rugby was built on a narrow base made up mainly of university and company teams,\u201d says Yuichi Kurosaki, the founder of the Minato Rugby School in Tokyo. \u201cBut Japan\u2019s performance at this World Cup could change that. We have kids coming to training for the first time saying they want to emulate the Japanese team\u2019s players.\u201d WBBL: Melbourne Renegades 120-8 after 20 overs It was a decent finish to the innings for Red Melbourne after Ash Gardner took two wickets in two balls to see off Josie Dooley and Maitlan Brown. Former Sixer Carly Leeson put up a good fight alongside Jess Duffin for a little while, scoring seven from five balls before pushing for a run that wasn\u2019t there and being run out by her Universities teammate Maddy Darke. A good spread of wickets for the Sixers, with van Niekerk, Kapp and Gardner each taking two, with two run outs to boot. With the Renegades pushing their run rate up to 6 an over in the end they\u2019ve come up with a defendable total, but there is a lot of strike power in that Pink Sydney batting line and they will be feeling pretty confident about running this total down. Netball: The season is finally over for the Diamonds who have been at it since January, with the Quad Series leading into the Super Netball, the break for the World Cup, back to the Super Netball and finishing with the Constellation Cup. It\u2019s been a gruelling year for many of them, but what have we learnt from it? Erin Delahunty with the questions on everyone\u2019s mind in this article from earlier in the week. Rugby league: Back to the second game of the triple header in Auckland and New Zealand have managed to find the try line! It was Jamayne Isaako who did it, rugby league\u2019s answer to Sir Edmund Hillary. Since he was the one who\u2019d kicked their penalty goal earlier, everyone assumed he\u2019d be best placed to figure out where the scoring happened and by gum they were right. Emboldened by this approach, the Kiwis managed to score again, this time through Corey Harawira-Naera, up 12-2 in the 57th minute. WBBL: The pairing of Beaumont and Webb did get a bit of a wriggle on for a while there (I can only assume someone passed on my message to them) before Webb did take my suggestion and got herself run out for 25. Then Dane van Nierkerk, not wanting to be shown up by her wife, stepped in to take two wickets from the next two balls to leave the Renegades languishing at 71-5 after 15 overs. They\u2019ve increased the run rate to 4.95 but it\u2019s going to be tough to defend unless they have a huge finish to their innings. A-League: We\u2019ve got some A-League coming up later on and just the person to talk you through it jumping into Sportwatch. Our resident football guru Richard Parkin knows more about the A-League than you can poke a stick at and here he was proving it this week with a great article about Australia\u2019s search for world class players. \u201cAcross the nation, post-second world war migrants from Italy, Greece and Croatia banded together to form football clubs, not just for leisure, but for community, identity and a retreat from alienation \u2013 a sense of purpose that came to mean everything. Clubs like Sydney Croatia, South Melbourne Hellas or Marconi became a well-spring not just for talent from within their communities but many from without \u2013 attracted to the game through the culture and passion surrounding it.\u201d Rugby league: And a quick wrap of the Fiji v Samoa game from AAP as well. Fiji upset star-studded Samoa at Eden Park Viliame Kikau has demonstrated why he\u2019s rated one of rugby league\u2019s most destructive running forwards by spearheading Fiji to a 44-18 upset of Samoa. Despite facing a more fancied Samoa side full of NRL experience, Kikau showed them up with a performance that will have Penrith fans salivating. The Panthers star bagged two tries and set up a third for a 24-point halftime lead that Samoa wouldn\u2019t get close to challenging on Saturday. Fiji coach Brandon Costin hailed Kikau\u2019s humility during camp. \u201cHe\u2019s an out-and-out athlete. He\u2019s one of the best NRL players in the game but when he goes into that camp, he\u2019s a locally born and bred Fijian,\u201d Costin said. \u201cThe whole environment within our camp just drops down and there\u2019s a massive sense of humility across these boys that are playing at the top of their game. They don\u2019t have to be so humble. It\u2019s just in their upbringing, they come from a Fijian village and it\u2019s just amazing to be around these humans.\u201d The victory leaves the Bati in the box seat to top group B of the Oceania Cup and earn promotion into group A next year to face New Zealand and Great Britain. Kikau was well-supported by hooker Joe Lovodua, who scored the opening try and assisted on two others. Samoa entered the contest overwhelming favourites on the back of a line-up boasting stars Martin Taupau, Junior Paulo and Joseph Leilua. In contrast, Fiji only had seven players of NRL experience and were missing the likes of Apisai Koroisau, Maika Sivo and Jayson Bukuya. However Samoa were left stunned by a four-try point-a-minute opening ambush orchestrated by Kikau and halfback Brandon Wakeham. They momentarily stemmed the tide with a Tim Lafai try in the 27th minute but Kikau ended any thought of a comeback with a solo effort on halftime. Samoa did get the first of the second half through Taufua but it was all Fiji from there with tries to Isaac Lumelume, Brayden Wiliame and Kevin Naiqama. Taufua and Ronaldo Mulitalo claimed late consolation four-pointers. The lopsided defeat is certain to pile pressure on Samoa coach Matt Parish, whose side now rely on Papua New Guinea heavily upsetting Fiji to top the pool. Samoa has won just one of their past nine games under Parish, who was disappointed in his team\u2019s lack of resiliency. \u201c(Fiji) played with a lot of energy on the back of our mistakes and we had no answers,\u201d Parish said. \u201cI thought we should\u2019ve been a bit more resilient at times, but that\u2019s football.\u201d Fiji also trounced Lebanon 58-14 in an exhibition match earlier this year. Rugby league: Some news out of Auckland, with Kiwi Kieran Foran injured in the first half of the game. From AAP: Kieran Foran has suffered a suspected shoulder injury early in New Zealand\u2019s rugby league Test against Great Britain in Auckland. Foran came reeling out of an attempted tackle on James Graham in the sixth minute on Saturday before heading immediately up the tunnel at Eden Park. The Canterbury star was making his first appearance for the Kiwis in two years after a horror run with injuries. Earlier on Saturday, hooker Brandon Smith was stood down just hours before their contest against the Lions for breaking team protocol. Kiwis officials confirmed Kodi Nikorima would start at hooker. The decision came after coach Michael Maguire dropped star halfback Shaun Johnson following last week\u2019s loss to Australia. WBBL: No further wickets for the Sixers, but they\u2019re keeping it very tight, the Renegades only managing 32-2 at a run rate of 3.2 from the first 10 overs. Tammy Beaumont (14 off 31) and Courtney Webb (4 off 15) are at the crease and quite frankly they should probably try to run each other out, because wickets in hand will mean nothing if they don\u2019t pick up this run rate. They\u2019re both being cramped by the bowling attack and can\u2019t penetrate the field - time to give someone else a shot. Young Stella Campbell has been a highlight of the Sixers\u2019 attack, conceding just one run from her first over and getting some good pace. She has been dominating for Universities in Sydney Women\u2019s Premier Cricket over the past few weeks, so good to see her get a shot here. Rugby league: It\u2019s been a hell of a grind over in Auckland the scores locked at 2-2, with both New Zealand and Great Britain unable to find the try line after the first half. I mean that in the most literal sense, everyone knows rugby league players have the most terrible sense of direction. It\u2019s why we see so many trainers on the field in the NRL, they\u2019re constantly having to round players up, sheep dog style, to get them to find the try line. This is what a game would look like without trainers on the park. Cricket: While we\u2019re on the subject (and let me be clear, now that netball season is over I\u2019m always on the subject of cricket) this was a wonderful read from Sam Perry during the week. Perhaps better known as one-third of The Grade Cricketer twitter account, Perry swaps champing and lamenting about terrible blokes for fascinating analysis in this piece. This paragraph struck me as being applicable to the wider Australian sporting landscape and particularly pertinent to the other big Commonwealth sports - netball and rugby. \u201cAustralia\u2019s fortunes have often suffered at the hands of its own rigid cricketing ideology. We are self-appointed custodians of technique, and how a player is meant to \u201clook\u201d. It means the clever player can be overlooked for the thoroughbred, and there\u2019s an uneasy relationship with the sort of lateral thinking T20 strategy demands. \u201cJust go out and whack \u2018em,\u201d was how we used to do it, pre-Langer.\u201d WBBL: Because too much cricket is never enough, let\u2019s get back to the WBBL where the Sixers have had a fantastic start to the match, keeping the Renegades to 15-2 from their first five overs. Marizanne Kapp has both wickets with figures of 2-9 from her first two overs - down the other end Ellyse Perry has looked a little shaky, with some uncharacteristic wides and no balls, but she is still bowling fairly tightly, only letting six runs through. Sheffield Shield: Victoria have struck early after setting a low total for Tasmania on day three in Hobart. Peter Siddle and Chris Tremain removed both openers cheaply, Beau Webster gone for a duck and Alex Doolan for 16. Tasmania require 107 to win with Matthew Wade and Charlie Wakim to resume after tea. It\u2019s day two in the match between South Australia and NSW at Adelaide Oval. NSW were all out for 289 in their first innings, with debutant Daniel Solway the story of day one, finishing with 133 not out after coming in at number three. In reply, SA are 68-3 with Trent Copeland (best known for being netballer Kim Green\u2019s husband) getting the two openers. Meanwhile up at the Gabba, it\u2019s day one in the match between Queensland and Western Australia. After both Cameron Bancroft and Sam Whiteman were dismissed for ducks, Shaun Marsh and Marcus Stonis have dug in with a big partnership and the wild westerners are 111-2. Rugby league: It was a big win for Fiji over Samoa in the first game of the triple header over in Auckland, taking out the game 44-18. Fiji had six try-scorers for their eight tries, with only Viliame Kikau crossing for a double. The match between New Zealand and England has just got underway, the Kiwis up 2-0 after 10 minutes of play. WBBL: Well, we should have had a game up and running already, but the Hobart weather had other ideas. The match between the Hurricanes and Thunder (I mean, when you think about it, that combination is just asking to be rained out) has been abandoned without a ball bowled. Disappointing for both teams, who are currently sitting in first (Thunder) and third (Hurricanes) spots on the ladder and would have loved to push for a win and continued their early momentum. Play is about to get underway at the WACA, with the Renegades looking to bounce back from their rainsoaked disappointment against the Scorchers last night. They take on the Sixers, who won\u2019t be happy about their current ladder position of sixth, so the game should be a cracker. The Sixers have opted to bowl first in that game, but Ellyse Perry is very sensibly staying well clear of the bat flip after she was nearly donked on the head by one a couple of weeks ago. Good afternoon Sportwatchers and welcome to another huge day of sport. Of course we have the Rugby World Cup final tonight - we\u2019ve got you covered for that with a liveblog of the game from Lee Calvert. Will the Springboks get over the line, or will it be England lifting the Webb Ellis Cup? Actually, we have exclusive live pictures available from the England team\u2019s preparations for you right now: Elsewhere we have some WBBL for you, as well as the rugby league international triple header in Auckland, round 4 of the A-League and a bit of Sheffield Shield. Plenty to get through, so let\u2019s get started."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
