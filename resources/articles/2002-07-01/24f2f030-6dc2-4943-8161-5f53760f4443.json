For the fashionable holidaymaker this summer there is only one place to spend the night: in the bed of a star. The celebrity might not be between the sheets at the time but at least you can wake up, make coffee with their cafetieres and inspect your sunburn in their mirrors. Mick Jagger and Jane Seymour are two of the scores of stars who are cashing in by hiring out their homes for holidays. Jagger's oceanfront villa on the Caribbean island of Mustique - complete with six bedrooms, a huge koi pond, pavilions connected by walkways, private Jeep and staff of six - is available for hire at a mere \u00a31,200 for the night. For those unwilling to travel so far, actress Seymour's 11-bedroom manor house near Bath, is available for \u00a315,000 for a week. Ninth century St. Catherine's Court is surrounded by 14 acres of gardens and has its own tennis court, orangery, croquet lawn, Victorian plunge pool and medieval church. Seymour, 51, said she and her family stayed there twice a year, and her photographs and paintings are found everywhere. 'It's a home,' she said. 'It's not a hotel and will never be a hotel.' Jagger is particular about who stays at his villa and personally reviews every application. 'He's a little picky,' said Alfredo Merat of Overseas Connection, the agency letting his Mustique villa. Fellow rock stars almost never make the grade, Merat said, for fear they will 'trash the place'."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
