He confesses to having eaten more than 2,000 since discovering them in the Eighties as a teenager when he was 'fed up with his mum's lamb chops and potatoes' and went looking for something a little more exciting. A civil servant from Monday to Friday, Andy becomes a 'baltiologist' at weekends when he takes visitors on tours of Birmingham's Balti triangle. There are 40 balti houses in and around Ladypool Road in the city's Sparkbrook district, each with an army of loyal patrons. You can spot the real hardcore enthusiasts, explains Tan Choudhry, a fellow balti connoisseur who also accompanies the groups, because they often have burn marks on their wrists from the sizzling dishes that have caught them as they eagerly go for the first naan dip. The cuisine's popularity is evident at Imran's balti house which is full of families waving about ripped-up naan and casually multi-dipping in steaming stainless steel bowls. 'That's the beauty of the balti,' says Andy. 'It's a laid-back experience. You just dip and eat. And because most proper balti houses are Muslim, they don't have a licence to serve alcohol. This has two benefits - it means that, for a family eating out, it saves money as they can bring their own wine and it also it keeps out the drunken post-pub crowd, who will only go somewhere that sells beer.' It's not the ingredients that make balti different from a curry (recipes for baltis and curries depend on where the chef's family originated from), but the style of cooking. A balti is prepared in as little as 10 minutes and served immediately in the dish it was cooked in to hold on to the flavour, with a naan instead of rice. It's also usually cooked in vegetable oil not ghee, so is healthier. Curries, on the other hand, may well be cooked at the start of the evening and left to simmer. But there's more to the balti tour than a chat in a restaurant over sweet rasmalai and coffee. You get a demonstration in the art of the speedily cooked balti and peshwari naan (which, of course, you get to eat) then Andy and Tan sweep outside into the packed Ladypool Road to conduct a tour of the Asian shops that exclusively line the road. We get chatting to a shopkeeper about the balti craze and Andy reveals that at a food show in London a few years ago, a very well known Indian chef, whose name he begs me not to reveal, had told him the balti had no history or tradition like the curry. A year later, Andy saw the chef's balti set on sale. 'The balti has developed for the Western taste, just like any other international cuisine,' he adds. 'The fact that it's not the same food that is eaten in the northern foothills of Pakistan does not matter. When people are sniffy about it because it's not authentic, I say well, what is? As long as people enjoy it, it doesn't matter.' Essentials Balti breaks cost \u00a340 per person for the day package and from \u00a369 including overnight accommodation at Jury's Inn Birmingham.
