According to Strong, the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries were the golden age of the parish church. After that the story is one of desecration and decline, yet Strong resists the idea of the modern country church becoming a mere museum of lost faith. He also powerfully conveys the trauma of the Reformation for ordinary parishioners, as everything they held sacred was swept away and destroyed. Surprisingly, in the days when churches still served entire communities, the atmosphere could be extremely boisterous. It was permissible to knit during Mass or to heckle the preacher. In 1598, for instance, a Cambridgeshire man was charged with indecent behaviour in church for his \"scoffing speeches\", as well as his \"most loathsome farting\", giving a whole new meaning to Nietzsche's dictum that \"One should not go to church if one wants to breathe pure air.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
