He took the frame of an 18th-century opera house in the middle of the old part of Lyon, and because he couldn't expand the building outwards, he dug down to provide space for all the technical needs of the theatre, and built upwards to house the rehearsal rooms, topping the building off with with a beautiful dome. The rehearsal rooms are terrific; the dance studio is perhaps the most beautiful rehearsal room in the world. In fact, the auditorium is perhaps my least favourite part of the building - it is rather black, though it does come alive when there is an audience in place. But the entrances from the street are miraculous, with wonderful red-leather doors. You feel a real sense of occasion as you reach your seat. The whole structure sits in marvellous harmony with the buildings around it; it is a highly theatrical building and serves its purpose brilliantly. I have to choose the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford as my blunder. It isn't exactly my least favourite building, but it is certainly a piece of architecture that doesn't serve its purpose. It doesn't juxtapose successfully with the town, or with the Victorian gothic of the Swan theatre next door. And because it has been found not to serve its purpose, it has been added to; it doesn't look anything like the original theatre designed by Elisabeth Scott. So as you look at it from the front, there's a huge glass foyer stuck on it because the original entrance was too small, and as you look at it from the river it is covered with layers and layers of newer restaurants and bars. Essentially, the RST is a long, faceless brick building with one or two beautiful art deco features. \u00b7 Adrian Noble is artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
