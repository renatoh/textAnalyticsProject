The head of the family history website Ancestry.co.uk has a framed copy of a 100-year-old slip that marks his maternal great-grandfather's arrival in the United States. \"Would I be here today if he hadn't made that journey?\" asks the 34-year-old. His 18-year-old ancestor's arrival at Ellis Island allowed him to avoid the travails of the looming world war that was to engulf Europe and gave his progeny access to the American Dream. Hanna is head of a website that attracted more visitors in February than retailers such as John Lewis and even Apple's iTunes, according to the research group ComScore. In February some 2.4 million visitors clicked on to Ancestry.co.uk to search births, marriages and deaths as well as censuses going back to 1841. The number was an astonishing 1,100% more than visited the site in January 2005, when the American-born Hanna came to run the British outpost of the US subscription site MyFamily.com and launched a new marketing drive. Hanna's own journey is one that combines our age-old fascination with family history with the more recent one with how the internet is changing our lives. Sporting the goatee beard and fast-talking enthusiasm for the web that has been rare since the dotcom boom, the lanky American says: \"Family histories are now for everyone. It's not just a pursuit for dusty academics. When I first started poring over microfiches in public libraries - just me and a bunch of grans - people would literally shout out 'I found him' when they discovered a name. It's just not that hard any more, although it is as exciting.\" TV fuels success Genealogy has become one of the fastest-growing categories on the web, helped by the huge success of the BBC TV series Who Do You Think You Are? and the increasing availability online of historical documents. Commercial websites such as GenesReunited and 1837online.com let you create family trees and then contact distant relatives to piece together the historic jigsaw. A not-entirely uncontroversial deal with the Public Records Office four years ago means that Ancestry is the only site to have fully digitised all British censuses from 1841 to 1901. It has publicised this fact with some titbits of celebrity research such as the blood ties between George Bush, Winston Churchill and Prince William, as well as the dissenting roots of London's mayor, Ken Livingstone. The days after this Easter weekend are set to be Ancestry.co.uk's second busiest time of the year, after Christmas. \"Why?\" yelps Hanna. \"Because families get together and inevitably start telling stories about granny and someone gets the bug to go explore further.\" A self-confessed \"geeky kid who listened to family stories\", Hanna was just nine when his father died, leaving seven children. Hanna sees his father as his greatest inspiration: a high-school dropout brought up on the mean streets of Pittsburgh who made his living as an artist before dying at 39. While at Dartmouth College, Hanna wrote his thesis on his small New England village; \"a sort of family history for 500 people\". By 2000, at the height of the dotcom boom, the geeky kid had a fresh-minted MBA from Harvard and a new job in marketing at Netcentives, a web loyalty scheme based in Silicon Valley. \"Like almost everyone in my class I went to San Francisco to make millions,\" he says. \"It didn't exactly happen. The market crashed almost immediately.\" As Netcentives was collapsing (it did so in 2001), Hanna found himself one of thousands of over-educated and under-employed wannabes in Silicon Valley with time rather than money on his hands. He began using the internet to research his family tree and found out about his mother's grandfather's arrival at Ellis Island in 1906 with $10 in his pocket. This led him to beg a job at a genealogy website and it is this document, and a picture of the boat on which his east European great-grandfather arrived, that sits in his office. Hanna \"got the bug\" and began going to libraries and poring over miles of microfilm to trace relatives. \"I trained my eyes to blink at the end of each page,\" he says. By this time, 9/11 had sent the US economy into a nosedive and a nation into shock. Along with \"lots of smart people at the time\", Hanna thought about joining the FBI or CIA, before he realised that entry-level government wages would not pay off his expensive student loans. So he started temping at Genealogy.com, which sold software to build family trees, raising eyebrows among college friends. \"I let my ego go and just went and worked.\" He was running the site's subscription business by the time it was bought by the rival MyFamily.com in 2003. The new job meant moving to the head office in Provo, Utah, a state dominated by the Mormons and thus a hive of genealogists. A religious focus on family history means that Mormon volunteers have led the drive to index historical documents, not only in the US but elsewhere. It took them 17 years to put Britain's 1881 census online, for example. Its website, www.familysearch.org, claims to have the largest collection of free family history records in the world. Hanna is more forthcoming about his family history (including his lying drunk of a grandfather and a Confederate-supporting ancestor) than he is about his privately owned parent company. Formed in the mid-1980s as a specialist book publisher, MyFamily's own parentage is pretty opaque. There are \"five to 10\" backers, including @ventures, the investing arm of the internet backer CMGI. Such ownership usually suggests a sale or flotation. Hanna only says: \"We have turned down many, many offers.\" MyFamily is \"not affiliated to the church [of Latter-Day Saints] but many employees are members of it\". These include the group chief executive, Tim Sullivan, who has an astonishing 60,000 names in his family tree. The non-Mormon Hanna has just a thousand. One fact is clear: the group's decision to push online subscriptions in 1997 - two years ahead of its nearest rival, Genealogy.com - gave Ancestry a head start among US commercial groups. Last year, the group, which also includes the software firm Family Tree Maker, made $140m (about \u00a380m) in revenues from 800,000 paying subscribers. Subscription v advertising In Britain, the corresponding figure is north of \u00a310m, with 150,000 subscribers paying from \u00a35 for a few pages to \u00a370 for annual membership. Hanna admits he is still \"not happy with the conversion\" - the ratio of subscribers to the millions of people looking at the site each month. Ancestry's subscription-based model contrasts with that of many other largely advertising-driven sites. Its rivals most often accuse it of being \"very corporate and very American\". Such complaints point to the sense that the Brits competing in this space want to keep subscriptions down to \"the cost of a trip to Kew\" in west London, where the national archives are kept, whereas the Americans are charging a fortune for documents that are essentially ours. The boom in websites with licensing agreements has obscured the number of free sites out there. And after all, shouldn't facts be free? The Harvard MBA seems non-plussed by this. He thinks the government is doing what any \"forward-looking\" organisation should do by outsourcing something people want. \"Having all that stuff sitting in archives, inaccessible, is unacceptable,\" he says. \"It's a matter of priorities and resources.\" He argues that money from Ancestry's licensing deal with the Public Records Office can be used to open other archives. Hanna is leading an expansion into continental Europe, something likely to be far tougher owing to the political negotiations that are needed. Since his arrival, Ancestry has spent a huge amount on marketing and rivals call its tactics overly aggressive. He admits the website made mistakes but in customer service rather than sales. Its customer service would demand a transatlantic phone call with opening hours that left British subscribers up all night. \"We were criticised and rightly so,\" says Hanna, who came with his baby girl and wife to sort out the problems. He changed calling times and allowed payments by debit as well as credit cards. \"This is not an excuse for getting things wrong but it's a difficult process. No one has done more to digitise and index family records. Period. Or full stop, as you say here.\" The group also plans a new customer service unit, maybe in Britain. Although, as he says: \"People [in Britain] accept such calls being made to Bangladesh.\" Hanna is most conscious of his status as a foreigner. \"It would be better if I were British. I get by because people see that I'm passionate about this stuff.\" His enthusiasm seems genuine. After two hours, I know far more about his family history than about my own. He says: \"I can't believe it when people say, 'There's nothing interesting in my story.' Are you kidding me? That's like saying you are not interesting.\" He seems genuinely hurt that his history teacher brother is the one least likely to get excited by his revelations. On the way out, we pass a picture of his wife, Halicue, and daughter. \"It's my wife we really should have talked about. She is an African-American who has Choctaw blood.\" Hanna on Hanna What lessons did you learn from the dotcom collapse? To question the business you work for and make sure there's a real business there. What's your favourite website (excluding Ancestry)? Google. I am very practical and just want to be able to find things quickly. Who are the heroes and villains from your own family tree? My maternal grandfather was a hero. He lived until he was 98 and first told me about my history. For villains, I had a Confederate ancestor in the US civil war and my paternal grandfather was an alcoholic who made up his own history. Who or what do you most admire? My father, one of 16 children from the mean streets of Pittsburgh. He became a successful artist and supported seven children of his own until his early death."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
