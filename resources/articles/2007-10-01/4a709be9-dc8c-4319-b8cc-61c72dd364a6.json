Reality Estate, which is to be performed on October 28, is a 30-minute promenade performance around Five Ways housing estate, featuring local residents, choirs and artists. One choir will perform a score by Dutch composer Merlijn Twaalfhoven, inspired by the residents' hopes and aspirations. And images of a \"virtual\" choir, made from video recordings of rehearsals, will be projected on to disused shop windows. According to Mark Storer, the project's artistic director: \"It is a hyperreal fairytale journey with strange sights - an extraordinary experience that celebrates the lives and stories of those who live there.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
