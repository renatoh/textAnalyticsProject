The young defender's move from Manchester United as part of the deal that took Tomasz Kuszczak to Old Trafford was Bryan Robson's last piece of transfer business as Albion manager before he was dismissed last Monday. He now has to hope that Robson's replacement, whoever that may be, values his talents as highly. \"It has been a strange week,\" he said. \"It's always a bit strange when a manager goes. It's the first time that it has happened to me so it was a new experience. It was a surprise but football is a strange sport and there are a lot of surprises in it but you've just got to get on with it and just keep playing, keep concentrating all the time. Whatever manager comes in, hopefully I'll impress him and stay in the side.\" If the West Brom board were expecting the dismissal of Robson to pay instant on-pitch dividends they would have been disappointed. Albion were fortunate to escape with a point, despite Ronnie Wallwork's disallowed injury-time would-be winner, after another largely soporific performance. The impression is that the side simply have not adjusted to life in the Championship. Too often midfielders hoped for time on the ball where none was on offer and possession was regularly lost to snapping Luton tackles. \"It's a strange league this Championship, anyone can beat anyone, and you have to get used to it,\" said McShane, who should be better prepared than most having spent much of last season on loan at Brighton from United. \"Hopefully we'll just get on with things and get the results going again.\" Luton were left frustrated. Rowan Vine scored two, taking his season's tally to six, but might have had a couple more from a terrific first-half performance and hit the bar at the beginning of the second. Albion, given no peace by the home side, clung on grimly with their irritation visibly growing. Darren Carter pinged home their first from the edge of the area to keep the Baggies in touching distance at half-time, and Zoltan Gera - who cut a detached figure for much of the game - pounced on Paul Robinson's low cross for the equaliser that their second-half improvement probably deserved. \"It is a bit of mystery why we're not performing or why we're not putting 90 minutes together,\" said Nigel Pearson, Albion's caretaker manager, whose hopes for the full-time position were done no harm by the result. \"But to be fair to the players they did play much better [in the second half]. So our away run continues in terms of not winning three points in league games. But it will change.\" Man of the match Rowan Vine (Luton)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
