The Rev William Aitcheson told Philip and Barbara Butler he was \u201cblinded by hate and ignorance\u201d when he targeted them in 1977 at their home in College Park, Maryland. In a letter dated 8 September, Aitcheson wrote he rejected such beliefs before he joined the priesthood but was too ashamed to face the Butlers. \u201cI believe now that all people can live together in peace regardless of race,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI also know that the symbol of the most enduring love the world has even known must never be used as a weapon of terror. Its use against you was a despicable act. I seriously regret the suffering it caused you.\u201d The Washington Post reported that Philip Butler said in a news conference on Friday that he wants to forgive Aitcheson but is not ready, saying: \u201cI can\u2019t do it yet.\u201d Aitcheson was sentenced in 1977 to 90 days in jail. In 1982, at the conclusion of a civil suit, Ronald Reagan visited the Butlers at their home. Aitcheson was ordained in 1988. In August this year he wrote an essay for the Catholic Herald, in which he said violence around a neo-Nazi march in Charlottesville, Virginia, in which a counter-protester was killed, had prompted him to speak publicly about his past. \u201cWhile 40 years have passed,\u201d he wrote, \u201cI must say this: I\u2019m sorry. To anyone who has been subjected to racism or bigotry, I am sorry. I have no excuse, but I hope you will forgive me. \u201cThe images from Charlottesville brought back memories of a bleak period in my life that I would have preferred to forget.\u201d The Butlers and their attorney, Ted Williams, spoke on Friday about Aitcheson\u2019s letter and the recent payment to the Butlers of $23,000 from the overdue civil suit judgment along with $9,600 in attorney fees. The Catholic Archdiocese of Arlington said in a statement that though Aitcheson had \u201cno legal obligation to make restitution and no obligation under church law either\u201d, he had \u201cfelt a moral obligation to pay as much as he could\u201d. \u201cPlans for his future priestly ministry are still being discerned,\u201d the statement said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
