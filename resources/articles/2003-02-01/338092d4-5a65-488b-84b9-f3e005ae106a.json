Having opened the way for Arsenal to take an early lead, he was forced to watch as the Amsterdam club's latest generation of prodigies contrived an impressively spirited response. Bergkamp said he intended to treat this match just like any other, but it must have been a special sensation to face the club that he joined at the age of 12 and where, aged 17, he made his first-team debut as a substitute for the great Marco van Basten, sent on by Ajax's manager at the time, Johan Cruyff. From Van Basten he learned how to score goals with a deadly economy, 103 of them in 187 league matches. In the decade and a half since, Bergkamp has seldom betrayed his exalted pedigree. With the exception of two unhappy years struggling against the massed defences of Serie A in Internazionale's colours, he has given pleasure and instruction wherever he has played. At Arsenal he is one of the immortals, his partnership with Thierry Henry already ranking in modern mythology with that of John Radford and Ray Kennedy. No more beautiful or original goals have been scored for the Gunners than his famous efforts against Leicester City and Newcastle United. They were the product not just of quick feet and supernatural anticipation but of an enormously fertile imagination. At his best, Bergkamp plays with a balletic grace that is always placed in the service of the competitive purpose. He plays with his head up, scenting opportunities, and his feet change direction with a bewildering rapidity. Last night's match was not five minutes old when he wrote his signature on it. Ronald Koeman, Ajax's manager, had made special provision for his presence, detailing Tomas Galasek, the 30-year-old Czech midfielder, to sit in front of the back four and track Bergkamp's movements. But Galasek was nowhere to be seen when Patrick Vieira received the ball out of defence, took three paces, and pushed a pass so cunningly weighted that Bergkamp could let it run as he turned and then guided it with his first and only touch into the path of Sylvain Wiltord, who raced down the right before cutting in and firing his shot through Bogdan Lobont's legs. It was a classic Wenger-era goal, slicing through the opposition's centre and featuring a magnificently precise contribution from Bergkamp. A few minutes later he was at it again, drawing three defenders to him wide on the left before playing a sumptuously curving pass into the path of Lauren, cruising into space on the right. And midway through the first half he clipped a reverse ball that Henry, running into the inside-left channel, just failed to catch. By then, however, he would have noticed that Koeman's team were living up to their club's celebrated traditions. Steven Pienaar, the 20-year-old South African, 18-year-old Nigel de Jong, and Maxwell, the 21-year-old Brazilian, were darting and probing in midfield like a reincarnation of the team of Edgar Davids, Clarence Seedorf and Marc Overmars 10 years ago. It was no great surprise when De Jong took Galasek's pass and clipped the ball past Seaman for the equaliser. Shortly before the interval there was a vignette of the other, less attractive side of Bergkamp when he went into a challenge with Galasek inside the Ajax half. Trying to extract the ball, he twisted his body and brought his boot down on his opponent's leg, for which he was roundly abused by Ajax fans. Visions of his challenges on Jamie Carragher of Liverpool and Nils-Eric Johansson of Blackburn were evoked, but this time the lack of malice was obvious. Otherwise this was an entertaining match between two teams of great artistry and competitive spirit. On the night, Bergkamp could be proud of his association with both."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
