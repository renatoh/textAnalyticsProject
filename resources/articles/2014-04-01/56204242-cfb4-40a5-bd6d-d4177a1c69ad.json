Black boots were under threat as early as the 1950s. Here's Simon Burnton in 2013 and his brilliant Joy of Six: Tales from the boot room: \"Rewind to December 1959, when the Mansfield boot-manufacturing firm Ward Bros closed its doors with the loss of 60 jobs. \"Fashions in football boots these days are as fickle as the indies' shoe trade, if not more so,\" said Harold Ward, a director of the family firm. \"Until about three or four years ago a football boot was a football boot, varying only in size and weight, but following a sound basic design. Now the latest creation is likely to be in black and tan with silver eyelets, and in a couple of months' time it will be out of date, replaced by something else. We can't risk building up stocks that won't sell.\" But the beginning of the end for the traditional black boot came in the early 1970s. The German sportswear company Hummel was looking to break into the UK market and signed up several professionals to wear its new white boots. Not that they were worn for sartorial elegance. Alan Ball, who debuted his white boots in the 1970 Charity Shield, used to paint an old pair of Adidas boots white, while Derby's Alan Hinton risked Brian Clough's wrath for the money. \"The background to me wearing them was simple. A company called Hummel approached me and offered me a grand,\" Hinton told the Star in 2011. \"That was a fair bit of money back then. I thought Cloughie would crucify me, but he didn't for some reason.\" They then dropped out of fashion for a time, with the next reference in the newspaper archive we could muster coming from David Lacey's report on the 1995 European Cup final between Ajax and Milan in Vienna, where the Rossoneri's Marco Simone was a trendsetter. \"For a time it looked as if the amount of room Simone and his white boots were being allowed by Ajax would eventually return the trophy to the San Siro. However, he was to come no closer to scoring than the volley, from Donadoni's centre, which Van der Sar turned round a post at the end of the first half.\" When it comes to the first luminous footwear, things, ironically, are a little murkier. The mid-90s are the turning point once more and the earliest definitive reference we've uncovered comes in a report from Dundee's Dens Park. \"It was perhaps a portent that the afternoon was going to be a rather grim affair,\" wrote Archie MacGregor in the Sunday Times in November 1996, \"when St Johnstone's Attila Sekerlioglu decided to dispense with his notorious yellow boots.\" Any advance on November 1996? Let us know at the usual address: knowledge@theguardian.com PATRIOTIC KITS (2) Last week we looked at the clubs and countries to have plastered themselves in patriotic garb, and, as ever, the Knowledge inbox has been awash with emails pointing out the ones we missed. \"As a Mansfield Town supporter I was shocked and appalled to see Chesterfield FC featured at the top of your column this week,\" writes the shocked and appalled Mike Pollitt. \"I feel duty bound to draw your attention to our 2010-2011 season away kit, which was equally patriotic but not a cast-off from another club that had made them 'by simply cutting up union flags and stitching them together to create a football jersey'. The Stags players wore shorts and more conventional boots than shown in the picture, of course.\" And here's Joe Chapman: \"Flag-centric kits aren't only reserved for the nationalistic; they also offer an opportunity for publicity hungry chairmen. Windsor FC (the phoenix club from the old Windsor and Eton side that dissolved in 2011) have announced they will wear this kit from now on. It's ostensibly patriotic though the style does give the impression that whoever designed it suffers from acute colour-blindness. I'm not sure if the bowler hats are mandatory for the ensemble though.\" ALLITERATIVE LEAGUE WINNERS \"Have the four English professional divisions ever had four champions beginning with the same letter in the same season,\" pondered Gregg Bakowski last week for no reason other than it popped into his head when he was cycling to work. \"The quick answer is no,\" begins Peter Tomlin. \"In the days when there were only two divisions, it happened twice: 1892-93 (Sunderland won the first division and Small Heath won the second division) and 1906\u201307 when Newcastle United and Nottingham Forest won the two respective divisions. \"In a four-division season, the closest there has been to having all four champions beginning with the same letter was 1954\u201355. Birmingham City were second division champions, Barnsley won the Third Division (North) and Bristol City won the Third Division (South). Chelsea were the spoilsports, winning their first First Division title that year. The highest placed team beginning with 'B' in the top division were Burnley who finished 10th \u2013 nine points behind Chelsea.\" KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \"In light of Real Madrid's sacking of Fabio Capello, are there any other managers who have been sacked after winning the league title twice by the same club?\" inquired Gordon Tait back in 2006. Madrid actually only swung the axe at poor Fabio's head on one occasion, Gordon; on the other, in 1997, he left the Bernab\u00e9u for Milan of his own accord. However, Vicente del Bosque has been effectively sacked by the club twice: first, during a short tenure as manager in 1994 and then, infamously, in 2003 when the club decided not to renew his contract even though he had just led the club to their second La Liga title in three seasons. He had also won two Champions League crowns in his four years in charge. \"Del Bosque was showing signs of exhaustion,\" deadpanned the Real president Florentino P\u00e9rez, before adding, with a straight face: \"I want to be sincere about this \u2013 our belief that he was not the right coach for the future.\" Even before Del Bosque, Madrid had form for severing the hand that fed them: in 1998, they sacked the German coach Jupp Heynckes after just one season - a season in which Real won the European Cup for the first time in 32 years. Heynckes paid the price for some relatively miserable domestic form \u2013 Real finished fourth in La Liga, although they actually lost fewer games than the champions Barcelona \u2013 and was gone within eight days of the 1-0 victory over Juventus. However, surely the hardest-done-by manager in history was the Bayern Munich manager Udo Lattek, also sacked by his paymasters on two occasions. \"In 1975, after he had won three German championships in a row and the European Cup, a Bayern side full of tired World Cup winners only finished 10th in the league,\" recalls Raphael Honigstein. \"Legend has it he then told club president Wilhelm Neudecker that 'things have to change', only to receive the reply: 'Yes, they have to: you're fired!' He was reappointed in 1983 and again won three German championships and two cups in four seasons. But the European Cup final defeat in 1987 exposed a fraught relationship with his players. The club ultimately blamed him for the 2-1 loss against Porto and he was sacked. Again.\" For thousands more questions and answers, take a trip through the Knowledge archive. Can you help? \"Has a goalie ever been sent off and not been replaced?\" wonders Pennywise Peter via Twitter \"With two goals for Edin Dzeko last night, Manchester City have now got four players with 20 goals for the season in all competitions (Edin Dzeko, Yaya Tour\u00e9, Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Alvaro Negredo),\" begins Sam Al-Hamdani. \"Has any team ever bettered this in a single season?\" \"My question follows on from Jason Roberts retirement via hip-knack,\" begins Neill Rees. \"There must have been someone, somewhere that decided to play on, despite the expert advice to cease? Has their ever been a report of such a player to play on despite being medically told to not continue past Go, not just in a single match, but for the rest of the season or more?\" \"Kicking around on some French football sites, I noticed that Jerome Rothen, a winger mostly known for his days at PSG was in Ligue 2's team of the year in 1999-2000, and again in 2011-12,\" writes Eric Devin. \"While the French second division is obviously far from being one of Europe's top leagues, this stretch between being named to one all-division team and then another at the same level must surely be a record? Of note here are Wayne Bridge (2001-02 Premier League, 2012\u201113 Championship) and Michael Carrick, (2003-4 Championship, 2012-13 Premier League) but extensive Wikipedia trawling finds no such gap between appearances at the same level in Italy, Spain, England or Germany. Is Monsieur Rothen the holder of this somewhat dubious record?\" \"Recent Derby County teams have featured players named Bamford and Buxton, both towns within Derbyshire. Has there been a team which includes more players named after places within their county boundaries?\" wonders Gareth Buttrill Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
