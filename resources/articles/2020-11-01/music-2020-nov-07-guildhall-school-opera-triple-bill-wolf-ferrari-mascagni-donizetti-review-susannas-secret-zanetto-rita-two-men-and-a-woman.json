The art form has never shied from taxing subjects. In a stylish triple bill, Guildhall School of Music and Drama has made Wolf-Ferrari\u2019s Il segreto di Susanna (Susanna\u2019s Secret), Mascagni\u2019s Zanetto and Donizetti\u2019s Rita (Two Men and a Woman), each set in Florence, speak to a contemporary audience. Conducted by Dominic Wheeler, directed by Stephen Medcalf and involving small casts, a sizable orchestra and a full production team \u2013 I counted nearly a hundred names \u2013 this classy evening of sex and violence ingeniously negotiates the limits of social distancing. A double cast shares the four livestreamed performances (last one 9 November, 7pm, free). In Susanna\u2019s Secret, two promising performers \u2013 soprano Olivia Boen and baritone Tom Mole, both full of stage courage \u2013 played up the folly of a jealous husband presuming his innocent but bored wife has a lover. Soprano Ella de Jongh and, in the title role, mezzo-soprano Jessica Ouston captured the yearning fantasy of Zanetto, a mournful and unsatisfactory piece that nonetheless touches the heart. It also makes immense vocal demands, well met by both. Donizetti\u2019s Rita is a woman with two husbands: the former, violent, the current downtrodden. Annoyingly Husband No 1, assumed dead, turns out to be alive. This always insightful composer manages to make humour out of complex, uneasy human truths. Soprano Laura Lolita Pere\u0161ivana showed pizzazz as the confused wife, with tenor Thando Mjandana and baritone Chuma Sijeqa beguiling as her decidedly unbeguiling menfolk. A few ensemble problems in the Donizetti aside, the orchestra played with energy and dedication; so much talent, and so much hope for opera in its ever darkening hour. Guildhall\u2019s Opera Triple Bill concludes Monday 9 November, free live stream, 7pm"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
