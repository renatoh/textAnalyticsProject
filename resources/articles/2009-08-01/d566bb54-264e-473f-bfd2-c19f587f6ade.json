This may be because the pair of you are beautifully synchronised in your body clocks. Or it may be because you're both eager to get down to some serious nocturnal aerobics. Or it may be that you have only the one bedside lamp in the bedroom, and as a result the person on the opposite side of the bed from it has very little say in the matter. 100-300 There is a small but significantly irritating gap between when you want to turn out the lights and when your partner does. In some cases, this may be only a matter of minutes, but because of your extremely high-wattage bulb, those few minutes feel as if you're directly under a searchlight at a maximum security prison camp.
