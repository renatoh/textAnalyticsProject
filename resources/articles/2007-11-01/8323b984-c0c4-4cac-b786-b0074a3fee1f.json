You might have been better off heading to New York: there, it retails from $299, or around \u00a3142 - more than \u00a350 cheaper than here. And while you were there, you could have stocked up on some other bargains: Levi's 501 jeans cost \u00a360 through its UK store, but you can pick them up for just less than half that - $58 - in the US. A Nikon D40 digital SLR camera will set you back \u00a3327 in Currys but just $429, or \u00a3205, across in the Big Apple. Emerging markets UK stock market may have made a tentative bounce back from the summer lows, but emerging markets have surged ahead as investors look for ways to escape the risk that the credit crisis will push the US into recession, dragging Europe with it. Over three months the Chinese stock market has risen 15 per cent and Hong Kong's Hang Seng index is up more than 40 per cent. If you held shares in the three top-performing Asian funds - from Threadneedle, Neptune and Gartmore - you would have gained more than 30 per cent in the period. Gold Gold is priced in dollars, so the greenback's weakness has encouraged traders to mark the price up to compensate. But the precious metal is also gaining from its status as a hedge against inflation and a diversification away from riskier assets - including anything that could be touched by the credit crunch. Asian banks are rumoured to be ditching some of their dollar holdings in favour of gold to mitigate losses from the falls in the US currency. It has risen 14 per cent in just one month, and Merrill Lynch's gold and general unit trust has gained almost 30 per cent over three months. Investors have been piling in too: ETF Securities, which runs an exchange-traded fund tracking the gold price, reports that $400m has been invested in the past four months alone. Other commodities BHP Billiton's tilt at Rio Tinto set commodity share prices on fire last week, but they had already been doing rather well on the back of rising prices - silver and aluminium are up 10 per cent in the past month. Real estate Overseas property expert Escapes2.com reports a surge in interest from UK buyers in property in the US, with inquiries up almost threefold in six months and Florida now topping the list of preferred second-home locations. That is helped by the decline in property prices there too: a house that cost \u00a3180,000 three years ago can now be picked up for just \u00a3130,000. A spokesman said that even those planning to wait a bit before taking the plunge should buy their dollars now. Oil As with gold, the fact that oil is priced in dollars may explain part of its recent surge as it approaches the $100 mark. It is also seen as a good hedge against equities and other financial assets. The enthusiasm for oil, combined with Asian fever, has helped make China's PetroChina the world's biggest company and the first to achieve a theoretical market value of $1 trillion. US export While British exporters struggle to sell, as the weak dollar makes them seem rather pricey, their US counterparts are enjoying the opposite effect. A John Deere combine or tractor, for instance, will be 11 per cent cheaper than a year ago, while a Jaguar or a Land Rover is that much more expensive. Big banks Northern Rock is doing only around a fifth of the new business it was enjoying at the start of the year and the gainers are those lenders that are seen as more solid and dependable - such as Halifax owner HBOS and Abbey, part of the Spanish Santander group. Likewise, Barclays claims to be benefiting from a 'flight to quality' among institutional clients, though the City remains to be convinced. HSBC's shares have suffered less than the rest of the sector as investors bet that its size and global reach means it will be less affected by market turbulence. Distressed debt hedge funds and 'vulture funds' Hedge funds specialising in taking advantage of others' misfortune have prospered. That includes those that buy up debt at a fraction of its face value in the hope they of recouping more than that, and those that agitate for change at companies afflicted by turmoil, such as Switzerland's UBS."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
