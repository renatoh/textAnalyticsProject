Lightly tanned and looking sufficiently lean to still be playing, the 42-year-old exudes the relaxed air of someone enjoying a de-stressing spa break as he details his 6am runs along the Promenade des Anglais and daily gym regime. Then, with a seamless conversational reverse pass, he sits up straight, contemplates Sunday\u2019s opening World Cup Group D game against Scotland and begins punctuating his sentences with the words \u201crisk\u201d and \u201cbravery\u201d. \u201cThis job\u2019s the biggest risk I\u2019ve ever taken, but this is going to be the biggest Women\u2019s World Cup and I want to challenge for it,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I took this job I remember driving down from Valencia [where he and his family were living] and hearing words my Dad used to say: \u2018Never take the easy option, Phil. To succeed in life you\u2019ve got to take risks\u2019.\u201d The buses shuttling along the dual carriageway separating the beach from England\u2019s team hotel are all plastered with the tournament slogan \u201cDare to Shine\u201d and Neville seems very much on message. It is, after all, a familiar mantra reiterated to an Old Trafford graduate schooled by Sir Alex Ferguson. \u201cBravery is one of our five values,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ll only criticise my players if they don\u2019t make the pass, if they try to take the safe option. For 16 months we\u2019ve talked about risk, about gambling in the final third, being brave. We had the Marines in to talk to us about delivering on the frontline.\u201d The rehearsals have been mixed with England winning the SheBelieves Cup in the United States this spring, but losing three of their past five home friendlies, against Sweden, Canada and New Zealand. \u201cThose defeats, especially the one against Sweden show we cannot drop below our best,\u201d says Neville. \u201cTo win the World Cup we\u2019ve got to be at our best and more. I\u2019m certain of that. The players know it, too. \u201cAt Canada 2015, Mark [Sampson, his predecessor] and the girls had to make a superhuman effort to go from 14th in the world to win a bronze medal. It was incredible. But we\u2019re going to have to do even more to just get back to bronze level now. It\u2019s not going to be easy; the minute we fall below our standards we can be turned over. \u201cGetting to the semi-final in 2015 felt like winning the tournament; now we are at the stage where we don\u2019t want to be lauded for getting a bronze medal. But we can\u2019t take reaching the last four here for granted in any way; to get there we\u2019re going to have to be so brave.\u201d This is the first major tournament England have faced since their domestic league switched from a summer to a winter schedule and Neville has taken a radical approach towards countering fatigue. \u201cPhysically, we\u2019ve tried to stretch boundaries,\u201d he says. \u201cWe always do two more reps, three more reps, then when they\u2019re at breaking point, we push them further. It\u2019s a risk but to win you need to take risks. We\u2019ve taken really bold risks in the way we\u2019ve trained them, but these players don\u2019t know their own capabilities.\u201d It is time for a change of pace and the sight of Steph Houghton sitting at the opposite end of the restaurant, alone with her thoughts as she stares out at the Mediterranean is not lost on her manager. The England captain\u2019s husband, the former Liverpool, Bradford and Bolton defender Stephen Darby, has motor neurone disease and the couple are learning to live for the moment. \u201cIt\u2019s football, not life or death,\u201d says Neville. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of laughter and joking in our environment.\u201d This world of banter and practical jokes \u2013 the forward Nikita Parris recently delighted in putting salt in the manager\u2019s tea \u2013 eases the players\u2019 constant need to serve as role models and propel the women\u2019s game from niche to mainstream. \u201cThat\u2019s the biggest pressure my girls have,\u201d says Neville. \u201cThey\u2019re not just playing football, they\u2019re fighting for both those who fought for them in the past and to keep this train moving, to continue building legacies. The biggest thing is providing a better platform for the next generation. That\u2019s why my girls promote themselves so well. They\u2019re humble people \u2013 although I\u2019d like them to be a bit more arrogant at times \u2013 and there\u2019s a real authenticity when they speak. If they see a young girl at training they go out of their way to bring her into our community.\u201d Equality is floated as a conversational topic and, unusually, the coach\u2019s countenance darkens. \u201cMy girls really want to be respected,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say want equality, because I don\u2019t like that word. I think respect is better than equality. Equality means we\u2019re not getting everything, but we\u2019re getting unbelievable support \u2013 and what my players really want is respect. That\u2019s all they want. \u201cAs Toni Duggan said the other day, if we play well praise us, if we don\u2019t, hammer us. Just give us that respect. My players kick lumps out of each other every day in training because they want to win every game; so don\u2019t think it\u2019s all nicely-nicely.\u201d With victories hard to achieve in the increasingly competitive elite international arena the time for patronising put-downs is over. \u201cEvery game\u2019s hard now, whereas, in the past you could have rollovers,\u201d says Neville, who is not expecting a repeat of the 6-0 win England enjoyed against Scotland at Euro 2017. \u201cTactically, coaches are better now, so\u2019s the scouting. It\u2019s becoming harder to be successful.\u201d As his late father would doubtless have reminded him, the moment for bravery and risk-taking beckons."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
