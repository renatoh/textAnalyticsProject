Many countries, including the US where more than 110,000 have died, are now relaxing quarantine rules despite rising rates of infection in some areas. \u201cThat\u2019s millions and millions of infections worldwide. And it isn\u2019t over yet. And it\u2019s condensed in a very, very small time frame,\u201d said Fauci. In a videotaped discussion Fauci said he had known that an outbreak like this could occur but he was surprised by how \u201crapidly it just took over the planet\u201d. Fauci attributed the rapid spread to the contagiousness of the virus and extensive world travel by infected people. The top White House infectious disease adviser said the coronavirus pandemic differed significantly from other recent public health crises including Ebola and HIV. \u201cI mean, Ebola was scary. But Ebola would never be easily transmitted in a global way,\u201d he said. \u201cHIV, as important as it is, was drawn out over an extended period of time. I mean, I think the ultimate impact of Aids almost certainly will be greater than anything we\u2019re talking about now.\u201d The coronavirus just \u201ctook over the planet,\u201d he said. Fauci described research on the disease as \u201ca work in progress\u201d and said there were still questions about whether or not survivors who were seriously ill would fully recover. The disease has been shown to have a wide range of effects on people \u2013 leaving some without symptoms while others suffer lung damage, strokes, clotting disorders and severe immune responses. Fauci was speaking after the World Health Organization (WHO) rolled back guidance that it was \u201cvery rare\u201d for the disease to be transmitted by people who have the virus but no symptoms. \u201cOh my goodness,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cWhere is it going to end? We\u2019re still at the beginning of it.\u201d But Fauci said he was \u201cvery heartened\u201d by the pharmaceutical industry, which he said, \u201cstepped up to the plate\u201d. There are more than 124 Covid-19 vaccines under development as of 2 June, according to the WHO, and Fauci said he was \u201calmost certain\u201d that more than one would be successful. \u201cThe industry is not stupid. They figured it out,\u201d Fauci said. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be more than one winner in the vaccine field because we\u2019re going to need vaccines for the entire world. Billions and billions of doses.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
