I grew up in the hot spot of begonia biodiversity that is southeast Asia \u2013 home to dazzling iridescent species that shimmer like butterfly wings and mottled beauties that look straight off the set of Avatar. But my only knowledge of the genus was massive, double hybrids in lurid Vegas showgirl shades from 1980s British bedding-plant catalogues. Since then, thanks to the introduction of weird and wonderful species, I have well and truly been converted to this fascinating genus. Back in the day, the only begonias commonly available in the trade had not only had all their wild, rainforesty look bred out of them in favour of a uniform, plastic, perfectness, they were also strictly summer bedding plants only. Come the slightest whiff of frost, their soft, water-filled tissues would collapse to a brown mush that needed to be replaced every year. However, the popularisation of species from more northerly latitudes introduced a gene pool that confers a significant level of hardiness if given a thick winter mulch. Here are my favourite exotic begonias that are tough enough to thrive in UK gardens. I love Begonia formosana f albo-maculata from the highlands of Taiwan where the humid tropics meet the chill of winter. Its bat-wing leaves are covered in the most spectacular silver and white freckles over a base of the deepest, glossiest green. Large, pale-pink single flowers with sulphur-yellow centres are held above the leaves in summer, giving the plant a truly tropical look. Yet, despite its appearance, this species is really very frost tolerant, coping with lows as chilly as -10C in my experience and bouncing straight back the following spring. Another of the hardiest, more recent introductions from Asia is Begonia emeiensis. Its large, dark-green leaves have a faint shimmer of iridescence, which becomes stronger the deeper the shade they are grown in. A true water lover, this species inhabits the banks of rivers and streams in the wild, meaning it will grow in spots far too moist for other begonias. It is a great candidate for living walls or between the rocks by fountains and water features, paired with hardy maidenhair ferns. If you are going for the full hat-trick, you must try Begonia pedatifida, which has deeply divided fingers of foliage, creating an almost palm-like look, decorated with sprays of white flowers. Like any of the above it makes a brilliant bedfellow with grass-like ophiopogons and evergreen ferns, to provide winter structure when the plants are dormant. Want to make your budget stretch further? Club together with two mates and buy a plant each. They are all very easy to propagate from leaf cuttings, which will give you plants for free. If you let them self-seed by not being too strict with the weeding, they will potentially even hybridise to create new genetic combinations of hardy begonia that no one else has.
