Age: Three weeks old. Appearance: The perfect accompaniment to your self-isolated descent. I\u2019ve heard a lot about this. It\u2019s the Netflix show about the man who looks after tigers, right? Not reeeeally, no. Oh, that\u2019s a shame. I mean, it is about some people who own private big cat sanctuaries, but as a viewing experience it\u2019s also a bit like unscrewing the top of your skull and pouring tequila directly on to your brain. That good? Yes! You really haven\u2019t watched it? Everyone\u2019s quarantined. What else have you been doing? Obsessively auditing my remaining dry goods. Well, stop that. This is more important. Do you want me to tell you what Tiger King is about? I don\u2019t think I have a choice. That\u2019s right. It is about the rivalry between different big cat owners, all of whom look like a cross between a retired WWE wrestler and Wagner from X Factor. Remember Wagner? No. It doesn\u2019t matter. The lead character is a man called Joe Exotic who, well \u2026 Well, what? Where to start? He used to shoot horses and feed them to his lions whole. And he is a magician. And he was once married to two men at the same time. And he ran for president in 2016. And he is a country singer. That last one doesn\u2019t sound particularly outrageous. What if I told you he didn\u2019t write or perform any of the songs on any of his albums? Oh. Or that one of his songs was called Here Kitty Kitty, which directly claimed that his rival \u2013 Big Cat Rescue CEO Carole Baskin \u2013 fed her missing husband to his tigers? Which, obviously, she denies. Right. Or that he is now serving a 22-year jail sentence for trying to hire someone to murder Baskin? And this is a fun show? Absolutely. Everyone loves it! Vanity Fair called it \u201criveting\u201d. Slate called it \u201cgenuinely compulsive viewing\u201d. CNN, regrettably, called it \u201cGrrrr-reat\u201d. It was also, upon launch, the most-watched thing on Netflix. But isn\u2019t it a bit icky and exploitative? Oh, absolutely. Tiger King is a show about genuinely terrible people. It is exploitative, both to its subjects and the animals. It revels in humanity\u2019s basest instincts. It does that grubby Netflix thing of making the viewers complicit in all the terrible acts by giving notoriety to those who don\u2019t deserve it. It sounds awful. It is awful. So should I give it a miss? No! It is the perfect show for these weird, uncertain times and you should definitely watch it. Do say: \u201cTiger King is cruel and exploitative.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cBut it\u2019s this or reconnecting with our loved ones, so we may as well watch it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
