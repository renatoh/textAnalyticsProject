The manager heads to Manchester United on Saturday looking happier, and sounding more positive, than at any point this season. \u201cI am convinced, 100%, that we will stay in the Premier League this season,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez, whose side have only two points. If the Spaniard will not begin to truly trust Ashley until the owner reinforces an understrength squad in January, the conviviality over an Italian meal at a Northumberland restaurant on Wednesday does seem to have started breaking the ice. \u201cIt was a pleasant dinner; everything that was said will stay between us but I think it\u2019s positive,\u201d said Ben\u00edtez. \u201cI think some good can come out of it. I can\u2019t see any negatives. I think it was his [Ashley\u2019s] idea to support the team and the manager. Everyone was relaxed and the mood was very good.\u201d Asked whether he felt more confident about being able to make signings in January, the manager\u2019s reply was instructive. \u201cI hope so,\u201d he said. \u201cHe knows my ideas and if we talk and he sees the games it will be easier for everyone to understand. \u201cI\u2019m very realistic, I know January is a difficult window but, at the same time, Newcastle is a nice city, it\u2019s a good place with fantastic fans and it\u2019s an opportunity for players to come to the Premier League. I\u2019m quite optimistic but, at the same time, realistic. Maybe we can fix things and improve. We will see if we can go in the right direction.\u201d Ashley, after failing to attend any of Newcastle\u2019s games for more than a year, has been in the stands for the past two fixtures and is scheduled to be at Old Trafford to watch Ben\u00edtez\u2019s lastest reunion with his old foe Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. Ben\u00edtez was reluctant to be drawn on Mourinho\u2019s travails in Manchester, saying only: \u201cSometimes you have to praise players. Everyone has his own ideas; it\u2019s important the team understands your way of managing. But I don\u2019t see a fragile Manchester United team.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
