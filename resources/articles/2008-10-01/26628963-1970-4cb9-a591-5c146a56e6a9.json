As the Guardian reported in August the NHS is witnessing rising numbers of cases of patients with drink or drugs problems stealing the \u00a310-a-litre gel and mixing it with orange juice, Lucozade or cola to create powerful cocktails. Now the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA), which collects data on patient safety problems, has issued hospitals with new guidance on storage and use following 692 incidents related to the 70% proof alcohol gel. The NPSA stress that most of the cases were classed as \"low to no harm\" but there were also serious incidents. One of these cases was reported as a death, however the agency admitted it was difficult to know whether the gel was the direct cause as the patient had been admitted to hospital after drinking a large quantity of alcohol. In another case a psychiatric patient suffered burns to his hands when he tried to use the gel to start a fire on a hospital ward. And a patient with severe psychiatric problems, who had previously tried to commit suicide by jumping out of a window, took a paracetamol overdose and then drank some alcohol hand rub. Another patient added the gel to a hot drink when they mistook the gel dispenser for a saccharine dispenser. More than 100 other reports concerned children getting the gel in their eyes. When the Guardian broke the story in August hospitals said they had seen a rise in thefts of the gel dispensers and now many are moving to install locks. Homerton Hospital, east London, which was losing three or four dispensers a day, called in the police and was installing CCTV. Barts and the London Hospital is testing lockable dispensers and three other London hospitals - University College London Hospital, Guys and St Thomas' and St George's Hospital - have also reported thefts. The gel is rendered supposedly undrinkable by the addition of the foul tasting chemical additive bitrex or by chemically converting it into highly toxic methylated spirit. But ambulance paramedic bloggers who have been called to people collapsed in the street carrying gel dispensers say hardened addicts simply \"drink through\" the taste. Alcohol hand rub has been in use in the NHS for four years as one of the frontline weapons in the battle against hospital-acquired infections, such as MRSA. Now the NPSA has advised hospitals, particularly those caring for children and psychiatric patients, to move away from leaving dispensers at the end of beds or on the entrances to wards. Katherine Wilson, who leads the NPSA-run NHS hygiene programme, Clean Your Hands, said the NPSA recommends alcohol hand rub should only be used within the immediate contact area that a patient is being treated. \"We also strongly recommend staff use personal dispensers, particularly if they treat children or mental health patients, as this further minimises risk of misuse,\" she said. \"Hospitals that install hand rub dispensers away from the point of care, including along corridors or at ward entrances, must take all necessary safety and storage precautions.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
