Hamish Kilgour from the Clean describes the city as a cauldron, with the low-hanging sky its lid. It\u2019s a creative pressure cooker from which artists must escape. In the decades since, the bands that steamed from the top of that cauldron have gone global. Next to the Clean, the biggest name is Martin Phillipps, the legendary leader \u2013 of 21 different lineups \u2013 of the Chills. They were the definitive Dunedin band, with a strange, light, airy, eerie, breezy magic that both matched the city\u2019s geography and transcended it. But they were cursed. The subtitle of The Chills: The Triumph and Tragedy of Martin Phillipps \u2013 a new documentary by Julia Parnell and Rob Curry \u2013 tells you that this is, first and foremost, a portrait of the artist. A consummate songwriter, Phillipps appears as both a driven man and a lost boy, emotionally cut off from those drawn into his orbit to help him realise his vision. The film opens in the interior of Phillipps\u2019 home. Over the haunted opening notes of Pink Frost (\u201cThat\u2019s fine art, according to me,\u201d we hear Iggy Pop say, on a radio show), Phillipps pulls out his keyboard \u2013 then breaks into Heavenly Pop Hit, which wasn\u2019t so much his biggest hit as his nearest miss. Spliced amid scenes of festival crowds, ecstatic gigs and the video clip of the song, Phillipps climbs into a decrepit car and drives himself to hospital to receive the results of his liver function tests. Phillipps has hepatitis C. He is told, with medical precision, that he has a 31% chance of dying within 12 months. Then he is given a guarantee: \u201cIf you do keep drinking, Martin, you will die,\u201d the physician says. There is so much about the Chills\u2019 story that is, on the face of it, cliched. After a number of acclaimed singles and EPs, Phillipps, whose best songs are touched with a sense of wonder, signs his band to a multi-album deal with a US label, Slash. When the hits fail to materialise, he sinks into a fog of heroin addiction, alcoholism, depression and withdrawal. But Parnell and Curry treat their subject with unusual sensitivity, helped by Phillipps\u2019 extraordinary candour. He allows them access to every step of his treatment process, as well as to his archives (he is an obsessive collector). Around him, other band members, each of them individually numbered, step forward to speak. What they have to say is just as unfiltered. The former drummer Caroline Easther (Chill No 12) says Phillipps made her feel anxious. The bassist Justin Harwood (Chill No 14) comments that he didn\u2019t know if he was needed or expendable. He came to the latter conclusion after Phillipps told him he planned to write the bass parts on the band\u2019s next album himself. Another bassist, Terry Moore (No 6), who played in two stints with the band, wonders if he\u2019s going to be next. The drummer Jimmy Stephenson (No 15) has been left traumatised. In tears, he pulls out a gold record of the band\u2019s biggest album, Submarine Bells, the glass cracked after falling off his wall in an earthquake: to him it\u2019s symbol of both \u201cgreat success and shattered dreams\u201d. In between, we watch Phillipps going through piles of junk as he reassesses his life, sorting the detritus from the essentials. Preparing for an art exhibition \u2013 while spray-painting a mummified cat \u2013 he muses that \u201cit\u2019s much more fun working as a team on anything. But I\u2019m not going to sacrifice the quality for just a bit of team spirit.\u201d Phillipps remained Chill No 1. Over it all, Dunedin hovers. \u201cThe black cloud rolled in and it was there for a good long stay,\u201d says Chill No 26, Phil Kusabs. He\u2019s speaking of Phillipps but he may as well be talking about the city, for its combination of suburban blandness and gothic grandeur. We see trees bent out of shape by the elements and the forest in which Pink Frost was shot behind the town. It\u2019s beautifully filmed, suffusing the documentary with an atmosphere to match the Chills\u2019 glorious music, and we get to hear much of that, too. But it\u2019s never allowed to get in the way of the story \u2013 there\u2019s no recounting of the band\u2019s discography and, other than Neil Finn and the aforementioned Iggy Pop, no higher luminaries are called on to affirm the band\u2019s standing. Phillipps\u2019 story resonates because despite his self-involvement, it\u2019s bigger than he is. It\u2019s about artistic integrity, self-realisation, self-acceptance and a reflection on mortality. Towards the end of this sad, lovely film, the emotional rush is equivalent to the Dunedin surf washing on to the cold beaches \u2013 it finishes far more optimistically than it promises to. As a fan, I wanted to punch the air. And of course, it will be fans of the Chills who queue up first to see this documentary. If you\u2019ve not yet had the distinctive pleasure of hearing his band, the triumph and tragedy of Phillipps\u2019 story will make you one for life. \u2022 This article was amended on 19 June 2019 to correctly credit an image. \u2022 The Chills: The Triumph and Tragedy of Martin Phillipps screens as part of the Sydney film festival on Friday (Dendy Newtown) and Sunday (Event Cinemas, George Street).
