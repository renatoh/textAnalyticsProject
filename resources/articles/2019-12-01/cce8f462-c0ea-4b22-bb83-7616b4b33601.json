In a statement on Friday morning the prime minister explained he had brought forward his leave with his family due to the need to travel to Japan and India in January. \u201cI deeply regret any offence caused to any of the many Australians affected by the terrible bushfires by my taking leave with family at this time,\u201d Morrison said. Morrison later confirmed the holiday was in Hawaii, seeking to explain the trip\u2019s secrecy by suggesting he had tried to give his daughters \u201ca bit of a surprise\u201d despite several reporters stating the prime minister\u2019s office had denied reports he was in Hawaii after he and his family had arrived. The holiday \u2013 which was due to conclude on Monday \u2013 will now be cut short, with Morrison expected back in Australia on Saturday. \u201cI have been receiving regular updates on the bushfires disaster as well as the status of the search for and treatment of the victims of the White Island tragedy,\u201d Morrison said in the statement. \u201cThe Commonwealth\u2019s responsibilities have been well managed by the Acting Prime Minister, Minister [David] Littleproud and Minister [Marise] Payne. In a separate statement, Morrison expressed \u201csincere condolences and sympathies\u201d to the families of two volunteer firefighters killed when a truck near the town of Buxton late on Thursday hit a tree and rolled off the road. \u201cOur hearts go out to their families, friends and colleagues who have been working tirelessly beside them, particularly during this Christmas period,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven these most recent tragic events, I will be returning to Sydney from leave as soon as can be arranged.\u201d Morrison has described climate change as \u201cone of many factors\u201d in the bushfires, but has been accused of downplaying its threat and not doing enough on climate policy. Although he has repeatedly insisted Australia is meeting its international obligations to reduce carbon emissions, Australia was accused by about 100 countries of thwarting negotiations at last week\u2019s UN climate summit in Madrid by using an accounting loophole to meet its emissions targets. Australia has received broad criticism internationally for its climate policies, with a group of thinktanks recently ranking the nation the worst-performing country on climate change from a list of 57. The Morrison government was specifically singled out as a \u201cregressive force\u201d in the report, but Morrison himself rejected the group\u2019s findings as \u201cnot credible\u201d. He also criticised the widespread student strikes to demand more action on climate change, saying he wanted \u201cless activism in schools\u201d. Morrison has long been a supporter of Australia\u2019s fossil fuel industry. In a high-profile 2017 stunt, he brought a lump of coal into the House of Representatives and urged MPs: \u201cDon\u2019t be afraid\u201d. The Liberal government has faced criticism for years over its support for the proposed Adani coalmine in Queensland, which experts have said would lock in years of increased carbon emissions, threaten local wildlife and damage the Great Barrier Reef. Michael McCormack has served as acting prime minister since Monday, declaring his hometown of Wagga Wagga was the nation\u2019s capital, while Morrison copped bad press for an international holiday in Hawaii. Morrison told 2GB Radio although he did not normally announce when he was going on leave \u201cor say where we\u2019re going\u201d, he accepted that in the circumstances it had \u201cunderstandably caused a lot of anxiety and I deeply regret that\u201d. \u201cI know Australians understand this and they\u2019ll be pleased I\u2019m coming back, I\u2019m sure, but they know I don\u2019t hold a hose, I don\u2019t sit in a control room.\u201d Morrison said his wife and two girls \u201clike holidaying in Hawaii so we\u2019ve had a few nice days here\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s just unfortunate that it\u2019s come at such an awful time, particularly for those living in and around Sydney and New South Wales. And it\u2019s just devastating to be here and seeing what\u2019s happening there.\u201d Reporters including the BBC\u2019s Frances Mao and The New Daily\u2019s Samantha Maiden were advised by Morrison\u2019s office earlier in the week that reports he was in Hawaii were incorrect. The Labor leader, Anthony Albanese, has declined to criticise Morrison for his holiday, although Labor MPs have continued to target him for knocking back calls to pay volunteer firefighters and declining to meet former emergency services chiefs who have demanded more action on climate change. On Friday Albanese suggested the government should look at options to compensate volunteer firefighters such as tax breaks, one-off payments, or support for employers that allow workers to take leave. In a TV interview from Kurrajong Heights, north-west of Sydney Albanese said volunteers \u201cstill had to put food on the table, they still have to pay their mortgage\u201d and the nation should repay their commitment to their communities. On Thursday the Greens senators Sarah Hanson Young and Mehreen Faruqi attended a protest at the prime minister\u2019s Sydney residence, Kirribilli House, targeting Morrison for his absence during the crisis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
