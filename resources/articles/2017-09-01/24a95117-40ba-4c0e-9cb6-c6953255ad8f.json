The vote for the sanctions, the ninth package of measures imposed by the UN Security Council on Pyongyang since 2006 for its nuclear and missile tests, came as a relief to US diplomats who had feared a Chinese abstention, which would have considerably blunted the impact of the new sanctions. In late night negotiations on Sunday, the US considerably diluted its initial draft sanctions resolution, which would have imposed a complete oil embargo and a partial naval blockade, in an effort to win support from China and Russia. The final resolution adopted by the security council on Monday imposed a ban on oil condensates exports to the regime, capped refined petroleum exports at 2m barrels a year \u2013 cutting existing export levels by half \u2013 and maintaining international exports of crude oil to North Korea at existing levels, about 4m barrels a year. China supplies most of North Korea\u2019s crude. Western diplomats portrayed the Monday night vote as a win for international unity in the face of North Korean intransigence and provocations, and pointed out that it represented the toughest sanctions regime imposed on the regime to date. \u201cWe are facing not a regional but a global threat, not a virtual but an immediate threat, not a serious but an existential threat,\u201d Francois Delattre, the French envoy to the UN said after the vote. \u201cThis threat is what unites us in the security council and, I hope, what will bring us towards unity when it comes to the vote and hopefully beyond.\u201d The US mission to the UN put out a statement saying the sanctions were the strongest ever imposed on North Korea. \u201cThis resolution reduces about 30% of oil provided to North Korea by cutting off over 55% of refined petroleum products going to North Korea,\u201d the statement said. \u201cCombined with the previous Security Council resolutions, over 90% of North Korea\u2019s publicly reported 2016 exports of $2.7bn are now banned (coal, textiles, iron, seafood), which does not include revenues from overseas workers.\u201d However, few diplomats or observers believed the punitive measures alone would force Kim Jong-un\u2019s regime to stop its nuclear and missile tests. It test-fired two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July and carried out its sixth nuclear test, a powerful blast it said was the detonation of thermonuclear device, on 3 September. Textiles were North Korea\u2019s second-biggest export after coal and other minerals in 2016, totaling $752m, according to data from the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency. Nearly 80 percent of the textile exports went to China. Nikki Haley, the US ambassador to the UN, said: \u201cWe are done trying to prod North Korea to do the right thing, we are now acting to stop it doing the wrong thing.\u201d However, she said the US was not looking for war with North Korea and that Pyongyang had not yet passed the point of no return.\u201d \u201cIf it agrees to stop its nuclear program, it can reclaim its future. If it proves it can live in peace, the world will live in peace with it,\u201d she told the UN security council after the council adopted the new sanctions. \u201cToday\u2019s resolution would not have happened without the strong relationship that has developed between President Trump and Chinese President Xi,\u201d Haley said. The much stronger version proposed by the US last week, included the first asset freeze directed at Kim Jong-un, a complete ban on oil sales to his regime, and a mandate for warships from any member state to inspect ships suspected of carrying contraband to or from North Korea, and to enforce inspect using \u201call necessary measures\u201d. China\u2019s UN ambassador Liu Jieyi called on North Korea to \u201ctake seriously the expectations and will of the international community\u201d to halt its nuclear and ballistic missile development, and called on all parties to remain \u201ccool-headed\u201d and not stoke tensions. Liu said relevant parties should resume negotiations \u201csooner rather than later.\u201d To kick-start talks, China and Russia have proposed a dual suspension of North Korea\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile testing as well as US and South Korean military exercises. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a big mistake to underestimate this Russia, China initiative. It remains on the table at the Security Council and we will insist on it being considered,\u201d Russian UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia told the security council. The Pyongyang regime threatened retribution against Washington for any new sanctions measure threatening to inflict \u201cthe greatest pain and suffering\u201d the US has ever encountered. The UK ambassador to the UN, Matthew Rycroft, was asked why he thought the new sanctions would change North Korean behaviour considering the eight earlier resolutions had failed. \u201cFirst of all, these are significantly tougher sanctions. Secondly, you\u2019re right that sanctions take time to have an impact, but it\u2019s only over the last year or so that the Security Council has been sanctioning sectors of the economy,\u201d Rycroft said. \u201cAnd the textile sector is the final sector of the economy that is not until tonight subject to a ban on exports. So this is a very significant tightening up still further of the constraints on the North Korean regime.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
