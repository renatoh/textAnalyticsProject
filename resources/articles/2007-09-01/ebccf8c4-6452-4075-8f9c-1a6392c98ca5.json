Any advice? Rebecca Garrill, Cambridge, via email Aficionados of folding bikes talk reverentially of Bromptons (bromptonbicycle.co.uk). They tick all the boxes: dependable, well made and, as yet, unsurpassed for speed and ease of folding. When I test-rode one, my only objection was that perhaps they were not the best-handling and most fun to ride. Plus, that hand-built quality comes at a price. I was impressed by Dahon's range (dahon.com). A bike like the Mu XL does everything you ask, is cheaper and, arguably, easier to ride. But go to a shop that specialises in folding bikes (eg. velorution.biz), and get the advice of a retail expert. \u00b7 Send your cycling queries to bike.doctor@theguardian.com Matt Seaton's Two Wheels is published by Guardian Books at \u00a38.99.
