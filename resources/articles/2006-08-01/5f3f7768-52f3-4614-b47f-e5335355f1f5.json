A 15th win from 16 matches pulls the Black and Whites four points clear of Leeds, setting up a potential play-off clash with the leaders St Helens. Peter Sharp's side never needed to shift into top gear but, with solid efforts from Richard Swain, Garreth Carvell and Shayne McMenemy up front, they were not in any real danger of losing either. \"I thought we put a gutsy effort in against a tough team,\" said Sharp, who secured the signature of the Cronulla forward Hitch Maiava for next season at the weekend. \"That gives us a four-point break and it's in our now hands now. We control our own destiny as to where we finish and that's a nice position to be in.\" For Huddersfield the match had more implications than two lost league points - a defeat which leaves them still looking over their shoulders towards the bottom of the table - as their influential stand-off Chris Thorman had to be withdrawn with a hamstring injury that puts his Challenge Cup final place against St Helens in doubt in two weeks' time. \"Chris felt it a bit before the game and it got gradually worse through the match,\" their coach Jon Sharp said. \"It's causing us some concern and not looking too good.\" Hull dominated the opening quarter, with the only surprise being that they recorded only six points during that period. Their impressive full-back Motu Tony sneaked over from dummy-half in the third minute with Paul Cooke converting but, despite forcing four goalline drop-outs and making ground almost at will, they failed to push home their advantage. It took Huddersfield 24 minutes to mount their first genuine attack, only for Thorman to drop the ball with the line open. Moments later Cooke edged Hull further in front with a penalty. It was a moment of Giants indiscipline that crucially allowed the visitors to record their second try just before half-time. When the Huddersfield prop Wayne McDonald lost the ball in a four-man tackle, the hooker Brad Drew objected to the referee Phil Bentham's knock-on decision and was sin-binned for dissent. In the ensuing set of six, McMenemy crashed over to make it 14-0. The Giants were still down to 12 men when Graeme Horne capitalised on defensive confusion to touch down Cooke's clever kick two minutes into the second half. Huddersfield improved significantly with the ball in the final half-hour, even closing the gap briefly to eight points with tries by Stuart Jones and Andy Raleigh. Jones finished off neat work from Kevin Brown, before Raleigh stormed over in the corner. But almost immediately afterwards Keith Mason lost the ball deep inside his own half and Shaun Briscoe's try sealed matters for Hull.
