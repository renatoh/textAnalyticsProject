After he and Feliciano L\u00f3pez \u2013 who earlier secured the Queen\u2019s Club singles title he previously won in 2017 \u2013 had beaten the Londoner Joe Salisbury and the American Rajeev Ram 7-6 (6), 5-7, 10-5 to win the Fever-Tree doubles title, Murray said: \u201cIf it happens in September or next year or in six weeks, I really don\u2019t mind. \u201cI\u2019m happy with playing tennis and training and having no pain any more. If I keep progressing, I would like to try to play singles. I have a couple of options after Wimbledon: either I continue with doubles but start training and practising singles through the US Open swing, and then try and maybe play singles after that. Or I take a longer break post-Wimbledon of maybe, let\u2019s say, a month or six weeks to get myself ready for singles and then try and play close to the US Open time. \u201cI guess those would be the two options. I don\u2019t anticipate it would be much longer than that. My schedule could potentially be a bit different. I might not play three weeks in a row or two weeks back to back, for example. \u201cBut I\u2019m just quite happy doing what I\u2019m doing, taking each week as it comes. If things keep going well, I\u2019ll try and play singles. If I start training and I think actually I\u2019m not going to compete at a level I\u2019m happy with, yeah. \u201cI know in Australia I didn\u2019t anticipate playing doubles, but I also didn\u2019t anticipate feeling like this and enjoying playing tennis like this, either. We\u2019ll see what happens.\u201d Murray, who had his hip resurfaced in January and now plays with a metal insert, was alert, strong and confident. Transferring to singles, though, will be complicated. He lost in five sets against Roberto Bautista Agut in the first round of the Australian Open, and broke down in tears afterwards, resigned to quitting the game. That he has managed to come back to this sort of level in five months is remarkable. The former British No 1 Greg Rusedski said of the theatre that unfolded in fading light on Centre Court: \u201cYou couldn\u2019t have scripted it any better. He\u2019s our greatest sportsman of this generation, when fit.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
