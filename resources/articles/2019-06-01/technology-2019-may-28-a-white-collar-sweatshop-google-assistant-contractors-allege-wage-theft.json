Throughout the three-day event, company executives repeatedly answered yes while touting new features of the Google Assistant, the company\u2019s version of Alexa or Siri, that can indeed feel magical. The tool can book you a rental car, tell you what the weather is like at your mother\u2019s house, and even interpret live conversations across 26 languages. But to some of the Google employees responsible for making the Assistant work, the tagline of the conference \u2013 \u201cKeep making magic\u201d \u2013 obscured a more mundane reality: the technical wizardry relies on massive data sets built by subcontracted human workers earning low wages. \u201cIt\u2019s smoke and mirrors if anything,\u201d said a current Google employee who, as with the others quoted in this story, spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the press. \u201cArtificial intelligence is not that artificial; it\u2019s human beings that are doing the work.\u201d The Google employee works on Pygmalion, the team responsible for producing linguistic data sets that make the Assistant work. And although he is employed directly by Google, most of his Pygmalion co-workers are subcontracted temps who have for years been routinely pressured to work unpaid overtime, according to seven current and former members of the team. These employees, some of whom spoke to the Guardian because they said efforts to raise concerns internally were ignored, alleged that the unpaid work was a symptom of the workplace culture put in place by the executive who founded Pygmalion. That executive, Linne Ha, was fired by Google in March following an internal investigation, Google said. Ha could not be reached for comment before publication. She contacted the Guardian after publication and said her departure had not been related to unpaid overtime. But current and former employees also identified Google\u2019s broad reliance on approximately 100,000 temps, vendors and contractors (known at Google as TVCs) for large amounts of the company\u2019s work as a culprit. Google does not directly employ the workers who collect or create the data required for much of its technology, be they the drivers who capture photos for Google Maps\u2019 Street View, the content moderators training YouTube\u2019s filters to catch prohibited material, or the scanners flipping pages to upload the contents of libraries into Google Books. Having these two tiers of workers \u2013 highly paid full-time Googlers and often low-wage and precarious workers contracted through staffing firms \u2013 is \u201ccorrosive\u201d, \u201chighly problematic\u201d, and \u201cpermissive of exploitation\u201d, the employees said. \u201cIt\u2019s like a white-collar sweatshop,\u201d said one current Google employee. \u201cIf it\u2019s not illegal, it\u2019s definitely exploitative. It\u2019s to the point where I don\u2019t use the Google Assistant, because I know how it\u2019s made, and I can\u2019t support it.\u201d An \u2018army\u2019 of linguists The study of language is at the very heart of current advancements in computing. For decades, people have had to work to learn the language of computers, whether they were trying to program a VCR or writing software. Technology such as the Google Assistant reverses the equation: the computer understands natural human speech, in all its variations. Take, for example, the straightforward task of asking the Assistant to set a timer to go off in five minutes, a former employee on Pygmalion explained. There are infinite ways that users could phrase that request, such as \u201cSet a timer for five minutes\u201d; \u201cCan you ring the buzzer in five minutes?\u201d; or \u201cConfigurar una alarma para cinco minutos.\u201d The Assistant has to be able to convert the spoken request into text, then interpret the user\u2019s intended meaning to produce the desired outcome, all practically instantaneously. The technology that makes this possible is a form of machine learning. For a machine learning model to \u201cunderstand\u201d a language, it needs vast amounts of text that has been annotated by linguists to teach it the building blocks of human language, from parts of speech to syntactic relationships. Enter Pygmalion. The team was born in 2014, the brainchild of the longtime Google executive Linne Ha, to create the linguistic data sets required for Google\u2019s neural networks to learn dozens of languages. The \u201cpainstaking\u201d nature of the labor required to create this \u201chandcrafted\u201d data was featured in a 2016 article about Pygmalion\u2019s \u201cmassive team of PhD linguists\u201d by Wired. From the beginning, Google planned to build the team with just a handful of full-time employees while outsourcing the vast majority of the annotation work to an \u201carmy\u201d of subcontracted linguists around the world, documents reviewed by the Guardian and interviews with staff show. The appetite for Pygmalion\u2019s hand-labeled data, and the size of the team, has only increased over the years. Today, it includes 40 to 50 full-time Googlers and approximately 200 temporary workers contracted through agencies, including Adecco, a global staffing firm. The contract workers include associate linguists, who are tasked with annotation, and project managers, who oversee their work. All of the contract workers have at least a bachelor\u2019s degree in linguistics, though many have master\u2019s degrees and some have doctorates. In addition to annotating data, the temp workers write \u201cgrammars\u201d for the Assistant, complex and technical work that requires considerable expertise and involves Google\u2019s code base. Their situation is comparable to adjunct professors on US college campuses: they are highly educated and highly skilled, performing work crucial to the company\u2019s mission, and shut out of the benefits and security that come with a tenured position. \u201cImagine going from producing PhD-level research and pushing forward the state of knowledge in the world to going to an annotation type job, where all you\u2019re doing all day is annotating data; it\u2019s very click, click, click,\u201d said a former project manager on Pygmalion. \u201cEveryone was trying to prove themselves because everyone was trying to work for Google. The competitive edge that happened among colleagues as TVCs was severe.\u201d In comments provided to the Guardian after publication, Ha said: \u201cThe quantity of hours would not have been relevant to being converted to a full-time role.\u201d She said that skills, education and expertise were the most important factors for potential hires, and that Google\u2019s challenging interview process is well known. \u201cI have preached that work/life balance is critical for life satisfaction and general well being,\u201d she said. \u201cI have said again and again that we are NOT saving lives, our work is not critical enough to be killing ourselves for our job.\u201d \u201cGoogle is a multibillion-dollar company,\u201d she added. \u201cI would NEVER ask for people to work and be unpaid. This goes against everything that I believe.\u201d \u2018The definition of wage theft\u2019 This dynamic created the incentive for temps to perform unpaid work. Managers took advantage by making it clear they wouldn\u2019t approve overtime for contract workers, while also assigning unrealistic amounts of work, current and former employees said. The pressure to complete assignments was \u201cimmense\u201d, said one Googler. \u201cIn this mixed stream of messages, I think a lot of people had to make their own calls, and given the pressure, I think people made different calls.\u201d The Googler described the overall effect as \u201cgaslighting\u201d, and recalled receiving messages from management such as, \u201cIf the TVCs want to work more, let them work more.\u201d All seven current and former employees interviewed by the Guardian said they had either experienced or witnessed contract workers performing unpaid overtime. \u201cTo my knowledge, no one ever said, you need to work TVCs above their contracts, but it was set up so that it was the only way to get the expected work done, and if anyone raised concerns they would be openly mocked and belittled,\u201d said another current Googler. \u201cThe 40-hour thing was just not respected,\u201d said a former associate linguist. \u201cIt was made clear to us that we were never to log more than 40 hours, but we were never told not to work more than 40 hours. \u201cThe work that they assign often takes more than eight hours,\u201d they added. \u201cEvery week you fill out a timesheet. One person one time did submit overtime, and they were chastised. No punishment, but definitely told not to work overtime.\u201d A spokeswoman for Google said that it was company policy that temp workers must be paid for all hours worked, even if overtime was not approved in advance. \u201cWorking off the clock is the very definition of wage theft,\u201d said Beth Ross, a longtime labor and employment attorney. Ross said that both Google and Adecco could face liability for unpaid wages and damages under federal and state law. \u2018They dangle that carrot\u2019 The associate linguist was one of several who said that they took the position at Google in hopes that they could eventually convert to a full-time position. Several members of Pygmalion are former contract workers, including the current head of the team, who took over from Ha, the executive who founded the team, in September 2017. \u201cPeople did [unpaid overtime] because they were dangled the opportunity of becoming a full-time employee, which is against company policy,\u201d a current Googler said. \u201cThere\u2019s a particular leveraging of people\u2019s desire to become full time,\u201d said another. \u201cWhen I was hired, I was very explicitly told that there is no ladder,\u201d a current contract worker said. \u201c\u2018This is not a temp-to-hire position. There is no moving up\u2019 \u2026 But the reality on the team is very much one where there is clearly a ladder. A certain percentage of the associate linguists will get project manager. A certain percentage of project managers get converted to full time. We watch it happen, and they dangle that carrot.\u201d One Googler who successfully converted to a full-time position after working as a temp on Pygmalion said that at times the bargain was even made explicit. In April 2017, they recalled, Ha attended a meeting of outsourced Pygmalion project managers in London and \u201cexplain[ed] that the position was designed for conversion and that we should be proactive in asking for more work in order to achieve this\u201d. Ha said that she had helped many contract workers convert to full-time positions. \u201c\u2018Designed for conversion\u2019 means that the TVC is now inside Google and has exposure and understanding of the culture (very important) and projects,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I was trying to say that they should reach out to project owners to gain Google experience. In no way was this statement related to working overtime and not getting paid. This was about opportunity and access.\u201d Ha also stressed that she was not responsible for Pygmalion after September 2017, when it moved to a new organization within Google and she started working on a different project. The Google spokeswoman said that it is company policy not to make any commitment about employment or conversion to temps, and that Googlers who manage temps are required to take a mandatory training on this and other policies related to TVCs. \u2018Why do it?\u2019 The disparity in wages and benefits between Google employees and contract workers is stark. Alphabet recently reported median pay of $246,804, and employees enjoy perks such as free meals, on-site yoga classes, free massages and generous benefits. Amid increasing activism by Googlers and contract workers, Google recently announced improved minimum standards for US-based contract workers, including a minimum of eight paid sick days, \u201ccomprehensive\u201d health insurance, and a minimum wage of at least $15 an hour by 2020. (A full-time job at that wage pays $31,200 a year; by comparison, Google charges its own employees $38,808 a year to place an infant in its onsite daycare facilities.) Wages for contract workers on the Pygmalion team are well above the new minimum standard, usually starting around $25 an hour for associate linguists and going up to $35 an hour for project managers. But contractors complain about subpar benefits and other indignities. The former project manager described Adecco\u2019s benefits plan as \u201cthe worst health insurance I have ever had\u201d. A current contract worker earning less than $60,000 annually said they were paying $180 each month in premiums for an individual plan with a $6,000 deductible. For families, the deductible is $12,000, according to documents reviewed by the Guardian. Google declined to comment on Adecco\u2019s pay and benefits. Googlers earn significantly more, and those on individual plans contribute between $0 and $53 for their health insurance and have a much lower deductible ($1,350), according to documents reviewed by the Guardian. Googlers with families pay up to $199 every two weeks, with a $2,700 deductible. Others complained of a lack of trust and respect. In 2018, Google revoked the ability for contractors on Pygmalion to work while riding Google\u2019s wifi-equipped commuter buses, creating frustration for those who spent three to four hours a day traveling to the company\u2019s Mountain View campus and could no longer work and count that time toward their shift. Google said it works to ensure that temps, vendors and contractors do not have over-broad access to sensitive internal information for security reasons. \u201cWhy do it?\u201d a former associate linguist said of working unpaid overtime under these conditions. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to lose the job. Having Google on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9 is important to a career \u2026 Later on, I came to find out that you can\u2019t say \u2018Google\u2019 on your r\u00e9sum\u00e9. You have to say \u2018Google by Adecco\u2019.\u201d A weekend assignment Both Google and Adecco recently launched investigations into the allegations of unpaid overtime in Pygmalion. \u201cOur policy is clear that all temporary workers must be paid for any overtime worked,\u201d said Eileen Naughton, Google\u2019s vice-president of people operations, in a statement to the Guardian. \u201cIf we find that anyone isn\u2019t properly paid, we make sure they are compensated appropriately and take action against any Google employee who violates this policy.\u201d The current investigation was initiated after the company received a report of a possible policy violation in February 2019, the Google spokeswoman said. The company will provide appropriate compensation if need be and will take action up to and including terminations if policy violations are found, she added. The spokeswoman also acknowledged that concerns about unpaid overtime were raised to human resources in 2017, but said that the company investigated and did not find any such cases at the time. \u201cWe are committed to ensuring all employees are compensated for all time worked,\u201d said Mary Beth Waddill, a spokeswoman for Adecco. \u201cOur longstanding policy is that every employee is required to report time accurately \u2013 even if that time isn\u2019t pre-approved \u2013 and they should feel encouraged to do so by their managers. If we learn that this is not the case, we will work with Google to take appropriate action.\u201d On Friday 17 May, Adecco sent emails to current and former Pygmalion temps. Recipients were asked whether they reported all the hours they worked, and, if not, to estimate how many hours they worked unpaid. The emails requested a response by Monday 20 May, though a Google spokeswoman said this week that the deadline has been extended. A Google employee reacted: \u201cThey\u2019re asking people to work on the weekend to recall unbilled overwork. It seems like it\u2019s designed to discourage people from responding.\u201d Indeed, one former contract worker who left the company many months ago said they received the email but did not bother to respond. \u201cAfter I left, I didn\u2019t keep records of the hours I worked,\u201d they said. \u201cEven if I wanted to report overtime now, how could I?\u201d This article was updated on 25 June to attribute the source of information about Linne Ha\u2019s firing from Google, to include the date when Ha ceased leading Pygmalion and to incorporate comment from Ha.
