There was no special memorial service planned for the 16 children and one teacher shot dead by Thomas Hamilton at Dunblane primary school. Classes took place as normal in the south Perthshire town's four schools, in accordance with a decision thought to have been taken following discussions with the affected families. A local minister, the Rev Colin McIntosh, who conducted several of the funeral services at Dunblane cathedral, said: \"The community as a whole decided that they would like to make it a quiet, peaceful time, and I would like to respect that.\" Ann Dickson, a local councillor both now and 10 years ago, said: \"Everyone just wants to get on with it now. This year is no different to last year or the one before that.\" Scotland's first minister, Jack McConnell, has written to the schools in Dunblane paying tribute to the \"strength and dignity\" of all those affected by the murders. The Scottish cabinet arranged for 17 white roses to be laid at the memorial garden in Dunblane, which was created in remembrance of the victims. The 16 children and their teacher Gwen Mayor were killed on March 13 1996 when Hamilton, a social misfit and loner obsessed with guns, burst into the school's gym and opened fire before shooting himself. Candles were lit all over the world on the first anniversary of the shootings, in 1997, after a request from the families, and hundreds of thousands of people signed petitions calling bans on handguns. Despite widespread opposition from the gun lobby, the government introduced tough gun controls in 1997. Today anti-gun campaigners used the anniversary to call for a national gun register to be introduced. The Gun Control Network (GCN), which includes relatives of those killed in the Hungerford massacre, said a register would track everyone who has a gun licence and those who have been judged unfit. The register was first proposed nine years ago, but still has not been introduced. Gill Marshall-Andrews, chair of GCN, said: \"Provision for a national database of gun owners was made in the first Firearms Amendment Act of 1997. It is indeed bizarre that nine years later the nation still waits. Is this incompetence or a lack of political will?\" Home Office minister Hazel Blears said the government was committed to setting up a firearms register. \"We remain absolutely committed to getting this firearms register,\" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme, adding that there had been difficulties with IT. She said: \"We do now have a system that is going to be trialled in May this year, and if that's successful, I expect it to be national within nine months.\" Ms Blears said Britain now had some of the toughest gun laws in the world. Crime statistics suggest, however, that while general levels of crime are falling, firearms incidents are increasing across the UK."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
