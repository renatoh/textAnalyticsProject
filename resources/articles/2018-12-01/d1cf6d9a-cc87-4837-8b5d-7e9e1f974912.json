Aboriginal people, of course, maintain a unique relationship with our coasts, one that stretches back into deep time. But surfing? Pundits can name a handful who\u2019ve made a mark in professional competition, like Robbie Page and the late Mark \u201cSanga\u201d Sainsbury, a young prodigy who lived in Darginung country at Avoca beach, and died tragically while surfing at the age of 26. Recent decades have seen the rise of surfers like John Craig, Dale Richards, and Otis Carey, a Gumbaynggirr and Bundjalung freesurfer and artist. This year, the Australian Indigenous surfing title at Bells Beach was won by a tall, powerful natural-footer named Soli Bailey. Soon after, he qualified for surfing\u2019s World Tour. An Indigenous athlete was back in surfing\u2019s limelight. Solamon Storm Bailey grew up in Byron Bay, home not only to Carey but also to world tour surfers Danny Wills and Kieren Perrow. Quiet but fiercely confident, Bailey dominated pro surfing\u2019s incubator tour, the Qualifying Series, with imperious surfing at the world\u2019s most iconic and intimidating waves, from Bells to Oahu\u2019s Sunset Beach, to Tahiti\u2019s menacing Teahupo\u2019o, and Peahi, the beautiful monster wave off Maui. At the Volcom Pro at Pipeline last year, Bailey again showed composure in big barrels on shallow reef, cruising past a host of champions including Adriano De Souza, Kelly Slater and local John John Florence. By then, people were talking. Where had this kid come from? Bailey identifies as \u201cBundjalung on my grandmother\u2019s side, from the Yaegl tribe around Coffs Harbour\u201d. He asserts his indigeneity in much the same way he surfs: with a plain sort of confidence. He has been photographed sailing through a blue sky on a board with the black, gold and red flag underneath. He wants to represent Australia in surfing at the Tokyo Olympics, and says \u201cthe next five years will be the best five years in Indigenous surfing history\u201d. Former pro surfer Rob Bain works for Bailey\u2019s major sponsor, O\u2019Neill. His reaction to the young surfer\u2019s qualification for the world tour goes well beyond the corporate line: \u201cI\u2019m passionate about Soli\u2019s connection through his indigenous roots,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cI\u2019m just stoked with this result.\u201d Robbie Page said via Facebook: \u201cHe is our greatest, and he\u2019s still building momentum. Indigenous king of the sea. Brought tears to my eyes.\u201d The Guardian spoke to Bailey on Oahu\u2019s North Shore, as he waited for the trials before the season-ending Pipeline Masters. Despite winning the Volcom Pro, Bailey insists Pipe experience is hard to come by. \u201cI haven\u2019t surfed the place a lot,\u201d he says. \u201cPaddling out there, and surfing it, are two completely different things. I\u2019ve spent a million hours out there since I was twelve, but I\u2019ve had maybe only thirty good barrels over that time. It\u2019s a full-on crowd - it\u2019s hard to grasp the difficulty.\u201d Yes, twelve years old. Bailey\u2019s first trip to Hawaii was with former world champion Barton Lynch. \u201cHe brought me over for a month. I was terrified, though he didn\u2019t subject me to the really serious waves.\u201d Casting his eye over the contest schedule for 2019, Bailey won\u2019t limit himself to the fabled barrel venues. \u201cI\u2019m looking at the whole year,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom past experience on the QS and the junior tour, you just don\u2019t know where you\u2019ll perform well. Bells is special to me because of its Aboriginal background, Snapper because it\u2019s the start of the year and it\u2019s near home. But Teahupo\u2019o is among the heaviest barreling waves on the planet, and I love getting barreled. And then you\u2019ve got that rich history at J-Bay \u2026 I can\u2019t wait.\u201d When asked about his strengths, Bailey nominates big waves and barrels. Then he stops, backtracks apologetically. \u201cHang on, don\u2019t say that. That makes me sound like a \u2026 nah.\u201d It\u2019s the curious mix of self-assurance and humility that others have commented on. He\u2019s a likeable guy. The difficulty with Bailey\u2019s assertion that indigenous surfing is entering a golden age is that right now, he\u2019s the figurehead. Does he feel the pressure? \u201cIt\u2019s a big burden, yes, but that\u2019s exciting to me, not frightening. \u201cI want to push it, show the youth it\u2019s a great career and you can excel and connect with it. That\u2019s why any surfer gets in the water \u2013 the connection with the ocean, the time to yourself, even if you\u2019re with friends.\u201d If there are cynics, trolls of the AFL boundary-line variety, Bailey has already tuned them out. \u201cI\u2019m all about positivity. I haven\u2019t seen any negativity, but then again I\u2019m not looking for it.\u201d He\u2019s more inclined to look to the Polynesian Hawaiians like Sunny Garcia and Zeke Lau for inspiration. \u201cWhen I come to Hawaii I have a connection here. It feels warm, and I\u2019m at home and it flows. I\u2019ve never talked to those guys about being an Indigenous role model specifically, but I see the way they represent, their pride. I want to do something similar.\u201d Bailey spent an afternoon recently in Sydney with Adam Goodes. \u201cHe\u2019s a national hero for the Aboriginal community. For everyone, really. He said to me, \u2018there\u2019s a lot of pressures you\u2019ve just got work out for yourself.\u2019\u201d Could those pressures include the need to speak out politically, now he has an international platform? \u201cI\u2019m still pretty young,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m focused on my competitive career. But if I have an opinion I\u2019m not afraid to say it. If things are wrong, I want to see them put right. Adam said to me \u2018you have to accept that\u2019s going to happen and you\u2019ll make a decision whether to speak out \u2013 and until then, keep doing what you\u2019re doing.\u2019\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
