That\u2019s relatively successful as in relatively unsuccessful. Smoking tends to be a binary choice: you\u2019re either smoking or not smoking. It was possible the prime minister was signalling a new relativism in social policy \u2013 \u201cCongratulations on cutting down your shoplifting from five days a week to just two. Here\u2019s a gold badge\u201d \u2013 but it\u2019s more likely he hadn\u2019t given much thought to what he had actually said. On second thoughts, scrap that first sentence. Not even the spirit was particularly willing in the last prime minister\u2019s questions before Christmas. Jeremy Corbyn began the session half asleep and had to be nudged into action. \u201cMerry Christmas everyone,\u201d he said. David Cameron had also nodded off. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say season\u2019s greetings, I\u2019m going to wish everyone merry Christmas,\u201d he replied before walking over to the nativity scene by the speaker\u2019s chair and ostentatiously kissing the baby Jesus. \u201cActually, I did say merry Christmas,\u201d Corbyn interrupted, himself rushing off to the nativity scene and kissing the baby Jesus and the Virgin Mary. Being seen to enjoy Christmas is now a recognised political sport, with the loser officially deemed to be a threat to the fabric of British society. In parliament, Christmas is far too serious a business to be enjoyed. Once the Great British Christmas-Off was over, Corbyn turned his attention to the NHS. In particular, the potential winter NHS crisis and the lack of funding in A&amp;E. Dave\u2019s attention was still elsewhere. \u201cHospital stays have gone down from 5.5 days to 5.0 days under this government,\u201d he recited absent-mindedly. He announced this as if it was some kind of achievement, rather than a sign hospital wards were now so full that doctors had taken to throwing anyone with a better than 50-50 chance of survival out on the street. \u201cAnyway,\u201d he declared petulantly, \u201cI don\u2019t really want to talk about hospitals and stuff. I want to talk about the unemployment figures.\u201d Cameron didn\u2019t really want to talk about them either. What he actually wanted to talk about most of all was Maj Tim Peake and the new Star Wars film. It wasn\u2019t entirely clear if Dave knows that Maj Tim is a real person and not some character riding shotgun with Luke Skywalker. When he\u2019s home alone watching Where Eagles Dare for the 364th time, Dave sees himself as a lone commando behind enemy lines, heroically defending the country in the face of near impossible odds. It\u2019s one of the things about him that makes so many people nervous about our involvement in overseas military engagements. There isn\u2019t a director to say \u201ccut\u201d. Quite the opposite. Conservative Oliver Dowden, who spent much of his time preparing Cameron for PMQs in the last parliament and was rewarded for his incompetence with a safe seat, was more than happy to indulge Dave\u2019s fantasies. \u201cLet\u2019s talk a bit more about Star Wars that was made in my constituency,\u201d he said encouragingly. \u201cChocks away,\u201d Dave whooped. \u201cLike many people I can\u2019t wait to see the new Star Wars documentary. May the force be with me.\u201d George Osborne tried to calm Dave down by handing him his Christmas present 10 days early. Dave tore at the wrapping paper to reveal his very own planet-destroying Death Star. \u201cWe\u2019ve looked at other renewable energies and obviously we remain totally committed to them,\u201d he burbled, \u201cbut the thing is that they don\u2019t work nearly as well as nukes, turbo lasers, proton torpedos.\u201d Dave pulled out a lightsaber. \u201cOver there,\u201d he said, pointing at the Labour benches, \u201cis the Dark Side.\u201d The punchline was so laboured no one even bothered to groan. Not that Dave cared. He was lost in a galaxy far, far away."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
