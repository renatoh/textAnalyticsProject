Just like thousands of kids across Australia, she\u2019d come home from school every day and watch YouTube videos of players doing tricks, then go outside and practise until she mastered them. It didn\u2019t matter where she was or what the field looked like \u2014 whether it was outdoors, indoors, or in her backyard\u2014as long as she had a ball at her feet. But when she was 21, that dream came crashing down. \u201cI had two strokes, so I lost the use of my arm and my leg. I had to learn to stand up again, sit up straight, to walk; I couldn\u2019t do any of that,\u201d Christodoulou said. \u201cThe first time the physio came to my room they said, \u2018You need to set a goal, something to work towards\u2019. My goal was to be able to play football again. I didn\u2019t even think about walking, I just wanted to play. Now I\u2019m here, and it means a lot to me, it makes me emotional whenever I think about it.\u201d \u201cHere\u201d is the 2019 National Cerebral Palsy Football Championships, which took place in Sydney in October. Nicole, alongside her friends Matilda Mason and Tahlia Blanshard, were three of five women invited to play in the tournament for the very first time. It\u2019s a sign of the rapid progress women\u2019s cerebral palsy football is making around the country. Their entry-points into football have been as varied as their life experiences. While Nicole has been playing her whole life, Matilda and Tahlia only took up the sport recently after being invited by fellow players or members of the Cerebral Palsy Alliance, who run gala days in a number of major cities. \u201cLast year, the CP Alliance offered for me to go to a football gala day and I laughed. I didn\u2019t go,\u201d Blanshard said. \u201cA few months after that, December of last year, [Football NSW] had a come-and-try day. I rocked up with a singlet, tights, no boots, no shin pads, and joggers. Ever since then, I\u2019ve been training for football.\u201d These women aren\u2019t new to the world of sport, though. Blanshard represented Australia in swimming at the Cerebral Palsy World Games in 2018 and is part of the Australian Development Team, while Mason found her way into the game after playing hockey and doing kickboxing. But football is now moving ahead of the curve when it comes to providing team opportunities for people with cerebral palsy. Not only are platforms like the championships becoming more common, but the growing social network means more prospective players are taking part \u2014 and these women are at the centre of that push. \u201cI love it to pieces,\u201d said Mason, who travels two hours each way to train in Perth. \u201cI appreciate it so much, all the opportunities and the people I\u2019ve met, not just in WA but now over here. I\u2019ve grown the passion to help Brad [Scott, current Pararoo] to broaden it to females, and then also to regional communities. We want to bring the next generation in, and I don\u2019t think any of us will give up until that happens.\u201d Christodoulou agreed: \u201cI feel like maybe I\u2019m the chosen one, so that I can inspire people. I know both worlds, so I can help as many people as I can, not just through sport but through everything: their daily lives, their confidence levels, and believing in themselves. It\u2019s not easy having a disability, especially if it\u2019s invisible. A lot of the time you can\u2019t see it, you can\u2019t see what goes on in people\u2019s heads, or what people feel.\u201d The two main themes of our conversation were exposure and education, both for people with cerebral palsy and for the able-bodied people around them. Football programs like those run through the Pararoos Development Centre, Football NSW and the Cerebral Palsy Alliance provide a space for conversations around what representation, support and success in sport can mean for people with disabilities. \u201cI do a lot of stuff with the CP Alliance,\u201d Blanshard said. \u201cEvery single day someone always asks, \u2018Can we play football now?\u2019. I can\u2019t wait to be able to go up to those kids and say, \u2018Yeah, you can go play football now\u2019. There\u2019s girls and boys, but even the boys didn\u2019t know there were opportunities to do CP football. \u201cI don\u2019t even mind what sport they go into. Whether they come up to me and say, \u2018I want to do football\u2019, or \u2018I want to do swimming\u2019\u2019, or \u2018I want to be able to have friends with CP\u2019\u2019, or \u2018I want to know, how did you get through school? How did you do your homework?\u2019. \u201cIt is the case that the sports have given me the opportunity to start conversations with people I never would have met in any other way. It\u2019s important that the kids see it, because on [bad] days, those are the ones where it\u2019s easiest to feel like you\u2019re the one that\u2019s different. Suddenly they think, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m having a bad day, but I\u2019m still going to run out, I\u2019m still going to kick that ball, I\u2019m still going to go and jump in the pool\u2019, and all of a sudden, that is something that brings them joy.\u201d Football Federation Australia has taken up the call for better support and exposure of cerebral palsy football, providing increased funding through the national teams\u2019 new CBA and organising for the Pararoos to play their first international game on home soil since the 2000 Paralympics last Saturday, which was also live-streamed on Kayo. Christodoulou and Blanshard were there, cheering on their friends from the stands, wishing it could be them representing the Paratildas. It\u2019s a goal well within reach as the International Federation of CP Football plans to host its first Women\u2019s World Cup in Barcelona next year. \u201cI think the magic word is awareness \u2026 awareness, communication, put it out on social media, put it out on the TV,\u201d Blanshard said. \u201cLet the world know that stuff happens and you don\u2019t have to be the top of your sport to be able to do these things. We were so lucky to get this opportunity, but we\u2019re not superstars. We\u2019re still just fairly ordinary women with CP that just fell in love with the sport.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re human too, we deserve a chance,\u201d Christodoulou said. \u201cIt\u2019s a way for us to get our story out to the kids as well, to inspire them. I was discriminated against a lot, and I\u2019m sure all the people here have been discriminated against a lot because of their disability. \u201cTell your story to these kids, that\u2019ll keep them going. It\u2019ll change a lot of lives, not just one, or your own. Sometimes the people around you are your inspirations.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
