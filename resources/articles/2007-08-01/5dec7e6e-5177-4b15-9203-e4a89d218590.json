This American trio find old slide collections in thrift stores and garage sales and write songs to go with them. Dad Jason sings (and plays guitar and keyboards) accompanied on bass and drums by 13 year-old daughter Rachel. Mum Tina operates the slide projector and designs the sets and costumes. It's like a cross between the Partridge Family and Frank Zappa. No wonder David Cross is a fan. What makes them so enjoyable is that they're entirely genuine: a real family and completely guileless. \"Everything we do is without irony,\" Jason told the San Francisco Chronicle. Like all really good ideas, it's so simple that the only puzzle is why nobody thought of it before. \u00b7 Green Room, Edinburgh, Sat 25 &amp; Sun 26; Soho Theatre, W1, Thu 30 to Sep 15 Hattie Hayridge Edinburgh Science fiction anoraks may still recognise her from Red Dwarf, but before her role as Holly The Computer in that classic sci-fi sitcom, Hattie Hayridge was already a fine stand-up comic and now, for the first time in eight years, she's back in Edinburgh. It's a far cry from her Festival debut, some 20 years ago. She answered an advert in The Stage to appear in a Fringe play - but it turned out to be an experiment by a psychology student to see how they'd get on. Since the play was dire, they got on very badly, though it was a lot better after the psychologist went home. However she soon became an established act, with a flair for one-liners and a humane sense of fun. If you can't see her in Edinburgh, hunt down her warm and witty autobiography, Random Abstract Memory. It's a gem. \u00b7 Underbelly, Sat 25 &amp; Sun 26 Wil Hodgson Edinburgh Wil Hodgson calls Chippenham \"a man's town\", but this description of his hometown isn't much of a compliment. Despite his beefy build and his associations with skinheads and wrestlers, Hodgson is firmly in touch with his feminine side. He stopped being a skinhead because he was too fond of Care Bears. Mind you, he's not camp - he's just someone who understands (and articulates) what we all sense deep down, that we're all a mix of masculine and feminine. It was after a sticky gig in Brighton that Hodgson really began to talk about himself, after Jimmy Carr told him he was telling more entertaining stories in the dressing room than he was on stage. It was good advice, and Hodgson took it. The best stand-up is autobiographical, and with his sense of who he is, Hodgson is one of the best stand-ups in the land. \u00b7 Pleasance Courtyard, Sat 25 to Mon 27"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
