Trump has been tweeting again, and this time, his \u201cflexibly\u201d spelt vitriol was aimed at the Morning Joe talk show hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough who he accused of trying to hang out with him at some New Year do. Trump tweeted about Brzezinski: \u201cShe was bleeding badly from a facelift. I said no.\u201d The Morning Joe hosts have now questioned Trump\u2019s mental state \u2026 meh, who hasn\u2019t? Has Trump got an issue with women and blood? Many will recall his previous haemoglobin-themed rant about the TV journalist, Megyn Kelly (\u201cBlood coming out of her wherever\u201d), when she had the temerity to ask him questions. So, while Kelly was depicted as belligerently menstruating, Brzezinski, four years older, was denigrated for bleeding from plastic surgery wounds. Tellingly, Scarborough managed to do the decent (male) thing and not bleed at all. Basically, with Trump and women, it\u2019s all about blood, blood and more blood, gushing everywhere, like a lady-version of the lift scene in The Shining. If ever there was a tiny clue that a man has a big problem with women, this surely is it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
