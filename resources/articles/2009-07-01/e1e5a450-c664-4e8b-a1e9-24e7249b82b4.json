All of the climate prediction models suggest we're on the worst-case trajectory, and some cases worse than the worst case. That's my depressing take on it.\" So what is he doing to help? Building a new super-sustainable HQ for his newspapers perhaps? Alas not. For his master plan to transform Fortress Wapping into a \"news publishing campus\" to sinuous designs by Amanda Levete - architect of the UFO-shaped media centre at Lord's and the blobby, sequin-clad Selfridges in Birmingham - have been attacked by the mayor of London's planners, who said the project's approach to biodiversity and climate change mitigation was not up to scratch. Not enough solar panels, apparently. The landscaping, furthermore, represented \"a missed opportunity\" to help the birds and bees. Daddy won't be pleased. He has ordered News Corp to become carbon-neutral. We won't tell if you won't. \u2022 Daily more evidence confronts us that things are hard and getting harder. The economy is worse than we ever imagined it could be. For graduates, the outlook is bleak. They need to be open to offers, and though it's just part-time, there is a little something on the Arts Council website that might suit. \"Boris Johnson Lookalike Wanted. For major TV project,\" it says. \u00a310,000 to \u00a315,000 pro rata, but don't dally. Casting next week. \u2022 Isn't it good to see the National Archives, sleepy repository of documentary history from the Domesday Book onwards, at one with Gordon's bold plans for Building Britain's Future? As the PM made his announcement, director Natalie Ceeney was telling staff how the brave new world will operate. To better serve the public, they will, she said, close the entire building one day a week. The internet is always there. Get with the programme. Closed is the new open. Less is more. \u2022 Good is Bad. The late Michael Jackson taught us that. And as the tributes flood in, all of us remembers the King of Pop in our own way. Some play the CDs, others just remember; but in Birchington-on-Sea in Kent, where John Worrow is carving his niche as an ambitious Conservative parish councillor, they are going one better - with a Michael Jackson tribute competition. Entrants can imitate \"the Young Michael\", the \"Older Michael\", \"The Jackson Five\" or make a mark in the \"Michael non lookalike, music tribute\" category. John will handle the auditions, for he is Birchington's Simon Cowell. He will also be joint compere; Cowell with a hint of Brucie. They have many talents there that the just-departed would have appreciated. Speed off the mark is just one of them. \u2022 Finally, what now for the berth that is the Oxford University poetry professorship? Of course, the glamour has been dimmed by the dirty tricks row which forced Ruth Padel to drop out, having poisoned the well for Derek Walcott. And yet, and yet, the post must be filled. So will it be a shoo-in for Clive James? Maybe not. For there is a plan to persuade Felix Dennis - the extrovert publisher, ex-convict and environmentalist whose drunken thoughts so easily turn to murder - to seek the post many feel is rightly his. The plotters, we shall not out them yet, see in Dennis a body of work worth highlighting and a character well able to popularise poetry for the common man. Here is a verse from his masterwork on MPs' expenses, Ordure on the Farm. Savour it if you will. \"All our MPs had a farm - spouting all day long, And on that farm they had some pigs - let's all sing their song: With an oink-oink here, And a flip-flip there, Here an oink, there a flip - now I own a second home! We all work so jolly hard - we've done nothing wrong. Hear, hear!\" Neither Walcott or Padel could have written that. This is fortune; opportunity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
