Current models, predominantly 'man goes for walk with shovel', are no longer thought to suit the modern theatre of war. We can expect some impressive sets of initials to replace the most famous in the English-speaking world - WC. The CPEL, or Collectively Protected Expeditionary Latrine, for example, will protect the user from chemical and biological attack - obviously a permanent anxiety to the service man or woman. Less secure, but intended for 'theatres of operation' is the Modular Initial Deployment Latrine, or MIDL, which can service 25 troops apiece. There are others, but talk of theatres has our mind wandering to the facilities in Britain's entertainment halls where entire audiences are expected to find, queue for and use around four cubicles in one 20-minute interval. We recently joined a queue in the Albert Hall with 5,000 other promenaders, most of whom we'd met buying drinks in the many bars. Lord Foster, your country needs you. A few MIDLs would, we believe, make a great contribution to British life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
