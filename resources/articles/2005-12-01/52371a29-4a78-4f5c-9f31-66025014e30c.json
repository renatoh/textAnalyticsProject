Paul Taylor, 20, who drove an ice axe into the 18-year-old student's head, must serve at least 23 years and eight months of his mandatory life sentence. Taylor's 17-year-old cousin Michael Barton, brother of the Manchester City footballer Joey Barton, must serve a minimum of 17 years and eight months for the murder in Huyton, Merseyside, in July. Sentencing the pair at Preston crown court, sitting in Liverpool, Mr Justice Leveson said they had carried out a \"terrifying ambush\" and a \"racist attack of a type poisonous to any civilised society\". Barton, who initiated the confrontation and supplied the axe, was yesterday convicted of the murder. Taylor admitted murder on November 15, just before he was about to go on trial. Today, sentencing the pair, the judge told them: \"You took from Anthony Walker his most precious possession, that is to say his life and all it held for him. He was a young man of enormous promise, lost in a moment. \"You have damaged forever the lives of those who loved him. Further, you have destroyed your own lives and affected the lives of all who are dear to you.\" Mr Justice Leveson told Taylor he accepted that he did not start the confrontation but said that he \"quickly allied [himself] to it\". He said that if Taylor had not driven his car to find Mr Walker and his friends after the initial confrontation at a bus stop outside the Huyton pub, the tragedy would never have happened. He also accused Taylor of having \"a streak of loutish lack of control\". He told Barton that although he did not wield the axe, he was jointly responsible for the murder. \"You knew what you intended to do as you drove searching out your quarries and you crept into the park with evil on your mind,\" the judge said. Before passing sentence, the judge was told that Taylor was \"horrified\" at what he had done and wanted to apologise to Mr Walker's family. Andrew Menary QC, defending Taylor, said his client had been \"consistently under the influence of cannabis\" at the time of the killing. David Steer QC, defending Barton, said the most relevant features of his mitigation were his youth and lack of intelligence. Mr Steer also asked to be taken into consideration the fact that Barton had no previous convictions, did not inflict the fatal injury and did not intend to kill Mr Walker. In explaining how he calculated the minimum tariffs, Mr Justice Leveson said the starting point for Taylor was 30 years. The minimum for an adult convicted of murder is 15 years but this doubles if the killing is racist. The judge said the murder was racially aggravated and premeditated but Taylor received credit for his guilty plea, which the judge said \"required real courage\". The tariff was also reduced because of Taylor's young age and limited intellectual capacity; the judge also accepted the intention was to cause serious harm rather than to kill. Because Barton is a juvenile, the starting point for his tariff was 12 years, and there is no automatic doubling for racial motivation. During the mitigation hearing, counsel for Barton revealed that Taylor had carried out the killing after being released early from a young offenders' centre. Taylor was jailed in October 2004 for burglary and given a 21-month sentence but served less than a third of it and was released in February this year, four months before the murder. After sentencing today, Taylor showed no reaction as he was led from the dock. Barton also showed no reaction other than nodding to members of his family as he was taken down. The murder trial heard that the fatal blow was so fierce it drove the axe more than two inches into the victim's skull. Mr Walker, who hoped to become a lawyer, died in hospital five hours after the attack. Mr Walker's mother, Gee, saw the axe sticking out of his head in hospital and was at his side when he died. After Barton was convicted yesterday, she spoke with powerful dignity about her family's loss and said she would forgive her son's killers. Speaking outside the court today, she said: \"Justice is done; it is within the justice system.\" \"I just hope and pray they use this time to reflect on what they've done.\" Asked whether she believed Taylor's expression of remorse, she said: \"I have to. I admire him for that ... his mum must have instilled some goodness in him.\" Detective Superintendent Peter Currie, who led the murder inquiry, said the sentences were \"within the guidelines\", and that he believed they would send out a message of deterrence. \"It is a substantial proportion of their lives ... the message has been sent out to the community: we will not accept it,\" he added. Yesterday, an investigation was launched after racist graffiti was daubed near the scene of Mr Walker's murder shortly after Barton's conviction."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
