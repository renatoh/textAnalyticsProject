Let's get to the basis of the tirade - simmering resentment in England that the Celts, particularly those in Scotland, appear to be gorging on an economic cake whose ingredients and creation are attributable solely to the English and particularly the southern English. But it is not the inflation-prone South which has kept the British economy afloat these past 30 years. It is North Sea oil. So, would southerners rather continue with a (disputed) \u00a32 billion 'subsidy' or lose several billion pounds of North Sea oil income? Walter Roberts Edinburgh \u00b7 Andrew Rawnsley's column bemoaning over-representation of Celts in Cabinet made no mention of Britain's other Celtic nation - Cornwall. In the week that John Prescott announced three referendums for regional assemblies in the north of England, the people of Cornwall were denied a referendum on the issue of a Cornish Assembly. This is despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the Cornish electorate have signed individual declarations calling for their own Assembly. I trust Mr Rawnsley will investigate further this failure of the centralised democratic system in Britain. Cllr Dick Cole Party Leader, Mebyon Kernow (Party for Cornwall), Cornwall \u00b7 Andrew Rawnsley's denigration of Celtic aspirations for Cabinet seats and maintaining Welsh and Scottish Offices in London betrays a lack of understanding of the problems of Wales and Scotland or the gulf in job opportunities, GDP etc, between London and its own English regions. Statistics show that disparity between the south east of England and other UK regions is, at 33 per cent, the worst in Europe, worse even than Italy with its endemic disparity between north and south. Wales also pays \u00a370 million annually from the Wales Assembly budget to match European Union grant money because the Treasury refuses to pay their share. When Wales is allowed a properly empowered government to tackle problems bequeathed to it by successive London governments, that will be the opportune moment for us to forgo our demand for political presence, albeit temporarily, in London.
