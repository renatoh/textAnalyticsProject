Their snooze-fest against Liverpool was dire in every respect. In fact the most notable effort on target (there were two, by the way) was a back-header at the Liverpool goal. Does tonight promise to be any different? Well, ITV aren't banking on it - hence this game is being shown on ITV 4, a station I wasn't even aware existed until ten minutes ago when a frantic call to the facilities dept revealed that it can be found on channel 12 of the GU tellies. At that Chelsea v Liverpool game there was a man, very close to where I was sat in the cheap seats, who spent the entire game shouting abuse at the Chelsea side. He picked on Frank Lampard first, and spent a good 15 minutes screaming, \"WORK LAMPARD!\" at the midfielder. Then, seemingly at random, he transferred his attacks systematically onto the rest of the team, every time screaming the same thing. Eventually he settled, somewhat unfairly, on the tireless Nicolas Anelka, until the Frenchman was subbed late in the second half. The irony of the situation was that, when the shouty-man wasn't urging the team on the pitch to work, he was talking to his mate about how his dole money wasn't going far enough... Anyway, shouty-man can yell himself senseless tonight as the object of his abuse, Anelka, will be spending a good proportion of the 90 minutes dressed in a track suit and peering out from under a woolly hat on the bench. Team news: Olympiakos: Nikopolidis, Zewlakow, Julio Cesar, Antzas, Pantos, Ledesma, Galletti, Torosidis, Djordjevic, Stoltidis, Kovacevic. Subs: Sifakis, Patsatzoglou, Leonardo, Leonel Nunez, Mitroglou, Belluschi, Sisic. Chelsea: Cech, Belletti, Carvalho, Alex, Ashley Cole, Essien, Makelele, Ballack, Malouda, Drogba, Joe Cole. Subs: Cudicini, Lampard, Obi, Kalou, Wright-Phillips, Terry, Anelka. Referee: Konrad Plautz (Austria) The pitch: in Greece was, until recently, covered in snow after some freak snowfall in Athens over the last few days. It's currently piled up on the side of the pitch, which makes for an odd sight at a Greek game. Olympiakos, for their part, will play defensively tonight, trying to squeeze out a win, which means this should be a riot. They seem to have given up on their policy of signing has-beens as well - the likes of Rivaldo and Karembeu for example - so may have the legs, and lack of flair, which with to do grind out their mirthless victory. Chelsea, on the other hand, are going without both John Terry and Frank Lampard (who scored twice at the weekend) which doesn't bode well defensively as Alex still looks fragile. The midfield should flourish though, as Ballack has been like a reformed man without his midfield partner cramping his style. Essien, too, could well be more potent without having to cover back so much. My prediction: it's going to be 1-1, isn't it? And that's if we're lucky. Pre-match emails: \"Olympiakos scored 11 goals in the Group Stage so maybe they can put Alex to the test,\" emails Art Durbano. \"They'd better; they shipped seven in that Group Stage and if they sit back, little SWP is going to score the most boring hat trick in Big Cup history. Also: don't take this the wrong way, but shouldn't a man your age have a more dignified e-mail address?\" Well, SWP isn't playing but I can't see Chelsea running riot, somehow. It's just not in their nature when playing away in Europe. And, secondly, for all you know I could be 12. \"So, did you get this match by drawing the short straw or making one of your bosses mad?\" asks George Templeton. Actually, George - and I'm expecting this to open up a flood of abuse - I'm a Chelsea fan. Still, I'll do my best to keep this neutral. If only because I don't think there's ever been a more unpopular club to support. Not even United fans get the sort of raised eyebrows and drawn out sighs Chelsea fans receive. We're off: Chelsea are in bright yellow and the commentary team are Peter Drury and David Pleat. I'll reserve judgement on that particular pairing, but only because Mr Pleat works for this here company. Essien has an early, long-range pop across the face of goal, by the way. 3 min: Much knocking the ball about to little avail. There's a thin mist from the pre-game fireworks hanging low over the ground too, against which the Chelsea strip sings out like a beacon. Eventually, Ballack earns a corner after shepherding a ball over the line. 5 min: Djordjevic has a shot, which pings a Chelsea foot and, like their opposition before them, they do little with the corner they earn. 7 min: Zewlakow swings in a corner but it's headed clear to Joe Cole. He goes down over an Olympiakos leg and earns a soft free-kick. The Greek side win it back and start knocking it about among themselves well. Chelsea have been, to some extent, chasing shadows - albeit misty ones. 9 min: Djordjevic plays through a delightful, one-touch ball into the box for Stoltidis. The left-footer makes an absolute meal of it, though, since it fell to his right. It's hoofed clear but Drogba can't quite break. Djordjevic has been very bright so far. 11 min: Essien tries to put a cross in but doesn't beat the first man. \"Surely only Chelsea fans are watching this? Anfield has the air of the Coliseum - splendid,\" writes the ubiquitous Gary Naylor. Given the paucity of emails so far, I'd agree with your first point, Gary. 13 min: Ballack launches an attack up the left, he flicks it to Malouda, who back-heels it through to Drogba who storms into the box ... so the ref blows up for a foul on Ballack, ignoring the advantage. Instead of sending the ball into the box though, Joe Cole elects to pass it along the ground to an Olympiakos defender. Hmmm. 14 min: Pantos beats Joe Cole, who is covering in the right back slot because Belletti has gone AWOL. Eventually Belletti gets back, so Pantos beats him too for good measure. His shot, though, hits one of his own players and rebounds back to Chelsea. 16 min: Drogba puts the ball into the box and the Olympiakos defence fanny about with it just long enough to get the ball to Malouda who stings the keepers gloves with a ground-skimming shot. \"Your prediction is wrong...it will only be 0-0,\" writes the reverse-named Robinson Howard. You may be right Howard, or Robinson, or whatever. Chelsea are unbeaten in 15 and the Greeks are unbeaten in 16. 18 min: Alex does his best to make life difficult. A cross comes into the area and, completely unchallenged, he skims it over his head rather than making the simple back-header that was needed. Carvalho mops up. Both teams are playing one up-front, by the way, which should tell you all you need to know about the quality of football here. 21 min: Belletti is knocked over about 30 metres out. The right-back fires it in and, from Malouda's flick, Carvalho heads it straight at the keeper. He was offside, but only just. 23 min: Chelsea try to juggle the ball into the box, first Belletti, then Ballack, then Joe Cole flick it about between themselves but Cole can't get a shot away. Most of Chelsea's good work is being done down the left. Malouda, though, hasn't quite got his crossing boots on yet. 25 min: Quick free-kick played in by Djordjevic and Galletti nearly got on the end of it ahead of the Chelsea defence. Cech came out just in time, though. Kovacevic, by the way, has spent much of this game running into Chelsea players, falling over, then earning free-kicks. Drogba, meanwhile, is limping about the pitch in worrying fashion. 27 min: Ah, it's OK. The Chelsea medical dept have chucked Drogba a bandage and told him to get on with it. That's the sort of medical team that Roman Abramovich's millions buy you. 29 min: Makelele plays a good ball to Cole on the right and he sends Drogba into the box with a slick through-ball. The striker didn't really exhibit his normal pace and strength to get to it though, so Olympiakos take it off him and up the other end to earn a corner. From it, Stoltidis flashes a header across the face of the goal. All it needed was a touch to knock it in. 31 min: Again, Chelsea break up the left - this time through Ballack. Pantos makes a robust challenge and, from the throw-in, Drogba chances his arm - or foot, more precisely - from outside the box. It's a tame effort, though, that old man Nikopolidis catches easily. Peter Drury has just said this is very watchable, which means he's got something else on his telly. 34 min: \"1-0 all the way, Ballack 43rd minute,\" reckons James Martin, who may or may not be the 'celebrity' chef who prances about on a Saturday morning. 36 min: The temperature of the tackles has been going up a notch (if that's not a ludicrous analogy). Makelele has been putting it about a bit and then Alex goes in feet first and flattens two Olympiakos players. \"Oooff,\" they say in unison, so Alex gets a yellow card to go with his yellow shirt. 38 min: Olympiakos break and, for a minute, it's four on four. Galletti's cross-field ball started it and then Djordjevic thumped in a tasty cross. Alex does a reverse-superman and hoofs it behind - his feet-first dive connecting with the ball this time - for a corner. Drogba clears. 40 min: Makelele does something he's never done before. He takes the ball just over the halfway line and shoots. From the top of my head, he's scored once for Chelsea - and that was a penalty that he had to knock in at the second attempt - and his effort goes some way to supporting that fact. It nearly hits the corner flag as it dobbles along. 41 min: Here comes the 43rd minute, James. Will Ballack score? 42 min: Free-kick flashed into the box by Belletti... Ballack can't connect. Maybe he's saving himself ... 44 min: Ah. The disappointment is almost tangible. Stick to the cooking, James. 45 min: \"Ballack will not score in this game, nor in the return leg,\" says Howard, or Robinson, or whatever, putting the nail in James Martin's point. \"Robinson is the first name,\" he adds clearing up that little conundrum. Not much happening on the pitch, save a long range cross from Olympiakos. Half-time: 0-0 and who would have guessed? \"I wonder if Avram Grant can see how well Ballack is playing with Lampard not on the pitch?,\" writes George Templeton. \"I think the Liverpool match proved conclusively that a Ballack-Lampard midfield for Chelsea makes as much sense as a Gerrard-Lampard midfield did for England.\" That's a point I agree with wholeheartedly, George. I don't think it's any coincidence that Ballack has been putting in his best performances for Chelsea at exactly the point when Lampard has been out of the time for a while. Essien did exactly the same thing previously. Lampard, in my opinion, makes it hard for anyone to play with him because he doesn't do enough covering in the midfield. Apology to Maka dept: \"How could you possibly forget Makelele's stunning 30-yard volley against Spurs last season?\" scream approximately 50 emails in my account. Sorry to him, Julian Menz, Aidan Jackson-Evans, Lee Middleton and Michael Gainsford who are all, rightly apoplectic. Well Maka might not be, to be fair. He hasn't taken the trouble to email. Peep, peep: No changes for either side. \"I think I've seen Olympiakos' keeper before,\" writes Jack Goodson before winding himself up for a pay-off ... wait for it ... here it comes ... \"Wasn't he big during the silent film era?\" Ka boom! Chelsea win a corner which is headed back out to Malouda. He sends it whistling - well, about 20 feet - over the bar. 48 min: Bit of a scramble just outside the Chelsea box. The ball is played into Kovacevic, who falls on the floor rather than make use of the bungling between Carvalho and Alex. In response, Chelsea take the piss - Ballack, Cole and Malouda spend 30 seconds simply chipping the ball over the Olympiakos players' heads. Pointless but fun. 50 min: Stoltidis puts in a great cross to Galletti, the only Olympiakos player in the box. It's centimetres over his head but, were he to have connected, that almost certainly would have been a goal. The Chelsea defence were all ball chasing. 53 min: Chelsea have certainly been more dominant so far this half. The tactic, though, seems to be of the long-ball to the box variety. Ashley Cole has barely ventured into the Olympiakos half so far, which hardly suggests attacking intent. 55 min: Ballack dribbles it to the edge of the Olympiakos box, after beating a strong challenge. His threaded ball doesn't quite make it to Drogba though. Cole pounces on the rebound, charges to within about five yards of the byline and puts over a cross. Despite the ball clearly not crossing the line the ref gives a goal kick. 57 min: Belletti gets kicked inside the box and goes down. The referee awards the free-kick Olympics' way for no good reason. Up the other end, Belletti scythes down Galletti (I think) viciously and is awarded a yellow card. Djordjevic gets on the end of the free-kick and fires the first on-target shot of the game at Cech, who saves. Classic stuff, eh? 59 min: Bah! writes James Martin, or words to that effect. \"I had 20 quid on Ballack, oh well. Its 4.40am here in China now,\" he adds, apropos of nothing. Do the Chinese have quids, James? 61 min: So far, and I may well be wrong (given the Makelele comment) Drogba is yet to touch the ball this half. Ballack doesn't aid things much by driving up the pitch and failing to pass it to him. The Olympiakos fans, meanwhile, have unleashed a terrifying torrent of boos and whistles as the Chelsea side just knock it about between themselves. It sounds like a hive of very angry, very big bees. Frightening. 63 min: Malouda jumps up arms first and flattens Zewlakow. Makelele has several angry words with the ref about it, as do Drogba and Ballack. Makelele is given a yellow card though, before Chelsea clear the free-kick with ease. A period of Chelsea possession is greeted with the angry bees treatment again. 65 min: Pantos puts in a high cross that loops over the Chelsea defenders. Galletti stands at the back of the box and has about 20 minutes to set himself before slicing it with the outside of his boot. It goes just over and just wide. Good effort, if accidental. 67 min: \"I realise that it is a bandage, but the white thing on Makelele's ear makes it look like he's on a mobile head phone,\" chuckles Chris Z, from America. \"Has he placed a call on the field to officially protest that yellow card?\" 69 min: Free-kick on the left, high up the pitch for Chelsea - i.e. a good spot from which to launch an attack. Belletti, sensing the moment puts in a cross that goes along the ground a good ten yards behind the Chelsea attackers. Bah! Apparently Anelka and SWP are warming up, while John Terry has asked for some blankets to be delivered to the dug-out. Maybe he's preparing to go to sleep like the rest of us. 71 min: Galletti gets ahead of Ashley Cole but the defender recovers and works the ball to Makelele. He plays it up to Malouda who hits a screamer from outside the box. It goes wide, though. Kalou is warming up too but, from the looks of much of the African Cup of Nations lads, he may as well not bother. Neither Drogba nor Essien have had much to do with this tie, to be honest. 74 min: More passing it about among themselves from Chelsea, with the same results from the crowd. It would be harsh to criticise Chelsea too much for this performance - the way things are going, they look like grinding out a 0-0 draw away from home in Europe, which isn't a bad thing. But they should have the firepower to knock in a goal. Kalou and Anelka come on for Malouda and Cole. Drogba and Anelka playing alongside each other for the first time ... interesting. 76 min: Well it would be were Anelka not lining up on the wing, and were the interplay between the strikers not woeful. Belluschi comes on for Djordjevic but let's resist the Animal House gags, shall we? 78 min: Kalou races onto a long ball but can't get there in time to knock it back across to Anelka and Drogba in the box. 79 min: Anelka meets the ball outside the box and tries to whip in a shot. It's a tame effort that goes wide. He might have been better playing that into Drogba who, like an Asbo-toting hoodie, was loitering ominously. 81 min: \"Makelele has been wearing that 'bandage' since before Christmas. It started out covering his whole ear. Is it conceivable that a communication device could be concealed inside or have I been watching too many spy movies?\" ponders Kevin Rainey. Perhaps he picked the trick up from the Mourinho-in-the-laundry-bin / physio-with-the-hat-pulled-low incident. 83 min: Anelka has brightened things up but it still doesn't look like a goal is coming here any time soon. Leonardo is on for Galletti. The howls of both anguish and celebration (well, mostly anguish, to be fair) from other people on this desk would suggest that Liverpool have just scored. 85 min: This is just tedious, to be honest. Ballack shoots from outside the box. It's on target, and that's about the best you can say for it. Lampard is warming up. What he's warming up, I'm not sure. 87 min: Equally as bored as the rest of us, no doubt, Olympiakos aim a cross into Kovacevic to liven things up. To maintain the theme of his night, he goes down. Ballack is off and Lampard is on, while Kovacevic is also off for Nunez - who has too many accents over his name for me to be able to do its spelling justice. We'll stick with Nunez and hope he doesn't touch it much. 88 min: Bah, Nunez has clearly heard me and launches a ludicrously ambitious shot from the halfway line. Cech smiles contemptuously at it as he catches it. At Anfield, Liverpool are 2-0 up. 89 min: Essien returns the compliment with his own ambitious shot that creeps just wide of the bottom of the left-hand post. The Chelsea pecking order is clear, meanwhile. Anelka has been plying his trade on the wing, as has Kalou, while Drogba has been lording it up in the middle. Nunez is on the ball, taunting me with his multiply accented name. I'm not giving in. 90+1min: Yellow card for Ashley Cole, pointless one, that. Peter Drury has finally seen sense and has made the same point I made, oh, ages ago. \"This is sterile,\" he says. As he does so, Kalou latches onto a hit and hope ball into the box. He was in the clear but his first touch put the ball in the keeper's hands rather than the back of the net. Good chance, that. That's it: Let's not talk much about this, shall we? Chelsea will probably be happier but, as the old saying goes, football is the loser tonight. Actually, Chelsea will definitely be happy - a 0-0 draw away from home, in this kind of fierce atmosphere, is always worth having. Post-match rambling: So the Anelka-Drogba partnership, at least on this initial showing, involves the Frenchman making way for the Ivorian. Avram Grant is clearly a believer in the George Templeton school of management too - his substitution suggests he doesn't believe Lampard and Ballack can play together either. It's certainly hard to see Olympiakos getting a result at Stamford Bridge on this showing, though. If this is the sort of ambition they show at home in front of a massively partisan crowd, they'll be sunk away from home. Thanks for all your emails tonight. Should you feel the need for more of this kind of action, Josh Widdicombe will be chopping out vignettes on the England New Zealand cricket game here. Keep the poor lad company, he looks shattered already."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
