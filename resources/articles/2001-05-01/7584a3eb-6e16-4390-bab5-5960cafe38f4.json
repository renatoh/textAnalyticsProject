Friends Provident, Scottish Provident and Scottish Life all announced details of their conversion schemes last week. This is what their customers can expect: Friends Provident Friends plans to float shares on the Stock Exchange on 9 July. Around 1.7 million members are to receive 200 shares each; Merchant bank Merrill Lynch forecasts that these could be worth 225-270p, making the flat payments \u00a3450-\u00a3540. Around 600,000 policyholders will qualify just for the flat payments: those with life and health insurance policies, including term assurance, permanent health insurance policies, critical illness cover and unit linked products. Members who have with-profits investments will receive extra allocations, depending on the size of their investments and how long they have held them. Payments to with-profit members could average more than \u00a32,000. Members will also be given a chance to buy extra shares at a discount. Policyholders must validate their membership in order to receive payments - though 25 per cent have not done so. Friends urges anyone who has a policy but not received any documents to contact its helpline on 0845 070 1170. Members can also validate their claim on shares by voting on the demutualisation proposal. Friends started posting voting forms last week and the deadline for receipt of votes is Monday 4 June. The final vote will be at an extraordinary meeting on 6 June. The insurer hopes to protect the entitlements of members whose policies mature before the EGM by asking members to vote on a rule change allowing this. Members who do not want to keep their shares can opt to sell them immediately after the flotation. Policyholders should receive cheques or shares by mid July. Only policies taken out before 4 May last year will qualify and members who bought with profits investments after 1 January last year will receive the flat allocation only. Scottish Provident Scottish Provident has agreed a deal with Abbey National expected to be worth more than \u00a32bn. There are 750,000 policyholders, 440,000 of whom will be eligible for cash payments of \u00a3500 each. Payments will go to holders of life insurance, critical illness and other forms of protection insurance as well as to with-profits investors. Of the 440,000, 385,000 will be entitled to variable cash payments calculated on the value of their policies and the length of time they have been in force. The average will be \u00a33,400. Some policyholders will receive six-figure payments, and Scottish Provident is to offer payments by loan notes that can be encashed to reduce or avoid capital gains tax bills. With-profit policyholders will also have bonuses on their policies enhanced by an average of about \u00a31,500 over the life of each policy. Policyholders must submit postal votes by 12 June and there will be an EGM to vote on the deal two days later. The aim is to send payments to policyholders by early next year. Policyholders who have not yet received voting forms should call 0845 270 0444. Scottish Life Scottish Life plans to demutualise through selling itself to Royal London for \u00a31.1bn. Scottish Life has 560,000 policyholders - 140,000 will not qualify for payments because they are not members. There are 150,000 who don't have with-profits policies, such as term assurance and unit-linked endow ments, who will receive \u00a3500 cash. A further 200,000 have with-profits investments but are not members and will be entitled to variable bonuses to be added to the value of their policies. Some 70,000 will be eligible for cash and variable bonuses - the average variable payment will be \u00a33,500. Voting documents, sent last week, must be received by Scottish Life by 29 May. There will be an extraordinary general meeting on 31 May and if the deal with Royal London is approved, cheques should be sent out in early July. Policyholders who have not received voting forms should call 0845 203 0246."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
