A spokeswoman from Slough borough council said a deal struck between Ryde College, a private tutorial college in Watford, Hertfordshire, and Lea Junior school, which would see 20 nine and 10-year-olds taught GCSE information technology for a fee of \u00a3600, was \"completely against\" its policy. She said: \"It is not the policy of the local education authority to charge pupils for lessons held in school time. \"Schools can make their own arrangements for extra-curricular activities. The LEA does not support charging pupils and we will be investigating the situation.\" Graham Lane, chairman of the Local Government Association's education committee, added: \"Education must be free in school time. The right for free tuition is extremely important.\" Staff from Ryde are due to begin teaching at the school when term begins next week. The pupils, who have not been chosen because they are the brightest or most likely to succeed, but because their parents have the money to pay, will sit their IT exams next summer. The school's headteacher, Raminder Vig, believes the school can only benefit from the college's input. A firm believer in partnership with private industry, he hopes to attract funding to make Ryde's fast-track approach to IT study available free to all pupils next year. \"A partnership with private industry is a must now,\" he said. \"This is a trial. The aim is that by Christmas we will know how successful this is and we will be looking at private enterprise to see how children who don't have \u00a3600 can afford this. \"We want to make this part and parcel of the school. Entitlement must be for everyone and my aim is to make it available to all students next year.\" Since it opened in 1982, Ryde College has helped thousands of youngsters achieve top marks in GCSEs and A-levels at an early age. This year, the college helped 12 to 14-year-old pupils from three state schools in Waltham Forest pass GCSEs in IT. However, the classes were held outside school hours and education in the borough is run by a private company. Managing director of the family-run college Mike Ryde said: \"In Lea primary, IT will be taught within their [the pupils'] core time. Parents will pay \u00a3600 and it's between schools and parents to decide. They don't have to pay, if they want their children to do this they can, it's optional, voluntary.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
