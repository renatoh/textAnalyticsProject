When it is suggested that such a piece of clothing seems essential for a Sunderland midfielder living in the Kingston Park area of Newcastle, he laughs. \"No I didn't put my hood up after we beat them last Sunday, I went home and put my head out of the window,\" says the distinctively red-haired Colback who was many people's man of the match after the 2-1 win against Newcastle United at the Stadium of Light. It was Sunderland's first victory of a previously traumatic season and hinted at a bright new dawn under Gus Poyet's management but Colback knows defeat at Hull on Saturday will make it feel as if they have returned to square one. \"We need to make sure we get something from Hull otherwise the effects of beating Newcastle won't last,\" he cautions. \"Beating Newcastle will mean nothing if we lose to Hull but Sunday's given us a massive lift. It was a big relief to get that first win. The longer it went on the more difficult it was getting \u2013 and we haven't given the fans too much to cheer about so far this season. It was nice to be out and about again this week. When you've got one point and you're bottom of the league you feel half embarrassed going out of your house.\" After putting Newcastle's Yohan Cabaye in his place and having been restored to his preferred central midfield role by Poyet it has been a good week for a player frequently deployed out of position at left-back by Paolo Di Canio and, before him, by Martin O'Neill. \"At left-back I was always just filling and trying to do a job for the team but I never really thought I wanted to pursue that,\" he says. \"I've always seen myself as more of a midfielder. I think I can offer more to the team there. It certainly felt a lot more natural last weekend. The first day the new manager came in Gus Poyet pulled me to one side and said: 'I know you're not a left-back, I want to play you in midfield.' That was good to hear. It's up to me to show I have enough ability to earn his trust as a midfielder.\" In tandem with Lee Cattermole he completed an excellent audition last Sunday. \"Lee does all the dirty work,\" he says. \"But he's also very good on the ball. That gets missed, gets overlooked but he can play as well. People don't notice that he's a good footballer because he does the other side of it so well, he's so good at breaking up the play. \"The new manager says he wants to get us playing and passing the ball more though. It's a style that's not been seen much up here. It's going to take time but he's a very clever man and I'm sure we can really do it well. It will be nice for the fans to see that sort of football and it's a style of play I want to be involved in. I relish keeping the ball and passing it around.\" On Saturday he also has a point to prove to Steve Bruce, one of his former managers at the Stadium of Light who often seemed reluctant to play Colback. A strong performance against Tom Huddlestone, Hull's stand-out individual this season and a midfielder Di Canio was desperate to bring to Sunderland during the summer, could offer Bruce pause for thought. Mention of Di Canio puts the otherwise open Colback on his guard. So what did he learn from the Italian. \"There were positives,\" he acknowledges. \"But there's no need to talk about what's not here anymore.\" He prefers to discuss Poyet. Already impressed by the new manager's habit of talking to players one to one, Colback applauded the Uruguayan's decision to take the entire squad, staff and their partners out for a meal three nights before the north-east derby. \"We got the win so it must have helped,\" he says. \"Maybe we'll have to do it more often. The manager invited everyone's partners along which is unusual but very good. It gets the spirits up. It's nice to get to know other people and other people's cultures.\" With 14 new players, 13 from overseas, having arrived at Sunderland this summer, such bonding exercises seem vital but Colback maintains that, against all odds, players were already united. \"It was always going to take time for people to settle but everyone gets on really well here,\" he says. \"We've got a large squad so not everyone can get in the team but there's real togetherness. The lads who aren't playing always support the lads who are. That's great to see. There's a really good spirit in the camp.\" Poyet must trust it can serve as the springboard to one of football's greatest relegation escapes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
