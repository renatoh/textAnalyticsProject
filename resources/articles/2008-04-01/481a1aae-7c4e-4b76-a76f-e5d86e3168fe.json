Suddenly, \"hooray\" is harder still, because the moment you stop moaning, your members may start to wonder why they voted for you in the first place. Some credit is due to Paul Dixon, then, who in his role as chairman of the Racehorse Owners Association has just notched up two \"hoorays\" in the space of a few days. First, he welcomed the news that hard cash has now started to arrive back in Britain as a result of the move to 48-hour declarations. And then there was the announcement that the Levy Board will have rather more money to hand out this year than anyone had previously expected. As a result, its allocation for prize money will rise to \u00a356.2m, 13.5% above its original estimate. \"This is very good for the whole industry,\" Dixon said. \"Owners, trainers, jockeys, breeders and stable staff have been getting very frustrated by prize money going from bad to worse over the past year or so and it is a relief to the people who keep the industry going that now something is being done about it.\" Ponder that phrase for a moment: the people who keep the industry going. Dixon is a businessman, and a very good one at that, which is how he can afford all his horses in the first place, but surely his analysis of this particular situation is skewed, to say the least. The people keeping things going here are the punters who have upped their spending - ie. their losses - on British racing in recent months (though the determined effort to shave SPs over the last year or so must also have played some part). Yet the punters are the one group who do not get a name-check in Dixon's extended list. Since they will be responsible for his members getting an extra \u00a36.7m in prize money this year, you might expect them to get a nod of acknowledgement at the very least. As so often, though - except, that is, when they have the ingratitude to try the one-armed bandits instead - it is as if the punters simply don't exist. Any major racing industry needs punters, and plenty of them, and if the vast majority of them were anything but significant losers over the course of an average year, the sport would collapse. They pay for their fun, just like the owners do, while everyone else sits in the middle and takes their cut. The betting experience available to British punters, meanwhile, is, in some respects, the best in the world. They do not have to wage a daily battle against the huge takeout of a pari-mutuel monopoly (though even these days, there are owners who put a Tote monopoly in Britain at the top of their annual list for Santa Claus). They can bet with a bookmaker without facing a jail term, and best of all these days, they can bet on an exchange, where the over-round on an individual race rarely exceeds 1%. But this is still no reason to take them for granted. Just like the owners, punters will only keep paying if they are getting enough enjoyment back in return. This, of course, can take many and various forms. Betting shop punters want racing they can trust and SPs they can trust too. They want entertaining races with decent fields. The ones who also go racing want good facilities, reasonable admission prices and edible food, and to get there and back in relative comfort. The last train to Esher in time for the first race at Sandown on Saturday felt, by all accounts, more like the last helicopter out of Saigon. The point here is that you can soak the punters for a while and reap the benefits in prize money, and convince yourself that the future is rosy. Unless you make sure that they are feeling the benefits too, however, all you are doing in the long term is preparing to drive them away."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
