The reasoning goes that political instability brought on by the polling will spur a wave of violence that forces the US to renege on its promise to begin withdrawing in earnest. However, this analysis ignores powerful factors \u2013 dramatically reduced attacks, meaningful shifts in favour of resolving challenges through political means and finally, a fierce urge among Iraqis to take charge of their own affairs \u2013 that make today's Iraq altogether different from the one that went to the polls in 2005. Make no mistake, Iraq's violence should trouble observers. The recent spike of attacks in the run up to the elections, are a serious concern. But compared to what, exactly? Such violence bears little resemblance to the days of 2006 and 2007. As Iraq tracker Bill Roggio reminds us, attacks are one-tenth what they were in that period, diving from 220 per month in 2006 to just 20 per month today. That's hardly comforting for Iraqis going to elect a new government, but it should tamp down alarmism. Iraq worriers also leave out the country's political trends when forecasting doom and gloom. They point to a de-Baathification campaign aimed at weakening Iraq's Sunni parties, raising fears of a repeat of the 2005 elections that saw a Sunni boycott turn into a full-scale sectarian civil war. But again, the picture is more complicated. The feeling by most Iraqi Sunnis is that sitting out of the 2005 polls was a mistake which they cannot afford to make this time around (a point demonstrated by Sunni politician Saleh al-Mutlaq's decision to keep his party in the election, despite his own disqualification because of Baathist ties.) Sectarianism remains part of the fabric of Iraq, but there are increasing signs that it can be handled politically. A final trope in this narrative of \"unravelling\" contains two elements. First, that US diplomacy is dangerously subdued. And second, that the military is concerned with trends in Iraq. Taken together, these dynamics suggest that the only responsible choice for the Obama administration is to hold off on withdrawal. But diplomacy without fuss is not the absence of diplomacy. And a military without a contingency plan is not the US military. In fact, US policymakers have worked with Iraqis behind the scenes on such thorny issues as last year's election law passage and the de-Baathification struggle. Higher profile involvement is simply not wanted. As for any plans to re-evaluate the terms of US military presence? As state department spokesman PJ Crowley said yesterday, \"these are ultimately choices for Iraq to make\". What is sadly left out of all of this is that Iraqis themselves are looking not to the elections, but the challenges that come after: forming a government and dealing with Iraq's persisting problems. The US has a role in assisting Iraq as it confronts such challenges, but it is best played quietly, against a backdrop of decreasing military presence."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
