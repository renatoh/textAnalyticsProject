Given that Woods played 12 holes at Royal Liverpool in bad weather on Saturday, it was no surprise that he took to the links for a full 18 at midday on Sunday in glorious sunshine. World No4 Matt Kuchar and Gary Woodland were Woods\u2019s partners, with the former insisting afterwards that the recently deposed world No1 can prevail again at Hoylake this week despite a run of eight years since his last Open win. Woods has played only one tournament \u2013 he missed the cut at the National Championship at Congressional \u2013 since having back surgery in late March. Bookmakers generally have some or all of Rory McIlroy, Adam Scott, Henrik Stenson, Martin Kaymer and Justin Rose priced shorter than Woods to claim the Claret Jug. \u201cI absolutely think he could contend,\u201d Kuchar said. \u201cThe Open, the knowledge he has, the skill-set he has? Yes, he could definitely contend.\u201d Woods has played in five Opens from 2007 onwards. He has two top 10 finishes, a tie for 23rd, a share of 12th and a missed cut during that spell. Woods\u2019s last major victory came at the 2008 US Open. \u201cHe was impressive out there,\u201d Kuchar said. \u201cI thought he was crazy to come back as early as he did [after surgery] but he said he thought it was the right thing to do, to test it and see how fit he is. He said he is recovering well, that after playing he gets up the next day and feels good. \u201cWe had a little match going and on the last hole he duly stuffed one in there close from 160 yards to beat me. So that was a bit of a bummer but totally like the Tiger we\u2019re used to seeing.\u201d Another familiar sight was that of Woods opting not to use a single driver throughout Sunday\u2019s practice round. When he won here on Merseyside in 2006, he famously used his driver only once in 72 competition holes. The venue is not as fast-running as eight years ago but accuracy, rather than length, remains the necessary component. For his part, Woods is showing no obvious signs of physical limitation at all when on the course. \u201cI\u2019ve got my speed back, which is nice,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m starting to hit the ball out there again. I\u2019m only going to get stronger. As the weeks go on, I\u2019m getting strong and faster.\u201d When asked to describe his level of confidence, Woods claimed it is growing. A counter view has arrived from Nick Faldo. The three-times Open champion believes Woods \u201chas the cards stacked against him this week\u201d. Faldo also finds it curious that Woods did not prepare for this, the 143rd Open, by adding an extra event such as the Scottish Open to his schedule. \u201cHe has played two rounds and thinks he\u2019s ready,\u201d said Faldo of Woods. \u201cHe left Congressional saying he knew what to work on, so we\u2019ll see. He looked rusty, and you have got to be rusty after that sort of break. You\u2019ve got to get out there and play. He sounds confused when he says he needs reps and then doesn\u2019t play.\u201d Glancing back to 2006, Faldo said: \u201cThe course has got to play longer, because that was burnt. As you know he hit 2-irons from the tee bar one, and then he was going in with 4-irons and things like that. I think they calculated he was playing an 8,500 yards course playing it that way. Seriously. \u201cSo that was Tiger at his optimum. That was him in a Tiger zen.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
