It is all down, he says, to Burnley Football Club's manager Stan Ternent - and vegetable soup. The 6ft 4in all-rounder, whose weight and physique have been an issue since he was criticised by the England management four years ago, admits staying in shape is a constant battle. \"If I have more than a week off I end up like Robbie Coltrane,\" he joked. So after taking a few days off following England's exit from the World Cup last month, he was ready to start training again. Then he bumped into Ternent and his assistant Sam Ellis at a function, and they invited him down to Burnley, following in the footsteps of Ian Wright and Paul Gascoigne, who arrived at Turf Moor at a similar stage of previous seasons. \"I did some running up long hills with the young kids, and also played a few matches,\" Flintoff said. \"I used to play centre-half as a kid but they didn't trust me with that so they just shoved me up front to run around. I scored one goal, a toe-poke following up a fumble by the keeper, and I was happy enough with that.\" So could Freddie follow the example of Ian Botham, who famously guested for Scunthorpe United \"I wouldn't have thought so - I don't think my ECB contract will allow me,\" he grinned. Flintoff is one of the five centrally contracted players who have been given permission to start the season with their counties, meaning he can play in Lancashire's opening fixture against the champions Surrey starting at the Oval on Friday. The Oval was also the venue for Flintoff's sole championship appearance last season, when he played one of his finest first-class innings, making 137 in a modest Lancashire first-innings total. That was not enough to win the game, however, as they were skittled in the second innings by the Pakistani all-rounder Azhar Mahmood, who was then standing in at Surrey for Saqlain Mushtaq but has since been recruited as their second overseas player. Flintoff also played his best one-day innings for Lancashire at the Oval, an unbeaten 135 in a NatWest Trophy quarter-final three summers ago that had David Gower and Ian Botham drooling in the Sky commentary box. \"I've turned it around a bit down there,\" he agreed. \"I used to have a shocker every time I went but in recent times I've done all right. A repeat performance of last year, but this time with a Lancashire win, would be very nice.\" With the winter's shooting star James Anderson also available, Flintoff's all-round ability gives Lancashire a formidable pace attack completed by the reliable Glen Chapple and Peter Martin. No wonder they quietly fancy their chances of mounting a challenge to the brown hats of Surrey this season, and Flintoff is relishing a rare chance to make a contribution. He is again vice-captain to Warren Hegg this summer, and is also hoping to be permitted to play in the home game against newly promoted Nottinghamshire that starts at Old Trafford next Wednesday. \"I actually get more nervous playing for Lancashire than I do for England,\" he admitted. \"You come back for a game here and there, and the nerves are jangling. I want to give something back to Lancashire - they've been very good to me over the years. I'd love to captain them one day when I'm a bit older and more mature - it is an ambition of mine. Not that I'm trying to get rid of Heggy - he's doing a great job. \"Surrey are the side everyone is trying to follow - they're full of top players - but we've got some good ones ourselves. We've made two shrewd signings in Mal Loye and Iain Sutcliffe, and then some of the young lads are coming through really well. Jimmy [Anderson] has had a great winter, Kyle Hogg is much improved, and there's also Saj Mahmood to come into the attack. We've got strength in depth and if we can get off to a good start in the first two games we've got every chance this year.\" Finally, that vegetable soup. \"For the last couple of weeks I've been training down at the gym, and the chef has put me on a vegetable soup diet,\" he explained. \"I feel in great nick to be honest.\" The days of Fat Boy Freddie, and his lager and pizza diet, seem to have gone for good."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
