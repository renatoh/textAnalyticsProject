Harry Vaughan, 18, a grammar school pupil who achieved four A* grades in his A-levels, was sentenced at the Old Bailey on Monday after admitting 14 terrorism offences and two child abuse image offences. He was given two years\u2019 detention suspended for two years. Vaughan was arrested by police in June last year following an investigation into an online forum called Fascist Forge. Police found that the teenager, of south-west London, had been concealing his identity behind numerous aliases and boasting about school shootings, sharing explosives manuals and neo-Nazi propaganda online, expressing homophobic views and downloading indecent images of underage boys. Digital forensic specialists retrieved 4,200 images and 302 files from Vaughan\u2019s devices including an extreme rightwing terrorist book and documents relating to Satanism, neo-Nazism and antisemitism. Police also discovered graphics encouraging acts of terrorism in the name of the proscribed organisation Sonnenkrieg Division and footage of the 2019 Christchurch mosque massacre. Several homemade posters were found in the bedroom of the teenager, who attended Tiffin grammar school in Kingston-upon-Thames in Surrey. One featured the Norwegian far-right killer Anders Breivik and the words \u201cevery girl loves a mass murderer\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s okay to be a Nazi\u201d. Richard Smith, the head of the Met\u2019s counter-terrorism command, said the case showed that any young person can be susceptible to radicalisation. He said: \u201cHarry Vaughan is an intelligent young man \u2026 yet, online, he was an enthusiastic participant of rightwing terrorist forums. \u201cHis case illustrates it is possible for any young person to be susceptible to radicalisation, so today I really want to appeal to everyone to be as vigilant as possible for signs that a young loved one may be in trouble.\u201d In a pre-sentence report, Vaughan indicated there were no \u201csignificant political\u201d, \u201cracist or homophobic\u201d views expressed during his upbringing. The teenager\u2019s father, who was in court, is a clerk in the House of Lords and his mother is a teacher. The judge took account of the defendant\u2019s young age and his diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorder. He also acknowledged a letter from Vaughan\u2019s parents, who are committed to helping him \u201cchange for the better\u201d. His extremist views, which he now claims to have renounced, were said to be \u201cdriven by internet use\u201d. Prosecutor Dan Pawson-Pounds said: \u201cThe material demonstrated unequivocally that Vaughan had an entrenched extreme rightwing and racist mindset, as well as an interest in explosives, firearms and violence more generally.\u201d Vaughan\u2019s barrister, Naeem Mian QC, told the Old Bailey that a \u201ctoxic cocktail of factors\u201d had led the defendant to \u201cdisappear down a rabbit hole of the internet\u201d into a \u201cvery, very dark place\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
