Grief over the deaths of 176 people killed when their plane came down outside Tehran had turned to fury overnight, after the government admitted that the Iranian military had shot down the airliner \u201cunintentionally\u201d, and promised an investigation. \u201cResignation is not enough \u2013 we need prosecutions,\u201d they chanted, raising their fists as traffic slowed to a crawl around them. \u201cShameless,\u201d shouted others. As darkness fell, the chants got harder, effectively calling for a vote on the government itself, and attacking Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. \u201cThe way to save the people? Referendum, referendum,\u201d the crowd shouted. The government\u2019s blunt admission of responsibility was an unexpected shift after days of strident denial about any official role in the disaster. There was speculation that Tehran had changed position quickly to try to contain the fallout from the tragedy, but public shock had quickly given way to horror. \u201cThey say they will investigate the incident, but so what? It won\u2019t bring anyone back to life,\u201d said a woman called Nastaran, who lives in Shahedshahr, the town nearest to the crash site. \u201cProsecuting the man who did this won\u2019t change anything. People were happy after we took revenge on the Americans. That feeling has vanished now.\u201d Many of those on board Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752 were Iranians, or Canadians of Iranian heritage. \u201cThey killed our own sons and daughters and they are happy that they took revenge. Wow, what a revenge,\u201d said Maryam, out grocery shopping in Tehran. The plane was downed hours after Tehran launched missile strikes against American bases in Iraq in response to the US killing of top Iranian general Qassem Suleimani. The operator who hit Flight 752 apparently mistook it for an American missile launched in retaliation. Some expressed frustration that the military appeared to have acted out of panic. \u201cThey were too afraid of America\u2019s response so they killed our own people,\u201d said Bijan, another shopper. A sense of solidarity had unified Iran after Suleimani\u2019s death, with even many of those who were ambivalent about his legacy of proxy wars across the region angry at the nature of his assassination. That goodwill appears to have evaporated. An outpouring of official regret \u2013 including the commander of the air force, which shot down the plane, saying \u201cI wish I could die\u201d \u2013 did little to quell the anger. Even media outlets that are normally government allies, such as the rightwing Tasnim news agency, which has ties to Suleimani\u2019s Revolutionary Guards, attacked the way the tragedy was handled. \u201cThe catastrophic way the information was spread to people is just as bad as the catastrophe itself,\u201d Tasnim\u2019s editor in chief, Kian Abdollahi, said on Twitter. \u201cThe officials who reported wrongly to the media are responsible. They make us all ashamed.\u201d And on state-controlled TV there was rare, if mild, criticism: \u201cThey should have announced it sooner,\u201d said one man. \u201cNo planes should have been able to take off that day.\u201d Outside Iran, the country won some respect for admitting its role relatively quickly; many observers made comparisons with Russia\u2019s still unacknowledged role in the downing of flight MH17 over Ukraine in 2014. But inside Iran there was mostly fury at the delay, and anger that the admission appeared to have been prompted at least in part by external investigators uncovering damning evidence gleaned from photos, video footage and other outside sources. \u201cThe saddest point of all this is that if Canada and Ukraine had not been looking for the cause of the crash, right now [state TV] would still be broadcasting reports to the people about the power of the air force,\u201d said satirist Ahmed Kazemi on Twitter. In Canada, home to over a third of the victims, there were also calls for further investigations. \u201cThere are no winners in this story and only communities left devastated,\u201d tweeted Payman Parseyan, former president of the Iranian Heritage Society of Edmonton. Canadian officials have expressed frustration over an inability to access the crash site, despite a formal invitation from Iran to do so. Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne, Canada\u2019s foreign minister, told reporters on Friday evening that only two of 10 members of the delegation had been granted visas for travel to Iran while they waited in Turkey. Although the crash site has largely been cleared already, the area is still swarming with security forces. In the nearby town of Shahedshahr, taxi drivers were refusing to take passengers to the area. \u201cI am not looking for trouble,\u201d one said. \u201cPeople won\u2019t even talk about it on the streets because of the secret service officers everywhere.\u201d There were still some people defending the government, however, insisting that even tragic mistakes could not be entirely prevented in times of war. \u201cIt was just human error, like many things that the Americans have done and said are human errors,\u201d said Dawood, a veteran of Iran\u2019s war with Iraq. \u201cThis was a human error and the first mistake of this kind in the 40-year history of the Islamic Republic, so we shouldn\u2019t say it will change our image in the world.\u201d Additional reporting by a reporter in Iran, Michael Safi in Lebanon and Leyland Cecco in Canada"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
