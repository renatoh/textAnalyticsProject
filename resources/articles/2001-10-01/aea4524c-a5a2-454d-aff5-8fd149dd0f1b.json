He could hardly have chosen a more impressive selection for his opening concert, which offered Milhaud's upbeat La Cr\u00e9ation du Monde and Debussy's exotic Nocturnes, bristling against Stravinsky's Rite of Spring. Unlike Stravinsky's ballet, La Cr\u00e9ation du Monde has long since broken free of its stage origins. Written just over 10 years after its notorious predecessor, it rejects Stravinsky's violent primitivism in favour of a celebratory depiction of the creation that stunningly fuses western and Afro-American idioms. Although it is the riotous jazzy passages that linger in the mind, La Cr\u00e9ation is full of irresistible details that prove Milhaud to have been a master of orchestral colour. Tortelier's control of the subtly blended chamber scoring was beautifully balanced, moving seamlessly between primeval incantation, manic pseudo-improvised jamming and all shades in between. Both orchestra and audience took a while to settle into Debussy's Nocturnes. The opening Nuages never quite cast its spell . The extrovert F tes fared much better. Given a freer rein, the BBCPO swung into life, with a springiness behind every note. An electrifyingly visceral performance of The Rite of Spring provoked the normally rather sedate Bridgewater audience to roar excitedly at its conclusion. The performance made you understand that the work's violence can be disturbing as well as thrilling. Although Tortelier's tempi were never actually much faster than marked, the performance as a whole was infused with an extraordinary sense of anxiety and anticipation. All of Stravinsky's most blatant shock tactics were given a full-blooded treatment that took them far beyond the comfortable barbarism that is now familiar. The final onslaught of convulsive savagery was absolutely terrifying. This concert will be broadcast on Radio 3 tonight at 7.30pm."}, "isHosted": false}}}
