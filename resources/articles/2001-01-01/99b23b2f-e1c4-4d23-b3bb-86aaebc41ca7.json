Or rather, it was my Bangkok airport, a place where I'd arrive with backpack and head off into the wide blue foreign yonder, a world of self-discovery, fags, booze and unpoliced snogging. Of Calais itself I knew nothing except for its dowdy ferry terminal and hideously cratered surrounding landscape of cranes and dirt heaps. Until recently, that has been how most people regarded it - a dump that had to be arrived at in order to leave for somewhere more beauteous and interesting. The outskirts of Calais are cash-and-carry heaven, its pearly gates the ineffable Cit\u00e9 d'Europe, a shopping mall so charmless and anodyne it makes Bluewater look like the Brompton Road. But even after the building of the tunnel, the centre of Calais remained an unknown zone to most of the eight million Brits who annually head there. But early last summer, thanks to a near-miraculous feat by its football club, Calais finally found its place in the sun. When its amateur squad of cash-and-carry shelf stackers, swimming pool attendants, teachers and students played First Division Nantes in the final of the Coupe de France - the French FA Cup - it was as if Hartlepool had battled through to meet Manchester United at Wembley. Calais lost, but only to a last-minute penalty, and thanks to its Cup run, the club has paid off all its debts and, through generous win bonuses kept the squad together. Still managed by the thrillingly tempestuous Spaniard Ladislas Lozano, they are top of their league and are attempting to recreate last season's cup run, starting with First Division side Sedan, who provide the opposition next Saturday. In other words, there is now a reason to visit Calais that doesn't come in cases of 12 or disappear back to Eng land for resale from the back of a hired van. After all, if you're a Londoner, what makes more sense: follow relegated Wimbledon on this season's pilgrimage of four-hour train journeys to Barnsley and Crewe, or go for the alternative - a brisk Channel hop to become an honorary Calaisien? Why afflict your intestines with the half-time pies of Bolton and Preston when you can enjoy a Stade Julien Denis baguette stuffed with jambon and a side order of very decent frites ? This season, games kick off at 6pm French time. With a bit of forward planning, you can take an early ferry or go by Eurotunnel, pack in a day's shopping, watch a game, have a meal then catch the last ferry or train home. Calais's 80-year-old stadium has been given a new coat of paint together with a new set of speakers. Calaisiens liken the place to a cemetery when empty, but when it is packed it's very cheerful, very old-style anglais - one modest stand and the other three sides made up of terracing. You can't take alcohol into the stadium, but wine and beer is on sale inside. You've got Mexican waves and cheerleaders with pom-pons (in the club colours of le sang et l'or). Playing in the Championnat Amateur means that Calais not only compete against other north-eastern clubs but also the reserve teams of some of the big boys, too, so it is quite possible you will be watching future internationals, or established stars enduring a temporary spell in the stiffs. What's more, the town itself is lovely place if you just stop and look. Think Dover, but with better grub, shinier sun and flower-decked streets. It has ramparts and citadels, cobbles and quays, roundabouts with little boats stuck in the middle, gardens full of sunflowers the size of long-playing records, street painting exhibitions (the most popular themes are boats, flowers and, naturally, footballers). The town's unsung attraction is its beach, which is wide and beautiful. It's clean, too - dogs are banned from March to October. The harbour end features a palatial toilettes which looks like a mausoleum designed by Bauhaus and would be a definite candidate for listed status on the other side of the Channel. All along the seafront are rows of white-painted beach huts behind which are rows of restaurants with terraces to sit out at as you work your way through a bowl of moules roquefort, swill gamay and watch the non-stop ferry action. You won't find that at Selhurst Park. Le Foot Calais Racing Union Football Club, Stade Julien Denis, Avenue St Exupery. 62100 Calais. Ticket prices - main stand (seated) Fr50, terrace (standing) Fr40, populaire (standing around the side) Fr20. The club doesn't yet take credit-card bookings, but if you dust off your French and telephone them, they'll leave tickets for you to pick up on the day. Getting there Tickets on P&amp;O Stena Line services from Dover (0870 6000600) cost from \u00a362 return for a car and five passengers, and \u00a315 return for foot passengers. Eurotunnel (0870 5353535) is currently offering an overnight ticket for a car and up to eight passengers for \u00a369 return. The Stade Julien Denis is on the east of the town. On the way, call in at the club shop (162 Bld de la Fraternit\u00e9), somewhat disconcertingly billeted in a concern called Copy Magic. Don't even think about trying to park in the ground (the forecourt is so small even the seagulls have to fight for room). Plenty of spaces can be found within strolling distance. If you're making the trip on foot, a taxi from the ferry terminal will cost around Fr50, bus Fr10. Where to shop The Saturday morning market based in Place d'Armes has lovely flower arrangements, a fair amount of tat and a great selection of fruit and veg: mirabelles, muscat grapes, fresh flageolet beans, celeriac the size of elephants' feet. Heading west will bring you to Commercial Centre Auchan (motorway Junction 12 or 14) where as well as the Auchan hypermarket you will find Sainsbury's; a plus is that in the event of a bottle turning out corked you can return it to your local store back home. The site also includes a Nike factory outlet (savings of up to \u00a330 on trainers). Junction 18 will lead you to East Enders, Dave West's cavernous cash-and-carry where you can pick up an astonishingly drinkable white plonk called The Dog's Bollocks for \u00a31 a bottle or an excellent gigondas. Where to eat Around the beach area, you're spoilt for choice, from terrace caf\u00e9s to big seafront restaurants. The best of the brasseries is La Mer (3 21 96 17 72) specialising in plateaux de fruit de mer and moules. Aquar'aile (3 21 34 00 00) perched on a hilltop overlooking the ocean, lets you scoff elegantly (the speciality is foie gras) while enjoying the sun going down over the sea. If you've brought the car, head out of town to the little bucket-and-spade resort of Wimereux and the beach-side Hotel Atlantique. It is now the home of La Liegoise (3 21 32 41 01), which used to be in the centre of Boulogne and was the eaterie of choice for most locals. There's a great wine shop in Wimereux, too - Mille Vignes, run by Englishman Nick Sweet, 90-94 Rue Carnot (3 21 32 60 13). Where to stay Plenty of choice in the town itself. The Metropol (3 21 97 54 00), is a classic old-fashioned French hotel, close to the station but peacefully overlooking one of the quays. It has three stars, very reasonable rates and a cosy bar. Even more central is the George V (3 21 97 68 00) in Rue Royale, swanky without being overbearing and with a portrait of the Queen in the foyer. For those who crave proximity to the shopping, there's a B&amp;B and an F1 at the Auchan centre. What to see Head down Rue Royale (stopping at the Patisserie aux 6 Bourgeois de Calais to stock up on chocolate sardines, poire chocolat gateau and frangipane cassis) to the very good Office de Tourisme (12 Boulevard Clemenceau, 3 21 96 62 40) where you can overload yourself with all the leaflets you desire about the area's attractions. Within the town itself are two museums (covering the diverse subjects of lace and war) and a boat tour round the Citadelle. A tour of Calais lighthouse, where you can also hire a bike (Fr80 per day), will set you back Fr14. The town has well-marked paths and the canal towpaths to Coulogne and Guines make for peaceful, traffic-free cycling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
