Afghanistan, Iran and Iraq will be at the top of the agenda, and the US state department said that the trip, next Wednesday, would probably also include talks with Gordon Brown. \"I expect they will talk a little bit about Iran, talk some about Iraq, talk some about Afghanistan,\" spokesman Sean McCormack said. The visit comes against a backdrop of heightened controversy over the role of multinational troops in Afghanistan, with the country's president, Hamid Karzai, raising doubts over the effectiveness of their presence. Three separate reports, published in Britain and the US yesterday, suggested an enhanced military and aid effort would be needed to see off the threats of insurgency, poppy cultivation and a looming humanitarian crisis. The US, which recently announced it would send 3,200 marines to join 29,000 troops already in Afghanistan, wants its European allies to step up their military commitments. Rice has already raised the issue with Australia, France and Germany in recent talks. The German defence ministry yesterday said the US had written a strongly-worded letter to Nato members, pressing for combat troops to be sent to dangerous areas in the south of the country. \"I won't make a secret of the fact that we are encouraging all of our Nato allies to do everything that they can in terms of contributing resources,\" McCormack said. \"We are in a fight in Afghanistan, against violent extremists, whether that's al Qaida or the Taliban or any other associated group.\" Rice is also expected to discuss a new draft sanctions resolution against Iran, being circulated at the UN security ouncil, as part of continuing efforts to put pressure on Tehran over its alleged nuclear ambitions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
