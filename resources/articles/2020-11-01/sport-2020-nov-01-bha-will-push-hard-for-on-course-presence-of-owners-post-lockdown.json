Owners were barred from racecourses for just over a month after racing resumed on 1 June at the end of the first national lockdown. Their return from 4 July \u2013 Derby day \u2013 was seen as an important step as racing does what it can to maintain its ownership base at a time of immense economic uncertainty, in particular for smaller-scale owners. The scheduled racing on Thursday includes the first jumps meeting of the new season at Newbury, where a total of 140 horses are entered for the seven races. \u201cThere will be meetings tomorrow to work everything through, because there are arrangements which are different in Scotland and Wales,\u201d Rust said on the Luck On Sunday programme on Racing TV, \u201cbut fundamentally, on first assessment last night, the only query is going to be participation of owners. \u201cObviously we\u2019d love to keep them coming, but there have been some tough restrictions reimposed on hospitality, so there are no guarantees on that. We will fight hard on it, but the main thing is that we comply and we keep racing going for the next month.\u201d An important revenue stream that will definitely be lost during lockdown is the media-rights payments to racecourses from England\u2019s 5,700 betting shops. Even the British Horseracing Authority is not privy to the detail of the agreements between off-course betting firms and racecourses, but the payments are understood to be at least \u00a310m per month, while, for the moment at least, about 30% of Britain\u2019s betting turnover is still over-the-counter on the high street. The impact of the new lockdown on the Levy, which returns a percentage of bookmakers\u2019 profits from racing to the sport, is likely to depend on how much retail betting turnover moves online, David Armstrong, the chief executive of the Racecourse Association, said on Sunday. \u201cDuring the tier 3 lockdowns in the north there was definitely a switch, and during the first two weeks in June [when racing was on but betting shops were shut], when we had the playing field to ourselves, so to speak, we did incredibly well,\u201d he said. \u201cSince the reopening of betting shops there\u2019s been a significant switch from betting shops to online anyway, and that should continue, we hope, but we won\u2019t get a feel for that for a week or two.\u201d Monday\u2019s best bets As racing faces up to another eight-figure hole in its finances as a result of the second national lockdown, it\u2019s more than a little disappointing to find just five runners going to post for what is supposedly the best race of the day \u2013 a 12-furlong Listed contest with a \u00a320,000 first prize at Kempton. To be fair, though, all five have a chance on their best form and the favourite, Charlie Appleby\u2019s Loxley, is odds-against, having finished last of six on his only start since March, in a Listed contest over a similar trip at Newmarket in September. Prior to that, he won a Group Two at Meydan, and he was also a neck second over today\u2019s track and trip in December. He did not look entirely straightforward there, however, and the lightly raced Kirstenbosch (4.35), from the in-form James Fanshawe stable, makes more appeal today at around 11-4. Her seven-length second to Enable in the September Stakes can\u2019t be taken too literally, of course, but it was also a first try at a mile-and-a-half for a filly who is bred to excel at the trip. Fashion Advice (7.20) finished last on her first two starts of the season but dropped a strong hint of a return to form at Musselburgh last time and has a handy draw in stall one at Wolverhampton later, while Production (5.50) has also drawn well in two for the six-furlong handicap earlier on the card. Franco D\u2019Aunou (1.40) is an interesting debutant over British hurdles on the card at Hereford, having finished six lengths behind the useful Flouer at Nantes last year, while Langer Dan (1.55) and The Brothers (2.30) both hold strong claims at Plumpton."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
