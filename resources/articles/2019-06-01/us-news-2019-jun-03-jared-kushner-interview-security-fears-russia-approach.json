The admission came in an interview with Axios on HBO in which Kushner seemed unprepared for a range of questions \u2013 including several on whether his father-in-law, Donald Trump, is a racist. The answers which drew the most attention, however, were in a section of the interview devoted to his role in a June 2016 meeting between Trump campaign officials and a Russian Kremlin-linked lawyer promising to bring damaging information about Hillary Clinton. Asked why an approach by a hostile power did not immediately lead him to call the FBI, Kushner became defensive and suggested the question was \u201cself-righteous\u201d. \u201cLet me put you in my shoes at that time. OK, I\u2019m running three companies, I\u2019m helping run the campaign. I get an email that says show up at 4 instead of 3 to a meeting that I had been told about earlier that I didn\u2019t know what the hell it was about,\u201d Kushner said. He claimed not to know the meeting was set up in Trump Tower in order to receive Russian-sourced information, even after it was pointed out to him that the email telling him about the meeting had the subject line: \u201cRussia \u2013 Clinton \u2013 private and confidential.\u201d \u201cAgain, I would get about 250 emails a day, and so I literally saw show up at 4,\u201d Kushner said. \u201cI showed up at 4.\u201d Kushner also failed to explain why such a busy executive would attend a meeting in the middle of the afternoon without knowing what it was about. In the Axios interview, Kushner was also asked: \u201cWould you call the FBI if it happened again?\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to do hypotheticals, but the reality is, is that we were not given anything that was salacious.\u201d The suggestion that he might not report an approach, even though he now has (controversial) top security clearance, astonished former officials who have had to go through the stringent vetting procedures. \u201cThis shows a lack of understanding of our legal system when it comes to Russia,\u201d said Brett Bruen, global engagement director in the Obama White House. \u201cFailing to report it is a clear security violation.\u201d Sam Vinograd, who also worked in the Obama national security council, told CNN: \u201cJared Kushner basically just put a for sale sign on his forehead during this interview saying on national television he may not contact the FBI if a hostile foreign power contacts him. That really sends a message to Russia and any other foreign actor that Jared Kushner may be open for business during this 2020 campaign cycle.\u201d Trump reportedly ordered Kushner to be provided top secret security clearance, overruling the judgment of administration officials concerned about undeclared foreign entanglements from Kushner\u2019s business meetings. Kushner staunchly defended the president, particularly on the charge of racism. But when asked whether \u201cbirtherism\u201d \u2013 a groundless conspiracy theory Trump helped propagate suggesting that Obama had been born abroad \u2013 was racist, Kushner was evasive, simply repeating: \u201cI wasn\u2019t involved in that.\u201d \u201cIn retrospect, it\u2019s clear why Jared Kushner rarely does interviews,\u201d Daniel Drezner, professor of international politics at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, said \u201cPolitically it was a disaster. He seemed unprepared \u2026 and the answers are laughable.\u201d At one point towards the end of the interview, Kushner said that one of the best facets of his father-in-law was his readiness to hire people who were not \u201cqualified\u201d making air quotes when he said the word. Kushner, whose experience before the White House was working in his family\u2019s property business, has been given some of the most important and complex portfolios, including Middle East peace and immigration. \u201cWhat is astonishing is that he was put in charge of an awful lot of policy, when he was not remotely qualified,\u201d Drezner said. \u201cTwo years on, it\u2019s not obvious he has learnt anything.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
