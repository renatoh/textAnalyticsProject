The relationship between publican Gerry White, 73, and chef Jonathan Stasiuk, 60, turned sour after disagreements over money, the dumping of rubbish and plants, and a delivery of logs, the court heard. In the days before White\u2019s death on 27 May, Stasiuk allegedly messaged friends saying: \u201cTomorrow I go to war\u201d, and even referenced using a chainsaw. Southampton crown court heard on Monday that at around 4.30pm at Lake Community Gardens in the village of Lake on the Isle of Wight the pair had a confrontation. After allegedly attacking White with the chainsaw, which is understood to have come from the garden\u2019s clubhouse, Stasiuk strangled and smothered him, screaming: \u201cDie bastard, die\u201d, the jury heard. Minutes later he allegedly confessed to murdering White to a 999 operator, the court was told. Stasiuk, who worked for White\u2019s pubs, helped look after the 16-acre \u201cwellness\u201d garden. Matthew Jewell QC, prosecuting, said Stasiuk had a list of complaints against White. \u201cStasiuk harboured a growing sense of grievance and formed a strong belief in his position,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir relationship began to go sour for a number of reasons. \u201cThere was an accusation made against Stasiuk\u2019s partner about \u00a325 transport costs owed to her. There was a dispute about logs being delivered to Mr White\u2019s pubs that were apparently damp, there was an issue about plants. Rubbish appeared on the site and it appeared to Stasiuk that Mr White was using it as some kind of dumping ground.\u201d After the attack, Stasiuk called the police and told the operator: \u201cI\u2019ve just murdered someone\u201d, the court heard. Jewell said: \u201cHe told police where to find his body and said the murder happened 20 minutes earlier. He gave a full account over six interviews and told police officers he attacked Mr White with a chainsaw and then by strangling and smothering him until he believed he was dead. \u201cStasiuk explained it was the result of a growing and festering dispute that had led to his actions on that day. None of these grievances justify what Stasiuk did on that day to Mr White.\u201d Pathologist Dr Basil Purdue said White suffered severe injuries to his neck as a result of the strangulation as well as cuts to his legs. Jurors were told Stasiuk denies murder but admits manslaughter on grounds of diminished responsibility. The trial continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
