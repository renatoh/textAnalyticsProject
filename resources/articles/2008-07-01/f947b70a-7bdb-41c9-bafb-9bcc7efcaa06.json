Koller is accompanied here by the British bass-and-drums team of Mark Hodgson and Paul Clarvis, who help him extract startling jazz variations from a selection of old German folk songs. The Solid Strings quartet, led by the violinist Sonia Slany, also delivers three Koller pieces without any jazz input. It's a celebration of the pianist's delicate touch: soft-struck phrasing and insinuating elisions of notes, with the sometimes growling, sometimes purring lines of Hodgson and the flickering brushwork of Clarvis strongly evoking the classic Bill Evans trio feel. Koller's sophisticated jazz sensibilities transform these traditional folk materials into what seem strangely like standards you haven't heard before. The strings pieces are ghostly and eschew improvising, but their softly striving melodies exhibit another facet of Koller's restless imagination."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
