But no matter! Jonathan Liew was at the London Stadium, and his verdict has landed! You know what to do: clickity click! Thanks for reading this MBM. Nighty night! Ole Gunnar Solskjaer speaks. \u201cFootball is up and down ... first half we struggled ... we played at too slow a tempo and gave the ball away too often ... second half, the goal changes the mood ... great goal by Paul ... Mason\u2019s goal, the individual quality ... we play against a team who have drawn to City, beaten Leicester and Wolves and drawn to Tottenham ... they\u2019re a good team! ... they make it difficult for you ... they\u2019re compact and aggressive ... so I\u2019m very, very pleased with the performance ... last week we were 2-0 down at Southampton, so this is a step forward! ... I am very happy with the away form ... at home we are becoming more consistent ... we cope better when we are 1-0 down and 2-0 down, the character in the boys, they believe, and that\u2019s a big thing ... at the end of the season we don\u2019t care about the performance.\u201d Marcus Rashford, who transformed the game in the second half, speaks to Sky. \u201cWe have to stop doing that! If we keep more clean sheets, we\u2019ll definitely win more games. It\u2019s good that we showed spirit to come back, but ideally we don\u2019t want to be conceding. We defended quite well, they have some dangerous players, especially in the first half on the counter. Half-time was an opportunity to regroup and come out with a new focus, and that\u2019s what we did. It\u2019s not about what the manager says [at half-time] but about what we can see on the pitch. It was clear we didn\u2019t get in behind them enough. The team knew what we had to do. It was just a case of working hard and doing it. We can go to Leipzig and enjoy ourselves. It\u2019s a great feeling to have some fans back: 2,000 is much better than nothing. I\u2019m glad they can come back to enjoy their football.\u201d David Moyes engages the officials in a full and frank exchange of views. He\u2019s clearly far from happy about the Henderson clearance that could have gone out of play and led to Manchester United\u2019s equaliser. It was a game-changer, one way or the other: Manchester United were as imperious for the last half-hour as they were abject during the first 60 minutes. They\u2019re a very strange team ... but despite their Jeckyll-and-Hyde struggles, they\u2019re right in the title hunt! A huge boost ahead of bigger tests against Leipzig and Manchester City, though at some point they\u2019ll have to identify the reason for all this erratic behaviour, endearing and entertaining as it is. West Ham meanwhile should take great heart from their first-half performance, and write off that second half as one of those things. This is what Manchester United 2020 do, after all. They are not alone. A ninth consecutive Premier League away win. A textbook game of two halves. Manchester United are two points off the top! 90 min +4: Mata pings Greenwood clear. Greenwood opts for the first-time spectacular, and shanks it well wide left. Up the other end, Lanzini larrups a frustrated long-distance effort straight at Henderson. 90 min +3: Manchester United stroke it around as the clock ticks down. Compare and contrast to an hour ago. The transformation has been remarkable. 90 min +1: The first of five added minutes passes by without incident. \u201cThis iteration of Manchester United is obviously not a title winning side but this squad surely has resolve,\u201d argues Billy Graboso. \u201cThat alone will probably save Ole for this season.\u201d 90 min: Johnson is barged over by Rashford out on the right. A chance for West Ham to load the box and grab a goal that would make injury time interesting. But Cresswell\u2019s free kick is headed clear by Lindelof. 89 min: Benrahma embarks on a purposeful dribble down the middle. For a second, it looks as if he might sensationally break through. But he loses control on the edge of the box and falls over in the hope of purchasing a cheap free kick. He doesn\u2019t get one. 87 min: Rice has a rake from 25 yards. It\u2019s a decent hit, but takes a deflection off McTominay that actually helps Henderson, the ball whistling straight down the keeper\u2019s throat. 85 min: The resulting corner is no good. Johnson comes on for Coufal. 84 min: A free kick for West Ham, 30 yards out. Cresswell takes, and curls powerfully over the wall and towards the bottom right. It\u2019s in all the way, but Henderson extends an arm to turn around the post. What a save! 82 min: West Ham are in danger of losing heavily, which seemed to be Manchester United\u2019s fate in the first half. Rashford makes good down the left and sends a dribbler across the face of goal. Thankfully for the 2,000 increasingly morose attendees, there\u2019s nobody in dazzle camouflage in the middle. 80 min: Coufal dribbles down the right and wins a corner off Telles. Cresswell takes. The ball ends up at the feet of Benrahma on the other wing. He dribbles at Lindelof, who isn\u2019t minded to tackle inside the box. Benrahma drops a shoulder to move to the inside, and sends a curler towards the top right. Inches over, with Henderson beaten. It\u2019s just not West Ham\u2019s day. Mata creams a first-time pass from the centre circle down the inside-left channel for Rashford, who is sprung clear. He draws Fabianski and dinks a lovely chip over the keeper and into the net. Good luck trying to figure this Manchester United side out. 77 min: Greenwood bustles down the inside left and slices a shot wide. Manchester United look dangerous on every attack now. They\u2019re as wonderful now as they were woeful earlier on. 76 min: Rashford is fixed up and good to go again. Meanwhile the hosts make a double change, sending on Benrahma and Lanzini in place of Bowen and Fornals. 74 min: Rashford romps at warp speed down the left. Rice gets a good foot in to stop his gallop. Rashford accidentally falls into Ogbonna\u2019s boot, and play is stopped while West Ham were on the counter. The West Ham 2,000 aren\u2019t happy, and boo accordingly, but the referee had little option. 72 min: Fernandes turns in the centre circle and slides Rashford clear down the inside-right channel. He\u2019s clear on goal, but slightly scuffs his shot across Fabianski, which twangs off the base of the left-hand post and away. Inches from setting the seal on what will be one of the more absurd Jeckyll-and-Hyde performances since ... er, last weekend at Southampton. 70 min: A look of glazed confusion washes across the face of David Moyes. He has no idea how his team have just been hit by that double whammy. But this is just what this Manchester United team does. He\u2019ll be doubly livid now. Telles makes space down the left and cuts back for Greenwood, who has his back to goal on the six-yard box. He takes one touch to spin Ogbonna, and lashes past Fabianski. One smooth movement of extreme brilliance! 67 min: Moyes is fuming. 66 min: There\u2019s a VAR check. Did Henderson\u2019s blooter upfield curl out of play before reaching Fernandes? David Moyes certainly things so. But there\u2019s no way of knowing for sure, if the footage shown is all they\u2019ve got to go by, and so the goal stands. Henderson launches a long clearance down the right, under pressure from Bowen. He inadvertently springs Fernandes down the right. Fernandes cuts back for Pogba, who unleashes a screamer into the top right! Fabianski had no chance. 63 min: Martial can\u2019t continue. He limps off, to be replaced by Mata. 61 min: Rashford earns a corner for Manchester United that\u2019s wasted. But they\u2019re beginning to ask a few questions on a regular basis at long last. 60 min: Ogbonna launches a crossfield pass that finds Coufal in acres on the right. The resulting cross is no good, but once again you have to question Telles. Not so much what he\u2019s doing, but where he is. 59 min: Manchester United are currently playing with ten-and-a-half men. Martial is limping heavily and trying to run it off. 57 min: Fernandes shows in attack for the first time since coming on, spinning cutely down the middle and threading a delicate pass forward in the hope of releasing Martial into the box. Martial is well offside. But again: a little better from Manchester United. 55 min: Rashford tries to pick up the pace with a determined dribble down the left. He cuts inside and tees up McTominay, who flashes the side netting with a fierce first-time drive. A little better from the visitors. 54 min: On Sky Sports, co-commentator Gary Neville is fuming at the half-arsed nature of Manchester United\u2019s press. Right now: steam &gt; bubbles. 53 min: Maguire decides to have a thrash from the best part of 30 yards. It\u2019s a decent enough effort, but Fabianski shouldn\u2019t get beaten from there, and doesn\u2019t. He smothers easily. 52 min: Incredible amounts of space for Coufal on the right. Where\u2019s Telles?! He enters the box and looks for Fornals in the middle. The ball flies across to Bowen, who attempts to steer into an unguarded net from a tight angle, but can only find the side netting. A big chance to double West Ham\u2019s lead is spurned. 50 min: West Ham stroke the ball around nicely, from back to front, Masuaku finally firing in a cross from the left. Maguire hacks clear. Both sides, for differing reasons, look hell-bent on hunting goals. 48 min: Rashford probes down the left. He runs slap-bang into Coufal, and demands a free kick for obstruction, but doesn\u2019t get one. You\u2019ve seen them given. A good sign for those worried about his shoulder that he\u2019s more than prepared to get physical. 46 min: Martial is sent scampering down the left ... but he\u2019s miles offside. \u201cThose Man Utd shirts are a bit like watching telly in the 70s/80s,\u201d suggests Justin Kavanagh. \u201cThe broken lines would slide upward or downward for ten minutes before a minute of beautiful clarity would break through and you could finally make sense of what you were watching - only for the zebra lines to then return with a vengeance. A lot like watching United these days, in fact.\u201d Manchester United get the second half underway. They\u2019ll be buoyed by the fact they\u2019ve won four of the six Premier League games in which they\u2019ve conceded the first goal this season ... and that Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford are on for the second half. They replace Donny van de Beek and Edinson Cavani. Half-time entertainment. Having witnessed that abject first-half display, Manchester United fans can be forgiven for daydreaming about better times. They could do worse than fire up United Rewind, a nostalgia-fest hosted by Rob Smyth and Daniel Harris of this parish. It\u2019s everything you\u2019d expect from this magnificent duo ... but even better than that. You won\u2019t regret it. Get on it. There\u2019s just enough time left for Bowen to lift an effort over the bar ... and the whistle goes for the break. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that the hosts could - arguably should - be at least three goals up. Manchester United have some thinking to do. 45 min: From the resulting throw, Bowen flashes a header goalwards. Henderson does well to parry, though the flag goes up for offside anyway. 44 min: West Ham break from the Manchester United corner. Fornals puts Bowen clean through! The visitors are very fortunate that Wan-Bissaka is much faster than Bowen. He catches him up on the edge of the box and blocks. 43 min: Yet despite their awful first-half display, they could be level. Martial glides in from the left and curls powerfully towards the top left. Fabianski does extremely well to claw out for a corner. 42 min: Manchester United are a rabble. McTominay and Lindelof get in an awful mess, gifting Bowen possession then bringing him down. That leads to a shot, a corner, a melee, and a Pogba overhead clearance that on another day could have taken Soucek\u2019s head off. 40 min: Haller is sent clear down the middle! Manchester United\u2019s defence is all over the shop! Haller rounds Henderson on the left. He switches feet, preparing to stroke home ... then slips over! Henderson is able to claim. Haller might have been a yard offside, but we\u2019ll never know for sure. No need for VAR to check, and Haller may be the only person in the London Stadium wishing there were still no fans allowed. 39 min: Manchester United fans won\u2019t be too worried yet. They keep falling behind on their travels in the Premier League ... and keep winning. Can West Ham buck the trend? The corner\u2019s whipped from the left to the near post. Rice flicks on. Henderson plus defenders had all swarmed Rice, and Soucek is able to poke into an unguarded net from a couple of yards! It had been coming. 37 min: Haller spins Maguire down the right and loops long to the far post, where the excellent Bowen waits. He brings the ball down and shoots from a tight angle. A deflection earns West Ham a corner. From which ... 36 min: Pogba has a dig from distance. It\u2019s swerving around but easily claimed by Fabianski, who has otherwise had very little to do. 35 min: Pogba\u2019s forward pass clanks into a thicket of players. Bowen comes away with it and drives towards the Manchester United box from the right. He slips a pass into Fornals, who pokes a delicate no-backlift effort towards the bottom left. Henderson is beaten. The ball clanks off the base of the post and back into the keeper\u2019s grateful arms. 33 min: Manchester United\u2019s brief resurgence has stalled. They\u2019re shipping possession with obscene regularity right now. This time they allow Bowen to have a dig from distance. Miles over the bar, but it\u2019s another warning sign. The visitors need to sharpen up. 32 min: Cavani gifts West Ham the ball. Bowen is sent scampering down the right, passes Telles with ease, and curls to the far post, where Fornals heads into the side netting from a tight-ish angle. It wasn\u2019t the easiest of chances, though he should still have done better. 31 min: West Ham work a short corner and waste it. A harmless game of head tennis breaks out on the edge of the Manchester United area and Henderson is quickly out to claim. 30 min: Pogba and Van de Beek take turns to give the ball away cheaply. That allows Masuaku to work his way down the left and earn a corner. 28 min: Manchester United are spending more and more time in the West Ham half. Cavani is popping up everywhere. 26 min: A long ball launched down the West Ham right. Maguire comes across to deal with it, but brings the ball down with his arm. It\u2019s a blatant handball, but there\u2019s no free kick coming West Ham\u2019s way, the referee waving play on. David Moyes goes ballistic on the touchline. That free kick would have been in a tasty position near the Manchester United box. 25 min: A free kick earned by Pogba out on the right. He takes it himself. The delivery\u2019s no good, and it\u2019s easily cleared by Ogbonna. \u201cIs that the Manchester United bench booing Pogba?\u201d wonders sports satirist Gary Naylor. 24 min: Once again, the Manchester United corner is a non-event. But Manchester United are growing into the game after a slow start. 23 min: Pogba wins a 50-50 with Rice and lays off to Martial, who slips Telles away down the left. Telles sweeps a low cross into the mixer. Ogbonna is forced to sky the ball over his own bar for a corner. 21 min: A little space for Haller out on the left. He\u2019s got Bowen bombing down the centre, through a huge gap in the Manchester United defence. He looks to thread a diagonal pass to release his team-mate ... but it clatters into Maguire, who intercepts through accident more than design. The visitors were nearly exposed there. 19 min: A one-two between Greenwood and Wan-Bissaka out on the right. The full back passes infield for Martial, who takes a snapshot. It\u2019s deflected wide for a corner. Nothing comes of the set piece. 17 min: Soucek wraps his leg around McTominay from behind and is fortunate to escape a booking. It\u2019s a painful one for the Manchester United midfielder, but after a brief spot of rolling and grimacing he\u2019s up and about again. 16 min: Masuaku crosses from the left. Haller tries to trap and turn on the penalty spot, but loses control. West Ham are attacking with confidence. 15 min: It\u2019s Pogba trying with a long pass this time. He finds Cavani down the left. The striker brings it down gracefully, but then backheels to nobody in particular. For a second, West Ham were very light at the back. 14 min: Maguire launches long, hoping to release Van de Beek, breaking from deep. Ogbonna puts a stop to the plan with a towering header clear. 12 min: A neat interchange between Haller and Fornals nearly opens Manchester United up down the left. The flag goes up, though there wasn\u2019t much in it. West Ham have been much the better team during these early exchanges. 11 min: A free kick for West Ham out on the left. Cresswell takes, looping long in the hope of finding Ogbonna at the far post. Henderson comes out and flaps a bit, but there\u2019s no worry as the delivery\u2019s no good and the ball sails out for a goal kick. 9 min: Soucek releases Bowen down the right. Bowen\u2019s free! He enters the box and passes a forensic shot across Henderson and into the bottom left. But the flag goes up for offside. VAR double-checks, though there\u2019s no need to. He was miles off. 8 min: Plenty of applause as Fornals continues to apply the press. A gorgeous sound rippling down from the stand. We\u2019ve missed it. 6 min: Henderson is put under some early pressure when the ball\u2019s at his feet. He deals with West Ham\u2019s press comfortably, but you can be sure David Moyes has told his charges to test the full Premier League debutant at every nerve-jangling opportunity. 4 min: Cavani wants a free kick after running into Balbuena out on the left. He\u2019s not getting one. Meanwhile here\u2019s Damian A Durrant painting a dazzling picture with words: \u201cManchester United\u2019s kit looks like a hangover feels.\u201d 2 min: West Ham are on the front foot early doors. Bowen causes a bit of bother down the right, swinging the ball in twice. Manchester United can\u2019t clear and Fornals nearly gets a snapshot away at the near post. Henderson blocks and the danger is averted. The players take a knee ... there\u2019s no room for racism ... and West Ham get the ball rolling. Bubbles in the air, as well as the sweet, sweet sound of punters in the stand. Stay safe, everyone. The teams are out! West Ham United are in their famous claret and blue, while Manchester United wear their dazzle-ship camouflage. The 2,000 West Ham fans in the Billy Bonds Stand bring the atmosphere. Above them, a rainbow, in support of Stonewall\u2019s rainbow laces campaign for LGBT+ inclusivity. All of it: lovely to see. David Moyes welcomes the lucky 2,000 fans back to the London Stadium. \u201cI hope the fans have a positive effect. We\u2019ve been playing well. We\u2019ve been playing in a positive fashion, especially here at the London Stadium where it\u2019s been said it\u2019s not home yet, we\u2019re not winning enough games, but I think we\u2019re doing much better so hopefully the supporters will help us again today. It\u2019s a start, but this arena can hold many, many more, and it\u2019s capable because of the way it\u2019s spread out, and the distances to walk up to the stadium, etcetera, but we\u2019re following the government guidelines and we can only have 2,000. I think Manchester United are a really good team, they\u2019ve been in form away from home, so I\u2019m hoping we can give them a really good game and show that we are worthy of being in and around the top teams.\u201d Ole Gunnar Solskjaer speaks to Sky Sports. \u201cThe injury David de Gea had against Southampton has flared up a little bit so we didn\u2019t want to take the risk and kept him at home. Bruno Fernandes has been kicked from pillar to post recently so if I don\u2019t have to use him I\u2019d like not to. Marcus Rashford is fit enough to be on the bench and he held his arm up - with a bad shoulder! - to say he\u2019s ready if needed. Every time you pick a team you think short term, but with a little eye on the next few games. I couldn\u2019t take risks even though we know this is an unbelievably tough place and a tough team to play against.\u201d That Manchester United team serves up a tasty trio of Premier League firsts. Dean Henderson and Edinson Cavani both make their full league debuts for the club, while Bruno Fernandes isn\u2019t in a Premier League starting XI for the first time since he joined. Meanwhile Digvijay Yadav is on board with my description of the upcoming showdown in Leipzig: \u201cIt\u2019s season-defining all right. If Manchester United win here and in Germany, they\u2019d be within touching distance of the top of the league and would have snuck out of a tough group. Lose and Mauricio Pochettino should keep his phone fully charged.\u201d West Ham, three on the bounce, make just one change to the side named for the win over Aston Villa, and not by choice. The injured Michail Antonio is replaced by Sebastien Haller. Manchester United have one eye on the potentially season-defining visit to Leipzig on Tuesday, making four changes to the team sent out against PSG. Bruno Fernandes and Marcus Rashford drop to the bench, while David de Gea and Fred miss out altogether. Dean Henderson, Paul Pogba, Donny van de Beek and Mason Greenwood step up. West Ham United: Fabianski, Balbuena, Ogbonna, Cresswell, Coufal, Rice, Soucek, Masuaku, Bowen, Fornals, Haller. Subs: Benrahma, Lanzini, Snodgrass, Noble, Diop, Johnson, Randolph. Manchester United: Henderson, Wan-Bissaka, Lindelof, Maguire, Telles, McTominay, Pogba, Greenwood, van de Beek, Martial, Cavani. Subs: Mata, Rashford, Grant, Fernandes, Matic, Williams, Tuanzebe. Referee: Andre Marriner (West Midlands). This is one of those fixtures that delivers more often than not. See! This evening should be no different. West Ham are in great form at the moment, having won their last three Premier League games, and five of their last eight. They\u2019ve even worked out how to win ugly, which they did against Aston Villa on Monday night, a fact David Moyes was more than happy to admit. Sign of a good team, right? Which is what the Hammers, quietly, are threatening to become. A third successive win over Manchester United at home is on. Manchester United will have other ideas. A four-game winning run came to an end on Wednesday night at the hands of Neymar, and there\u2019s no shame in that. That sequence of victories included a comprehensive dismantling of Everton, an aesthetic abomination against West Brom, and one of those spectacular never-say-die wins, against Southampton, that used to be their calling card when they were on top. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is getting more things right than wrong, albeit mainly on the road, where they\u2019re currently eight wins on the bounce, club-record behaviour. With both teams in good nick, everyone involved will fancy their chances. An evening of top-class entertainment stretches out ahead of us ... and the 2,000 lucky fans who return to the London Stadium tonight to give the hosts a boost and the visitors the what-for. It\u2019s on! Kick off: 5.30pm GMT."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
