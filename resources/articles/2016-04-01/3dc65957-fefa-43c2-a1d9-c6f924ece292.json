This middle section is the \u201cdesolate\u201d one, as opposed to the \u201crestless\u201d first episode or the \u201cenchanted\u201d third part, yet to come. The desolation manifests itself in the final five minutes, although it perfumes the entire film. As before, Scheherazade (Crista Alfaiate) narrates and we hear three more tales, supposedly selected from the 470th, 484th and 497th nights of her ordeal (there is a gigantic epic somewhere out there, of which this huge trilogy is just a sample). There are erotic images of naked women, a visual rhyme for the young virgins of Baghdad in the first film. The tales are The Chronicle of the Escape of Sim\u00e3o \u201cWithout Bowels\u201d; The Tears of the Judge and The Owners of Dixie. In the first, Sim\u00e3o is a notorious mass killer (his \u201cwithout bowels\u201d nickname is down to his thinness) who is being hunted by police with a drone camera. The narrator notes that \u201cevil is only a severe tendency of selfishness\u201d, and shows that public disaffection with everything turns Sim\u00e3o into a folk hero. In the second, a judge is reduced to tears at a surreal, outdoor legal proceeding, like A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream of judicial madness. Every crime has its origin in another crime \u2013 including a rich landlord making prank emergency calls to undermine Portugal\u2019s public health service \u2013 and the wrongdoings are impossible to disentangle. In the third, a stray dog called Dixie is adopted by a melancholy elderly couple and given to an impoverished younger pair reliant on food banks. The effect of these movies \u2013 part realist, part dream-like \u2013 is gradual and yet very potent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
