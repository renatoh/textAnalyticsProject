The first came from their Great Britain hooker Keiron Cunningham, who was not even supposed to be playing after being carried off in Thursday night's 40-6 thrashing at London Broncos. But Cunningham showed astonishing pace in his cover defence to run down Mark Smith, then used phenomenal strength to stop him grounding the ball over the line. At that stage Saints were leading only 2-0 but within two minutes they finally broke the try deadlock. Tommy Martyn, a gifted but unpredictable stand-off, did the trick with a breathtaking piece of skill. He regathered his own grubber-kick behind the Wigan defence and then sent Peter Shiels over by passing to his left while looking the other way. Gary Connolly, the Wigan full-back, was left floundering and the capacity 15,100 crowd simply amazed, until the Saints majority raised the roof. They knew they had witnessed something special. Yet Martyn was not finished as he scored a secondtry himself from a Sean Long kick and then added a 30-metre drop-goal. \"Tommy's special,\" said the Saint's coach Ian Millward afterwards. \"I could speak about him for half an hour. But I reckon that (Cunningham) tackle would go down as the greatest tackle I've seen in my coaching career. I woke up this morning 99% sure he wouldn't play, and I've got a funny feeling that was really hurting him. He's one super athlete.\" Wigan's coach Stuart Raper agreed that Cunningham's tackle had been the turning point. \"If Mark Smith scores in the corner I could be sitting here smiling,\" he said. \"I'm disappointed but not disheartened.\" However, Wigan picked up worrying injuries to Paul Johnson and Julian O'Neill, forced off with respective knee and ankle problems. That drop-goal made it 15-love, appropriately enough in the week that the Rugby Football League appointed a former tennis administrator, Richard Lewis, as its first executive chairman, although Martyn ruined that gag by sending Tony Stewart over in the corner for a third Saints try in stoppage time. It was the first time Wigan have been whitewashed in the seven seasons of summer rugby, although against this St Helens team that was far from a disgrace. This was the 1001st Super League game and the Lancashire heavyweights launched the second millennium with a half which can rarely have been bettered in the competition. There were only two points, secured for St Helens with an 11th-minute offside penalty by Sean Long, but that was no reflection on a lack of attacking intent. Instead it was a tribute to the quality of the two defences. Andy Farrell produced a magnificent last-ditch effort to deny Darren Britt, and Paul Sculthorpe claimed a try but the video referee ruled that he had failed to touch the ball down.
