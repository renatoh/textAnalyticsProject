Once again, the MP for Birkenhead, scourge of Militant, welfare visionary and original new Labour thinker, has confirmed his rugged independence by voting against the government's licensing reforms. More than that, he has shown that a vital part of the cultural DNA of the Labour party has not died out. In Field's lonely stand against 24-hour opening, the Puritan tradition lives on, a political inheritance that is about to face its darkest hour in the implementation of Tessa Jowell's gambling act. It was Harold Wilson who suggested the Labour movement owed more to Methodism than Marx. He was right. For despite its avowedly secular intentions, the Labour party was from its earliest days joined at the hip to nonconformity. Its foundation place - Memorial Hall, London - is a monument to one of the defining moments in Puritan history - Charles II's ejection of dissenting ministers from the Church of England in 1662. And early membership of the Independent Labour party was frequently chapel-bred, finding its strongest electoral support in the nonconformist West Riding, County Durham and south Wales. The spirit of dissent was keenly felt by Keir Hardie, who regarded himself as fighting a modern civil war against the old Cavalier foe. As historian Raphael Samuel put it, Hardie was never happier than when expounding the socialist gospel in religious terms. Addressing striking railwaymen in the 1890s, the Labour leader did so with all the fervour of Cromwell rallying his Ironsides on the eve of Marston Moor. 'Come out from the house of bondage, fight for freedom, fight for manhood, fight for the coming day when in body, soul and spirit you will be free to live your own lives and give glory to your creator.' A more practical Puritan was London trade unionist John Burns. A Sabbatarian and teetotaller, Burns turned the London County Council into a committee for public morals. In his attempt to wean the working classes off drinking and gambling, the capital's music halls and pubs, together with Sunday trading, were all subject to LCC wrath. 'The tavern throughout the centuries has been the antechamber to the workhouse, the chapel of ease to the asylum, the recruiting station for the hospital, the rendezvous of the gambler, and the gathering ground of the jail,' Burns declared in a lecture on 'Labour and Drink'. The cult of abstinence continued into the 20th century in the form of Stafford Cripps, along with equally ardent teetotaller Tony Benn. But Benn's serially destructive political career also revealed the negative impact of Puritanism. In Labour circles, his Manichaean world view of right and wrong passed into the language of socialist betrayal. No wonder the likes of Tony Crosland and Roy Jenkins, who believed in power and permissive politics, railed at such dogma. Crosland hated the Puritan tradition with its Fabian pamphlets and tea-drinking seminars. For Crosland, the future of socialism was about joy. In his 1956 revisionist classic, The Future of Socialism, he argued for 'liberty and gaiety in private life, more open-air cafes, brighter and gayer streets at night, later closing hours for public houses, more local repertory theatres, better and more hospitable hoteliers and restaurateurs, brighter and cleaner eating houses, more riverside cafes, more pleasure gardens on the Battersea model, more murals and pictures in public places... and so on ad infinitum'. This is the tradition new Labour has embraced. Early on, Peter Mandelson set the tone when he said the government was 'intensely relaxed about people getting filthy rich'. Similarly, Tony Blair declared it was never a burning ambition of his 'to make sure that David Beckham earns less money'. And like his late mentor Jenkins, who always valued duchesses above the Diggers, the Prime Minister has never had much time for 'prolier than thou' personal asceticism. More recently, this liberal tone has come to dictate social policy. The extension to opening hours, egged on by traditional Tory brewing interests, constitutes an extraordinary disavowal of the Puritan tradition. Perhaps that is why in Scotland, home to the kirk and heart of the temperance movement, ministers are in the middle of a messy U-turn on the legislation. Back in England, Downing Street advances something called 'grown-up liberalism' in place of paternalist socialism. Now we have the gambling reforms. One single piece of legislation encompasses almost everything Hardie, Burns and the early Labour movement opposed: super-casinos with 1,250 jackpot gaming machines open 24 hours a day. Although the planned 40 super-sized casinos are now down to one mega casino, together with a further eight 'large casinos', the reforms remain seismic. Previous restrictions on visitor identity, jackpot sizes and advertising have been junked. While many will welcome plans to remove slot machines from places where children have access, is it necessary for the party of Sabbatarianism to make on-course betting available on Good Friday (with Christmas Day dropped from initial legislation)? Yet despite its killjoy reputation, Puritanism is about more than just banning earthly pleasures. Certainly, the Labour party pioneers hoped to discipline the feckless working classes and make politics their pastime. But they were also concerned with the exploitation of those employed by drinking, gambling and entertainment businesses. Restrictions on Sunday trading and opening hours were about protecting the workers as much as abolishing fun. Many pointed to the precedent of the Long Parliament which enacted unprecedented holidays for apprentices and servants. Should we not now be hearing something from ministers about those who are going to have to work these longer hours in pubs and casinos? As with the drinking legislation, gambling reforms are on a two-year delay. Without a government rethink, it seems we must look again to Frank Field to put aside his own Anglican sympathies, take up the Puritan cudgels and fight the good fight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
