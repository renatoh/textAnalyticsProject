He's given their attack a new dimension and both Jermain Defoe and the midfield are benefiting. West Ham were written off by most people a few weeks ago but they've given themselves a fighting chance of avoiding relegation and I think Ferdinand's got a lot to do with that. At 36 he won't often last 90 minutes but he's like a spirit leader for the team and other players, including Defoe, get confidence off him. Ferdinand set up Defoe's opening goal on Saturday and it has helped Defoe to be playing alongside a genuine target man. When I saw Defoe earlier in the season he was the point of West Ham's attack and having to do a lot of physical stuff that he shouldn't be. He's much more of a support striker and this set-up is ideal for him. He can now gamble with his runs off the ball, knowing Ferdinand will win a good percentage of anything upstairs. It came off for his goal when David James hit a massive free-kick on top of Ferdinand, who knocked the ball down for Defoe to score. With Ferdinand West Ham are able to turn defence into attack very quickly, particularly with James being an accurate, big kicker. Opposing defenders are forced to retreat to deal with Ferdinand's aerial threat and the possibility of him flicking something over the top for Defoe. That stretches the game and gives West Ham's quality midfielders more space to play in."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
