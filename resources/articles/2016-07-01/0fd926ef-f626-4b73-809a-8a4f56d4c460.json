Thousands of the Silver Y moths \u2013 Autographa gamma \u2013 are winging their way from the continent to Britain, and while they will not match the many millions that swarmed as far north as Shetland in 1996, experts are predicting a strong year. \u201cIt\u2019s looking like it\u2019s going to be an above average year, providing the conditions are right and there\u2019s a southerly wind,\u201d said Zoe Randle, a surveys officer at the charity Butterfly Conservation. The species is relatively unremarkable to look at, no threat to woolly jumpers and no serious risk to crops as its caterpillars eat a variety of plants, but it does make an incredible migratory journey. A study by Rothamsted Research using radar found that the 2cm-long moths use winds to blast across the sea at speeds of up to 60mph, or as much as six times faster than their own flight speed. They select the altitude where the wind speeds are fastest \u2013 200-1,000 metres above ground \u2013 and can travel up to 250 miles in one night. \u201cIt\u2019s cool that something so small can travel such long distances at such great speeds. It\u2019s pretty remarkable,\u201d said Randle. The species, which takes its name from the silver Y-shapes on its wings, is among the top 20 being counted in the Big Butterfly Count, a citizen science survey which starts across the UK tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
