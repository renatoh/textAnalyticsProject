The recording studio where Elvis got his start is now a museum with tours led every hour by local musicians. You'll get a history of rock'n'roll's beginnings, get to stand in the room where Elvis cut his early tracks, and get to touch (or pose for pictures with) the studio's legendary microphone. If you have to wait for your tour to start, have a milkshake in the lobby \u2013 they're some of the best in town. \u2022 706 Union Avenue, +1 901 521 0664, sunstudio.com. Open daily from 10am-6pm, tours at half past every hour, $12 See a concert at Levitt Shell At the beginning of his career, Elvis performed at the bandshell in the middle of Overton Park in midtown, Memphis. These days, the Shell is the home of a summer and autumn concert series that brings bands from all over the world to Memphis for free. Outdoor shows every Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday in May, June, August and September. \u2022 1928 Poplar Avenue, +1 901 272 2722, levittshell.org Have breakfast at the Arcade Restaurant When you go to the Arcade for breakfast, try to get a seat at the Elvis booth towards the back of the restaurant (it was apparently his favourite). Even if you can't get the coveted seat, you can still gorge yourself on the restaurant's fantastic sweet potato pancakes and other classic southern breakfast treats. The Arcade is one of the oldest restaurants in Memphis and the classic retro decor hasn't changed in years. \u2022 540 South Main Street, +1 901 526 5757, arcaderestaurant.com. Open daily 7am-3pm Stay the night in Elvis's apartment Before Elvis was a big deal, he was a high-school kid living in the Lauderdale Courts apartments with his parents from 1949-53. Today, Lauderdale Courts has been transformed into Uptown Square, a community of classy condos and upscale apartments, but you can still tour (and spend the night in) Elvis' old digs \u2013 apartment 328 \u2013 which has been decorated as it would have been when the Presleys were in residence. It can be a little eerie to stay the night, but it should be on any hardcore fan's bucket list. \u2022 188 Exchange Avenue, Memphis, +1 901 523 8662, lauderdalecourts.com/home, $250 per night (plus tax)\u200e Pay your respects at the Candlelight Vigil The Candlelight Vigil is Elvis Week's main event, and the only one that captures the week's unique blend of reverence, kitsch and fun. It's also one of those things that you've got to do at least once before you die. The vibe is part-funeral (you can wait in line to file reverently past the grave with a candle) and part block party (people set up makeshift shrines on the street and hang out next to them in lawn chairs). The Vigil starts at 8.30pm on 15 August and goes on until everyone who's wanted to has had a chance to pay their respects. \u2022 15 August annually. Graceland, 3734 Elvis Presley Boulevard, +1 901 332 3329, elvis.com/elvisweek\u200e Stay at the Heartbreak Hotel The closest hotel to Graceland is also the most Elvis-y. Each of the 128 rooms at the glittering, flamboyant Heartbreak Hotel has some sort of Elvis touch, but the most amazing rooms are the themed suites. If you're not staying at the hotel, you can always have a drink (perhaps a Blue Hawaiian) at the bar. \u2022 3677 Elvis Presley Boulevard +1 901 332 1000, elvis.com/graceland/heartbreak_hotel. Doubles from $115 Shop at Lansky Bros Elvis was more than a musical icon \u2013 he was also a style guru, known for his crazy colour combinations, tight jumpsuits and lots of sequins. That's a little too much look to get at the mall: to shop like Elvis, you have to shop local, particularly, at Lansky Bros. The clothing store, which was founded on Beale Street in 1946, is now located in the lobby of the Peabody Hotel. It still carries high-end menswear, including some of the styles that were designed for Elvis. \u2022 Peabody Hotel, 149 Union Avenue, +1 901 529 9070, peabodymemphis.com Take your picture with the Elvis statue on Beale Street Elvis Presley has been dead for 36 years, but in Memphis, he's everywhere. There's no better place to take a picture with him, though, than the statue on Beale Street. It could have been a simple statue, but the sculptor took the time to add detail to the guitar and get the sneer just right. \u2022 Beale Street, Memphis Tour Memphis in a vintage Caddy Tad Pierson can show you things that don't make it into any of the standard Memphis guidebooks. He'll pick you up in his vintage pink Cadillac and squire you around town to Memphis' more obscure musical history landmarks, or to a handful of the city's coolest blues halls and juke joints. \u2022 American Dream Safari, +1 901 527 8870, americandreamsafari.com Visit the Elvis shrine at Goner Records The greatest Elvis shrine in Memphis is at Goner Records in Cooper-Young. Drop a quarter in the shrine's coin slot and listen to Elvis tunes and behold its majesty. The shrine is made of all kinds of things \u2013 beads, glitter, picture frames, action figures and a single blue-suede shoe. After you check out the shrine, browse the shop for vintage and new vinyl, magazines, posters and T-shirts. \u2022 2152 Young Avenue, +1 901 722 0095, goner-records.com.
