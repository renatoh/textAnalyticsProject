Six House of Commons select committees announced the assembly on Thursday. It is the second of the three demands made by the Extinction Rebellion protest group to be addressed. However, the group have criticised the initiative as it wants the assembly\u2019s decisions to be binding, not advisory. Parliament declared a climate emergency in May, but the third Extinction Rebellion demand \u2013 action to cut emissions to net zero by 2025 \u2013 has not been met. Theresa May followed official advice and set 2050 as the date for the end of greenhouse gas emissions earlier in June, making the UK the first major economy to do so. A citizens\u2019 assembly is a representative group of members of the public who come together to learn about and debate issues, and come to conclusions on the best solutions. Parliament has had such assemblies before, for example to assess social care. The climate assembly will take place over a series of weekends in the autumn but the people and locations are yet to be determined. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a challenge for just one parliament, one political party, or one generation; to achieve net zero by 2050 we need to build cross-party and cross-generational support for the actions needed to deliver it,\u201d said Rachel Reeves MP, chair of the business, energy and industrial strategy (BEIS) committee. She said there needed to be both strong government action and buy-in from the public for the environmental, health and employment benefits that achieving zero emissions could bring to be realised. \u201cI hope the citizens\u2019 assembly will demonstrate that, when all is considered, there is strong public support \u2013 even demand \u2013 for the government to take the action necessary,\u201d she said. Greg Clark MP, the secretary of state responsible for climate action, welcomed the citizens\u2019 assembly. \u201cInitiatives to engage the public will be vitally important to appreciating the challenges of getting to net zero and giving people a say in shaping the future policies to achieve the target,\u201d he said. But Roger Hallam, from Extinction Rebellion, said: \u201cWe have a citizens\u2019 assembly that will give recommendations. Everyone knows what that means, which is it will come out with some ideas and get ignored, like people have been ignored for the last 30 years.\u201d \u201cIf you are going to do a citizens\u2019 assembly it has to have teeth and be legally binding,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are facing a dire existential emergency. It\u2019s what the UN is saying, what scientists are saying \u2013 the only people who haven\u2019t taken it on board are politicians around the world.\u201d Cutting emissions to zero will require the further introduction of renewable energy and electric cars, the end of gas heating and cooking in homes, restrained flying and meat-eating and the planting of 1.5bn trees to absorb any remaining carbon dioxide. But measures such as a diesel tax in France have been seen as unfair. Extinction Rebellion mounted large-scale protests in April and young people inspired by the teenage Swedish activist Greta Thunberg have put further pressure on politicians to act rapidly. The government has already announced that young people will advise ministers on how the UK should meet the net zero target. Extinction Rebellion is also protesting in the Scottish parliament on Thursday to demand a citizens\u2019 assembly. Areeba Hamid, at Greenpeace UK, said: \u201cThe citizens\u2019 assembly shows our politicians are starting to take this major existential threat a bit more seriously, but for it to work, it needs to be more than just a glorified public consultation. Will ministers be forced to take its conclusions into account or will they be able to brush them aside as they have done with countless consultations before? The solutions to tackle the climate emergency have been around for decades \u2013 what\u2019s been lacking is the political will to make it happen.\u201d The House of Commons select committees organising the citizens assembly are BEIS, environmental audit, housing, communities and local government, science and technology, transport and treasury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
