All eyes to Tuesday\u2019s crucial vote. Thanks for joining us! James Cleverly is back on social media already, reiterating the divisions among opponents to the deal \u2013 a strategy that Downing Street have been seen to increasingly pursue. However, he stopped short of claiming victory. The hastiness of the debate allowed for few direct political points to be scored, with Cleverly, Gardiner, Lucas, and Rees-Mogg largely speaking rhetorically rather than addressing each other\u2019s points (although at one stage the debate was temporarily reduced to a head-to-head between Lucas and Rees-Mogg). Nonetheless, tonight\u2019s format gave the panel scant time to articulate a comprehensive alternative to Theresa May\u2019s proposed deal. However, Channel 4 was congratulated for providing \u201cmuch needed reflection of the main strands of parliamentary problem ahead\u201d. My overriding thought right now is reminiscent of many following the general election debate in 2017, in which Theresa May abstained. It feels that somehow - yet again - our leaders are not subjecting themselves to adequate scrutiny. Here are more highlights from the hour long event: Labour has posted a video of Barry Gardiner\u2019s opening statement: As have the Tories for their man: Caroline Lucas\u2019s is here: And, Rees-Mogg: Here are the closing statements: Theresa May\u2019s deal would rip the country in half, Gardiner says, suggesting that it would satisfy nobody. \u201cLabour\u2019s deal secures your job and your future.\u201d Cleverly criticises the positions of the other three panellists on by one and says \u201cLets just take the deal and get out,\u201d as the debate ends. Guru-Murthy thanks the four debaters for attending, lamenting that May and Corbyn were absent. I\u2019ll post more comprehensive quotes from the debate shortly. \u201cThe only honourable thing to do [if the government loses Tuesday\u2019s vote] would be to hold a general election and step aside,\u201d says Gardiner. Theresa May will have ceased to function as a prime minister in such a case, the Labour shadow minister claims. Rees-Mogg reiterates that the Tories and Labour both said they would implement the result of the referendum in their 2017 manifestos. He has continually criticised the people\u2019s vote campaign, directing his ire towards Lucas. \u201cThis is all about trust,\u201d he says. \u201cAcross Europe politicians are distrusted - there are riots in France and troubles in Italy. \u201cEverybody agreed to accept the result of the referendum. Now Theresa May has said one thing and come back with a deal that does another.\u201d Guru-Murthy then speaks to an audience member who is in favour of a WTO set of rules, under a no deal. Another says such a course would be an \u201cabsolute tragedy\u201d, Theresa May\u2019s deal would be better. A final audience member says we need a people\u2019s vote, and the debate comes to an end! Time to revisit the New Statesman\u2019s profile of Jacob Rees-Mogg, says the magazines political editor. Gardiner says that we need another general election, but Lucas says that Labour\u2019s position would not be all that dissimilar to the Conservatives\u2019. A people\u2019s vote would be the best way to tackle the grotesque inequalities in the UK, Lucas says. Rees-Mogg asks whether she would then want a third or fourth referendum, presumably if the result did not go in the direction she preferred. Lucas then highlights historic hypocrisy on Rees-Mogg\u2019s part. This is turning into a bit of an argument between the two. The younger generation will be more betrayed than anyone else, says Lucas in response \u201cOne thing that is already clear by tonight is that this decision cannot be left to the politicians. We simply can\u2019t agree. \u201cThis not a parlour game or debating society. These are real people with real lives\u201d That\u2019s why the people need to have their say, she says. \u201cA people\u2019s vote would be your first chance to vote upon the facts. \u201cDon\u2019t leave it to the Westminster elite to decide for you,\u201d she says to whoops and cheers. Earlier she suggested that people campaigning for a no-deal are only doing so because they would be insulated from the ramifications of that course of action. Everyone poses for a selfie taken by tonight\u2019s host. Barry Gardiner and Jacob Rees-Mogg have just given their opening statements. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t be talking about hard remain or soft remain,\u201d Rees-Mogg says, asking if politicians will do away with their promises. \u201cI\u2019m dealing with the 17.4m voters who won,\u201d he goes on to say. Barry Gardiner demurs that it will not be hedge fund managers that will suffer, its normal people. Normal people will have their rights eroded, he proclaims. \u201cThe hedge fund managers voted remain,\u201d Rees-Mogg says. He then implores Labour to win an election if they want to implement their proposals, rather than leaving it to the EU. Channel 4\u2019s format \u201cisn\u2019t fruitful for Downing St\u201d, says Business Insider\u2019s Adam Payne. ITV and the BBC had been competing to host a debate, under differing formats, between May and Corbyn. Damien Gayle\u2019s report from today\u2019s marches is now live: Here we have quotes from the first half of the debate. Tory deputy chairman James Cleverly said: Our deal delivers on what people voted for. It takes back control of our money, our borders, our laws. It means we can get on with Brexit and give more time to focus on other important issues like the NHS. The only thing we know for sure is that rejecting this deal means damaging uncertainty and, as a Brexiteer, the thing that worries me the most is the risk we do not leave the EU at all. But Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said the deal \u201cdoes not do what the Prime Minister said\u201d on the customs union, the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and a border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. There are 68 pages of laws that will apply in Northern Ireland that will be adjudicated and made by the European Union. Caroline Lucas says that this is about \u201cdelivering on the promises of Brexit\u201d and \u201cthis deal doesn\u2019t deliver on the promises\u201d. \u201cSo we\u2019re not exactly taking back control,\u201d says Lucas. \u201cYou know, we know, that we\u2019re not going to be any better off under this deal.\u201d James Cleverly, arguing in favour of the government\u2019s position, says that rejecting the deal would spell \u201cdamaging uncertainty\u201d. He claims that the Bank of England is in fact projecting economic growth, despite doomsday forecast recently. Labour\u2019s Barry Gardiner concedes the point but contends this would nonetheless mean that the UK will be worse off than it would be otherwise. He adds that we need a deal to protect jobs amid record levels of poverty, homelessness and food bank use. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the European Research Group which is advocating for a hard Brexit, says that the current deal means that the UK will still be subject to some EU laws. People did not vote to still be under control of the European Court of Justice, he suggests, while the backstop agreement would mean the UK cannot leave unilaterally. Its worth mentioning that his voice is particularly croaky tonight. Cleverly accepts that there is no unilateral exit clause. \u201cECJ rules will be temporary\u201d during the transition period or backstop, he says, provoking chides from the other panellists while Rees-Mogg shot back, saying the Attorney General\u2019s advice showed \u201cthe backstop could be permanent\u201d. Tonight\u2019s debate is what the UK deserves, says Krishnan Guru-Murthy, as he introduces the panel of politicians who will tonight argue their respective positions as I outlined below. \u201cIts decision time on Brexit,\u201d says Guru-Murthy, who is well-known for his combative interviewing style. \u201cWill Theresa May\u2019s deal be done, is there a better way to leave the EU, or should we stop the whole thing with another referendum?\u201d Prior to the politicians\u2019 brief opening statements, which I shall sum up next, four audience members laid out their thoughts on Brexit, mirroring the four sets of opinions that the politicians are set to advocate for next. One says that workers rights must be protected, and if they cannot then there should be a people\u2019s vote, mirroring what appears to be Labour\u2019s current position. Another claims that Theresa May has behaved \u201ctreasonously\u201d in moving the UK towards a soft Brexit. Another criticises the fact that the UK is likely to be worse off under all the possible Brexit scenarios. The health service is struggling, she says, and now is not the time to end freedom of movement. A fourth and final attendee, supporting Theresa May\u2019s position, says that what we have on the table is a \u201cviable deal\u201d which protects business. \u201cWe must back ourselves as a nation,\u201d he says. We\u2019re now going to round up our coverage of today\u2019s \u201cBrexit betrayal\u201d counter-protest, which vastly outnumbered the UKIP-organised demonstration attended by far-right figurehead Tommy Robinson. I will link to Damien Gayle\u2019s report once it is up. We will now look ahead to Channel 4\u2019s Real Brexit Debate which shall begin at 7pm. It will be fought between Conservative party deputy chairman James Cleverly MP, Labour MP Barry Gardiner, each supporting their party\u2019s position; as well as Caroline Lucas MP who will argue in favour of a People\u2019s Vote, and Jacob-Rees Mogg who is backing a no-deal Brexit. We\u2019ll bring you news from that as it comes. A broad coalition of antiracist groups attended a counter protest attended by a multicultural crowd of around 15,000 people, mainly young protesters marching under placards saying \u201cno to racism; no to fascism\u201d, \u201coppose Tommy Robinson\u201d, and \u201cfuck fascism\u201d. Police held thousands of stop Tommy Robinson protesters in Trafalgar Square and only let them into Whitehall in groups in a tactic which could have been to prevent them breaching a cordon intended to stop them clashing with Brexit Betrayal marchers who gathered at the south end of Whitehall Momentum national co-ordinator Laura Parker said today was a \u201chuge blow\u201d for Tommy Robinson, who now has the Ukip machine \u201cin tow\u201d Today is a huge blow for Tommy Robinson and his vile, hate-fuelled politics. Even with the Ukip machine in tow he only managed to bring a few thousand supporters out on the streets, while we mobilised nearly 15,000 to march against his racism and bigotry. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan became the latest member of the shadow cabinet to declare their support for the People\u2019s Vote campaign for a second referendum Officers said three arrests had been made, all from among the counter-protest group. We are unaware of any significant clashes between the rival protestors, however, there were verbal confrontations between antiracist protesters and hecklers in Trafalgar Square, promoting police to move in and more tightly manage the crowd. Police imposed restrictions on freedom of assembly around Westminster over fears of a violent confrontation between opposing demonstrations. Pro-Brexit demonstrators accused Theresa May of compromising over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU A march in support of Tommy Robinson\u2019s \u201cBrexit Betrayal\u201d rally in London failed to materialise. Organised by a group called the Mersey Nationalists it was due to take place in Liverpool today, the Liverpool Echo reported Labour MPs were quick to criticise a protestor who attended the march carrying a noose suspended on a wooden frame, with Karen Buck saying it was \u201cvery, very wrong\u201d. Alex Sobel said: \u201cThis is what actual fascism looks like.\u201d Hope Not Hate said the march had been \u201cabsolutely riven with ugly messages and symbolism\u201d. Away from the marches, three MPs hinted that they would consider succeeding Theresa May at prime minister as we approach the crucial vote on Wednesday A Stand Up To Racism representative earlier told the crowd that some 15,000 attended today\u2019s counter-demonstration. Co-organiser and the organisation\u2019s joint convener Weyman Bennett said: \u201cI believe that the majority of people in this country reject fascism and racism. \u201cWe\u2019ve had unprecedented unity. All of us have come together from whatever party or faction we represent and have agreed that we have to march together to defend our democratic rights.\u201d My colleague Damien Gayle, meanwhile, has found a man playing Luis Fonsi\u2019s Despacito on an accordion on Westminster Bridge. The \u201cBrexit Betrayal\u201d rally ended promptly at 3.30pm - the time that police had stipulated that protesters must begin to disperse - after hearing a second and final speech from Tommy Robinson, the de facto leader of the movement. He called on all those present to join Ukip. Addressing the crowd, he said he was among the 30-40% of people who don\u2019t vote. \u201cI\u2019ve never voted because there is no one to vote for,\u201d he said. Now, with move to the right from Ukip, which recently admitted Robinson as a member, Britain would have a populist party of its own to vote for, he said. \u201cUkip can be a voice for the working class communities,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cno other politician will talk about Islam; no other politician will talk about the issues affecting our country.\u201d The Metropolitan police reported three arrests, including one for assault, one for possession of an offensive weapon and one for a public order offence, all on the antiracist side. Dr Rosena Allin-Khan,has become the latest member of the shadow cabinet to declare their support for the People\u2019s Vote campaign. Allin-Khan, the MP for Tooting, in south London, and Labour\u2019s shadow minister for sport, speaking at the People\u2019s Vote and Best for Britain rally, said: I launched a local Brexit Poll, asking people to give me their views on the Brexit deal and today, I published the results - 90% of local people want a People\u2019s Vote. Parliament has a decision to make in the next few days which will alter the course of history for the UK, for us and for our children. The current government is run on confidence and supply, but let\u2019s be straight \u2013 confidence is in very short supply. Let\u2019s end the economic uncertainty, let\u2019s end the fear mongering - and let\u2019s have a campaign on the facts. If calls for a general election are rejected - I\u2019ll be backing a People\u2019s Vote. Just to let you know, comments have now closed but the blog will continue. As well as the Brexit Betrayal march and the counter-demonstration in central London there is a People\u2019s Vote and Best for Britain rally in east London today. Lord Heseltine said: Let us make our position clear. We are the British patriots. We want a Britain at the heart of Europe because we want the voice of Britain, the tolerance of Britain, the culture of Britain, at the heart of Europe. We are proud of our Commonwealth and empire. Our voice is their voice in Europe. It is the Brexiteers who seek to belittle us, to undermine our influence, to slam windows, to close doors with the suggestion that our membership of the European community blunts our influence. Caroline Lucas, Green party MP, told the crowd there was a clear message to Theresa May: We don\u2019t want your vision of a mean-minded little Britain, with our borders closed and our horizons narrowed. We don\u2019t want a future that betrays the hopes and dreams of our young people, who overwhelmingly want to stay inside the European Union. We say that Britain is better than that, we deserve better than that. Philip Lee, Conservative MP and former minister, told the rally: I think a People\u2019s Vote is the best hope that we have of reuniting our country after this sorry episode. Let\u2019s grasp this opportunity, let\u2019s take back control, let\u2019s have a People\u2019s Vote. The rally in London\u2019s ExCel centre, is also being addressed by Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable, Tory former minister Anna Soubry and celebrities including Charles Dance and Jason Isaacs. Several thousands of pro-brexit supporters rallied at the bottom of Whitehall listening intently to speeches from Gerrard Batten, Neil Hamilton and Carl Benjamin. Hamilton said he had spent 50 years fighting against British integration with \u201cthe globalist European elite\u201d. He said: Populist movements are on the rise across Europe. Why is it that otherwise peaceful, law-abiding people are now setting Paris ablaze? It\u2019s because they are not represented by their president, who is an agent of a foreign power. Among those watching was Madeleine Jenkins, 72, from Brentwood. She said: It\u2019s a totally fake deal and we want to go to WTO rules. It shouldn\u2019t be frightening because we don\u2019t want to belong to a communist state. We want to be independent and I think you will find the Eastern European countries also wouldn\u2019t want to be in what its become, because the just got out of a totalitarian state. The European Council president, Donald Tusk, says that he has spoken to Theresa May ahead of an \u201cimportant week\u201d (he is obviously a master of understatement). Tusk does not elaborate on whether May \u201chandbagged\u201d him (The Sunday Times reported that the prime minister was preparing to \u201chandbag\u201d Brussels in an attempt to win concessions and was prepared to delay the vote while she did so). Damien Gayle says he has spotted a flag with the symbol of Generation Identity, the expanding far-right network, at the Brexit Betrayal march. Away from the marches, three MPs have hinted that they would consider succeeding Theresa May at prime minister as we approach the crucial vote on Wednesday, my colleagues Dan Sabbagh and Jessica Elgot report: Boris Johnson, Esther McVey and Dominic Raab all refused to rule out leadership bids and called on May to persuade the EU to ditch the backstop and withhold some of the \u00a339bn divorce bill, though Brussels has said no further negotiation is possible. A Momentum spokeswoman told the Press Association that about 15,000 people have turned up to oppose Tommy Robinson\u2019s march, claiming it \u201cvastly\u201d outnumbered those on the Brexit Betrayal march by nearly five to one. A Ukip spokesman said \u201cquite a few thousand\u201d had turned up to its rally. Police did not provide estimates on crowd sizes. Damien Gayle spoke to Momentum\u2019s national coordinator, Laura Parker. She said: I just think it\u2019s really important that everyone from Labour, from the broader Labour movement, from the trade union movement comes out and makes it clear that we will not have fascists on the streets of Britain in 2018. We have seen a terrifying rise of the right across Europe, in Hungary, in Poland. We have got Trump in America, Bolsonaro in Brazil and Tommy Robinson wandering around London. It has just got to be stopped. Police have been holding thousands of stop Tommy Robinson protesters in Trafalgar Square and only letting them into Whitehall in groups. The tactic could be to stop them rushing a cordon intended to stop them clashing with Brexit Betrayal marchers led by Robinson, who are gathering at the south end of Whitehall after marching from Park Lane via Parliament Square. Here is video footage from the Brexit Betrayal march and the counter-demonstration: A march by a group called the Mersey Nationalists was due to take place in Liverpool today in support of Tommy Robinson\u2019s Brexit Betrayal march in London but it failed to materialise, the Liverpool Echo reports. It said: They had insisted the march would be to protest against the government\u2019s \u2018Brexit Betrayal\u2019 - but anti-fascism campaigners said the group were about \u2018whipping up racism\u2019. And more than a hundred people with anti-racism flags and placards gathered in the city centre to show their opposition to the group... It appears that the counter-protestors might have scared Mersey Nationalists off, with organisers of the declaring victory after the group had failed to show up hours after the demonstration was set to start. Last month, a far-right group abandoned plans to march through Liverpool after members were visibly outnumbered by counter-demonstrators, including the mayor of the city, Joe Anderson. This is awful to see. There were verbal confrontations between antiracist protesters and hecklers in Trafalgar Square, promoting police to move in and more tightly manage the crowd. In an echo of an anti-facist chant, one man shouted \u201cleft wing scum, off our streets,\u201d at protesters making their way into Whitehall. He was confronted by another man who shouted in his face: \u201cWe\u2019re black, white, Asian and we\u2019re Jew. Fuck off!\u201d My colleague, Damien Gayle, has been speaking to people at the counter-demonstration to the Brexit Betrayal march: Here are some photos from the Brexit Betrayal march, which accuses Theresa May of compromising over Britain\u2019s exit from the EU and the counter-demonstration protesting at the march\u2019s links to the far-right. Pro-Europe former Conservative minister Dominic Grieve has warned the Conservative party could split as a result of Brexit. He told Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: There is a risk the party will split and cannot continue in its current form... I can see that this is of such a fundamental character this issue that it may be the end of the Conservative party in its current form, and that bothers me very much because one of the products of Brexit has been total paralysis on virtually every other area of policy. Meanwhile out there there are lots of things that need to be tackled, which I as a Conservative would like to see tackled, and actually can co-operate with friends and colleagues who are Leavers if we were able to find the time and space to do it. Brexit is absorbing all our energy and slowly sort of paralysing us, and it applies to Labour as well. He said Boris Johnson would be a \u201cdisastrous leader\u201d, adding he would find it \u201cvery difficult in those circumstances to take the Conservative whip\u201d. However, fellow Tory MP Kwasi Kwarteng told BBC Radio 5 Live\u2019s Pienaar\u2019s Politics a split was not on the cards: I think one or two people might leave, I don\u2019t know who they will be, they might decide to retire or they might decide to abandon the party whip, that has happened before, but I don\u2019t think a full on split like there was in the 19th century is going to happen. Nigel Dodds , the DUP Westminster leader, said his party, which is propping up Theresa May, would continued to support her but it could not be relied upon if she did not deliver a satisfactory Brexit. He said the party was determined to defeat the government on Tuesday, dismissing May\u2019s threat that it could ultimately lead to Jeremy Corbyn entering Number 10. Speaking on Sophy Ridge On Sunday, he said: I don\u2019t think anyone realistically believes that - this is a scare story being put out by Theresa May because under the terms of the Fixed-term Parliaments Act everybody knows, even people in the Labour Party know, that\u2019s unlikely unless this deal were to go through. I think then clearly Theresa May would be in difficulty in terms of the parliamentary arithmetic. Police have imposed restrictions on freedom of assembly around Westminster today over fears of a violent confrontation between opposing demonstrations. Mounted riot police, and officers in riot gear were deployed outside the BBC on Portland place, where antiracist groups have been gathering for a march to Whitehall to oppose the \u201cstop Brexit betrayal\u201d demonstration led by the far-right figurehead Tommy Robinson. A multicultural crowd of thousands of mainly young protesters marched under placards saying \u201cno to racism; no to fascism\u201d, \u201coppose Tommy Robinson\u201d, and \u201cfuck fascism\u201d. Some had faces covered. Sources in antiracist groups have said some members were keen to find a way to block the opposing march Robinson\u2019s supporters have been gathering outside the Dorchester on Park Lane for a march through Victoria to Parliament Square and Whitehall. The Metropolitan police has said it will deploy officers on Whitehall to keep the opposing demonstrations apart. The force has set strict restrictions to the timings of each protest and the routes of their respective marches. \u201cBreach of the conditions is a criminal offence, and anyone breaching them may find themself [sic] liable to arrest,\u201d police said in a statement. \u201cThe decision to apply Section 12 and 14 of the Public Order Act was taken based on current tensions and concerns, the current intelligence picture about Sunday and previous marches and protests held by similar groups,\u201d the force said. \u201cTaking all these factors into consideration the MPS has made an operational policing decision to take this approach, and believe it to be proportionate in these specific circumstances.\u201d The former foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, like Esther McVey, has - unsurprisingly - refused to rule out leadership ambitions. Asked on BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show if he would promise not to stand against Theresa May, he said: I will give you an absolute, categorical promise that I will continue to advocate what I think is the most sensible plan. But Johnson said it was \u201cnonsense\u201d to suggest he had already begun offering fellow Tories jobs in a future administration. The real problem with the backstop arrangement is it gives the power to Brussels and to all the other EU member states effectively to blackmail us and to get what they want out of the future trade negotiation. The Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay was also on Andrew Marr and sought to quash speculation that the vote will be postponed. He told BBC\u2019s Andrew Marr show: The vote is going ahead. That\u2019s because it is a good deal, it\u2019s the only deal and it\u2019s important we don\u2019t let the perfect be the enemy of the good. He insisted there would no more negotiations with Brussels. The risk for those who say simply go back and ask again, the risk is that isn\u2019t necessarily a one-way street. The French, the Spanish and others will turn round, if we seek to reopen the negotiation, and ask for more. Unsurprisingly the front pages of the Sunday papers are dominated by Brexit. The prime minister used the Mail on Sunday to warn Tory MPs they risked handing the keys to Number 10 if they voted down her deal. May said the country would be in \u201cuncharted waters\u201d if the deal is rejected. It would mean grave uncertainty for the nation with a very real risk of no Brexit or leaving the European Union with no deal. We have a leader of the opposition who thinks of nothing but attempting to bring about a general election, no matter what the cost to the country. As someone who cares passionately about my country and my party, I believe Jeremy Corbyn getting his hands on power is a risk we cannot afford to take. The Sunday Telegraph leads on the resignation of Will Quince, the Colchester MP and aide to the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, who quit his post on Saturday night in protest at the Brexit deal, and the potential for more to leave in the next 48 hours. It says government whips have given Tory MPs until Sunday lunchtime to decide how they will vote. The Sunday Times suggests the vote could be delayed as the prime minister tries to \u201chandbag\u201d concessions from Brussels (\u00a3). The Observer says the cabinet is split over the issue of a second referendum. Finally, the Independent on Sunday says more than half of voters now want to remain in the EU. You can read a fuller round-up of the papers here: Good morning. With just two days to go until the crucial vote on Theresa May\u2019s Brexit blueprint, the debate over the best deal (if any) continues to play out in the media. Esther McVey, who resigned from the cabinet over the deal has said she would be willing to stand for the leadership if May went - not exactly a vote of confidence in the prime minister. She told Sky News\u2019s Sophy Ridge on Sunday: If people asked me, then of course you\u2019d give it serious thought and do it - if people asked me. But at the moment I\u2019m looking at who is in papers, who we can get behind but it shouldn\u2019t be about the personality, it should be about the country and this deal. McVey said that if May loses the vote on Tuesday she must \u201cimmediately\u201d go to the EU and \u201cget a better deal\u201d. She added: \u201cIf she doesn\u2019t, it is going to be very difficult for her.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
