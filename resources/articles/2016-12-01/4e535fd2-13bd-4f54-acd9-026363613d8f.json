By the Pentagon\u2019s account, the strike, which hit the Syrian village of Tokhar near Manbij, represents the single worst incidence of civilian casualties in the entire US war against Isis. But human rights monitors believe the US military is still undercounting the death toll, which is substantially lower than the ranges those monitors have compiled. The Syrian Network for Human Rights has listed, mostly by name, 98 men, women and children dead from the July airstrike. The human-rights monitor Airwars, based in the UK, assesses civilian deaths in the strike to range between 73 and 203. In a statement on Thursday, US central command (Centcom), said that an internal investigation had concluded that \u201cup to 24\u201d civilians died from the bombing. Key details of the incident remain unclear: the attack at Tokhar, near Manbij, occurred in the early morning hours of 19 July, local time. Centcom listed the date of the strike as 18 July, while saying that a different 19 July strike allegation, this one near Aleppo, did not in fact happen. But it had previously acknowledged that the airstrike in question occurred. Centcom said the civilian deaths resulted from Isis \u201cinterspers[ing]\u201d civilians with its fighters at an area identified as a staging ground for a \u201ccounterattack\u201d against US and proxy forces. At the time, the two sides had been locked in weeks of fierce fighting for control of Manbij, a waypoint for Isis to exfiltrate terrorists through Turkey, and \u2013 for the US coalition \u2013 the last obstacle southward to Isis\u2019 Syrian capital of Raqqa. The US said the airstrike targeted the area and \u201cinadvertently\u201d killed the non-combatants alongside nearly 100 Isis militants. \u201cUnknown to Coalition planners, civilians were moving around within the military staging area, even as other civilians in the nearby village had departed over the previous days,\u201d Centcom said in its statement. After various investigations into allegations of US-caused casualties, Centcom now believes that the US has inadvertently killed 173 people to date in a war that has entered its third year. But monitoring groups say that the US has systematically undercounted the civilian death toll of the war. \u201cOur own research indicates at least 330 civilians died in these same events. Even when [Centcom] confirmed cases, there appears to be under-reporting on these incidents,\u201d said Airwars\u2019 Chris Woods. Woods said he was \u201cvery pleased\u201d that Centcom acknowledged its role in the Manbij-area strike, though he noted the confusion in dates as to when the strike occurred. But he considered the variance in casualty figures alarming. \u201cHow can we only have 24 killed by the coalition, when we have such substantial reporting of civilian casualties that day?\u201d said Woods."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
