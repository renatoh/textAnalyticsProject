But an encounter that included three goals and two missed penalties at least ensured that they left their mark. All but the mathematicians had long since considered Bradford's fate a formality but, had they held on to their early lead or managed to convert either of their two spot-kicks in the second half, Jim Jefferies' team would still be hanging on.Everton, showing their customary profligacy in front of goal, were not the most merciless of executioners but goals from Duncan Ferguson and Niclas Alexandersson proved enough. While the home players embarked on what, considering their performances over the course of the season, was a rather ill-judged lap of honour, the Yorkshiremen, having kept the grim reaper at bay with victories in their previous two matches, accepted their fate without tears and without histrionics 'We made mistakes because we were attacking and left exposed, but at least we went down showing what we are capable of,' said Jefferies Bradford took only two minutes to show that with a goal that ensured an after noon of ulcer-inducing tension for the home fans. Andy Myers' was the first head to reach Benito Carbone's left-wing corner on the edge of the six-yard line, converting with the sort of authority that his team's strikers have failed to show for the bulk of the season. Everton's response was predictably urgent and the remainder of the half would largely be spent in prolonged, and ineffective, attacks on the visiting goal. Not until Walter Smith stressed the urgency of the situation and made a tactical reshuffle at half-time, did Everton inject a cutting edge into proceedings. Within a minute of the restart, Everton were level, after 62 minutes, they led. Ferguson finally converted one of the plethora of Everton chances when he placed Kevin Campbell's flick-on from Michael Ball's long throw through Gary Walsh's legs from six yards. The second goal, a clean left-foot Alexandersson strike from eight yards was the result of neat approach play and a cross from Scot Gemmill. Either side of that goal, Steve Watson conceded penalties, first for tripping Carbone, then for handling. In the 54th minute Robbie Blake's attempt was well saved by Paul Gerrard low to his right, 11 minutes later Carbone took over penalty responsibilities only to shoot high over the bar. 'It's been a difficult season for everybody,' said manager Walter Smith. 'I'm just glad we're not involved on the last couple of Saturdays.' So, too, one senses is Jim Jefferies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
