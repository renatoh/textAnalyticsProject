He goes past the potted quince and maple trees, past the bamboo and roses. \"It's a working-class thing, I suppose,\" he says, \"that need to get out of the house and go to work.\" For more than four decades, Birtwistle has had a studio in which to write - be it in Twickenham, or France, on the remote Hebridean island of Raasay or, now, in the Wiltshire village of Mere. But he has never yet had a private plot that's excited the gardening magazines so much, nor suited him quite so well. He knows every plant by name, and laid out much of the garden, including the water feature, himself. Some have seen its design as reflecting the composer's musical fascination with shape and structure, surface and facet. There used to be a silk factory on this site. Now Harrison Birtwistle makes music here. It's music that one might describe as many things - difficult, brilliant, avant-garde, light on tunes - but even his fondest admirers would be hard pushed to call it silken. As he strolls to work, he walks above the factory's concrete floor, now overlaid with beds and paths. In the studio he has his desk, a keyboard, a small heater, a nice view and - most important of all - no telephone. What is he writing? He looks bleakly through the conservatory windows and says: \"What aren't I writing?\" He has a way, this soft-pawed composer with his beard-softened face and gentle Accrington accent, of flintily returning questions to sender. What isn't he writing? Good question. At the moment he's very busy. He's writing a piece for the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols at King's College Cambridge, which will - fingers crossed - prompt mince pie-making conservatives to howl: \"I wanted God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen, not a fire in a pet shop!\" at the radio on Christmas Eve. He is also putting the finishing touches to a half-hour-long orchestral piece called Theseus Game, which receives its British premiere this weekend. It is a piece for two conductors and a large ensemble. \"I've often wanted to have two conductors when I've written pieces before,\" he says. \"I'm drawn to the idea of the musicians being pulled in two different directions and performing different and perhaps even contradictory roles.\" But these are only preludes to the Birtwistlian hoopla that will be 2004. To mark his 70th birthday next year, his operatic piece The Story of Io will be premiered at Aldeburgh festival. A new work for the Cleveland Orchestra will be performed next year at the Lucerne festival. There will be birthday concerts on the South Bank in London. He is starting to think about the new stage work commissioned for Covent Garden for 2007. It should be a fine commemorative year, celebrating the singular musical achievement of one of Britain's few genuinely great creative artists. But Birtwistle still worries about being misunderstood. \"When people ask me what I do when I write music, it's an impossible question to answer,\" he says. Right now he's wondering especially about what one man, who expressed an interest in hearing some of his oeuvre, will make of the recording he lent him recently. \"The chap who does the garden said he wanted to hear some of my music. I said only on condition that you set aside half an hour, put the thing on fairly loud and sit down and listen to it today and tomorrow. That's all that's required. \"I felt I had to lay down the law a bit. Most people have forgotten what music is. Music is not really for listening to any more. I think music has a real problem with popular culture nowadays.\" What do you mean? \"There is a direct line from the year 1000 to now in musical culture which is bypassed in popular culture. I have nothing against it. There have been some remarkable things in popular culture since the second world war.\" Like what? \"Oh you know,\" he says. He is, however, an unexpected champion of the Police: \"I thought they were pretty good. He can't act for toffee, though.\" What about Sting's solo music? Birtwistle stares silently out of the window. He is belatedly getting into Roy Orbison. Why? \"He's very cool. He has a proper expressive voice, like a good lieder singer. My premise is if it's interesting, it's worth a detour.\" Do you think your gardener will find your music worth the detour? \"Don't know. Can't even remember what I lent him.\" But there is, none the less, something in popular culture that repels him. \"I think why I so often write pieces about Theseus, Pan and Orpheus is because we've been stripped of those shared myths. In ancient Greece, everybody would know the story of Orestes before they went to see it performed. It was in their psyches. That's why I wrote an opera called Punch and Judy, and why I wrote one about Gawain. They're mythic stories that were part of all of us. That's one of the things missing in us.\" Only one of the things? \"There are a lot of things missing in our culture. Our individualism is a frustrated form of creativity. Look at the Sunday papers. There are pictures of people who get famous for nothing. They're looking serious about nothing.\" Birtwistle seems to be working himself into a froth; then he stops, perhaps so as not to disturb his wife Sheila, who is upstairs, unwell. \"What really makes me cross - oh I can't be bothered.\" Why not? \"I don't want to talk about that crap. I think it's bloody interesting what I do!\" Good point. Let's try to do the impossible and explain what Birtwistle does when he writes music. How did Theseus Game, for instance, come about? He answers with a question. \"Have you ever been to Lucca? If you go into a walled town, like Lucca, you find what you do is retrace your steps and approach piazzas from different angles. The nature of the place is concealed - like a ball of string.\" So does this have something to do with Theseus in the labyrinth, having slain the Minotaur, retracing his steps with Ariadne's thread? Birtwistle shakes his head sadly. \"It's not about the story,\" he says. \"Francis Bacon talked about 'the boredom of the story' and that's why I use myths. They've been told endlessly before; you don't have to do the boring work of creating them.\" But I thought you reckoned popular culture had messed so much with our collective psyche that we don't know those mythic narratives any more. \"That's a problem,\" he concedes. \"I used to read a lot of pulp fiction, but I kept finding that they have an idea about the subject but they don't know how to end the story, and that's boring. That's what's brilliant about Psycho. It starts off as what would be a pretty good pulp story even if it didn't have the Bates Motel. I know I don't have the invention to write Psycho, but I do have the talent to work through a musical idea.\" So what is the musical idea in Theseus Game if it isn't the McGuffin of Theseus in the labyrinth? \"It's about making a context and then breaking it. It's how you break it that becomes interesting.\" To illustrate what he means, Birtwistle shows me an etching by Picasso called Minotauromachia. A young girl holding a candle and a bouquet is confronted by a sexually predatory Minotaur; a wounded female bullfighter is straddled across a snarling horse; a bearded man, possibly Christ, climbs up a ladder on the left. The etching sets up an incredibly dense labyrinth of symbolic associations. Picasso has torn up all but the barest context and created something more engaging; Birtwistle aspires to do the same. \"I deal in a lot of my pieces with what you might call a labyrinth. I'm concerned with time which is circular. Time is not linear, though it expresses itself in that way.\" That must be a problem for you since music is traditionally seen as developing in a linear manner through time. \"Is it?\" he asks. Another good question. No, not necessarily. Music doesn't have to develop. \"In the end you understand music through your memory. You go back to the same thing again and again and experience it differently.\" One of Birtwistle's formative musical experiences came in 1953 when one of his fellow members of the New Music Manchester Group, the composer Walter Goehr, gave the British premiere of Messiaen's Turangal\u00eela Symphony. Birtwistle was drawn to the static, descriptive quality of the music, its refusal to develop like, say, a sonata or a canon. It prompted what the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians calls a career-long \"preoccupation with non-narrative temporality, where recurrent musical objects are viewed in different lights and from constantly changing perspectives\". For all their differences, Birtwistle's works - from 1965's Tragoedia through the Grimethorpe Aria and the Salford Toccata, right up to more recent pieces such as Panic - have this preoccupation in common. Birtwistle doesn't disagree with any of this. All he does say is that his music is not some premeditated project. He holds up a copy of a recent interview headlined: \"You have to have a vision\". \"No you don't,\" he snaps. \"And I certainly haven't.\" It recalls his remarks about his first acknowledged work, 1957's Refrains and Choruses for wind quartet. \"I wrote it completely off the top of my head. I can't justify a single note.\" This makes Birtwistle a difficult interviewee: he can theorise about his music until the end of time, but \"it's just a story you tell afterwards about what you've done\". Do you ever rewrite old pieces? \"Never. It's very strange listening to older pieces because I can't remember them completely and there's always things in anything you do that you regret. We all feel insecure and vulnerable about our work.\" So why don't you revise? \"I like the idea that there's a bit of dirt in it. I would have been a terrible jeweller. Boulez is a musical jeweller. But I don't think of myself as a lesser artist because of that. Experience makes other problems. By which I mean you remember the wounds and they heal, but there are other boils and sores and other wounds that appear.\" He suggests that such creative suffering is hardly common nowadays. \"We have a generation of young composers in this country who are amoebas who come into the world fully formed. I make no more claims for them. For me, I have a music in my head but I don't feel I had the technical equipment or the tools to make it come out.\" He declines to name these amoebas. \"I very much identify with painters and sculptors. I suppose it's called the struggle. I don't know. But I feel closer to people like Klee and C\u00e9zanne. Think of those views of Mont Saint Victoire. The subject matter falls out as irrelevant, the different views on the same thing are what it's about. That's much more me.\" And that's the end of the interview. After it, he's going to wander down his garden again to the studio - each time a different path, each stroll a different perspective on the same thing. Then he will settle down to write music. \u00b7 Theseus Game will be performed at Huddersfield contemporary music festival (01484 425082) on Sunday and at the Queen Elizabeth Hall, London SE1 (020-7960 4242), on Tuesday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
