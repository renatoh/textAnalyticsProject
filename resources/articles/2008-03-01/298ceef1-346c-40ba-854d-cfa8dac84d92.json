The Scotland striker, who replaced Sasa Papac just after the hour mark, equalised Noel Hunt's opener five minutes from the end of normal time and again levelled after Mark De Vries had restored United's lead in extra-time. And when the dramatic penalty shoot-out came, it was Boyd who hammered home the last penalty. Willo Flood and De Vries scored their spot-kicks but Craig Conway hit the post and David Robertson and Lee Wilkie had their penalties saved by Rangers goalkeeper Allan McGregor. Jean-Claude Darcheville struck the bar and Lee McCulloch had his penalty saved by Lukasz Zaluska but Steven Whittaker and Steven Davis scored, leaving Boyd to take the glory, along with McGregor. It was an incredible end to an amazing afternoon at the national stadium. The 17,000 fans from Tayside had the first chance to cheer after 34 minutes when Hunt latched on to a flick from De Vries before bundling the ball over the line at the left post. It was the scrappiest goal seen at Hampden since Tom Forsyth scored the winner for Rangers against Celtic in the 1973 Scottish Cup final but the United fans did not care about how it went in. United looked to have survived a second-half pounding, but with five minutes remaining midfielder Mark Kerr inexplicably tried to pass back to goalkeeper Zaluska from the edge of his own penalty area. Boyd anticipated the move and gleefully drove home from 12 yards out to force the extra 30 minutes. Five minutes in, Barry Ferguson lost the ball to Flood just outside the United box and seconds later De Vries finished off a four-man move by turning Kirk Broadfoot inside out before driving past McGregor from 16 yards. The drama was far from over. With eight minutes of extra-time remaining, and United defending desperately, Boyd squeezed in a second equaliser and there was no real surprise when he finished the contest off with his penalty to leave United slumped on the Hampden turf. It had started so much more positively for Craig Levein's men. United's first-half lead was deserved and indeed it could have been doubled just before the break when a mix-up between McGregor and Papac saw the ball roll down the left-back's body and past his 'keeper, Carlos Cuellar handily placed to clear to safety from almost on the line. Rangers boss Walter Smith reacted to the jeers his side received as they came off the pitch at half-time by replacing holding midfielder Brahim Hemdani with striker Darcheville as part of a tactical reshuffle. It was an admission that McCulloch's deployment as a lone striker in the first period had failed to work. The first half had few redeeming features as far as Rangers were concerned, apart from when in the 20th minute skipper Barry Ferguson saw his powerful drive from a cross by Davis brilliantly blocked by Zaluska. United looked more energetic and enterprising, and an earlier interjection by Cuellar's crucial prevented De Vries latching on to Flood's dangerous cross in the Rangers six-yard box. The introduction of Darcheville rejuvenated the Ibrox side but the visitors were denied a good penalty claim in the 54th minute when Cuellar dragged United defender Christian Kalvenes to the ground as they battled for the ball inside the Rangers penalty area. Referee Kenny Clark had a good look at the incident but took no action. The match, at last, had caught fire. Rangers survived a spell of intense pressure before Darcheville broke clear in the 59th minute, his angled drive striking Zaluska before going just past the left post for a corner which again United cleared easily. When Boyd replaced Papac, it was a sign that the Ibrox side were throwing off their defensive shackles in search of an equaliser. But there remained enough unease in the Rangers defence to encourage United who showed no indications that they regarded their lead as insurmountable. Tension slowly mounted and in the 77th minute Darcheville had the ball in the net from a quickly-taken free-kick, but referee Clark decried that Ferguson's set-piece had been taken just too quickly. In the 83rd minute Zaluska again came to the rescue as he beat away an angled-drive from Darcheville after he had burrowed in to the United box. But in the 85th minute Rangers were rewarded for their pressure when Boyd grabbed their equaliser. The United defence seemed to have coped with yet another Ibrox attack when Kerr tried to find Zaluska, but he was left with his hands on his head as Boyd rifled the ball into the bottom right corner of the net. The Taysiders looked demoralised at the end of normal time but De Vries struck five minutes into the added period to restore their lead. In the 112th minute Boyd headed the equaliser for the second time and the game headed for penalties, and soon there was further glory for the Ibrox striker."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
