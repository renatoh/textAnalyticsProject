The nurse and her husband hoped to buy and run a bed and breakfast, so she could retire from her job. Advised by Westpac financial planner Krish Mahadevan to sell the family home and invest in a self-managed super fund, she was then told she could not borrow the money she needed. \u201cI said, \u2018We sold our family home on your advice. We now don\u2019t have a family home to live in\u2019,\u201d she told the commission through tears. \u201cI was too embarrassed to tell anybody. I felt humiliated, stupid.\u201d \u2022 Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon McDowall and her husband are still renting, and fear they will never be able to buy a home. She said she could probably have to keep working \u201cuntil I\u2019m 80\u201d. McDowall has followed other customers of Australia\u2019s financial services industry into the royal commission \u2013 people such as David Harris, who repeatedly pleaded with Commonwealth Bank not to increase his credit limit because he was struggling to control his gambling addiction. Despite his plea, the offers of more and more credit came, until he was in debt to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars. \u201cI explained I\u2019m a gambler, I have a gambling problem, they can clearly see that I\u2019ve got a gambling problem because of the transactions I\u2019ve been making, and I don\u2019t understand why they keep offering me more money,\u201d he said. The litany goes on: NAB staff accepted envelopes stuffed with cash to wave through loans they knew were based on fake documents in order to \u201csmash targets\u201d and score bonuses. Commonwealth Bank employees charged clients who were dead for a decade, for services they never provided, not even when they were alive, conceding they were the \u201cgold medallists\u201d of \u201cfee-for-no-service\u201d banking. And AMP executives have admitted lying to the corporate regulator Asic in an attempt to cover up their behaviour of charging for no service. But the impact and scale of the malpractice is far broader than the handful of examples brought before the commission so far. Dozens of readers have contacted the Guardian \u2013 some anonymously \u2013 revealing that the predatory tactics by banks, the bad advice being knowingly given, and feckless lending practices, have ruined lives across the country, leading to bankruptcies, people losing their homes, family breakdowns, as well as debilitating physical and mental illnesses. As one correspondent wrote to the Guardian, the financial services industry has been \u201cruthless, careless, and irresponsible\u201d with the money and lives of the Australians they are employed to assist. Several readers said they had been given poor financial guidance by advisers, who profited from that advice that proved ruinous to their clients. Bank clients said they had been pushed into products that lost them money, without being warned of the risks, and without being told that the advisers were receiving commissions for those products. Some say this has been happening for decades. In the late 1980s, one man approached a big four bank in Melbourne with enough money saved to buy a house outright. He was referred to an \u201cexpert financial consultant\u201d. \u201cShe convinced me that buying a house was a really bad idea. She explained how unit trusts were much safer investments ... she did not mention at any time that she would receive a commission from those trusts,\u201d he said. The trusts collapsed in value, while Melbourne property prices soared. \u201cThe financial consultant that I saw behaved more like a high-pressure salesperson. She seemed to be motivated more by the undisclosed commissions that she would receive than by any desire to protect my financial future.\u201d Several readers told the Guardian they were given ever-increasing credit limits despite being unemployed and that the banks did not check their ability to repay the debt. One was made redundant, but the bank kept increasing the credit limit \u2013 from $6,000 to $40,000 \u2013 on an interest rate above 20%. \u201cThe bank hounded me with phone calls and the threat of debt collectors. I eventually gave up and declared bankruptcy. The bank has lost nothing through their predatory lending, and I have been left with exactly that.\u201d Another reader said his bank \u201ccontinually increased my credit card limit without checking my financials. I did not have an income. They did not check if I could afford the repayments they would be asking for. I have suffered financially.\u201d Many of those affected by bad advice were educated and considered themselves financially literate. Some worked in the financial industry themselves, but say they were lied to. Other readers said insurance companies had refused to pay claims for property damage sustained in massive storms officially declared disasters by governments. The impact of financial malpractice has spilled far beyond people\u2019s economic circumstances: contributing to chronic stress, ill-health, and family breakdowns. \u201cThe non-economic loss of this last 11 years of hell cannot be quantified,\u201d one reader wrote. \u201cI am now on lifelong medication due to a serious medical issue as a direct result of the chronic stress \u2026 my children have had their childhood robbed, my elderly mother cannot have the surgery she needs as her life savings have been decimated.\u201d With the sheer scale of malpractice uncovered over the last week, and a growing political consensus about the importance of its work, the royal commission now appears almost certain to be extended."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
