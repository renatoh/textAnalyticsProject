Meant to post this earlier but have been busy sorting out things for tomorrow. I'm off to a Konami event for their oddly titled new racing game, Enthusia, and have had to sort out some important packing issues - namely what games to take with my DS on the flight. Mario DS is a given, but I can't decide between the original Zelda on GBA or the ever-lasting Golden Sun. Anyway - net connection permitting - I'll blog from the Konami event over the next couple of days."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
