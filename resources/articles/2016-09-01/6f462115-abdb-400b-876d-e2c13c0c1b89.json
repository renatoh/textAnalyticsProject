So you have to recast your ideas. \u201cThis is what makes the plays work \u2013 because everything keeps shifting.\u201d The philosopher AC Grayling agreed, saying: \u201cShakespeare\u2019s a wonderful resource ... in getting us to see things about despair, ambition, desire, the passion for vengeance, love, all these things.\u201d The panel explored gender, race and class in Shakespeare and the bearing his plays have on contemporary politics. Greer also used the episode to pay tribute to Richard Neville, the writer and co-founder of the controversial counterculture magazine Oz, who died on Sunday night. Greer said: \u201cI\u2019m sad today because Richard is gone but in fact we lost him some time ago when he became ill. Another part of me is glad that it\u2019s over. That the struggle is over and he is at peace. \u201cHe was unafraid, he was supple-minded, he was open to new ideas, he was adventurous. \u201cHe was also charming. And we haven\u2019t got that many charming men.\u201d The founding artistic director of Bell Shakespeare, John Bell, said Shakespeare could be adapted to illuminate contemporary politics. \u201cI\u2019d be interested to see a production of The Merchant of Venice where you substituted the word Muslim for Jew and see how that would resonate,\u201d Bell said. Greer, Bell and Grayling were joined by Indigenous actor Kylie Farmer and the actor and playwright Kate Mulvany to canvass Shakespeare\u2019s work, in a markedly different Q&amp;A, free of political talking points. Asked whether Shakespeare\u2019s plays should be used to subsidise new Australian work, Greer said: \u201cIt is obviously possible, and yes, I would. But what worries me slightly is the assumption that Shakespeare\u2019s kind of olde worlde and not of today, and so forth. The reason that we speak Shakespearean is because it is still current for us.\u201d Bell said that he done precisely that when he was running the Nimrod threatre. Neither Bell nor Greer agreed there should be a moratorium on Shakespeare to make room for new playwrights. \u201cAnything in culture needs a balance of classics and new work. It\u2019s just a matter of working out the proportions. Audience need to see the classics,\u201d Bell said. The panellists talked about Shakespeare\u2019s bearing on their own lives. Mulvany said: \u201cHe teaches me as a human because of the way he crystallises and encapsulates a moment in a word or a phrase. What he teaches me as a playwright is extraordinary though too.\u201d The episode concluded with Bell reading a speech on refugees \u201cfrom a play called Sir Thomas More, which Shakespeare wrote in collaboration with a younger writer\u201d that referred to a nation\u2019s \u201cmountainish inhumanity\u201d. \u201cIn this speech Sir Thomas More is confronting the protesters and the mobs who want all the refugees removed from London,\u201d Bell said. He recited from the play, asking the Q&amp;A audience to: \u201cImagine that you see the wretched strangers, Their babies at their backs and their poor luggage, Plodding to the ports and coasts for transportation.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
