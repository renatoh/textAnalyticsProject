Brentford had just got back to 2-1 when Cardiff regained their two-goal cushion in the 75th minute when Danny Gabbidon jumped high to meet a corner with a powerful header. Brentford's misery was compounded when Paul Gibbs was sent off for bringing Robert Earnshaw down in the penalty area but Earnshaw spot-kick hit the bar. Cardiff took the lead after 15 minutes when Scott Young played the ball through from the centre circle and Peter Thorne found a way round Darren Powell before sending a firm drive wide of Olafur Gottkalksson. Cardiff were suddenly brimming with confidence and they had more trickery up their sleeves. They delivered it with a touch of magic by Earnshaw, who increased their lead in the 35th minute. Graham Kavanagh, the architect of so much that was good about their approach work, threaded a 20-yard pass through to the young striker, who collected the ball with his back to goal. Earnshaw's instant turn wrong-footed the Bees' defence and his stunning shot left Gottkalksson helpless. Steve Coppell had changed tactics during the interval, moving Powell out of central defence and into a three- man strike force but apart from shots from Steve Sidwell and Hunt that both went wide Brentford rarely threatened. Coppell then gambled again by withdrawing both his starting strikers, Burgess and Lloyd Owusu, in favour of Kevin O'Connor and Mark McCammon with 24 minutes remaining. It paid almost instant dividends when Evans beat the Cardiff defence with a low effort from just inside the area to pull a goal back for Brentford in the 68th minute."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
