But top choreographer is subject of new science exhibition at the Wellcome Collection: as good a clue as any to what makes Wayne McGregor such an interesting figure in ballet. McGregor is as likely to work with Radiohead as the Royal Ballet (he was responsible for making Thom Yorke jerk around in the videos for Lotus Flower and Atoms for Peace's Ingenue); or with the White Stripes and Jim Henson. Running through his work is an interest what makes bodies move, a focus that has led him to undertake research with neuroscientists and technologists. The dancing can be jagged and fractured, and his pieces do not necessarily make easy viewing: one early work was slammed as \"interminable\" by the cutting-edge Telegraph. But McGregor wilfully embraces his own contradictions. A ballet star who likes hip-hop, a maverick with a CBE. Something rather British about that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
