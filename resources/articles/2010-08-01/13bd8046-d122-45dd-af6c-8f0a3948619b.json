It is the unusual climate-change-led seasonal cycle of land temperature in Pakistan that has exacerbated the monsoon rainfall and produced the hugest volume of water in the northern mountainous region of the country ever recorded in the history, causing floods in the Indus river basin. Various scientific studies have already shown that the monsoon regions of the world will be affected by climate change more than any other regions on Earth. It is high time that the world in general and carbon-emitting industrial countries in particular showed responsibility and extended help to Pakistan not only in relief activities for the flood affectees at the moment, but also for developing a sustainable adaptation mechanism in the country to mitigate climate-change-led calamities of such kind in future. Syed Mujahid Ali Shah University of Greifswald, Germany \u2022 The people of Pakistan may be in God's hands now that swathes of Sindh lie under water, but for decades they have been in the hands of an Islamabad coterie who have failed to deliver autonomy or basic rights to its citizens. Pakistan's problems are regional problems and they lie rooted in bad governance. Islamabad's attempt to centralise a state around Wahhabism promoted institutionalised Islamic extremism and destroyed traditional values of tolerance. Globalisation offers a chance to shrug this off and support the viable self-determination of Sindh, Baloch and Punjab peoples within a Pakistani state \u2013 a state that, if reformed, could bring security and a new model of governance to the region. It's time the international community recognised this and listened to Pakistan's people instead of its jet-setting leaders.
