Trooping into a local photographer's studio, they will strip off before posing with an emblematic item - a helmet, a book, a ball - coyly concealing what they doubtless refer to as their \"private parts\". The 12 best images, cheaply bound, will then be hawked around offices, schools and factories, sometimes for as much as a tenner. Ever since the ladies of the Rylstone WI posed nude for a calendar to raise money for cancer research, it has been virtually impossible to get middle Britain to keep its clothes on in September, when most of these ghastly productions get put together. Throwing caution, and underwear, to the wind, gaggles of mild-mannered people, the kind who never leave home without checking twice that the gas is turned off, act like soft-porn stars, working the camera with winks and pouts and what they probably fondly imagine is a cheeky grin. It is, of course, the very fact that these people are not porn stars that underpins the whole project. Nude charity calendars depend for their fizz on the fact that two mutually exclusive categories - respectable and slutty - are brought together in a tantalising collision. Firemen, librarians and lollipop ladies are public servants whose day job is supposed to involve being more sensible than the rest of us. It girls, Oxford University students and daytime TV presenters - all of whom have recently produced their own nude calendars - are assumed by virtue of their wealth, class or celebrity not to need to sell their bodies. To put up a calendar that consists of pictures of naked prostitutes, strippers and even glamour models would make most of us feel queasy and exploitative. Having one with Fern Britton or the Duchess of York on the wall suggests that we are all in on the joke together. Still, none of this quite explains why people who for the rest of the year cross the street only when the green man is showing are quite so desperate to get other people wondering about what they look like without their clothes on. The charity angle is, of course, entirely spurious. For if you are really that bothered about Cancer Research, residential drug rehabilitation or building a new cricket pavilion, you could bake a cake, run a marathon, or stand in the rain for two hours on a Saturday morning. Most radically of all, you could simply make an anonymous donation. No, the fact that so many people choose to get naked - or pretend to, since the careful way the models are posed means that you would actually see more flesh if you bumped into them in the high street on a hot day - rather than simply get out the cheque book suggests something much deeper: a very childish urge to show other people your bum or willie (the nursery words are crucial - substitute the proper terms and the whole joke dies in an instant). Just as three-year-olds are often heard to ask, in all seriousness, \"Would you like to see my bottom?\" while simultaneously refusing quite to grant the wish, so posing for a nude calendar is like playing doctors and nurses with the world. In a tiresomely repetitive cycle of now-you-almost-see-it-now-you-don't, amateur nude models tease the viewer with the possibility that he or she (the effect is so unerotic that it matters little whether the imagined spectator is male or female, straight or gay) is about to be allowed to view a body part usually shrouded in mystery. This, then, is the transaction you should bear in mind when in the next few weeks you fork out for a nude charity calendar. In return for your \u00a310, you are buying the possibility - teasingly denied and endlessly deferred - that one day you might just get to see the local lollipop lady's snatch. kathryn.hughes@btinternet.com"}, "isHosted": false}}}
