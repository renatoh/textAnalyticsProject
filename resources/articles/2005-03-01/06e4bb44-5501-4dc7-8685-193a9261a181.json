With the English management still muttering about Kaplan's decisions to disallow a Mark Cueto try and decline the use of video technology when Josh Lewsey felt he had scored beneath a pile of bodies late in the game, the Rugby Football Union's head of refereeing performance Colin High said that at least two major unions had expressed concern to him about the dwindling number of top-level referees equipped to handle big games. \"It's so difficult there are increasingly few people in the world capable of doing it,\" said High, a former international referee himself. \"I'm permanently looking for new people as the others fall off the end and they're extremely difficult to find. It's like looking for another Jonny Wilkinson. \"It's a worldwide problem. If you talk to most countries I don't think they'd say there is a lot coming through and I'm not just talking about the smaller nations. \"Everyone makes mistakes but the good guys don't make bad big decisions. It's not just about consistency, it's accuracy which is crucial. It's no good being consistently bad.\" Along with most observers, High was mystified as to why Kaplan, one of the game's more experienced referees who has taken charge of 24 Tests and well over 200 first-class games, did not refer the Lewsey incident in Dublin to the television match official, if only to cover himself at a crucial stage of a game which Ireland ultimately won 19-13. \"Why he didn't call for help [from the video official] I've no idea,\" he said. \"I didn't think it was a try but it would have been smart to have at least used the technology.\" Lewsey, for his part, was convinced he had grounded the ball, and the England assistant coach Phil Larder has joined Andy Robinson in recommending that television evidence be extended beyond in-goal decisions. \"There is nothing more frustrating than losing a game by an incorrect judgment,\" said Larder. \"When there is a debatable try from a high kick like the one Mark Cueto caught in this match then surely they should have a look at it on video.\" It is now five years since video referees were introduced - the first instance was during the New Zealand v Tonga game in June 2000 when a try by Todd Blackadder was referred upstairs by England's Steve Lander - but High is among those who believe it would be unwise for the IRB to increase the video official's current remit. \"You can't go down that route, otherwise you'd be stopping the game every two minutes,\" he insisted, adding that the alternative - more than one referee on the field - was also impractical in rugby's case. \"It's been talked about but we're struggling to get one person of the right calibre let alone two. We're trying to get guys like Dave Pearson through but it takes years not five minutes.\" The fact also remains that the 38-year-old Kaplan is officially among the IRB's top 16 worldwide referees and, lest Englishmen forget, was in charge of the Ireland v England grand slam game in Dublin two years ago when the visitors won 42-6. Those, however, who recall Andre Watson's interpretation of the scrummage in the 2003 World Cup final and sniff a South African conspiracy should be warned that another referee from the republic, Mark Lawrence, is handling England's next Six Nations game against Italy at Twickenham on Saturday week. It is another strange but true statistic that England have played five Tests controlled by Kiwi referees since the World Cup and have lost on each occasion. The southern hemisphere appears to be taking subtle revenge for the Woodward years but, even so, it remains a big assumption that England would have won at Lansdowne Road had the refereeing been sharper-eyed. There is every chance Martin Corry's early try would have been ruled out for obstruction on Ronan O'Gara and, even had Lewsey's try been awarded, Charlie Hodgson would have had to land the conversion against a blustery wind from near the left touchline. There were certainly no hard feelings among the two sets of players, with Corry enjoying the company of several Irish opponents into the early hours at a Dublin nightclub. As yet, however, there have been no reports of English players buying unlimited drinks for Mr Kaplan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
