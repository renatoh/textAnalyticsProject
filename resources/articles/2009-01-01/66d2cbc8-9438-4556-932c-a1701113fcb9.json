The New York Times goes with Report Calls Online Threats to Children Overblown, saying that: children and teenagers are very unlikely to be propositioned by adults online. In the cases that do exist, the report said, teenagers are typically willing participants and are at risk in other ways (with poor home environments, depression or substance abuse, for example). The report criticized previous findings that one in five or one in seven minors are sexually propositioned online, saying that in a strong majority of those situations, a child's peers are responsible for the proposition, which typically amounts to an act of harassment or teasing. The task force also looked at age-verification technologies and \"concluded that such systems 'do not appear to offer substantial help in protecting minors from sexual solicitation'.\" The Wall Street Journal's headline is Internet Child Safety Report Finds No Easy Technology Fix. It says: the task force found that the risks that minors face on the Web\u2014notably bullying and harassment by peers, which are far more common than sexual predation\u2014aren't very different from those they face in the real world. The group reviewed several different types of technologies, including age and identity verification, filtering and auditing, text analysis and biometrics, and found they came up short of a comprehensive way to protect children and teens. In addition, the report found that deploying these technologies would be costly and could create broader privacy and security problems. The New York Times says: \"The 39-page document was the result of a year of meetings between dozens of academics, childhood safety experts and executives of 30 companies, including Yahoo, AOL, MySpace, Facebook, Verizon and AT&amp;T.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
