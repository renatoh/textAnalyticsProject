A backs-to-the-wall first half from Steve Clarke\u2019s side saw Belgium\u2019s chances kept to a minimum: David Marshall was forced into a fingertip stop by a looping strike from De Bruyne before Lukaku miscued badly from close range. But the resistance was broken on the stroke of half-time when Eden Hazard raced to the byline and lofted a cross for Lukaku to nod home. The striker\u2019s hit-and-miss night continued when he squandered a couple more presentable chances before making the points safe in the Group I match by pouncing when Marshall spilled De Bruyne\u2019s effort. Scotland contrived to miss a three-man breakaway before De Bruyne added a third. Northern Ireland\u2019s perfect start to their qualifying campaign continued with a hard-earned 1-0 win against Belarus in Barysaw. Conor Washington came closest to breaking the deadlock during a cagey first half when he rifled wide from the edge of the box. The visitors upped their efforts after the break, Washington and George Saville both unleashing vicious shots from range, before Paddy McNair jinked into the box from the left to drill low and hard into the far corner with five minutes to go. The points keep them at the top of Group C despite Germany\u2019s 8-0 win against Estonia in Mainz. An Ilkay G\u00fcndogan penalty made it four goals within the half-hour and Leroy San\u00e9 rounded off the scoring late on. Italy were made to work for their 2-1 win over Bosnia-Herzegovina in Turin. Edin Dzeko capped a flowing move before Lorenzo Insigne volleyed home a corner in dazzling fashion. Marco Verratti\u2019s precise finish clinched the win late on. Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 opened the scoring as France breezed to a 4-0 victory in Andorra, the Chelsea defender Kurt Zouma turning in the fourth."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
