The fee is thought to be \u00a34.75m, over \u00a31m more than Sunderland are believed to have offered last week. Rangers play Paris St-Germain away tomorrow in their Uefa Cup third-round second leg, and Reyna is expected to feature. But the Rangers manager Dick Advocaat said yesterday: \"It is a possibility that Claudio Reyna will make his last appearance for Rangers against PSG. \"It is frustrating but the same situation as Giovanni van Bronckhorst [who joined Arsenal in the summer]. He was desperate to play in the Premiership, and Reyna has the same opportunity. He is 28 and can go to play in England. \"If a player gets the opportunity to go and play in the Premiership it is quite difficult for a club like Rangers or Celtic to keep him here, even if you pay him the same money. We are never going to win because it's agents and players who decide what happens.\" Reyna, who will be going to the World Cup with the United States, would be a significant loss to Rangers and a valuable addition to Sunderland with another midfielder, Gavin McCann, in the midst of a pay dispute and threatening to leave the club. But one player who will not be joining Sunderland is Nicolas Anelka. The PSG striker was offered on loan to Peter Reid last week but there has been no contact since and the former Arsenal player has been recalled to the side who will play Rangers tomorrow night. Gordon Strachan will today complete the signing of Blackpool's Brett Ormerod in time for the striker to go into Southampton's squad for the game at Leicester on Saturday. Ormerod, 25, will sign for an initial \u00a31.3m, rising to a maximum \u00a31.75m, after scoring 20 goals in all competitions for Blackpool this season. The player expects to be on the bench at Leicester after agreeing personal terms and passing his medical at St Mary's stadium yesterday. David Ginola was yesterday charged with misconduct by the Football Association after his confrontation with the fourth official Clive Wilkes following the Aston Villa player's sending-off on Saturday. Ginola waved a finger at Wilkes and then tapped him on the side of the head before heading to the dressing room. Coventry's Republic defender Gary Breen has been put on the transfer list after stalling over a new contract. The much-travelled striker Dean Windass will join Sheffield Wednesday on loan from Middlesbrough today. Sheffield United's transfer-listed winger Paul Devlin is set to join Birmingham once Steve Bruce is installed as manager at St Andrews. A deal is in place for Devlin to rejoin Birmingham for an initial \u00a3400,000. Their request to take the 29-year-old on loan was rejected last month. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
