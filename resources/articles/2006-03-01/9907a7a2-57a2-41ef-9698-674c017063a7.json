Some children would knock on the door and shout, 'Got any empty boxes?' and run away. There's always been a stigma. Adults shouldn't shield children from death. I think it's good to involve them in funeral arrangements. I remember a boy of six suggesting his nan's ashes should be scattered in M&amp;S, the place she most loved. I said, 'I'm not sure they'd allow it' and - because he'd seen The Great Escape, he replied: 'We'll walk around shaking her out of holes in our pockets.' Marvellous. Death is an extension of life, part of the same journey, and we start to get ready for it from the moment of separating from our mothers. I lost my mother when I was 17 and it was the worst thing she ever did to me and the best gift she ever gave me, because leaving me was awful, yet she left the realisation of what it feels like to lose someone so close and special. My great campaign in life is to have bereavement recognised as an illness. For some people it's only like a cold, for some flu, but for others pneumonia - which is to say that some shake it off quite easily, some have it lingering and for others it's neverending and finishes them off. I've seen people die of a broken heart - I believe sincerely that that happens. I arranged a funeral involving a procession of practically every ice-cream van in south London, all playing different tunes at the same time. International transportation of human remains is more common than people realise. Few airliners take off without a body on them. One of the biggest problems in the world is judgmentalism. I'm a magistrate and on the introductory course someone who'd been a magistrate for years old me, 'You only have to look at someone to know if they're guilty or innocent.' I said, 'What are you, clairvoyant?' When I go into a pub in Bermondsey people say things like, 'Ohh look out, he's measuring you up!', or sing: 'Albin's coffins are the best, They fit you tight across the chest.' I once stood at the pub door and joked, 'Do you know what I can see in front of me now? Next year's accounts'. I arranged Damilola Taylor's funeral with his father, and the man's dignity, control, lack of anger and yet sincerity was amazing. This was a very compassionate man, able to overwhelm his anger. I thought it was lovely. I've failed more often than succeeded in business, but that's the only way to succeed. Twenty-two funeral directors refused to bury Myra Hindley and I think that's wrong. A good funeral director doesn't question - he serves. Bermondsey will always change and that's fine by me. In fact I think people here have accepted influxes from different countries better than anywhere. It's enriching and it's tremendous. Iranians are the most hospitable people I've ever met outside my own country. They want to feed you and care about you and they are absolutely wonderful with death. They're not the aggressive natured people they're often portrayed as. They're really very kindly. And budamjon and bahmian sauce may be the greatest food in the world. About once a year I do the perfusion [cooling down] of a body for cryonic suspension, although personally and as a Catholic I don't believe they'll ever come back. I used to think that everybody alive is afraid of dying. Now I think it's not the dying we're afraid of, but the journey."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
