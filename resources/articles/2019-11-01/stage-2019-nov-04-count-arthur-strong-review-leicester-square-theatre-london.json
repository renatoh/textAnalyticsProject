If that doesn\u2019t make the slightest sense, the Count\u2019s fuzzy logic \u2013 abundantly on display in this new show about the cosmos \u2013 must be catching. Is There Anybody Out There? is another wonderful set from Steve Delaney as the malaproping \u201cnutty old bloke\u201d, now bidding to supplant Brian Cox (or should that be George Formby?) as the nation\u2019s astronomer-in-chief. One doubts the BBC\u2019s \u201cdirector-colonel\u201d will take the bait, but there\u2019s no question that this is another stellar performance by the confused Count. If there is a criticism you could level at Delaney\u2019s shows \u2013 beyond the backhanded compliment that they can be as excruciating as they are entertaining \u2013 it\u2019s that they work to a familiar formula. The Count will struggle to perform unlikely songs: tonight, he opens with Starman by \u201cDavid Essex from Mutiny on the \u2026 Buses!\u201d There\u2019ll be vaudevillian physical comedy, like the business with the spectacles in his pockets. His crap ventriloquism will feature, as per a chat with Captain Sulky, the first monkey in space, which descends into a sub-Planet of the Apes interspecies bun fight. But within that frame, Delaney keeps finding funnier settings for the Count\u2019s bewilderment and curmudgeonliness. He performs a one-act play for schoolchildren about Renaissance astronomer Gary Barlow, who invented the telescope, \u201cas well as painting the cistern in the chapel\u201d. Verily, Barry Garlic is \u201cthe Stephen Hawkwind of whichever century it is that I\u2019m in\u201d, blithers the Count, before educating the kids about the planets in our solar system with a clothes rail and eight balloons. His trouble with the phrase \u201cjust a couple of puffs\u201d brings proceedings to a near halt; his accidental ingestion of helium forces an emergency interval. Throughout all this nonsense, the real, gruesomely compelling joke is on the Count\u2019s state of mind, and his mortal combat with the Queen\u2019s English. Even with constant stoking, his train of thought derails repeatedly and ends the show a wreck. How did I get here? his eyes scream at us. Where did I start? How did his lecture on Newtonian physics lead to a role-play about a pineapple falling on a bat? However did a list of space-related chocolate bars end up featuring Ursula Andress, the Four Tops and the films of \u201cDustbin Hoffman\u201d? It would be tragic, if the Count weren\u2019t so cantankerous (blaming everyone but himself for his confusion) and, finally, so indomitable. Yes, the eyes flash with terror, but soon he\u2019s off on another tangent, explaining \u201cthe Big Bump\u201d, imagining Lulu\u2019s guest slot on his TV astronomy vehicle, or reminiscing about the forgotten music-hall icon Lenny Long-Arms. At every turn, Delaney\u2019s performance gives us something to marvel at, whether it\u2019s the Count\u2019s clenched physicality, would-be cut-glass vowels or the fierce concentration he brings (you can almost hear the synapses cranking into position) as he fathoms where Ed Sheeran stops and Alan Shearer begins. There are still moments of claustrophobia; it\u2019s part of the Count Arthur experience to feel trapped with him in ever-decreasing circles. But Delaney pays for your discomfort with great wads of laughter, as the Count\u2019s lecture on cosmology falls to Earth with a very big bump of its own. \u2022 Touring until 8 March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
