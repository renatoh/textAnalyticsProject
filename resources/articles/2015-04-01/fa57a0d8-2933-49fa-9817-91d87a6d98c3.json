In the latest round of the war of election letters, Hunt\u2019s supporters have emailed sympathetic doctors to ask them whether they would be prepared to sign the letter. The email says: \u201cThere is a letter being put together saying that the NHS shouldn\u2019t be used as a political football during the election campaign. If you are willing in principle to support this, please reply to Jeremy Hunt\u2019s advisor.\u201d The move to rally support for the Tories, by highlighting reported remarks by Ed Miliband that he is seeking to \u201cweaponise\u201d the NHS, follows the publication in the Guardian of a letter by GPs which was highly critical of the Tories\u2019 handling of the NHS. The letter, signed by 140 senior doctors, said: \u201cWe invite voters to consider carefully how the NHS has fared over the last five years, and to use their vote to ensure that the NHS in England is reinstated.\u201d The Tory fightback was disclosed by the health writer Roy Lilley. He tweeted: \u201cTories canvassing for a \u2018support the NHS\u2019 letter from doctors \u2013 the games continue!\u201d A Labour source said: \u201cThis is desperate stuff from a Tory election campaign that is stuck in the gutter. David Cameron has nothing to offer patients and can\u2019t escape his dismal track record on the NHS. It won\u2019t escape people\u2019s notice that it comes on the same day waiting lists hit a new high.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
