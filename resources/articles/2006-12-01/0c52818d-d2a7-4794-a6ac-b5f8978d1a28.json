Unfortunately, while we get flirtatious discussing where to hang the mistletoe, it seems the boss has come over all Scrooge. Take, for example, the news from Select Appointments that just 9% of us are getting a Christmas bonus. It was long ago, but even I remember when a Christmas bonus was standard: the milkman got one, the postman got one, and you got one. I don't know when it went out of fashion for everyone but bankers, but 9% is a disgrace. Someone should complain to Father Christmas. \u00b7 And it gets worse. No Christmas bonus, and no Christmas party either - unless we're prepared to pay for it. According to research from Somerfield, only a third of us get our annual night on the tiles dancing to Slade's Merry Christmas Everybody gratis; the rest of us are actually forking out \u00a31bn between us for the pleasure. The most shocking thing is, no matter how laid back your boss, the Great Party Swindle means that you are paying to spend more time at work. I know it's the time for giving and all that, but I'm sure the great white beard in the sky meant \"give to the poor and needy\" not \"give to the powers of global capitalism\". \u00b7 Anyhoo, I could forgive the party if only her in charge would say thank you. OK, so serial lateness, backchat and a refusal to engage with the photocopier do not an employee-of-the-month make. But I'm sure that my lack of focus and direction must qualify under some kind of heavenly \"meek and mild\" catch-all formula. Sadly, workplace experts Croner tell me that less than half of us will be receiving presents from our bosses; and, worse, the lucky ones who do are likely to be subjected to the bah humbug gift - presents all right in themselves, but with the company logo graffitied all over them. \u00b7 It's not all doom and gloom. So, you paid for your own turkey and the boss got you a company desk tidy. But never mind - at least we're going to have a good kneesup. Unfortunately, listen to Cliff Richard croon about mistletoe and wine followed by a Jingle Bells sing-a-long too often and your ears drums will explode in disgust. Luckily, all is not lost. A man called John Levine has created an Alphamusic Christmas CD which apparently \"fosters a spirit of creativity and cooperation in the workplace\" by making your brain produce something called \"alphawaves\". The only problem is that all this talk of alphawaves and alphamusic just isn't that Christmassy, is it? All together now: \"Last Christmas, I gave you my heart ...\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
