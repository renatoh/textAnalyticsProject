Though time has taken its toll a bit, it still ranks among Miller's finest operatic stagings, largely because his dispassionate approach forces us to experience the work's emotional power without ever allowing us to wallow in sentimentality. Its flaws are few: Bernard Culshaw's set, a turquoise box subject to decoration and transformation, is more suited to the private worlds of Violetta's country retreat and her twilit sick room than to the Parisian scenes, where the sense of tawdry luxury needs to be a bit more in-your-face. And Miller's evocation of Flora's party, which should indicate extreme sexual and moral danger, seems tepid after Violetta's own soir\u00e9e, where she parades before her guests, a nervous professional dominatrix in drag. Where Miller scores high, however, is in his alarming, yet deadly accurate emphasis on the work's over-arching image of consumption. Violetta is consumed by the physical illness - its symptoms relentlessly depicted - just as Alfredo and Germont between them consume her emotional life. In no other production are we quite so forcefully reminded that the trauma of leaving Alfredo under Germont's moral pressure will not only force Violetta to return to prostitution, but is going to bring on a medical relapse. At one hideous moment just before she dies, father and son break into mutual recriminations, oblivious to the fact that Violetta is writhing on her bed in agony. All this is helped immeasurably by a remarkably fine performance from Sandra Ford as Violetta. She looks beautiful, fragile and vulnerable; her voice, though, is opulent, cleaving the air with considerable force. The men aren't quite in her league. John Hudson's Alfredo is gawkily shy yet explosively tempered, though his voice is now a fraction too heavy for the role. Ashley Holland's Germont is a hectoring, moralistic bully. He sings handsomely, if at times too loudly. Noel Davies's conducting is on the fast side and some might find it too edgy, though its mixture of nervousness and feverish morbidity accurately captures both the sense of life ebbing away and of time running out.
