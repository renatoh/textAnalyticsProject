Aliadi\u00e8re is on holiday and has not discussed the proposed move, which rests on his willingness to join Middlesbrough. Gareth Southgate, the Boro manager, tried to sign him in January but the transfer was blocked by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger after an injury to Robin van Persie left Arsenal short of options in attack. Southgate turned instead to the South Korea international Lee Dong-guk but hopes finally to land Aliadi\u00e8re, whose first-team appearances at Arsenal have been limited. Aliadi\u00e8re joined the club in 1999 but has failed to hold down a regular place and has had loan spells at Celtic, West Ham United and Wolverhampton Wanderers. With Mark Viduka set to join Newcastle United, Southgate wants to bring in at least one striker. West Bromwich Albion's Diomansy Kamara is also on his list. Yesterday saw one departure from Boro confirmed, with Stuart Parnaby ending a 15-year association with the club by joining the Premiership newcomers Birmingham City on a free transfer. The utility player becomes Steve Bruce's second signing since promotion was secured, the midfielder Fabrice Muamba having made his loan move from Arsenal long-term. Parnaby can play as a right-back, central defender or in midfield and wants to kick-start his career, having had few first-team opportunities during the second half of last season with Boro. The 24-year-old, who has signed a three-year contract, said: \"The time had come for me to make a fresh start at a new club and I decided to join Birmingham after meeting Steve Bruce. He spoke really highly of all the lads and what a big club it is. Everything was really positive.\" Parnaby made 127 appearances for Boro and was part of the side that reached the Uefa Cup final just over a year ago. He hopes his Premiership and European experience will be an asset in helping Bruce's young squad adapt to the top flight. \"I know what it takes after playing with Boro in Europe and the Premiership so hopefully I can bring that bit of experience to the younger players in the team and we can push on,\" he said. Jason Koumas has admitted he is ready to leave West Bromwich Albion to pursue his ambition of playing in the top division. The Wales midfielder has been linked with a move to Everton and said: \"I'm a local lad, from that area [Liverpool]. If you ask any player they'll say they should be in the Premiership and I'm no different. I feel I could play in the Premiership, no problem. If it doesn't happen it doesn't happen - I'll just keep playing my football.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
