He also said he was furious when Russia and the US reached a deal in autumn 2016, before the US election, to de-escalate the civil war by grounding the Syrian air force and separating al-Nusra terrorist forces from the Syrian opposition \u2013 a deal that fell apart after a Syrian army attack on a UN aid convoy killed more than 20 people. He said one of the effects of the EU\u2019s failure to address the Syrian crisis and the wave of Syrian refugees into Europe in 2015 was Britain\u2019s Brexit vote. De Mistura was speaking for the first time in the UK about his period as special envoy between 2014 and 2018, a period in which there were tens of thousands of deaths, a Russian military intervention and a gradual clawback of territory by Assad. Speaking at the Aga Khan Centre in London, he said: \u201cWhy did I leave last year? Well, officially, for personal reasons. Unofficially, because I felt the war territorially was leading to an end and having really fought against what happened in Aleppo, in Idlib, in Daraya, I could not be the one that is shaking Assad\u2019s hand and saying malesh [Arabic for don\u2019t worry]. \u201cI could not shave myself in the morning saying malesh. But wars are won and lost and this one territorially has been lost.\u201d He admitted he had not followed \u201cthe manual of the perfect mediator\u201d as he had condemned war crimes and sieges by both sides, angering both the government and opposition. He said the UN\u2019s interventions, including aid convoys and his personal denunciation of the destruction of Aleppo, may have saved as many as 700,000 lives. He did not regret his own interventions but said: \u201cI reduced my space as a negotiator.\u201d De Mistura claimed even now Russia wanted a peace deal, as shown by the restart of UN-led talks in Geneva last week by his successor, Geir Pedersen. \u201cThe Russians have no interest, no means, no capacity of reconstructing Syria and have no intention, if they are smart, of being left with the candle in their hand that then burns their hand. They would rather pass it on to Europe who could then contribute to the reconstruction. A broken country can be a huge heritage.\u201d He predicted Europe would help only if there was political stability in Syria, and he said this was only achievable if there was an inclusive peace. He also predicted Russia would put pressure on Assad to grant a measure of autonomy to the Kurds in north-east Syria, describing the current position as not sustainable. He admitted the international community had underestimated Turkey\u2019s obsession with the Kurds. He claimed Russia\u2019s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and the then US secretary of state, John Kerry, in a moment of personal chemistry reached a deal in August 2016. \u201cThe Russians will have the Syrian airforce and helicopters grounded and the opposition would have to separate from [the terrorist group] al-Nusra.\u201d \u201cThe Russians had wanted a deal because they feared Hillary Clinton was set to become president and introduce a more muscular policy. The deal fell apart due to \u201cspoiling events\u201d, he said, in reference to the aid convoy attack. Discussing the 2015 Syrian refugee crisis, De Mistura said: \u201cEven Brexit was a collateral effect of the disappointment of some Brits that Europe was not able to handle on behalf of everyone a major crisis.\u201d The former US ambassador to the UN, Samantha Power, speaking separately, said David Cameron\u2019s insistence on seeking and then failing to obtain UK parliamentary approval for airstrikes following a chemical weapons attack on the outskirts of Damascus on 21 August 2013 had led the Obama administration to abandon the plan. She described it as the \u201cunique foresight for which he is known now \u2013 the preview of the Brexit foresight.\u201d \u201cWe were much closer to Obama actually ordering the strikes. We were hours from it away really,\u201d she said. \u201cThen a decision was made really to give the PM his time so we have the biggest possible most legitimate coalition we can have. When that did not go through, the vulnerability of having a smaller coalition, the vulnerability of what happened to Cameron, made Obama feel he needed thicker ballast.\u201d She said the decision was then made to seek Congressional approval for US airstrikes. \u201cWe ended up with the rug being pulled out from under us altogether,\u201d she said. \u201cTo pursue that Congressional authorisation without knowing whether you have the votes, I don\u2019t think anyone can look back on that and think it is our best moment.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
