Yesterday the best the order of play committee could come up with was show court No2, the so-called graveyard of champions. Nalbandian, the No6 seed this year, responded with a 7-5, 6-4, 6-2 victory over Vladimir Voltchkov of Belarus, who three years ago reached the Wimbledon semi-finals and has done precious little since. Juan Carlos Ferrero, the new French Open champion, was given a good deal more consideration and placed on Centre Court, where he defeated France's Jean-Ren\u00e9 Lisnard 6-2, 6-1, 6-3. Ferrero took 10 days off after Roland Garros and only began practising for Wimbledon last Wednesday. However, the current king of clay is not one of those Spaniards who is totally averse to playing on grass, although he has not gone beyond the last 32 in two previous attempts here. He is highly unlikely to win but Ferrero has his eye on the world No1 spot, particularly after Hewitt's demise. The further the Spaniard can go at Wimbledon, and the more points he can garner, the greater his chance of climbing from his current position as No3 - effectively No2 after Hewitt's exit - to the top of the rankings. To that end he practised for a couple of days on synthetic grass in Spain before arriving in London last Saturday. \"I think sometimes the less practice you have, then the better you play,\" he said yesterday, although nobody was inclined to believe him. Against Voltchkov he was able to play comfortably from the baseline. \"It's good,\" said Ferrero, who is a man of few words, especially when it comes to the subject of grass. Martin Verkerk, the Dutchman beaten by Ferrero in the French Open final, had told the Dutch press that if they wanted a laugh they should watch his first match on the Wimbledon grass. Verkerk has a huge serve but it was to no avail against the 18-year-old Swedish qualifier Robin Soderling, who beat him 6-3, 6-4, 6-7, 6-1. It is not necessarily good news for Tim Henman, who was due to meet Verkerk in the third round. South Africa's Wayne Ferreira, who badly injured his groin during the French Open, lost in the first round against Slovakia's Karol Kucera but achieved his primary target, which was simply to play. Ferreira has run up 51 consecutive grand slam appearances and is now just three short of equalling Stefan Edberg's record."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
