How do I weigh it? If it's too heavy, do I cut it in half?\" Can you guess which cookery writer set off this wail in my inbox? That's right, it's Mr Heston Blumenthal. Do you read his recipes every week? Do you, at least, read their titles? Crushed meringue and pistachio with soya-sauce mayonnaise? Does that make you feel bracingly challenged or hideously inadequate? Do your salivary glands throb and your feet make pawing gestures in the direction of the kitchen, or do you find yourself thinking about the attractive blue neon signs of Pizza Express? Don't get me wrong. I am in awe of Mr Blumenthal. I once had dinner at his restaurant, The Fat Duck, at Bray, and by ordering very conservatively, had a wonderfully exotic meal. He is a disciple of El Bulli, the staggeringly innovative restaurant north of Barcelona, and this is a brave thing to be in the home counties. He is one of the rare restaurateurs in his class and price range who lets you bring your own wine in exchange for a corkage fee. He is the rare mixture of a supreme gastrotechnologist who understands the twitch and flex of every muscle, and a cook who is rococo in his imaginings. If you gave him a human brain he might poach it lightly in a reduction of 1978 Cornas and top it with a mortar-board made of liquorice; but he might not understand all that had been going on inside it before he popped it into the pot. Again, don't get me wrong. I quite want to cook some of what Mr Blumenthal does: though when he tells me that the best way of cooking a steak is to flip it every 15 seconds, making 32 flips in all for its eight-minute cooking period, I am inclined to wonder who will be minding the chips and mushy peas while I flip four steaks 128 times, so I say Pass. As for the chips - did you see his recipe for chips? He takes the two-stage technique (lifting the basket out while the oil heats up again) to its logical conclusion: you half-fry them, then shove them in the fridge for a couple of hours to chill out. A restaurant critic told me the other day Mr B also believes that if you prick each chip individually with a fork, this makes for an even finer end-product; but that for some reason (like straining our credulity) he didn't put this in the recipe. However, his emphasis on slow cooking seems to me salutary and admirable. And by slow he means very slow. I was cooking oxtail stew the other day and naturally, pedantically, checked a few recipes for how long to give it. Alastair Little two hours (you're joking), Fay Maschler three, Frances Bissell four (getting warmer). I think I gave it five, and two subsequent reheatings of 45 minutes each only enhanced the tail's fork-meltingness. Mr Blumenthal probably has a recipe that involves giving it the full cycle of the moon. The sticking-point, however, came fairly early. I had read several of his recipes for slow cooking, in which he gave oven temperatures in centigrade. I have a standard oven with gasmarks, and we were clearly talking gasmark 1 and below; the temperature-conversion charts that preface basic cookbooks didn't even start at the temperature - 65 - that Mr B was proposing for one particular recipe. In any case, he said an oven thermometer was essential; you also had to make sure the heat had stabilised before putting the meat in. Guessing was absolutely ruled out. Then I remembered that I did actually own an oven thermometer, bought on one of those scavenging trips to a kitchen shop where you go in search of a brave new machine and come back with a paring knife and a questionable gadget. It was, inevitably, in that drawer where you put such things and then forget about them, where everything is tangled up - whisks with chopsticks through their wires - a shameful place. I dug it out; 65 , I said to myself dreamily. Six hours, seven hours, a day-and-a-half, with cooking odours wafting gently up to my study. I took the thermometer out of its packaging. And its lowest marking was 75. Mr Blumenthal is off my radar, as well as my oven thermometer, and that's all there is to be said. His cuisine is Olympian, fit for gods who have become sated and fractious after millennia of ordinary perfection. The more immediate problem of conscience comes with writers who are similarly high-minded, but more accessible. I revere Elizabeth David, yet don't cook from her as often as I know I should, or even as often as I want to. Why not? Because she seems to have her admonishing eye on me; because I feel that if I get something wrong I will have offended her shade. Lo, I have been sloppy, and the temple of cookery has been profaned. Or take the case of the American food writer Richard Olney (1927-1999). Like Mrs David, he was a powerful force for good, a fine and evocative describer who put food in a wider cultural context. The Times obituarist rightly said of his Simple French Food that it was \"one of the very few cookbooks everyone should have\". He was also a man of incorrigibly high standards. Years ago I was a restaurant critic, and invited to a grand celebration of French cuisine at the Dorchester Hotel. A banquet for 200 or so, prepared by a bucketload of starry Michelin chefs. General bonhomie and savoir vivre. Olney was one of the guests, and I later heard that when the waiter poured him a glass of red wine, he sipped it and sent it back. Not because it was corked, but because it was a couple of degrees too warm. Simple French Food. Be careful: the first of those three words is booby-trapped. \"Simplicity is a complicated thing,\" 0lney reminds us, towards the end of a six-page discussion of the term. The modern mantra goes, \"If food is not simple, it is not good.\" Olney prefers its inversion: \"If food is not good, it is not simple.\" Thus everything from peasant cooking to classic haute cuisine may, by this definition, be accounted simple. We are not talking about ease of preparation. What we are after is \"purity of effect\" - which (you will have guessed by now) may involve considerable complication of means. The publisher of Simple French Food meanly had the book glued rather than sewn, and the pages you use regularly just fall out when you open it. What falls out in my case are gratineed cauliflower loaf, courgette gratin, pommes paillasson (the recipe is alone worth the price of the book) and marinated leg of lamb. Clearly, I have stuck to the simplest of the simple. The reason is easy to explain. Like most people, I annotate my cookbooks - ticks, crosses, exclamation marks, emendations and suggestions for next time. In certain cases, next time is never. My annotation of Olney's Courgette Pudding Souffl\u00e9 (and I apologise in advance for the language) goes as follows: \"This dinner for 2 took me 4 hours. The mouli doesn't work as he says, and on turning out the souffl\u00e9 collapses flat and the sauce became a quarter deep layer on top of it, ie. a fucking disaster. But all the same fucking delicious!\" One of many possible mistakes on my part was that I did not own a savarin mould. Own? I didn't even know what one was. Overleaf, where Olney mentions this item, I see I have underlined his words and written, \"Why not explain what this is somewhere in the bloody book, matey?\" As you can see, I emerged from Courgette Pudding Souffl\u00e9 in a somewhat conflicted state of mind. And no, I didn't go out and buy a savarin mould. I just went back to gratineed cauliflower loaf. It's partly about admitting the limits of one's ambition; but it's more about one's attitude to failure. And here most people, and certainly most kitchen pedants, part company with Messrs Blumenthal and Olney, and also with Mrs David. It's not that these experts don't think failures occur - they are aware of them. Elizabeth David writes: \"In cooking, the possibility of muffing a dish is always with us. Nobody can eliminate that.\" But she would agree with Richard Olney when he writes: \"A failure is no disgrace and may very often be more instructive than a success.\" Yes, I can see that in theory. But in practice, most domestic cooks feel that failure is indeed a disgrace, and that it would take some years of therapy to convince them otherwise. So we have over the years developed a very good system for cutting down the likelihood of failure. If we make a dish once, and it turns out anything from a serious muff to a complete hash, then we don't cook it again. Ever. It's natural selection in the kitchen. And as a system it is - in the very ordinary sense of the term - simple. \u00a9 Julian Barnes"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
