After an initial burst of fervour there are usually periods of relative calm during which everyone - the leaders and the led - are able to assess whether tearing up the old world was a good idea after all. It is a worrying time for the leaders because they can't go back. But how do they maintain the momentum? Why, they ask themselves, has the initial euphoria vanished? That's the quandary facing both the Independent and the Times just now in the great compact revolution. As the latest official circulation figures reveal, the sales rises prompted by the move away from the broadsheet format have slowed dramatically in the past couple of months. The Independent's astonishing year-on-year rise, up 22.86% on last May, is a tribute to its strategy of changing its shape. But the rate of increase has slowed considerably in the last two months. It has built a platform and now comes the hard grind: without the aid of the publicity and marketing which previously gave it a sales boost it must convince more people to switch from their current choice of title. The picture is somewhat distorted by the fact that the Indy did not go completely tabloid until May 17, so we must wait for the next set of figures to provide greater clarity. Similarly, the Times's performance is difficult to analyse because it does not publish a compact on a Saturday, an issue which has performed badly in recent months after a lacklustre revamp. What the figures do show is that the Monday-to-Friday compact Times was selling 301,000 copies last month, which means that half the readers are still not getting it. The tabloid figures will improve because the paper has now dropped its broadsheet in various regions. But will that mean the broadsheet loyalists begin to desert it? The consistent problem for the Times is that its compact appears so much less authoritative than its broadsheet. The writers are there, the stories are there and most - but by no means all - the words are there. Yet the perception of the smaller version is that it lacks the gravitas expected of a paper of record. Unlike the Independent, which has made the switch rather easily - due, in part, to its fewer pages and to its more committed journalistic agenda, which is more adaptable to the tabloid format - the Times's effort has been clumsy. If upset Times broadsheet readers do seek out an alternative, the Daily Telegraph and the Guardian would be delighted, because both are suffering: the Telegraph is heading down towards 800,000 while the Guardian is struggling to keep its head above 350,000. Both titles need to take advantage of the becalmed compact revolution. One title which desperately needs more buyers is the Financial Times, which is in something of a crisis. Its \"headline\" British sale in May was just 131,454, but 23,815 of these were bulk sales and a further 5,404 were sold at a discount. So the FT's full-rate sale in its home country last month totalled just 102,235. To put that in perspective, in May 1999 the FT was selling 155,000 at its full cover price in Britain. So, in five years, it has lost 34% of its home circulation, a dramatic fall by any standard. It's no wonder that the Business, the Sunday title on which the Barclay brothers have lavished millions, has found it impossible to attract a paying audience and depends for its sustenance on being given away free inside other publications. The only conclusion is that the business niche, once one of the most healthy reading markets, now appears unable to support a viable newspaper. The daily red-tops have nothing to crow about either, but the most eye-catching figure is surely the Daily Mirror's decline. It has been steadily losing sales over the months but the latest drop must be linked to the publicity surrounding the episode of the faked army torture pictures and the subsequent departure of its editor, Piers Morgan. What would be fascinating to know is whether readers departed because they were upset by the use of hoax pictures or because they were disappointed at Morgan's sacking. Know your enemy One of the most dispiriting aspects of commentating on the press is the regular discovery that the communications industry suffers from a lack of communication. On the other side, there is so much distrust of the press that organisations leap to the wrong conclusion. In an attempt to build bridges, therefore, let me try to make sense of a lack of communication between Unison, the public service union, and three regional papers. Unison asked eight newspapers to run a pre-election advert in which it attacked the British National party, urging people: \"Handle your vote with care\". Five papers - the Newcastle Chronicle, Brighton Evening Argus, Birmingham Evening Mail, Dudley Express &amp; Star and the Sandwell Express &amp; Star - obliged by publishing the advert. Three - the Southern Daily Echo in Southampton, the Sunderland Echo and the Barnsley Chronicle - refused. So Unison ticked off the trio by placing a full-page advert in last Wednesday's Guardian, reproducing the rejected ad under the headline: \"What some local newspapers won't let you read\". It accused the papers of censorship and, by implication, of going soft on the BNP. But that certainly wasn't true of the Barnsley and Sunderland papers, both of which have a record of hostility towards the BNP. A trenchant Barnsley Chronicle leading article three weeks before the election told its readers not to waste their vote on the BNP. So why didn't they run the advert? Both editors explained that they took legal advice from the Newspaper Society because they were concerned about a contentious line in the Unison ad which claimed that in areas where the BNP has won council seats local crime had increased and racial attacks had risen by 300%. The NS legal department outlined the risks, as lawyers do, and then it was up to the publishers to make a decision. Rather than consulting the NS, the advertising department of the Southern Daily Echo went back to Unison and asked officials to substantiate the claim. According to Ian Murray, the editor, when the union refused to do so, the ad was pulled. Murray's paper did not write about the BNP because, having taken advice, it decided the best policy was to ignore the party (which fielded five candidates, none of whom came close to election). In other words, all the papers agreed with Unison's position. There was no conspiracy, no censorship and no hidden agenda. But instead of a joint celebration there is now ill-feeling on all sides. Unison had to dip into its political fund to pay for the Guardian ad and the Barnsley Chronicle hit back at the union for its \"vile slur\" and \"peevish, unfounded attack\". I suggest that Unison contacts all three editors so that this dispute does not go any further. It just isn't worth falling out with each other over a party of racists. Play for Today Like many an entrepreneur, Rupert Murdoch likes to say how much he enjoys competition. After all, it's part of his economic philosophy and he is supposed to relish fighting rivals in the marketplace. So it was discouraging last week to see that Murdoch's company, News International (NI), had used the full majesty of the law to see off an enterprising little newspaper group which is seeking to launch a daily paper entitled Ireland Today. By chance, NI owns that title from the days when it bought Today in 1987, which it closed down in 1995. It will probably never use the title and it doesn't need it. On the other hand, it was an apposite title for the Belfast-based Andersonstown News Group, which is making plans to launch a daily cross-border paper later this year. There is no doubt that Ireland Today is a trademark registered to NI, so it has the law on its side, forcing Andersonstown to give a legal undertaking that it will not use the title. But come on Rupert, where's the point in taking your hammer to crack this nut? You run one of the biggest media conglomerates in the world. It's doubtful if this new paper will deprive your company of a single reader in Ireland. Now you've made the legal point, why not relent? Think how good you will look by doing so. Sweet FA Publishing a picture of David Beckham making an adjustment to a heart monitor would not rile the England captain or the Football Association. But a sneak shot of Beckham in his underpants, making a very different kind of adjustment, certainly upset the FA when it was published in the Sun and the Daily Star. The FA's lawyers warned editors that long-lens pictures were \"an unjustifiable intrusion\" into Beckham's private life. If the Press Complaints Commission is asked to inquire - and it hasn't yet received a letter - it will be an interesting case. The player was on a hotel balcony where he could argue that he had a reasonable expectation of privacy. Despite that, the best response by the PCC might be to do sweet FA."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
