In case you missed it, the offending words read \"Houllier I hope you die of Aids\". More often than not the obscenities and sick-minded utterances of football's lunatic fringe go without comment. Sadly there is an acceptance that they go with the territory, no matter how despicable the sentiments. But this was different. To wish the Liverpool manager G\u00e9rard Houllier a long, painful death was surely the work of some sort of footballing nut; a fan so obsessed by the concept that Liverpool should win, at any cost, that all sense of reason or decency was lost. The irony is that those words may just have provided the catalyst needed to jolt Anfield's highly paid underachievers - who, let us not forget, can realistically hope for no better than fourth place in this year's Premiership race. Fourteen years have elapsed since Liverpool last won the title, and six years more since they won Europe's premier trophy, and the fans crave a return to the glory years of Bill Shankly and Bob Paisley. This season the moments of encouragement have been few, but at last on Thursday it seemed there was a glimmer of hope. For 45 minutes in the Uefa Cup tie against Levski Sofia, Liverpool's defensive and sterile display typified all that Houllier's critics have come to suggest is the norm for his side. But whatever was said in the home dressing room at half-time, the second-half display was a revelation. Steven Gerrard's opening goal, driven from long range low into the Levski net, may prove to be the turning point for the club and for Houllier. As the Liverpool midfielder ran fully 60 yards back to embrace his manager in a spontaneous display of celebration, it would have been a hard man who could not appreciate the joy and relief experienced by all. The Kop, from the midst of which Houllier's spray-painting abuser perhaps sprang, thundered its acclaim - not only for Liverpool, more for Houllier. The much-maligned Frenchman was being given a managerial kiss of life by the thousands who have always been recognised as the heartbeat of the club. The stands reverberated: \"Allez, allez Houllier.\" The 2-0 advantage taken from the home leg should be enough to see Liverpool into the next round, whatever Levski manage to produce in Wednesday's second leg in Bulgaria - especially since Houllier's team were able to build on Thursday's success with yesterday's thrilling return to league matters at Elland Road. A 2-2 draw against struggling Leeds might look ordinary on paper but there were again signs of a new confidence and belief in the team. Certainly Houllier is already speaking of his plans for next season. What drives the Frenchman on, when logic suggests he should have walked away after another match against Leeds, in October 2001, during which he suffered a heart attack, is a love of the game which simply cannot be shaken. His illness was surely symptomatic of the extraordinary pressures under which modern managers place themselves. But his addiction to football drew him back after long months of recuperation. In a sense, Houllier and others like him are as obsessed as even the most misguided of fans. \"It used to be the rat race, now it's the sack race,\" Houllier once said when talking about the difficulties managers have to face on a daily basis. \"If a manager is slaughtered regularly in public, in the media, the players obviously see that and react. There is a real problem in the deterioration in the image and standing of the manager.\" But this season, for all the criticism that has been directed his way, it seems the Liverpool players have said loudly that they are with their beleaguered manager. \"When your house is attacked you make sure you get together, don't run away and stay strong,\" Houllier said at the weekend. \"There are two elements that keep me extremely strong: the first is the board, who are very understanding\" - and who have not sacked a manager since 1956 - \"the second have been the players, and they have been fine. \"It is fair to say I was pleased when Steven Gerrard ran straight to the bench and to me after he had scored. It has not been nice for anyone and some of the stuff written has been unfair. I was very moved by the fans singing my name. It has not been an easy time.\" Elsewhere Graeme Souness - looking more gaunt than fit as he tries to drive Blackburn away from relegation worries - is a manager who continues despite his own heart worries in the past; Joe Kinnear has recently been tempted back with Nottingham Forest; and Barry Fry, whose dicky heart was once wired up to measure stress for the purpose of a television documentary, shows no sign of opting for a quieter life than that of managing Peterborough United. Their love of football keeps them going when reason might say, for God's sake quit. I raised an eyebrow to see one report suggesting Kenny Dalglish might be tempted back to lead Liverpool if Houllier fails to win the Uefa Cup or reach fourth place in the Premiership to qualify for next year's Champions League. After all it was Dalglish who confessed that the time had come to leave when the job became bad for his health - and that was 13 years ago. Yet perhaps Anfield is one place that might yet tempt Dalglish away from the golf course. Could it be that the old crazy obsession for the game still burns? But, for now, Dalglish and any other would-be replacement must wait. The moron who wrote those evil words may have been at Elland Road yesterday, and possibly will be in Bulgaria on Wednesday. But the criticism can stop for now because the signs are that Liverpool have turned the corner. And one day G\u00e9rard Houllier may be able to ram the words back down his critics' throats. Now that would be sweet. Will English cricket put its money where its mouth is? \u00b7Is there one good reason why the England and Wales Cricket Board has not yet decided whether its cricketers are going to pull out of the autumn tour of Zimbabwe? The government has made it clear that it would support a decision not to tour, the players don't want to go and a report commissioned by the ECB itself reached the conclusion that it would be justifiable for England to pull out on moral grounds. And yet, the waiting goes on. Perhaps the ECB fears a claim for compensation from Zimbabwe. Maybe it worries that South Africa might take action against England, ending international contact, if the tour is called off, or that the meaningless ICC Trophy, to be staged in this country in September, might be jeopardised. Will the board upset the international governing body, the International Cricket Council? And then there is the problem of broken TV contracts . . . In other words, it is about money. But there comes a time when questions of morality are surely more important than how to balance the books. The ECB has a wonderful opportunity to cast aside its reputation for dithering if it takes the decision to pull out now. A message can be sent to the other cricketing nations that our country stands up for basic levels of human decency, and that Robert Mugabe's regime does not meet the standards we set. \u00b7Until recently, Belgium has not been noted for its dominance of tennis. But it seems the ho-hum factor is already setting in, after the Dubai Open produced yet another title victory for Belgium's world No1 player Justine Henin-Hardenne, as she beat the Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova in straight sets. The problem is, like buses, you wait an eternity for one champion and then two come along. The world No2, Kim Clijsters, is also Belgian. \"I have heard people saying they are going to get tired of seeing Kim and Justine in finals,\" Henin complained in Dubai, before adding, \"People have got to realise this is an amazing situation and they won't see this any more in the future in Belgium.\" \u00b7I hope Alan Shearer smiles to himself as the campaign gathers strength to have him restored to England's attack for Euro 2004, and sticks to his decision to stay out of international football. Yes, it is flattering that media pundits and former team-mates such as David Beckham should be saying the old warrior still has what it takes. But the harsh truth is that Shearer has lost the necessary explosive pace. His nous, positional sense and sheer bloody-minded will to win have served him well at club level in the autumn of his career, and Newcastle United continue to reap the rewards. But England is another matter. Shearer has always been his own harshest critic, and it is that dispassionate objectivity which might one day make him as fine a manager as he has been a player. If Shearer were to return now, he might underline the inadequacies of those who have followed in the England attack. More likely, he would see once more that, at the highest level, his days are done and I suspect he knows it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
