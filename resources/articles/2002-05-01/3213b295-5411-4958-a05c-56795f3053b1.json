The German driver's claim yesterday that he might be able to win all 12 remaining races was met with a resigned weariness among the other teams, who have already suffered him winning four out of the first five grands prix. Sponsors are expressing concern that although television ratings in Britain have held up so far at between four and six million on Sundays, this has been partly fuelled by viewers expecting the Williams team to launch a credible challenge. The danger is that without any such challenge materialising, the viewing figures will drop off. With Ferrari now poised to rout even their most likely challenger, it is far from certain that those figures will be maintained. Niki Lauda, the team principal of Jaguar, said he was worried that when the sponsors came to renegotiate their contracts they would be seeking to do so at a lower level. All in all, 2002 promises to be a watershed for the sport. Max Mosley, the president of the ruling body, the FIA, put a brave face on what so far has undeniably been a monotonous season. \"Any drop in television viewing figures would certainly be concerning, but it is very early days for this year's championship,\" he said yesterday. \"All sport is boring from time to time. That's the difference between sport and a circus or the theatre. Yet the season is still very young and it would be wrong to assume that the rest of the year will necessarily develop in the same way.\" As well as Ferrari's dominance, there are concerns that the lack of overtaking is reducing interest in the sport. Aerodynamics are now so efficient that the cars are unable to run close together without losing their grip. In addition, the introduction of two pit stops in 1994 has made racing more of a chess match than the sort of wheel-to-wheel battling that viewers love. Schumacher and Ferrari are merely doing what a good team should do, namely a much better job than their rivals. The difference is that they do it on a budget of \u00a3140m, the biggest in formula one. For the smaller teams at the bottom of the food chain, though, there is no trickle-down effect. There are concerns that the Prost team may be followed by others in going out of business. Arrows already have to dig deep to raise the \u00a318m annual lease fees to use the latest Cosworth V10 engines, and Minardi's team principal Paul Stoddart is facing a grilling from his consortium of Malaysian sponsors as to why he had to withdraw his two cars from last Sunday's Spanish grand prix after a succession of wing failures. Many believe that the motor manufacturers' announcement that they will press ahead with plans for their own world championship series from 2008 is causing division within the sport and scaring away potential sponsors. \"Obviously uncertainty in any sport is seldom positive,\" said David Richards, the team principal of British American Racing. \"As far as concerns from sponsors towards this potential uncertainty, I would say that they are aware of it.\" One thing does seems certain. Unless Williams and McLaren in particular sharpen up their acts, television viewers are likely to reach for the off switch as Schumacher's Ferrari continues its apparently remorseless progress towards the German driver's fifth world championship. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
