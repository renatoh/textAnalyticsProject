You know the sort of thing. Those who have watched the movie Deliverance are unlikely to splash out on a boxed set of banjo classics. And so it was that, having read a letter on Football365 the other day, two running stories of possibly imploding talent became conflated in my mind. \"England Need To Hit Rock Bottom\", was its dolorous headline. I now find it difficult to think of the travails of the national side without the mental image of Amy Winehouse drifting into view. Evidently, in some quarters, England have begun to be spoken of in precisely the same language used to delineate the singer's ongoing troubles - troubles which are deemed to have moved beyond the point at which we are still bound to refer to them via traditional entertainment industry euphemisms such as \"suffering from exhaustion\". Only last week, Ms Winehouse's father was explaining to BBC Radio Five Live that his daughter and her husband had \"to reach rock bottom\", and this view was echoed by our Football365 correspondent, who advocated a similar apocalypse for the infirm/inexperienced/heavily medicated band of brothers whose honour/misfortune it is to have the hopes of a nation on their shoulders. He was desperately hoping for England to fail to qualify for Euro 2008. \"And then for the first time in years we can seriously look at ourselves and realise we are the equivalent of a drug addict,\" he concluded, \"and then the only way is up.\" That is a matter of opinion, of course - even should they fail to qualify, one fears there might be a concealed basement to the barrel which England are currently scraping. Certainly, you'd have to think they have the potential for at least two Lohanesque relapses before being caught with someone else's blow in their jeans and being forcibly removed to a Utah rest facility. Anyway, Amy's being the first intervention to be run along the lines of 606, her parents-in-law also took to the airwaves last week, with their solution being to encourage fans to boycott her music to send a tough-love message. Frankly, if England struggle on Saturday, I don't think any of us should rule out Steven Gerrard's parents calling You're On Sky Sports and pleading with the public not to go and watch the team because it only encourages their destructive behaviour. In most other respects the saga already fits the Winehouse paradigm. Like Amy, of course, England are not short of a parade of concerned authority figures, with Tuesday being Sir Trevor Brooking's day to suggest the root of the problems (too many foreign players). Nor does the team lack for questionably motivated shrinks queueing up to explain the issues, with Guus Hiddink this week declaring that England have suffered from \"anxiety and looked scared\" in recent years. Yes, with diagnoses for the national side's underachievement now bordering on the psychiatric, the only surprise is that no one has yet gone the whole hog and suggested the current personnel crisis is the result of players subconsciously allowing injuries to happen as a way of ruling themselves out of these increasingly agonising events. As for enabler figures, perhaps in the mould of Amy's underemployed husband Blake Fielder-Civil, I remain haunted by the previously mentioned image of Steve McClaren in March, explaining his strategy for reversing five games without a win. \"Keep going, keep going,\" he grinned. \"Keep doing the same things.\" Indeed, with both tortured entities in such apparent turmoil, who is to say their fortunes are not symbiotically linked in some way we do not yet fully understand? Perhaps some of the Cassandras have already developed precautionary superstitions, just to be on the safe side. You know, if I touch every other lamp-post on my way to the ground, then my team will score. If Amy scoops the Mercury music prize on Tuesday, then this might presage an analogous victory against Israel come Saturday. (She didn't win, alas, but she showed up, and by all accounts was heartbreakingly good. I'd gird your loins for a frustrating draw.) At some point, though, all deeply serious comparisons between our troubled talents must end. It is, after all, customary when the likes of Amy threaten to implode to quaver that \"they simply burned too brightly\". And that, on the form book, is something of which no one could accuse McClaren's England."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
