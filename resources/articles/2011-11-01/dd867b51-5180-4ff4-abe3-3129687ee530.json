Tevez has been instructed to return to Manchester to explain why he flew to Buenos Aires without the club's permission. It remains unclear when, or if, he will fly back. The relationship is now so damaged City are not taking anything for granted and they have written to Tevez asking for an explanation, with duplicate emails going to the player's adviser, Kia Joorabchian, as well as one of his lawyers, written in English and Spanish to avoid the possibility that their former captain could cite language difficulties. The deadline was set at 5pm on Friday but a club spokesman confirmed shortly before that point they had not received anything. After the cut-off it is unclear, with both sides making an agreement not to comment. Daniel Taylor Brentford The Japanese referee Masaaki Toma will on Saturday become the first non-British or Irish official to take charge of an FA Cup fixture. Toma is in the UK as part of a referee exchange programme and has been selected to officiate the first-round match between Brentford and Basingstoke Town. Toma, who was the referee when England played Mexico in a friendly last year, has already taken on a reserve-team match between Bolton Wanderers and Sunderland and a Conference North fixture. David Elleray, the chairman of the Football Association's Referees Committee, said: \"His appointment shows that the FA Cup really does hold global appeal.\" PA Wigan Athletic The captain, Antol\u00edn Alcaraz, has issued an apology on the club's website for the spitting incident that has landed him a three-match ban. He was caught by television cameras spitting at the Wolves defender Richard Stearman during Wigan's 3-1 Premier League defeat by Wolves on Sunday and this week accepted a misconduct charge from the FA. A statement from Alcaraz read: \"I would like to apologise for my actions following the game against Wolverhampton Wanderers last Sunday. I apologise to anyone connected to our football club for the offence and upset that my actions have caused. I reacted wrongly after being provoked but I never meant to spit on an opposing player.\" PA Redditch United The FA has banned Josh McKenzie from all football until July 2014 after he struck a referee last month. McKenzie, who was playing for Redditch United against Chesham United on 15 October, was charged with and admitted to improper conduct after striking the match referee after he had been sent off. He was immediately released by Redditch and has now been banned for the best part of three years, as well as being fined \u00a3250.
