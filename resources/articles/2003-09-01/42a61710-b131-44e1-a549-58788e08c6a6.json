The Manchester United manager must have been both last night after his team paid for a poor display by losing for the first time in 21 league matches. The Scot is no more likely to have been smiling than he is to receive a signed copy of Beckham's tome. Disturbed all afternoon by Southampton's hyper-energetic approach, United conceded a late James Beattie header after the otherwise impressive Tim Howard failed to claim a corner. The champions could have few complaints at suffering their first defeat since going down 3-1 at Middlesbrough on Boxing Day last year. They created little, lacking the invention, flow and tempo which mark their best displays. That was partly because Southampton's tactics were spot on, based on closing down relentlessly so as to hurry United into errors, while forcing their opponents into retreat with a regular flow of long balls. Yet it was also because too many United players failed to shine and the team's balance appeared wrong. Kleberson, best known as a central midfielder, looked uncomfortable on the right before being forced off with a disclocated shoulder. Eric Djemba-Djemba, another summer signing, made too many errors alongside Roy Keane and, until Cristiano Ronaldo came on, United were high on graft in midfield but short on inspiration. They rarely threatened to break down Southampton and provided just one quality cross all match. Ryan Giggs played much of the game on the left but only threatened in short bursts and United sorely missed the goal threat and touches of Paul Scholes, who will be out for about a month. It was unfortunate for Ferguson that Ole Gunnar Solskjaer was also sidelined by injury. Such absences could be all the more costly this season given that David Beckham and Juan Sebastian Veron have gone and the exciting Ronaldo is young and adjusting to the Premiership. United's new arrivals are otherwise less inventive and also appear in need of time to adapt, while Diego Forlan still cannot be relied on to turn a match. Although he forced a fine save from Paul Jones in the 84th minute, he operated only on the fringes. The ease with which Southampton bustled United out of their rhythm ought to concern Ferguson. His players hit too many inaccurate long balls in the first half, gave away possession too often and barely fashioned a chance after the interval until Forlan's shot. Only when Mikael Silvestre directed a free header wide from a corner did they otherwise threaten and the first half had been little better. Keane dropped deeper and deeper to try to instigate attacks but to no avail. It is a start-point of Strachan's approach that his strikers and midfielders should run hard to prevent opponents from settling and he could be delighted with the efforts of Beattie, Kevin Phillips and the rest. Matthew Oakley was disciplined and steady, and Paul Telfer did well in his unaccustomed central role. Until the lively Beattie got his head to Graeme Le Saux's excellent corner Southampton seemed certain to be heading for a third successive goalless draw, but they had created scoring opportunities. Twice inside 10 second-half minutes Howard saved well, from Phillips and then Beattie. United's defence struggled to deal with Beattie's aerial threat and Southampton often went direct to the striker in the air or down the channels. At the other end Michael Svensson generally dealt well with Ruud van Nistelrooy, who rarely shone but looked the United player most likely to produce something. He had two first-half shots saved and will have to adjust to the change of service without Beckham. On the right flank formerly patrolled by Beckham, Kleberson struggled. It is too early to judge the Brazilian but he did not look suited to wing play. His passing and crossing were loose and he has to hope he can be accommodated in the centre, an honour not always afforded to Veron at United. Ronaldo came off the bench to add some unpredictability and thrust down that side without changing the game but United rarely flooded forward from deep in the numbers that can make them dangerous, particularly when Scholes and Solskjaer are around. A few runs from Giggs hinted at promise but he was not involved as much as United needed. Ferguson's players had been given a hint of what to expect inside 10 minutes when Beattie headed down for Telfer to shoot wide and the England striker was a regular thorn in their side. His header on gave Phillips a chance which Howard thwarted and he then saw a header tipped over by the American before glory arrived. Howard had commanded his area well and looked likely to save United from defeat until he lost an inswinger from Le Saux with Claus Lundekvam in front of him. Beattie got the decisive touch from a yard, leaving United with a feeling of vulnerability they have not had for some time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
