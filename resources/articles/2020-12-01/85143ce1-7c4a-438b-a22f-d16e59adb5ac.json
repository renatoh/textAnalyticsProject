Hearn\u2019s fighter, Anthony Joshua, faces Pulev on Saturday night in the first world heavyweight title contest to take place in a bio-secure Covid-19 bubble. The curiously open and engaging nature of boxing, the most brutal and dangerous of all sports, has been even more evident this week as the fighters, managers, promoters, television crews and lowly writers have all been cooped up together in a cordoned-off section of a hotel in Wembley. \u201cHe\u2019s scary,\u201d Hearn continued after I told him how Pulev had been a quiet revelation whether talking about books or his father, psychology or his conviction that he will beat Joshua. \u201cEvery time I\u2019ve seen him this week I\u2019ve gone like that.\u201d Hearn bunched his knuckles in the traditional fist bump of the fight bubble. \u201cAnd Pulev\u2019s really hit me quite hard on the hand. Not violently but I\u2019ve gone [Hearn wrings his hand]. I said: \u2018Kubrat, can you stop doing that?\u2019 He looked at me and said: \u2018Ha, ha, you easy \u2026\u2019\u201d Hearn has hundreds of millions of pounds hinging on the outcome of this fight. If Pulev were to shock Joshua and strip him of his IBF, WBA and WBO belts he will simultaneously rip up Hearn\u2019s intricate plans. An expected victory for the champion, in contrast, would secure a two-fight deal between Joshua and Tyson Fury, the WBC title-holder. Joshua against Fury, an all-British battle for the undisputed heavyweight championship of the world, would be a wild, compelling and insanely lucrative affair. Hearn expects the first fight to secure around 2.2m buys on pay-per-view. Pulev stands in the way \u2013 but the Bulgarian\u2019s toughness is not matched by the kind of hand speed which unsettled Joshua when he was stopped 18 months ago. Andy Ruiz Jr, dismissed as a roly-poly no-hoper, hauled himself off the Madison Square Garden canvas to blitz Joshua. The fallen champion looked battered and bemused on that crazy night in New York. It says much for Joshua\u2019s professionalism that he won the rematch in Saudi Arabia last December by opting for a more cautious strategy. He regained his titles with a wide victory on points but doubts remain because Ruiz partied harder than he prepared for that second fight \u2013 and memories of Joshua\u2019s vulnerability have yet to fade. Pulev looks lean and confident and Hearn said: \u201cHe\u2019s a tough guy. He\u2019s proud. But AJ is in a good place. He\u2019s edgy, he\u2019s nervous, which I think is a great thing because, in these fights behind closed doors, it\u2019s easy to be five rounds in and coast a little. And with 1,000 fans there on Saturday it\u2019s going to be even weirder than having nobody because it\u2019s somewhere in the middle \u2013 but still more like an exhibition atmosphere behind closed doors.\u201d The unsettling truth is that this will be the opposite of an exhibition. Robert McCracken, a down-to-earth Brummie realist who has trained Joshua since the amateur days and been in the corner for all his tumultuous high and lows, spoke plainly: \u201cIt\u2019s very tough for heavyweight boxers. They are always one punch away from disaster. But Josh\u2019s trained long and hard. He\u2019s taken Pulev deadly serious.\u201d McCracken nodded when asked if he agreed with Hearn\u2019s assessment that Joshua, beneath the amiable quips, is on edge. \u201cHe is. Pulev is another top fighter with an unbelievable record \u2013 he\u2019s only ever lost to [Wladimir] Klitschko. Very skilled, durable and tough. Josh is up against it because it\u2019s another live challenger. They\u2019re not hand-picked or No 15. It doesn\u2019t work like that with big Josh.\u201d The giant shadow of Fury hangs over the event \u2013 even if the 6ft 9in WBC champion with the outrageous suits and outlandish mouth is not expected to accept Hearn\u2019s offer to attend the fight. McCracken was pragmatic again when asked about Fury. \u201cHeavyweight boxing is so dangerous you can\u2019t be thinking of future opponents. You\u2019ve got the mandatory challenger [Pulev] who\u2019s really determined, technically good, physically strong. All Josh thinks about is Pulev. For the last six months really. He\u2019s got to get the job done.\u201d Pulev has a terrific jab \u2013 which is so often the key to victory in boxing. But, in the bubble, Pulev revealed even more. He was intelligent and amusing company. \u201cI win all the time,\u201d Pulev said when confirming that he is the Jenga champion in his camp. \u201cIt\u2019s very precise, like building, which is my second passion after boxing. I like building, I like designing, I like architecture. From when I was six years old I drew buildings.\u201d Pulev is a proud Bulgarian and he says how much he wants to beat Joshua for the sake of his country and, even more personally, for his late father, Venko. \u201cHe was a heavyweight,\u201d Pulev said, \u201cand he loved boxing, like crazy, like a maniac. Before me and my brother were born, he wanted his whole life to have boys who became boxing champions.\u201d Venko Pulev was married three times and he became the father to five girls before, finally, 39 years ago, his son was born. \u201cThat was me. He said: \u2018Wow! I can\u2019t believe it\u2019. He named me Kubrat which is the name of a very old king in Bulgaria. My middle name is Venko after him. My dad had two passions: boxing and books. He was a maniac about books. We lived in our small apartment and all the walls were completely covered in books, from floor to ceiling. In those socialist days everyone had the same apartment, the same furniture, the same couch. But all our furniture was made especially for books. Ten thousand books in one apartment. Every kind of book. History, romance, boxing.\u201d There was a less literary tone when Pulev spoke of his certainty that, driven by the memories of his father, he would knock out Joshua. The world champion clearly remained the king this week. While he was accommodating, Joshua was tucked away in his own bubble within the larger boxing bubble. He is protected by his management but Joshua understands that he will be alone when Pulev walks towards him in a ring full of jeopardy and uncertainty. \u201cI always say Sunday morning will come, so no rush,\u201d Joshua said with a wry smile when I asked him if the last few days of fight week were the hardest. \u201cWe\u2019re here now. I\u2019ve trained hard and I feel more confident than last time [the Ruiz rematch]. In Saudi, there was massive pressure. This one I have had a lot of time to work on everything. But it won\u2019t be a walk in the park because, if I don\u2019t take this guy deadly serious, I\u2019m giving him a chance to beat me.\u201d Joshua had heard all the questions about Fury and their anticipated showdown in 2021. \u201cI\u2019ll give you the answers but please, right now, it\u2019s solely about Kubrat Pulev. My focus is not on anyone else.\u201d In a small huddle around Joshua someone persisted and asked how he felt about Fury choosing not to be at ringside. \u201cI don\u2019t think too much about it. He\u2019s a good fighter. He\u2019s done well. Good luck to him, but Saturday night is my night.\u201d Joshua\u2019s cagey display in the Ruiz rematch was followed soon after by Fury crushing Deontay Wilder to become WBC champion in Las Vegas in February. \u201cYeah, but remember it took a long time for Tyson Fury to become destructive,\u201d Joshua said. \u201cI\u2019ve been that destructive ever since I started boxing. But I\u2019m just going to do the job against Pulev in the best way possible. I\u2019m ready for a 12-round fight but if a shot lands and causes a lot of damage I will be looking to take him out. Once a killer always a killer. Certain people can\u2019t sleep at night because they\u2019re really tuned up for a fight but I must be a good psychopath because I\u2019m sleeping like a baby.\u201d Boxing\u2019s capacity for tumult soon replaced such tranquillity. Friday afternoon\u2019s weigh-in descended into a flurry of chaos as Pulev shouted at Joshua: \u201cTomorrow I\u2019m going to destroy you.\u201d Joshua replied: \u201cWhat? You? Disrespect me and I\u2019ll show you.\u201d The fighters came nose-to-nose while, at the back of the room, Pulev\u2019s vociferous Bulgarian entourage charged the burly line of security men. The scuffling lasted for 10 seconds before the fighters exchanged more insults. \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t stop,\u201d Hearn told me afterwards. \u201cIn the end Pulev said: \u2018I respect you\u2019 and that dampened it. But he started again. Pulev said: \u2018Tomorrow I will finish you, I will end you.\u2019 AJ wasn\u2019t rattled. He was calm and cold.\u201d Late on Saturday night, when the bubble darkens, the black lights of the ring will frame the contrasting figures of Joshua and Pulev. All this week\u2019s edgy laughter and noise will die away. Everyone will pause as we wait to see the heavy blows land and discover whether the heavyweight money-spinner between Fury and Joshua has been ruined or secured.
