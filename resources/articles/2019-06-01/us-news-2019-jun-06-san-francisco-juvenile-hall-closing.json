The city is now tasked with creating a new program for youth offenders that will includea secure facility, but one focused on rehabilitation. The facility should feel \u201cmore like a school or a wellness center rather than a jail or a prison\u201d, said the city supervisor Hillary Ronen, one of the sponsors of the legislation. The push to shut down the city\u2019s juvenile detention center came as youth crime and juvenile felony arrests dropped throughout the state. However, San Francisco continued to spend $13m a year on a facility that remained, at times, three-quarters empty, Ronen said. And for the youth stuck inside, studies have shown time and time again the damage that incarceration can do to personal development. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense any more in this day or age, with all our modern understanding of the youth brain, to keep using these outdated modes that are extremely expensive,\u201d she said. The near-unanimous decision had overwhelming support from city lawmakers, with eight of the 11 lawmakers co-signing the legislation. The legal action was spurred by a San Francisco Chronicle report that found the city spent $300,000 per youth in juvenile detention, despite a declining population. The battle to close the detention center was personal for at least one lawmaker. Twenty-seven years ago, Supervisor Shamann Walton was one of those kids in juvenile hall, spending time in custody for crimes like armed robbery and possession of a firearm. As an elected official, he returned to a detention center and realized the experience was almost exactly the same as it had been for him when he was a kid. \u201cYou\u2019re still walking the line, you\u2019re still sleeping on concrete, you\u2019re still doing workbooks and not working with a teacher, you\u2019re still spending more time in your room, isolated, not having the opportunity for mental health help, or to gain life skills or social skills,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething needed to change. \u201cThe only thing I learned from juvenile hall was how to be resilient and how to endure a locked-up experience, which only prepares you to be in county jail or prison,\u201d Walton said. \u201cNothing I learned in juvenile hall prepared me to make the change I needed to get to where I am today, and the same thing is happening to far too many of our young black and Latino people.\u201d He hopes that by closing down the juvenile detention center and developing a new, rehabilitation-focused program for youth offenders, he will be able to provide future generations of kids that same opportunity to end the cycle of criminality that he was afforded. \u201cWe have to set our young people up for success and do it with the bold change that it requires,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a couple years to reimagine and reinvent the current structure, and I\u2019m excited.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
