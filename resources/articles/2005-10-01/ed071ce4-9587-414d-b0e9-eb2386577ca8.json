Mr Jones, 62, announced his retirement yesterday, just ahead of the group's October round of shareholder meetings. He will be succeeded next May, at the time of the chain's annual meeting, by John Barton, currently deputy chairman. The Next chairman is highly regarded by investors, both for his work at Next and for his role in reshaping the boardroom at supermarket chain Wm Morrison. He has clashed repeatedly with the grocer's chairman Sir Ken Morrison as he has brought in non-executives to help steer Morrisons out of the huge problems it has faced since its acquisition of Safeway last year. Mr Jones joined Next from the Grattan catalogue business in 1986 and was installed as chief executive in 1988 when Next's founder George Davies was ousted. The chain was on the brink of collapse but Mr Jones rebuilt it into Britain's third biggest fashion business with more than 550 outlets. Throughout his time at Next Mr Jones has been battling Parkinson's disease. Although diagnosed at the age of 39 he kept his illness secret until four years ago. Under his leadership Next's stock market value increased from a low of \u00a325m to the present \u00a33.3bn. Yesterday the shares lost 12p to finish at \u00a312.94. They have been battered in recent weeks after Next described high street conditions as the worst since 1992 and admitted to a 9% fall in like-for-like sales. Mr Jones moved up to the chairman's role in 2002 after appointing his former assistant Simon Wolfson as his successor. At the time of his appointment Mr Wolfson was the youngest FTSE-100 chief executive. Yesterday Mr Wolfson said: \"His blend of common sense, financial prudence and personal warmth has been an inspiration to all of those who have worked for him. His achievements have been all the more remarkable, given the ever increasing physical burden of Parkinson's disease.\" Mr Jones said: \"I am confident I will leave the company in good hands - the combination of Simon's energy and intelligence with John's wisdom and experience will provide the company with excellent leadership.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
