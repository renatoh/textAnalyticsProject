Greenwood scored the opening goal in Manchester United\u2019s win against Partizan Belgrade on Thursday, but missed their previous cup outing against Chelsea through being selected for the U21s to play Doncaster the night before. Even when Anthony Martial was out injured, Solskj\u00e6r resisted the temptation to use Greenwood in league games because he did not want to rush his development or give him too much responsibility too early. \u201cWe can\u2019t play him all the time, we are trying to ease him in gradually,\u201d the manager said. \u201cAs a young boy you have ups and downs. It would not be fair to ask him to play every week and it would not have been right either to put all the weight on Mason\u2019s shoulders when Anthony was missing. This club is all about giving young players with the right attitude a chance, but at that age you have to be careful. \u201cMason is going to have a very good career. He\u2019s a natural finisher and he\u2019s just as composed in front of a crowd of 60,000 as he is kicking a ball about with his mates but if it takes a couple of years for him to become established we are fine with that.\u201d United face Brighton at home on Sunday and Solskj\u00e6r believes their opponents have improved significantly under Graham Potter. \u201cI thought they were a good team last season. I remember thinking we were lucky to beat them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey seem to have turned a corner since, they have been controlling games and we are going to need loads of energy to press really well. We can\u2019t let them be comfortable here at Old Trafford.\u201d Defeat at Bournemouth in their last league fixture put an end to the mini-recovery United had staged since becoming the first side this season to take points from Liverpool, and Solskj\u00e6r accepts there will be backward steps as well as forward ones. \u201cYou will get that with such a young team,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are still not quite as consistent as we would like to be but we are learning all the time. We know the Premier League is out of our reach, we are too far behind the top teams, but there is a lot of the season left and any cup competition that comes around we intend to go for.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
