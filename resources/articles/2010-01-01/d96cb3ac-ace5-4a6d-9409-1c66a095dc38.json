That it was only just enough says as much about Fulham's character as it does about the visitors' poor defending, but it was an expensive evening for Roy Hodgson's team in every sense. Having lost the centre-half Brede Hangeland to a recurrence of a knee injury at half-time, Hodgson saw his leading scorer, Bobby Zamora, led from the field after dislocating what the manager said was either his collarbone or a shoulder. \"Hopefully the prognosis will not be too bad but it's not a short-term problem,\" said the manager. Stoke has always been a place apart, in some people's opinion anyway, and while heavy snow was causing chaos to the north and south of the five towns, the Britannia Stadium remained relatively flake-free, in the hours before the game at least. Matthew Etherington had the ball in the net as early as the second minute, unfortunately for Stoke from an offside, but the incident presaged a lively opening by the home team. They were rewarded in the 12th minute, shortly after Zamora had hit a 25-yard free-kick under the wall and just wide. Tuncay Sanli's persistence forced Hangeland to concede a corner which Etherington curled in from the right. Robert Huth, up from full-back, outjumped a clutch of defenders to head towards the far post, where Tuncay, lurking two yards out, redirected the ball firmly past Schwarzer. Fulham were fragile away from Craven Cottage last season, and given they had failed to win any of their previous eight league games on the road, are proving so again this time around, but they were unfortunate not to equalise when Hangeland's header bounced wide. Stoke's constant pressuring of the man in possession was beginning to have an effect however, and shortly after the half hour, they doubled their lead. Again Etherington's fast, inswinging set-piece delivery from the right was the key, though a Fulham defender should surely have at least tried to intercept the ball before Abdoulaye Faye, sliding in, did exactly that to steer it past Schwarzer. The Boothen End erupted but there might just have been an element of disbelief to their celebrations three minutes later. Again Etherington was involved, his cross was headed on by Danny Higginbotham and Mamady Sidibe's technique was faultless as he volleyed down and past Schwarzer. Needing encouragement, Fulham were fortunate. Damien Duff's shot from 22 yards appeared to be heading wide when it hit Shawcross and left Simonsen hopelessly flat-footed. Then, with five minutes of normal time remaining, Clint Dempsey smashed a superb dipping volley over Simonsen to ensure the nerves were jangling, and Stoke were lucky a 90th-minute handball by Shawcross inside the penalty area was missed by the referee. After three successive defeats, City's bid to retain their Premier League status for a second season is back on track, but for all that their manager, Tony Pulis, will be relieved his team are no longer the league's lowest scorers. \"We really pressed them and got after them in the first half,\" said Pulis. \"That's six goals in two games. We've been creating good chances, just not taking them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
