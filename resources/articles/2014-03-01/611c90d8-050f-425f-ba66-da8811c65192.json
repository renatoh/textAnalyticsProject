On the same day, Tasmanians are also expected to elect a Liberal government. If the Liberals win, this will herald a remarkable turnaround for the Liberals at the state level, with the ALP in office only in the ACT. In its heyday of the mid 2000s, the ALP dominated every state and territory. With Tony Abbott in office at the federal level, would this mean that Australians have embraced a new conservative settlement? In South Australia, the story is mixed \u2013 and as with all elections, local factors play a part. Mike Rann dominated SA politics since winning office with a minority in 2002, and Jay Weatherill has struggled to impose his own vision. Weatherill was dealt a tough deal when the Olympic Dam expansion was cancelled shortly after he took over the leadership, and with the devastation of the Holden pull-out, the economic situation has been precarious for a while. The difficulty for Labor is the problem all long-term established governments face: how to renew in office. The last time a government won four straight elections in SA was under Don Dunstan in the 1970s, but the elections cycles were shorter. Thomas Playford may have won nine straight elections from 1938-1962, but he was helped by the infamous \u201cplaymander\u201d. More recently, and unlike the last state election, there appear to be ideological differences between Weatherill\u2019s ALP and Steven Marshall\u2019s Liberals. Weatherill has repeatedly shown a preference for big government, and his focus on state-sponsored infrastructure spending to lift the economy draws upon his Keynesian economics. Marshall, conversely, sees SA as over-taxed, and has in sights reform of the Land tax and also repeal of the car park tax. In contrast, at the 2010 election, the main difference between Mike Rann and then Liberal leader, Isobel Redmond, was whether to build a new, or refurbish the Royal Adelaide Hospital. The ideological fault-lines between the major parties are now more pronounced. Yet, the ALP\u2019s attempt to portray Marshall as the latest carnation of a \u201cslash and burn\u201d Campbell Newman is failing to stick, despite Marshall seeking advice from neo-liberals such as Jeff Kennett. In part, that\u2019s because Marshall is a more socially progressive Liberal taking a practical, rather than ideological, approach. His predecessor tripped up over a series of gaffes and confusion about cuts to the public sector, but Marshall has neutralised this debate by matching the same cuts proposed by the ALP. The frustration with the Marshall campaign is the so-called \u201csmall target\u201d strategy. The Liberals have run a smooth campaign, and used a series of TV ads with Marshall promising to improve health and \u201cget SA back on track\u201d, but with little detail. Indeed, the Liberals are only planning to hold their official campaign launch just seven days before the election. But meanwhile, the \u201csmall government\u201d message resonates well with the wider population. The common analogy is that if your household is getting further into debt, then the last thing you do is get another credit card. This is a failure on the ALP\u2019s part to dispel this image: government debt is distinct from personal debt, not least as government has the power to raise revenue. Overall, the reasons why political parties attract voters is a murky, and imprecise science. Data from the Australian election study tells us that, over time, voters see less difference between the major parties, but crucially do see some difference. At the federal level, in 1993, 44% saw a \u201cgood deal\u201d of difference between the two, which declined to just 26% in 2010. In South Australia, local factors \u2013 such as the Debelle Inquiry into the Education department, and the so-called \u201cIt\u2019s Time\u201d factor \u2013 may be the main reasons that the ALP might lose office. Again, survey data shows that Australians tend to have a very high opinion of their democracy. For some, changing the government is more important than continuing with the status-quo, even if this means handing power to a new Premier with only one-term\u2019s experience as a politician."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
