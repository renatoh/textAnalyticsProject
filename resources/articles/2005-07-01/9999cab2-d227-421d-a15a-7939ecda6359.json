New York", "bodyText": "Why? As a boy, I saw New York on television and dreamt of getting there one day. I was about 22 when I made it, and will always remember standing in Times Square for the first time. The best thing? The music. There is every kind of record shop, and Beat Street Records in Brooklyn has become a regular haunt. My ideal day: I'd get up and go in search of a Mexican breakfast of eggs with chilli and spices. That would get me going for the day. Next, I'd walk the length of Broadway until I reached Times Square. I'd also make it to Barneys, one of the city's most expensive clothing shops. I'd eat in Chelsea then move on to a few bars before ending the night at Cielo, a cool club with an amazing sound and light system. My advice: Eat well. The food is amazing, and you can get whatever you want 24 hours a day. Getting there: Virgin Atlantic (0870 3802007, virgin-atlantic.com) flies Heathrow-New York from around \u00a3480pp return. \u00b7 A Picture Of Bristol By Roni Size will be on BBC Three on Monday at 7.30pm. His new single Sing is taken from his latest album, Return To V (Thrive Music)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
