This time, it's more serious than the usual tabloid fare of three-in-a-bed romps, bungs, drugs or training-pitch fisticuffs. The latest story is about two famous footballers and a brawl in the middle of Leeds that left a young Asian man unconscious, with a broken leg, bite marks and a lifetime of nightmares. On Friday, the footballers walked free from court and will carry on their lucrative careers with Leeds United - and England, perhaps. One of the players, Jonathan Woodgate, was convicted of affray and given 100 hours' community service. The family of the victim, Sarfraz Najeib, were appalled and their legal representatives say they are considering further court action. The Leeds chairman, Peter Ridsdale, recognising that the more serious hurt here was inflicted on Najeib, was quick to comment afterwards: 'I don't want to start looking for sympathy for our two footballers.' Yet, just as quickly, Ridsdale said that Woodgate and his accused team-mate Lee Bowyer, who was largely exonerated, would be welcomed back once they had talked about their past and future conduct with the coach, David O'Leary. And it has to be said that, from the moment the charges were laid, O'Leary has been unquestioningly supportive of the players. As a consequence, Bowyer, a robust character, has played regularly, although the more troubled Woodgate has not. Ridsdale's slim argument, meanwhile, was that neither player had been convicted of the more serious charge of GBH and, as he had said beforehand, if they had, they would have had no future at Leeds. It was a judgment ringing with calculated practicality. Woodgate and Bowyer are two very good footballers, worth a lot of money either on the pitch or on the transfer market. The victim's family and friends were unhappy that Bowyer - who, like Woodgate, had been involved in a lesser, though similar, public disturbance years ago - was found not guilty of grievous bodily harm and affray. Nevertheless, the judge refused Bowyer's request for the court to pay his costs of more than \u00a31million and said he had lied repeatedly. The main blame for the attack fell instead on a non-footballer involved, Paul Clifford, 22, who received six years for GBH and affray. Neale Caveney, another friend of the players, was given 100 hours' community service for affray. It was a messy conclusion to a trial that had been conducted in two disjointed stages, mainly because one newspaper had ignored guidelines at the abortive first hearing. In both halves of what was always going to be a circus, the media descended upon Leeds in strength, not so much because of the seriousness of the attack and the plight of the victim but because of the celebrity of the accused. This, however, is a story beyond normal tabloid prurience. It has been represented as a story of rich, young footballers setting a poor example to millions of young fans and a big club giving the impression they value money above morals. More importantly, though, it is not the whole story about football and footballers... I'm sure I'm not alone in finding Woodgate and Bowyer an unattractive pair. But they are just two players - typical of a few, without being representative of all, if you can make the distinction. It would be reassuring to imagine, on the other hand, that Neil Harris is more typical, as well as more represen tative. The night before the Woodgate-Bowyer story reached its headline-grabbing conclusion, Harris, a highly regarded young striker, returned to Millwall's first team after a long absence, coming on as a late substitute against Portsmouth. It rated a line or two in some papers. But Harris's story should bring a skip to the heart and a smile to cynical lips. In 1998, Millwall paid non-League Cambridge City \u00a330,000 for him. He scored 18 goals in his first full season and was voted the Lions' player of the year. Last season he scored 28 goals, the most since Teddy Sheringham 10 years ago, and was said to be worth \u00a31million. Harris could have moved on - Liverpool were interested - and might one day have asked for something like the money Woodgate and Bowyer get at Leeds. But he stayed at Millwall. Within a week of signing his new contract, he was told he had testicular cancer. They caught it early, though, and, after radiotherapy, he picked up his career, reappearing in the reserves in recent weeks. Harris wasn't just relieved to be playing again; he was very happy to be alive and, in celebration of that fact, set about raising money for cancer research. In a most innovative way. Millwall, the Institute of Cancer Research and a recycling company called Office Green have devised a scheme whereby old printer inkjet and toner cartridges can be re-used and raise money at the same time. Harris, who worked for a Japanese bank before taking up football as a job, is an articulate spokesman for his cause. His story is not sexy or sensational. Just heart-warming. As is that of Charlton Athletic Football Club. They are among just a dozen clubs in the Football League involved in a scheme to help disabled youngsters play football. It is called Ability Counts and is sponsored by One-to-One until May, after which the Football Association will be asked to take over. As Sean Daly, a coordinator at Charlton, said, it will be interesting to see if they do. Daly was at The Valley on Tuesday when Alan Beeson, who has moderate learning difficulties, trained with the first team, recognition for his selection in the national under-18 disabled team. Daly says Everton and Leeds, among Premier League clubs, have also taken part in the scheme, but the response generally has not been overwhelming. 'There are kids with all sorts of disabilities, amputees, Down's Syndrome kids, all getting stuck in together. The classes we run, twice a week in the area, are always fully subscribed.' Another footballer 'doing his bit' is Paul Gascoigne. Last week the old rascal donated \u00a310,000 to Gateshead Football Club to help them in their fight against bankruptcy. It is a little-publicised side to Gascoigne that is familiar to those who know him well. Just as it is possible to be a highly paid footballer and a total arse - such as Woodgate and Bowyer - so it is obvious that players such as Gascoigne and Harris can combine fame and finer qualities. But all-round saints are thin on the ground. On the day of the Woodgate-Bowyer judgement, Ryan Giggs gave a TV interview about his work for Unicef in which he said of his fellow professionals: 'Players and pop stars are in the public eye. People take notice of that.' Giggs, like the army of moralists with access to a microphone or laptop, seems to accept the argument that celebrities should be that dreadful modern phenomenon, the role model. Which is a point of view. But it is a tired and misleading one. The only people public personalities (or anyone else) should be responsible to are themselves. (They should read a bit of Nietzsche.) Giggs has turned out fine without following the example of the role model closest to him, his father, Danny Wilson, who had the occasional brush with authority when he was a rugby league star. Giggs made his own way - as do most people, for better or worse. If footballers want to go out and get drunk, the consequences belong solely to them. It is the same with any athlete or public figure. Or you and I negotiating a homeward stagger from the Christmas party. The Millwall supporters who attacked Portsmouth fans and wrecked a London pub before heading off to the New Den to applaud the return of Neil Harris on Thursday night were not responding to any example set by their team's footballers (least of all Harris). They were just boneheads. And, in all likelihood, they were every bit as thick as Woodgate and Bowyer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
