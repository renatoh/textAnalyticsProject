Hopefully, several names here will be in the reckoning come Festival time in March. But champion trainer Martin Pipe has the first major prize in his sights with Shooting Light in Saturday's Thomas Pink Gold Cup - a race he has won four times already under its various titles. Arctic Owl 7-year-old, trained by James Fanshawe Winner of the Irish St Leger last year, this high-class Flat stayer has been given ample time to recover from a minor training setback and has the potential to develop into a top hurdler - quite possibly Champion Hurdle class. Dark Shell 6-y-o, Nicky Henderson Also a smart performer on the level - Group class as a four- year-old with Sir Michael Stoute - Dark Shell won his novice at Huntingdon in March before, like so many at the meeting, getting totally bogged down in atrocious ground at Aintree. He will be aimed at valuable handicap hurdles. First Ballot 5-y-o, David Elsworth Pulled up in the mud when contesting the Grade One Martell Aintree Hurdle on his final start, First Ballot had shown real flair for jumping when making all to beat Razer Blade at Kempton. Since then he has been in great form on the Flat, improving in the region of 20lb, and he can exploit a good mark in handicap hurdles. Flame Creek 5-y-o, Noel Chance Of all the NH Flat Race winners last season, none impressed more than this gelding on his only start at Wincanton in the spring. Sent off a well-backed 3-1 shot, he took up the running on the bridle two furlongs out and shot clear in a matter of strides to win by 12 lengths. It was no surprise to hear him described by his trainer as \"something really special\" and Flame Creek is an exciting prospect for novice hurdles. Frantic Tan 9-y-o, Nigel Twiston-Davies Carrying on the tradition of his stable s good record in valuable staying handicaps with first-season chasers, Frantic Tan was most impressive when winning the De Vere Gold Cup, over three and a half miles, at Haydock. He struggled against First Gold and Marlborough when brought back in distance after that, but remains one for the short-list when stamina is at a premium. The Coral Welsh National is a likely port of call. Gower-Slave 9-y-o, Philip Hobbs Formerly trained by Peter Bowen, Gower-Slave was a revelation for his new stable last season, winning three out of four and signing off with a bold display of jumping over the Grand National fences when winning the John Hughes Trophy by five lengths. Hallyards Gael 7-yo, Mary Reveley While October Mist would seem to be Mrs Reveley s main novice chaser after his defeat of Barton at Wetherby, Hallyards Gael might not be far behind. Sidelined since winning over hurdles at Perth and Kelso early last season, the Strong Gale gelding is back in strong work and going well. He is highly regarded and can run up a sequence in northern novice chases. Shooting Light 8-y-o, Martin Pipe Martin Pipe has wasted no time in transforming Shooting Light from ordinary novice chaser into smart handicapper. The gelding was having his first outing for the stable when leaving his previous form behind to score by 11 lengths at Cheltenham last month. Though raised 14lb in the ratings, he is still well treated on his hurdles form and big-race success beckons - more than likely starting with Saturday's Thomas Pink Gold Cup. Spring Grove 6-y-o, Robert Alner The two-mile handicap division is comparatively weak in the chasing ranks and Spring Grove has the potential to do well in that sphere. Streamstown 7-y-o, Ferdy Murphy Soft ground is essential for this ex-Irish gelding, and if the mud is flying at Newbury on December 1 he would not be without a chance off a low weight in the Hennessy Gold Cup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
