He has joined on a Bosman transfer on a one-year contract with an option of a further year. Hinshelwood's need for additional cover up front was highlighted at the weekend when Bobby Zamora, Brighton's top scorer of the past two seasons, went off after half an hour with a knee injury during the home defeat by Norwich and the team failed to get a shot on target. Kitson, who had talks with Hinshelwood last week, said: \"I liked the way Martin came across. He's a genuine person and I have heard good things about him as a coach. Also, the way the chairman sold the club to me I was impressed by.\" The former Newcastle striker, who has scored 71 goals in 264 games during his career, added that one of the primary reasons for joining Brighton, with whom he has been training since last week, was the thought of teaming up with Zamora. Chris Kiwomya, the former Arsenal striker, has joined Grimsby for a week's trial with a view to completing a permanent move to Blundell Park. Grimsby's manager Paul Groves sees Kiwomya as a replacement for Steve Livingstone who fractured his skull as a result of an aerial collision with Derby County's defender Danny Higginbotham during Saturday's 2-1 home defeat. The 33-year-old Livingstone was knocked unconscious and the game was held up for 14 minutes while he received treatment on the pitch before being taken to hospital. He will be out of action for at least four weeks. Grimsby's physiotherapist Paul Mitchell said: \"He has fractured the base of his skull and is still bleeding slightly from his ear.\" The Wolves defender Colin Cameron has sustained suspected medial ligament damage and could be out for six weeks. He was injured in a challenge with Burnley's Gareth Taylor during the 3-0 win on Saturday. Two former England wingers have joined non-League clubs. Andy Sinton, 36, the former Spurs and Sheffield Wednesday player released by Wolves at the end of last season, has joined Burton Albion. Mark Walters, 38, whose clubs included Aston Villa and Liverpool, has moved to Ilkeston Town after announcing his retirement from the professional game. He was let go by Bristol Rovers in May."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
