Instead, he will take his revitalised Bradford team to the KC Stadium seeking to continue the Bulls' run of five successive trips to Old Trafford following this latest play-off triumph in a thrilling contest with Warrington. McNamara turned down the opportunity to take charge of his hometown club Hull in April, instead choosing to remain at Odsal, where he soon succeeded Brian Noble after the Great Britain coach departed for Wigan. After a difficult introduction to coaching at the top level, he now has his Bulls charges typically hitting their best form when it matters most. \"It's going to be tough against Hull - I thought they were great against St Helens,\" McNamara said. \"In defence they were tenacious and strong, and they certainly ruffled some feathers. I have a lot of respect for their coach [Peter Sharp] and his staff. It will be two sides desperate to get to a grand final on Friday.\" Against Warrington on Saturday night, McNamara's side kept their heads in the face of a superb Wolves comeback. The Bulls had led 18-0 inside the opening quarter, with the full-back Michael Withers scoring the first two tries of an eventual hat-trick, but by the closing 15 minutes they were behind 22-24 as Warrington scored four consecutive tries to threaten an unlikely win. That was when the home scrum-half Paul Deacon provided the most telling contribution of an influential all-round display. Deacon stepped through the Wolves defence to regain the lead for the home side, and late tries from Lesley Vainikolo and Withers' third gave the scoreline a decidedly flattering look. Deacon, omitted from Noble's GB squad last week, finished with 24 points - two tries and eight immaculate goals - to continue his recent good form. With his fellow playmakers Iestyn Harris and Terry Newton also peaking and Joe Vagana leading a marauding pack, Bradford's title challenge cannot be discounted. But they will have to cope without their player of the year, Andy Lynch, who sustained a badly broken ankle in the third minute of Saturday's game. Losing the prop is a significant blow, though the way the Bulls quickly built their 18-point lead, with Withers' tries and one to Deacon, showed that they can adapt. McNamara also confirmed that injured his trio Jamie Langley, Stanley Gene and Paul Johnson could all return against Hull. Warrington's talisman Lee Briers had had a frustrating opening quarter amid the Bulls stampede, but it was the Wolves captain who hauled the visitors back into the contest, scoring one try and creating another for Henry Fa'afili before half-time. After Toa Kohe-Love and the outstanding Stuart Reardon finished off quality Warrington moves in the early part of the second half, the visitors suddenly led. Then came Deacon's decisive intervention, with those late scores from Vainikolo and Withers sending the 5,000-strong Wolves contingent home disappointed but proud. Following a significant mid-season dip prompted by a Challenge Cup defeat at Hull KR and several injuries to key players, they recovered to progress further in the play-offs than ever before. \"We're dissatisfied with the season's effort, even though we've come further than any Warrington team in the modern era,\" their coach Paul Cullen said. \"Maybe that's a mark of how far we've come. But what we've learnt and shown is we can handle a crisis. We've handled it with dignity.\" Bradford Bulls Withers; Bai, B Harris, Hape, Vainikolo; I Harris, Deacon; Vagana, Newton, Lynch, Meyers, McKenna, Ferres.
