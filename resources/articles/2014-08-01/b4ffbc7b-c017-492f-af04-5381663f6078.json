The 65-year-old oversaw training on Thursday for the first time since signing a two-year contract to replace Tony Pulis \u2013 a session that included Wilfred Zaha, whose return from Manchester United on a season-long loan is complete pending insurance formalities \u2013 before explaining that the prospect of keeping his former employers in the Premier League made the job straightforward to accept. Warnock also said that he had been in the running to return last season before Pulis was appointed. \u201cThings happen for a reason at times and I\u2019ve felt this time that it\u2019s an opportunity to pay [Palace] back a bit. To give back to the fans, who have been brilliant. It\u2019ll take a lot of hard work, I know there\u2019s going to be ups and downs and criticisms along the way, but for the next eight months I\u2019m going to work as hard as I\u2019ve ever worked. \u201c You don\u2019t often get a chance to repay and I think I owe them a little bit, so it\u2019s great to be given that chance.\u201d Warnock was referring to circumstances surrounding his arrival at the club in October 2007, when he was \u201cat a low\u201d after being relegated on goal difference with Sheffield United amid controversy about Carlos Tevez\u2019s eligibility to play for West Ham. \u201cOriginally I would have liked to keep Sheffield up and then packed it in,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t work out like that and I had two or three months of moping around feeling sorry for myself. Then Simon [Jordan] came along, who I\u2019ve known for donkey\u2019s years, and we became very good friends. He got me down on false pretences of having a look at what they\u2019ve got and asking me about a few players, and then it was \u2018why don\u2019t you just do it for a few months?\u2019.\u201d Warnock\u2019s first spell at Palace ended when the club went into administration in 2010, news of which was first imparted when the team arrived for a fixture against Saturday\u2019s opponents, Newcastle. He has since managed Queens Park Rangers and Leeds United; the former was his last crack at the Premier League, one that ended unceremoniously when he was sacked by Tony Fernandes in January 2012. Since leaving Elland Road 15 months later, he had been happy to bat away any offers that did not appeal to him and his wife, Sharon. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have come [if she had not wanted to]. There were a couple of clubs \u2013 you know me, I get tempted with anyone, even in the bottom division \u2013 where I thought I \u2018I\u2019ll do that\u2019, until she said she\u2019d leave me,\u201d he joked. Warnock also said that the Palace co-chairman Steve Parish, whose falling out with Pulis led to the latter\u2019s departure, had not offered the position to anybody else. \u201cI think before Tony came there was a possibility that he wasn\u2019t going to and we talked then, but then he changed his mind and did fantastically. So I think Steve\u2019s always known I\u2019m available \u2013 I didn\u2019t really have to tell him. He says he never offered it to anybody beforehand, and if I\u2019m honest I\u2019m not really bothered. I\u2019m not bothered who was here, who was in the running, what the betting was.\u201d He emphasised that he had not sought assurances from Parish about transfer policy or funds, despite the well-documented problems the subject had caused with Pulis. \u201cYou don\u2019t talk about anything like that. I didn\u2019t talk about money or anything, it\u2019s the opportunity. You don\u2019t get opportunities like this very often \u2013 in different circumstances there might have been four or five other managers who would all have enjoyed it as well. I\u2019m very fortunate that I\u2019ve got the job now and I\u2019m going to really enjoy it if I can.\u201d Zaha\u2019s return is likely to be the first of several additions to the squad before Monday night\u2019s transfer deadline, although Warnock \u2013 who said he had received 320 messages from agents offering him players \u2013 does not envisage further movement before the weekend. \u201cI think it\u2019s right for Wilfried,\u201d he said of Zaha. \u201cI think there\u2019s still a lot more to come from him. He\u2019s one of those lads that people accuse at times of not having the right attitude, but I\u2019ve never seen that. If you\u2019re willing to spend the time with Wilfried, he wants to learn all the time and I think that\u2019s a great attribute. So I think you\u2019ll see a different Wilfried and hopefully he\u2019ll have a great season.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
