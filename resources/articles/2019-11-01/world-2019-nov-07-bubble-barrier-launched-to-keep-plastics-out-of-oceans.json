A Dutch start-up, the Amsterdam municipality and the regional water board launched the Great Bubble Barrier, a simple device that channels rubbish \u2013 especially small pieces of plastic \u2013 to the side of the Westerdok canal where it can be retrieved. Tests have shown it can divert more than 80% of flotsam. \u201cMore than two-thirds of plastics in the ocean comes out of rivers and canals \u2013 so if you have to intercept it, why not do it in the rivers?\u201d says Philip Ehrhorn, co-inventor of the technology. \u201cYou can\u2019t put a physical barrier in a canal: it has to be open for wildlife and recreation.\u201d The hope is that the innovation will help to address the mounting crisis of plastic waste in the ocean. Estimates suggest as much as 8m tonnes of plastic ends up in the world\u2019s seas each year \u2013 the equivalent of one truckload of old bottles, trays and containers every minute. The bubble barrier is a long, perforated tube running diagonally for 60 metres across the bottom of the canal. Compressed air is pumped through the tube and rises upwards, and then the natural water current helps to push waste to one side. It is trapped in a small rubbish platform on the side of the Westerdokskade at the tip of Amsterdam\u2019s historic canal belt. Ehrhorn, a German naval architect and ocean engineer, got the inspiration from a water treatment plant he saw while studying in Australia in 2015. \u201cAt one stage they aerate the water, and on a big surface put air bubbles like a big jacuzzi,\u201d he said. \u201cThe small plastic pieces that people throw in the toilet all collected in one corner and that was the kind of spark for me. If you can guide plastic to the side, can\u2019t you do it in a more directed way and on purpose in a river?\u201d At the same time, three keen Dutch amateur sailors and friends, Anne Marieke Eveleens, Francis Zoet and Saskia Studer, were discussing the problem over a beer in Amsterdam one evening and came up with the idea of a curtain of bubbles that sifts out waste but lets fish and boats through over a beer one evening in Amsterdam. The two teams came together to work on the idea, with the help of a \u20ac500,000 Postcode Lotteries Green Challenge award and other prizes. The first operational barrier in Amsterdam \u2013 due to run 24 hours a day for three years \u2013 aims to supplement dredging operations, which currently collect 42,000 kg of larger plastics from the Dutch capital\u2019s waterways each year. Bubble barrier waste will be separately collected, then analysed by plastics action group Schone Rivieren (Clean rivers). Marieke van Doorninck, head of sustainability for Amsterdam council, hopes it will be a successful example. \u201cAmsterdam\u2019s canals have enormous appeal,\u201d she said. \u201cBut when you think of them, you don\u2019t think about plastic bottles and bags in the water. The bubble barrier will mean fewer plastics reach the ocean, and is a step towards better regulation of our ecosystem, to the benefit of man, beast and environment.\u201d In the small, waterlogged country, this kind of innovation is welcome. Bianca Nijhof, managing director of the Netherlands Water Partnership, who organises the Amsterdam International Water Week conference, running this week, added: \u201cThe Dutch live with the water and don\u2019t fight against it: 50% of the country is below sea level, more than half is prone to flooding and in 2018 we had severe drought,\u201d she said. \u201cThis special relationship with water combined with an entrepreneurial mindset mean that innovation is at our core. The bubble barrier is one solution for clean water for all.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
