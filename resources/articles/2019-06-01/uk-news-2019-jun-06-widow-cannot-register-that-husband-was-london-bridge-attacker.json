Zahrah Rehman, who married Khuram Butt on Christmas Day 2013, said she suspected her husband might try to fight in Syria but never dreamed he would attack his own country. Butt and his two accomplices killed eight people on 3 June 2017 before being shot dead by armed officers. Weeping as she gave evidence at the inquests into the victims of the attack, Rehman told the Old Bailey in London on Thursday: \u201cI was living with him and he was in the same house as me and my kids, how can he do that? I couldn\u2019t register it, even now I can\u2019t register it. Even now, it\u2019s been two years and I haven\u2019t been able to look at the victims\u2019 pictures.\u201d She added: \u201cI knew there\u2019s a probability he\u2019d want to go to Syria but he never ever said anything in front of me that he wanted to attack this country.\u201d The court was shown videos of Butt and Rehman on holiday in Pakistan in 2014. One, in which the pair rode side-by-side on camels, shows Butt smiling into the camera and saying: Dawlat Islamia (Islamic State). Rehman told the court she was not aware of the meaning of the phrase at the time. She described as \u201cobviously not funny\u201d a video of the pair on the plane, joking about naming international airports after extremists such as Anwar al-Awlaki and Omar Bakri. Asked about her own suggestion in the video that they name London City airport after a pseudonym for Anjem Choudary, she said: \u201cIt just came into my head to carry on the joke he [Butt] was doing.\u201d Rehman, said she confronted Butt on a number of occasions about his behaviour, including after he appeared in a documentary called The Jihadi Next Door, after he was barred from Barking mosque in east London and got into a physical altercation with a member of the anti-extremism organisation Quilliam. But she said her husband always made excuses, presenting himself as an innocent party. The court heard that in 2016, Rehman\u2019s father took away all of the family\u2019s passports after Butt planned a holiday to Turkey. She told the court: \u201cWe can go anywhere on holiday, why do we have to go there? I did have my doubts that he was so interested in what was going on in Syria, that he was using Turkey as an excuse [to get to Syria].\u201d Rehman was asked why, as an \u201cintelligent and educated woman\u201d, she never reported him to the police or left him for good, given that she walked out for a month when he said he would take a second wife before later returning to the family home. She said: \u201cWe were living together but it was almost as though we were living different lives \u2026 The way he would talk to me, the way he would treat our [non-Muslim] neighbours \u2026 he never showed me signs that he would attack these same people.\u201d Rehman told the court that she would be confined to a different room when her husband\u2019s friends visited the flat because of beliefs on gender separation and when he went out he would just say: \u201cI am going to see the brothers.\u201d She highlighted the time when she raised concerns about the trip to Turkey as a pivotal point in their relationship. \u201cAfter that day, he realised he couldn\u2019t trust me again,\u201d she said, \u201cHe just hid all of that stuff from me \u2026 he knew I was a follower of British Islam.\u201d Rehman told the court that her husband would often demean her \u201cBritish Islam\u201d when she tried to confront him about his views. She told the court that on the day of the attacks they went to the park and then Asda. The last time she saw him was when he pecked her on the cheek as she dozed with their children, she said, recounting that he never kissed his son and daughter goodbye. She went to her uncle\u2019s house and when she got back to their flat in Barking all the lights were on, Butt\u2019s clothes were strewn on the bed and the back door was slamming open and shut in the wind. Rehman angrily tried to contact her husband but said, with hindsight, \u201cobviously, he was already dead\u201d. Rehman said she did not mourn for Butt, nor attend his funeral, but mourned his victims and revealed that she had, anonymously, laid flowers for them at London Bridge. Later the inquests heard evidence from Butt\u2019s brother-in-law, who called the anti-terrorism hotline in 2015 after almost coming to blows with him. Usman Darr made the call after Butt defended the burning alive of a Jordanian pilot by Isis. Another argument arose, Darr said, when both Butt and Rehman defended Choudary. Darr, who has since separated from Butt\u2019s sister Haleema, said: \u201cKhuram was very eager to defend him [Choudary], blaming the media and whatnot and his wife really agreed with him.\u201d Darr said he avoided contact with Butt subsequently and also told his wife not to take their children to his brother-in-law\u2019s flat. Their only encounters were at the home of Darr\u2019s mother-in-law. Asked by Gareth Patterson QC, representing the families of six of victims of the attacks, how he felt that his warning to the hotline was not passed to police investigating Butt at that time, Darr replied: \u201cEight people lost their lives sir.\u201d Dominic Adamson, representing Christine Delcros, who was hit by the van used by the attackers and whose fiance, Xavier Thomas, a 45-year-old French national, was killed, thanked Darr on behalf of his client. \u201cYou alone called the anti-terror hotline and did your bit,\u201d Adamson said. Aside from Thomas, those who died were Chrissy Archibald, 30, from Canada, S\u00e9bastien B\u00e9langer, 36, a French chef, Kirsty Boden, 28, a nurse from Australia, Spaniard Ignacio Echeverr\u00eda, 39, James McMullan, 32, the only Briton, who was from Brent, north-west London, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, a French restaurant worker and Sara Zelenak, 21, an Australian national.
