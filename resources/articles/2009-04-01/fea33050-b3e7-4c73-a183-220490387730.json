Chances are there will be one for Pulis the pragmatist, none for Mowbray the philosopher. This result put Stoke six points above Newcastle in the top relegation spot and left West Brom eight below Sunderland in the lowest place of safety. No fate was sealed with seven games to go but the force with one team contrasted sharply with the lack of it in the other. Six games ago the clubs were two points apart. Now it is 11. Stoke have won three and lost one; it is a good time to be playing like this, especially as Newcastle are Saturday's visitors. Albion have lost four and won none; at this rate it may hardly matter when Sunderland visit on 25 April. Stoke have the hex on Albion, winning 17 of their past 25 league meetings and losing only one. Even so, Mowbray had hopes that defied form and history. \"We talked a couple of weeks ago about having two big home games against Bolton and Stoke and we've taken one point,\" he said. \"We've been hurt by what we've been hurt by all season \u2013 poor defending.\" Inside two minutes Shelton Martis misjudged and Ricardo Fuller pounced. Scott Carson said in the programme: \"Mr Capello is going to be looking for goalkeepers he can trust [for South Africa 2010].\" His dive over Fuller's shot did nothing for his credentials. After that it was a cruise for Stoke, who showed themselves to bright advantage in claiming their first away win. This is the Year of the Ox and Fuller is a yoke in himself. He played alone up front but James Beattie, withdrawn to help midfield, was just as dangerous in his late arrival. \"While Ricardo takes people on, James relies on service,\" said Pulis, \"but nine times out of 10 he hits the target.\" It was not the 10th here. When Matthew Etherington's dash threw Gianni Zuiverloon and Jonas Olsson into confusion Beattie rammed in. Pulis said of the first goal that \"it took the wind out of their sails\". The second reversed any puff Mowbray might have given them at half-time. Stoke do not rely on sails. Jonathan Greening, Albion's captain, had called Saturday \"a massive, massive game\" and said: \"If we don't perform, it's our fault and, if we don't win, it will probably take Stoke out of the equation.\" In the event, Albion have virtually gone out of the equation at the other end and Stoke's game against Alan Shearer's Newcastle looks at least three massives. While Stoke were set up for a purpose and found it easily achieved, Albion stuck to Mowbray's pretty principles. None of six centre-backs has played more than 21 games; none of eight pairings has had more than seven. An email from his chairman might say: \"Dutchmen can't defend.\" Each of five non-spiky midfielders has started at least 21 games. In Stoke's penalty area no one attacked the ball as if meaning to score. They call the on-loan Marc-Antoine Fortun\u00e9 \"the Nancy hitman\". Stoke were rightly noted by Mowbray as \"throwing bodies in the way and blocking things\" but they seldom had to as the raiding wingers tracked back, forcing Albion to build slowly and sideways. Glenn Whelan stood out. Pulis spent well in January on Etherington (\u00a32m) and Beattie (\u00a33.5m for six goals in 10 league games), doing whatever it takes. \"I've never worked with the money others have but I've always had an honest team,\" he said. \"I don't like spivs.\" Stoke's fans may dare to look forward to a second season in the Premier League when they could make friends as well as noise by cutting out the worst of their chants. Before the end here Albion's were trooping away like mourners from a wake as the team, with the waters rising about them, went on playing their violins. Mowbray applauded them for leaving not booing. But unlike in banking, there are no rewards for failure and incompetence. Man of the match Glenn Whelan (Stoke) West Bromwich played more than twice as many passes as Stoke. And lost 2-0"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
