The home side started as if determined to make up for what had been a dismal 2008 in terms of performances and results. They were 10 points up in as many minutes with Regan King ruling the midfield with an effortless grace and it was the New Zealander who opened the scoring, drifting away from tackles to create his own try, but for the most part even the men in red's big names were shockingly ordinary. The Dragons were fortunate to escape unpunished in the opening couple of minutes when Gareth Wyatt tugged Morgan Stoddart before the full-back had got hold of a bouncing ball yards from the visitors' line, but moments later King broke through and when Stephen Jones extended the lead with a penalty, it looked ominous for the Dragons. The relatively small crowd - the other three regions all sold out over the holiday period - was a sign of the Scarlets' decline and their early confidence evaporated as the Dragons muscled their way back into the game, led by the prop Rhys Thomas who has been offered a contract to move west. Their first try came directly from a line-out and their second from a scrum. The wing Richard Fussell scored both, profiting initially from Jason Tovey's perfectly timed pass and then from even better distribution from the flanker Jamie Ringer. It could have been better for the visitors who were by now applying all the pressure: Colin Charvis was bundled into touch on the line by Simon Easterby and Thomas knocked on a yard out before a Shaun Connor penalty gave the Dragons a 17-10 interval lead. Connor missed the chance to give his side a 10-point advantage when he missed a straight 40-yard penalty immediately after the restart , before the Dragons started to make unforced errors. Fussell kicked the ball straight into touch before Connor, under no pressure, dropped the ball on his own 25 to give the Scarlets position. Jones kicked his second penalty and the Dragons found themselves on the back foot. Easterby's legerdemain created a try for the prop Phil John and, having regained the lead, the Scarlets went 12 points ahead through three further penalties from Jones before the Dragons rallied with a late try and conversion by Connor, wasting a chance in the final minute when they overthrew at a close-range line-out. A bonus point was a poor reward for a largely dominant display, leaving their coach Paul Turner to reflect: \"Our elementary mistakes allowed them back into a game they looked to have disappeared from.\" The Scarlets still have it all to prove.
