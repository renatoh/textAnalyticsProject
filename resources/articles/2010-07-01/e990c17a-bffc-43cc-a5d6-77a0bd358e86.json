Indeed, the party was so keen on AV that just before the election it tried to amend a wider piece of constitutional legislation in order to allow a referendum \u2013 only to be blocked in the Lords by the Conservatives. So it will strike many people as curious that the party decided this week to oppose a bill that among other things sets a date and question for an AV referendum. It is also curious that the bill is being promoted by the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, neither of which like AV. A week after its introduction, the parliamentary voting system and constituency bill is running into trouble. Tory backbenchers are mustering against AV, under the guise of concern about the date of the vote, which coincides with local and devolved elections. Already, more than 40 have signed an early day motion. Labour \u2013 agnostic on AV \u2013 objects to the lumping together of the vote with a rushed and controversial reshaping of constituency boundaries and a cull in the number of MPs. Labour will lose from this; the Conservatives will gain. If Labour and the Conservatives had taken 36% of the vote each at the last election, the Commons constitution committee was told yesterday, Labour would have won 114 more seats. Changing boundaries will only partly alter the imbalance, but it is obvious why each party takes the position it does. Partisanship runs more than one way in this affair. The bill as it stands is a trade-off within the coalition. Each of the partners has to stomach something it dislikes, in order to get the reform it wants. If one part falls, everything collapses. In Labour's eyes, the boundary changes are so odious that they outweigh any possible benefit from AV. It would have been better, and perhaps is still not too late, to separate the bill into two pieces of legislation. As things stand, the bill will come back to the Commons in September for its second reading, where it will be obstructed \u2013 and perhaps defeated \u2013 by a combination of Tory rebels and Labour. This is not a happy place for Labour, a party that believes in reform, to find itself. It diminishes the chances of a yes vote, assuming a referendum is held next May. Some Labour MPs will vote against the bill and go on to campaign for AV: but the public will have cause to be sceptical. The old reaction will probably win and the best chance of electoral reform for many years will have been thrown away. AV is imperfect: but it is certainly an improvement on first past the post. Most senior Labour figures have said as much at some point over the last year. The issue is whether the boundary changes really are a gerrymander, as Labour believes. The answer is no. There are very strong reasons to object to the haste, and also to the process being proposed, which would end public inquiries into revised constituency boundaries and base new seats on the current faulty electoral register. At a minimum, the register should be improved before changes begin. Yesterday the former boundary commissioner for England described how difficult it would be to revise constituencies and reduce their number to 600, all of almost equal size. Many smaller, often Labour, seats, and especially those in Wales, currently over-represented, will go. But there is no theoretical justification for the current inequality either, which means votes are far more valuable in some seats than others. Equalising seats is not the same thing as gerrymandering them, provided it is done in the right way. But the coalition's proposals are not right. Labour should attempt to amend the bill \u2013 it could, for instance, require the Boundary Commission to recognise unregistered populations in urban seats that otherwise fall below the quota for redistribution. But blocking everything, and perhaps losing AV, would be a mistake for a party of progress."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
