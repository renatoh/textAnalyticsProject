The institutionalisation of topics underpins the rise of Terry Deary's Horrid Histories empire, 39 titles of \"history with the nasty bits left in\". Deary, a former drama teacher, knows his market: the Rotten Romans, Terrible Tudors and Vile Victorians conveniently parallel the national curriculum for key stage two. Running out of topics, Deary is diversifying into cities - an inspired move. Horrible Histories: Dublin is the latest money-spinner, like Baedeker for eight-year-olds, packed with gore and a handy fold-out map. It can't lose. The government calls for an inclusive, multi-ethnic national history, but the right wants a patriotic narrative that will find the roots of British identity in Anglo-Saxon institutions and the battle of Trafalgar. The Daily Telegraph and the think-tank Civitas have tossed HE Marshall's Edwardian nursery classic Our Island Story into the breach. What would Henrietta Marshall make of this evangelical campaign? \"This is not a history lesson, but a story book,\" she insisted in 1905. Frank about her debt to legend, she said her tale did not belong with the schoolbooks, but \"quite at the other end of the shelf, beside Robinson Crusoe and A Noah's Ark Geography\". The saga opens auspiciously with Albion, son of Neptune, choosing a glittering little island as his own. From thence, British greatness unfolds. Or, to be more exact, English greatness; Scotland, Wales and Ireland only get a look in \"after [each] has been joined to England\". Any episode you can vaguely remember from your Ladybird books will be here, from Alfred's burnt cakes to Charles II hiding in an oak tree. The last stand of Caractacus against the Romans stirs the blood. \"'Show yourselves to be men,' he said. 'Today is either the beginning of liberty or eternal bondage.'\" A sense of manifest destiny drives the chronicle on. A drum roll introduces Bloody Mary's Protestant martyrs. \"Be of good comfort, Master Ridley, and play the man,\" said Latimer, as they were being led to the stake together. \"We shall this day light such a candle, by God's grace, in England, as I trust shall never be put out.\" Our Island Story was written at the high tide of Rule Britannia. Edwardian bombast holds it aloft. No quality is lauded more than courage, but rudeness always gets a ticking off. Charles II was \"lazy, selfish and deceitful, a bad man and a bad king\", but many loved him because as well as being clever and good-tempered he \"had very pleasant manners\". It is no bad thing to have Boudicca, the Black Prince and Bonnie Prince Charlie strung together in a sequential narrative. Yet the deficiencies of the national curriculum will not be addressed by a book that gives more weight to Merlin than to Richard II. To recommend Our Island Story as a textbook for nine- to 12-year-olds is like relying on Mel Gibson for the history of Scotland. \"Remember,\" wrote Marshall, \"that I was not trying to teach you, but only to tell a story.\" Just as well for the Maoris, who are written off as a race of savage cannibals. Where Our Island Story is heroically insular, an expansive sympathy illuminates EH Gombrich's rediscovered A Little History of the World. With a doctorate in art history, the unemployed Viennese 26-year-old knocked off this tour de force in six weeks in 1935, writing a chapter a day. Eine Kurze Weltgeschichte f\u00fcr Junge Leser was translated into five other languages before it was banned by the Nazis for its pacifism, by which time the Gombriches had fled. After the war, the Little History was reclaimed by another generation of Germans, but Gombrich resisted an English version, believing the British too inward-looking to be interested in the Visigoths and the Lombards. Only growing European integration persuaded him otherwise. Gombrich died in 2001, aged 92, still working on an updated edition. Gombrich opens with the most magical definition of history I have ever read. The past is a bottomless well. Throw a burning scrap of paper down that well \"and as it burns it will light up the sides of the well. Can you see it? It's going down, down. Now it's like a tiny star in the dark depths. It's getting smaller and smaller ... and now it's gone.\" History is the burning scrap of paper that illuminates the past. \"And in this way we light our way back.\" In 40 concise chapters, Gombrich recounts the epic of western civilisation, with some detours to China, India and South America. The creation, transmission and preservation of knowledge forms the arc of his chronicle. Gombrich admired the brilliant simplicity of Confucius' teaching around 500BC. Greek culture was the greatest intellectual force there has ever been. Arab scholarship synthesised the learning of Greece, Persia, India and China. The dark ages were a starry night of Christian study and faith. The library is one of civilisation's supreme achievements, so the sacking of the Greek library at Alexandria was detestable, as was the bonfire of history books lit by Shi Huang-ti, the first emperor of all China, in 213BC. But vandalism was futile, for the Arabs kept Greek learning alive, and under the Han, mandarin erudition prevailed. Tolerance, reason and humanity were \"the three fundamental principles of the Enlightenment\" which suffuse every page of the Little History. Sometimes Gombrich turned away in perplexity. The Spanish extermination of the \"ancient, cultivated Indian peoples\" of South America in the 16th century was \"so appalling and so shameful to us Europeans that I would rather not say anything more about it\". In 1935, Gombrich imagined Enlightenment values to be self-evident, and had no inkling of the looming catastrophe. In his 90s, he hoped children \"will learn from history how easy it is for human beings to be transformed into inhuman beings through incitement and intolerance\". Gombrich ends by comparing time to a river. We are all carried along by its force, each a tiny, evanescent bubble of foam, lifted momentarily on the crest of a wave, only to vanish for ever. \"But we must make use of that moment. It is worth the effort.\" British children need both an extended history of the British Isles in all its diversity and a long history of the wider world. Let's hope that a reformed curriculum will convey not only the sweep of history, but also its magic. As Gombrich promises: \"Not just a story, but Our story, the story that we call the history of the world. Shall we begin?\" \u00b7 Amanda Vickery is a reader in history at Royal Holloway, University of London, and author of The Gentleman's Daughter: Women's Lives in Georgian England."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
