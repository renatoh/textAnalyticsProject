That is not the way to build trust with the players.\u201d Former Australian Council of Trade Unions boss Combet says the central issue in the minds of players is gaining an understanding of how CA spends hundreds of millions of dollars in cricket revenue each year, and what proportion of that money is allocated to each of the players, grassroots cricket, and the different categories of CA\u2019s administrative staff. \u201cCA has resisted repeated requests by the players association for such detailed financial information,\u201d Combet says. \u201cIt\u2019s the players who fundamentally bring in the revenue, and it\u2019s fair enough that they are treated as respected partners with a share of the revenue and a say in the running of the game.\u201d On Thursday, Peever stuck firmly to CA\u2019s insistence that their move to end a 20-year-old revenue sharing agreement with players was focused solely on funding grassroots cricket, and that both the ACA and media were perpetuating a \u201cmyth\u201d about distribution of the game\u2019s riches. \u201cIt disrespects all those from across the cricket community who have flooded CA, and me personally, with messages of support because they see first-hand the chronic underfunding of the game at the grassroots level, in particular junior cricket,\u201d Peever wrote. \u201cThese people are true servants of the game and to imply that they are mere pawns in some ideological power play has outraged many.\u201d Combet says Peever\u2019s salvo was ill-timed, coming only two days after ACA CEO Alistair Nicholson and Cricket Australia boss James Sutherland finally resumed their positions at the negotiation table in a four hour meeting. \u201cMr Peever\u2019s responsibility as chair of CA is to unite and lead the game \u2013 and yet his first public comments on the pay dispute are divisive and seek to apportion blame for a dispute of CA\u2019s own design,\u201d Combet said. \u201cEven more surprisingly, his comments come at a time when sensitive discussions are seeking to resolve the dispute. Everyone involved, especially Mr Peever, should be focusing on resolving the dispute, not deepening it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
