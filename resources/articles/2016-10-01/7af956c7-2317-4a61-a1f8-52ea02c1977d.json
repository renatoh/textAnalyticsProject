But the number of suicides has increased across the UK since the financial crash in 2008 \u2013 except in Scotland \u2013 with middle-aged men the most likely group to take their own life. There are concerns that every year dozens of patients may be killing themselves after they have been wrongly released from hospital because mental health units have too few beds. Patients with schizophrenia, psychosis or other disorders committed a total of 870 homicides across the UK between 2004 and 2014, which was just over one in ten (11%) of all killings in that time. But the total number of homicides carried out by patients fell over the 11 years covered by the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by people with Mental Illness (NCISH). There were 87 such killings in 2004 and 94 the year after, but that had fallen to 67 in 2014 \u2013 a decline of 27% over the decade studied by researchers from Manchester University who undertook the inquiry. \u201cWhy that fall? We hope and we think that there have been improvements in clinical care, especially in improving the management of patients\u2019 substance misuse,\u201d said Professor Jenny Shaw, the inquiry\u2019s head of homicide research. However, their findings raise questions about the NHS\u2019s supervision of patients after they have been released from hospital. Almost two in five patients who killed someone (38%) did so after missing their most recent NHS appointment and so did not receive drugs or talk to a care co-ordinator or psychiatrist, according to in-depth analysis of 662 of the 870 cases. The report also found that half (52%) of those who committed a homicide had previously been convicted of a violent crime and almost as many (48%) had been in jail. A quarter (24%) had previously been involuntarily detained, or sectioned, under the Mental Health Act and 6% had been in a secure mental health unit. Killings by schizophrenics have also fallen, from the 53 seen in 2004 to 43 in 2013 and then 36 in 2014. Overall 369 homicides were carried out by people with a history of schizophrenia or other delusional disorder. However, killings by mental health patients are not falling as fast as the overall drop in homicides. The 27% fall is less than the 37% drop seen in the latter. As a result the proportion of all killings committed by such patients has risen from 9% in 2001 to the 11% seen in recent years. The NHS needs to undertake \u201cspecific clinical measures\u201d to close the gap, researchers led by NCISH director Prof Louis Appleby recommend. It should improve services for those with mental health problems who are also addicted to drugs or alcohol and do more to stay in touch with patients who are likely to stop being in contact, says the report, which was funded by the NHS\u2019s Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership. The researchers are warning that around 200 mental health patients kill themselves every year after being put under the care of community-based crisis teams and looked after in their homes, a third after being discharged from hospital in the previous two weeks. \u201cThe report raises questions whether crisis resolution/home treatment was the most suitable setting for their care and raises concerns that crisis teams are increasingly used due to pressure on other acute services, particularly inpatient beds,\u201d the inquiry found. Appleby added: \u201cOur findings suggest that we are accepting too much risk in the home treatment these teams offer and that the crisis team is now the priority for suicide prevention in mental health.\u201d Overall 28% of all suicides between 2004 and 2014 were of people receiving NHS help for mental ill-health. Around half of the 1,700 mental health patients a year who take their own lives in the UK had a history of drug or alcohol problems, the inquiry found. In addition, \u201cthere is evidence that economic factors are becoming more common as antecedents in patient suicides. Unemployment and homelessness have increased and 13% of patients who died by suicide had experienced serious financial difficulties in the previous three months\u201d it adds. In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255. In Australia, the crisis support service Lifeline is on 13 11 14.
