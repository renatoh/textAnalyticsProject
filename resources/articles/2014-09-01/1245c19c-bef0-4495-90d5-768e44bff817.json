Local officials say the backlog began when the Shelby County Rape Crisis Center was established in 1975, setting some of the first guidelines for keeping rape kits. A backlog began to form, officials say, when the practice of keeping the kits clashed with commonly accepted law enforcement practice. Until recently, law enforcement generally processed rape kits to solve a specific case. If that case was solved, or dropped, without testing the kit, the kit remained untested in evidence storage. Local officials say the kits were discovered in, \u201cthe old International Harvester plant,\u201d in Frayser, Tennessee, a facility described as \u201cmassive\u201d and \u201cabout two or three football fields long,\u201d Armstrong said, according to the Flyer. When the kits were discovered, there were no documents to indicate they were stored in the facility. \u201cWhat we take from this is that it\u2019s a blessing to us that we had the first rape crisis center in Memphis, but it\u2019s also a curse,\u201d said Memphis deputy chief Jim Harvey, according to the Flyer. Previously, police believed rape kits in Memphis dated back to 1985, according to the Daily News of Memphis. The kits discovered this month date back to before Memphis used computers to track evidence, and before DNA analysis was common. Testing all of the kits is expected to cost $6.5m. The department\u2019s sought grants and state assistance to help fund the testing, but still faces a $3.7m cash shortfall. The department has enough cash to fund testing through the fall, according to a monthly report the department produces on the backlog. Attempts to clear the backlog have already resulted in 162 news investigations, identified 16 individuals who\u2019ve previously been convicted of rape and issued 22 new indictments. Seven new investigators were added to the unit processing the kits, there are 16 in total."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
