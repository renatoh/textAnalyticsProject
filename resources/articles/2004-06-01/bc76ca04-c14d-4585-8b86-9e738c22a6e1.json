In Hartlepool a howling mob storms the monkey enclosure at the local zoo. But, in the toilets of an American pub, I see smiling men in England shirts shake hands with men in French shirts. Which is odd. Because I've just left a room full of ex-pat Englishmen who are still staring violently at the big screen TV. Their eyes bulge like pickled eggs. Their jaws are clenched so tight that their teeth squeak. One chap has sucked his Silk Cut so hard that his lips are starting to smoulder. And some of them are gripping half-empty lager glasses so viciously that it must surely only be seconds before they shatter, turning fists into lumps of bloody meat. But back in the restroom, man, it's like Agincourt never happened. It's all big grins and high fives and friendly back-slaps and \"We'll getcha next time, buddy!\" And \"You guys were awesome in de-fence!\" But we are in America. And they do things differently here. At least the Americans do. The majority of the million-plus English folk living in the USA (legally and illegally) will watch most of Euro 2004 at home, having forked out $179 (plus tax) for the privilege. Here they will become heartily sick of the same three adverts. Two of them - the one with the lucky sofa and the one with multi-millionaires on motor scooters - you will also be over-familiar with. But the third is for our eyes only. If features a middle aged cockney geezer in a cloth cap and comedy braces complaining vociferously about how he can't get custard creams and HP Sauce stateside. In amusing rhyming slang. With equally amusing American-English sub-titles. It's a laff riot. And not just the first 20 times you see it, either. And these are the ONLY three adverts we get. And we get them again and again. It's great. But the England games have to be watched in the pub. At $20 each a game. With other English folk. All sorts of English folk. Chatting about Baroness Thatcher's appearance at Ronald Reagan's funeral, I casually crack Jeremy Hardy's line about how Thatcher's tomb will be the first public toilet the Tories have built since the 1950's. Back home this would provoke gales of laughter. Here it's as if I've defecated on the table. People scowl, suck their teeth, cough and stare at their shoes. You're not in Islington now, Toto. But neither are we in some cosy, Countryside Alliance stickered country pub where the insecticide'n'cider hyped yokelry express their sense of national pride by screaming abuse at black faces on the big screen. There are Asian-Americans here. And African-Americans. And Asian British. And Black British (or \"African-American-British\" as I once heard an American commentator describe Emile Heskey). And while there are the usual knuckle-headed demands that we \"sing\" if we \"hate the French\", nobody does. Except the knucklehead. He is proud to be English. In fact he is one of those Englishmen who is so proud to be English that he buggered off somewhere better the first chance he got. And it's the same knucklehead who later leaps to his feet, his teeth bared and his finger jabbing in the direction of a chap in a French shirt. \"What the f***, what the f***, what the f***ing hell is that!?\" \"It's a France shirt, dude!\" grins the American in the France shirt, somewhat bemused. This is, of course, learnt behaviour. Last night's Sky Sports News had shown the usual fat, drunk and utterly unlovable England fans singing \"If it wasn't for the English you'd be Krauts\". At some Croats. And the Croats were smiling and shouting back. And looking a little confused. Were they, I wondered, attempting to discuss with the English some of the finer points of mid-20th Century history (with particular reference to east European geography, the role of the Red Army and the Yalta conference of 1945)? Or were they maybe having a little trouble understanding the - how shall we put this - pig-like grunting of the kind of animal-sex obsessed inbred rural scum who shout this sort of thing at foreigners? (\"But...but we are Croats! What are you saying? Are you mad?\") OK, back in the pub. The British national anthem. Nobody stands. Which brings a patriotic lump to my throat. For we are not Americans. And however much we might wave our silly little medieval flag and grunt Victorian battle hymns and drunkenly insult passing foreigners, we got the worst of that jingoistic crap machine-gunned out of us on the Somme. We don't do patriotism. Not really. It's one of the things that makes me proud to be English. That and the cheese, of course. It's a point that corgi-faced professional idignants like Richard Littlejohn will never get. Those loony-left councils don't ban St George's crosses and Union flags because they're \"politically incorrect\", John, but because they're naff, for gawd's sake. You new rahnd here or sumfink? When the camera pans down the mostly brown faces of the French team during La Marseillaise (and what a crackingly good republican tune that is) the boos and the jeers are strictly xenophobic. The crowd in this pub will moan and groan and scream and writhe and spasm like a team of top-notch porn stars making a straight-to-DVD orgy flick. But not one single racist epithet will escape their not-so-stiff upper and lower lips. And when Thierry Henry appears in close-up and the knucklehead (whom one suspects is a Manchester United fan) starts singing \"Sing if you hate Arsenal!\" (in his impeccable Thames Estuary accent), again nobody does. And a disgusted Mancunian voice says 'So that's just you, then?' And folk titter. But then, of course, someone left England's cake out in the rain. And a giant Gallic parrot came and puked all over it. We are gobsmacked, we are gutted, we are so not over the moon it is untrue. And we are trying very, very hard not to hate Marie - the extremely pleasant half-Irish/half French lass who, bless her, is doing her very best not to smile. Or to turn on the Liverpool fans and rip them limb from limb like an out-take from Quatermass And The Pit. Because it will take hours to get things in proportion. Because it matters in a way that the cricket and the rugby and the tennis will never matter. In a way that rounders and netball will never matter. Because American's don't riot when they lose at ice hockey. And no two countries have ever gone to war over a game of gridiron. Meanwhile, in the bogs, Americans of ros-bif and Cheese Eating Surrender Monkey extraction are love-bombing the motherloving heck out of each other. And Englishmen witnessing this entente cordial shake their head in amusement and disbelief. I tell you, it's like being in a foreign country sometimes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
