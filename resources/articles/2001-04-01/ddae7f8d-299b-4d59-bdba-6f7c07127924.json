In contrast, the chances of Wimbledon making an instant return to the Premiership remain bullish. In beating Trevor Francis's crestfallen side Wimbledon stretched their unbeaten sequence to 10 games and brought themselves to within six points of the play-offs. With eight games remaining and six of those at home the London club have breathed new life into a season that for so long had seemed dead. The Wimbledon manager Terry Burton said: \"While we're playing like we are and picking up points the chance of getting into the play-offs is there. We're probably as close as we have been all season. \"We've just got to look forward. There are enough games and enough points to play for and if we can go into the remaining games with the same positive attitude then we won't go far wrong.\" That positive attitude was in abundance on Saturday as the hosts took only 15 minutes to shatter their visitors' fragile confidence. A long goal kick from Kelvin Davis fell to the deadline-day signing David Nielsen, who marked his home debut with a goal, finishing powerfully past Ian Bennett from the edge of the area. Birmingham's attacking threat in the opening period was negligible and Trevor Francis opted to switch to a more offensive 4-3-3 formation after 28 minutes, bringing on Dele Adebola for Stan Lazaridis. However, the substitute was clearly unfit and was replaced 16 minutes later by Geoff Horsfield. The second-half introduction of Michael Hughes turned the game as the Northern Ireland international, who was making his sixth appearance of the season following a broken leg, took only five minutes to double Wimbledon's lead, squeezing a 25-yard free-kick past Bennett. Two minutes later Hughes floated another free-kick on to the head of his fellow Northern Ireland international Mark Williams to extend the hosts' lead. Although Birmingham replied with a consolation effort from Marcelo four minutes from time their performance suggests that their own play-off place is far from safe. \"We certainly don't have enough points,\" Francis said. \"We need quite a few more but I don't know what that figure is. Whatever the problem is - obviously there are tired legs and tired minds - we've got to snap out of it.\" With away games at Tranmere tomorrow and Bolton on Good Friday Francis knows that any more performances like this could well see a season of promise fall apart at the seams. \"It's a vitally important week for us,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
