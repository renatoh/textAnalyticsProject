When asked why, he replied that it was to see if it was as easy to rob a taxi in real life as it was in his favourite video game, Grand Theft Auto. The Thai government banned the game amid talk of a 'ticking time bomb'. Just the latest in a long-running argument about the damaging effects of violent video games. To objections from the gaming industry, the UK government has just introduced plans for a strict film-style classification system, which may allay parents' fears about violence but seems unlikely to address their concerns about video games in general: that they stifle creativity, hinder social skills and reduce their children to gawping couch potatoes. Video games are back in the firing line. Last Friday saw the release of Spore, one of the industry's most eagerly awaited games. But parents can breathe a sigh of relief, because this isn't some ultra-violent gun-toting gore fest. It's the brainchild of designer Will Wright, which means, in all likelihood, that it will totally rewrite the rules on what we can expect from a video game and prove as popular with parents as it is with kids. Through his games Wright has revolutionised the industry and more than once salvaged its reputation. With his latest he may well do so again. Wright, now 48, is regarded with awe by his peers (even his company Maxis, I'm told, is seen as 'mysterious', squirrelled away in Orinda, California for so long when everyone else was in Silicon Valley), because he has developed an entirely new type of video game. And out of the most unlikely material. SimCity, his breakthrough, is about nothing more elaborate than building a city and following the principles of good town planning. This in a market dominated by fantasy and sci-fi role-play games, sports simulations and first-person shooters. Released in 1989, SimCity (and its spin-offs) have gone on to sell a staggering 17m copies worldwide. But this is nothing compared with his follow-up, The Sims. Probably best described as an interactive doll's house, in which you look after the inhabitants, The Sims boasts sales of more than 100m copies, making it the bestselling PC game of all time. His latest game, Spore, is as ambitious in scope as its predecessors ('How do we deconstruct the universe?' Wright asked by way of introduction at a recent conference). Spore is based loosely on the theory of evolution. Each player starts off as a microbial cell which gradually evolves, through feeding on other organisms and picking up 'DNA points', until it wriggles out of water on to dry land. This creature then hunts and reproduces, eventually banding together to make a tribe, which in turn grows in size and then either by conquering or allying with surrounding settlements turns into a civilisation. Finally you advance far enough to be able to send a rocket up into space for the final stage, in which you jet about the universe in search of planets to colonise and aliens to pester. From single-cell organism to intergalactic empire in one game. With his slightly nerdy haircut and glasses, Wright certainly looks the part. Sitting in his office overlooking San Francisco Bay, he has one leg draped jauntily over the armrest of his chair. Glancing round, there are pointers to Spore everywhere. Pinned to his walls are images from the Hubble Space Telescope (used to recreate star clusters in the game); over his bookshelf a poster of his favourite film, 2001 (by way of homage, when players reach the final space stage, they can drop a black monolith down to the surface of other planets to freak out aliens); on his desk an entomology microscope. 'I've got one at home, too. They're much more interesting than a telescope.' What does he look at? 'Anything. You could put your hand under there and spend an hour looking at it. Fascinating.' In the corridor outside sits a battered doll's house, presumably a leftover from The Sims. Wright is telling me at great speed (he talks with considerable velocity) about the inspirations behind Spore. What follows is typically recondite. 'It's actually an idea you see repeated over and over,' he says. 'The idea of Powers of Ten.' This is a short film by Charles and Ray Eames from 1977 that looks at the universe on various scales, gradually zooming in from the galactic (a view of the entire Milky Way) to the microscopic (quark particles in the nucleus of a carbon atom). 'In fact, Powers of Ten wasn't the first one I discovered. The original idea came from a Dutch schoolteacher named Kees Boeke. He wrote a book in 1957 called Cosmic View: The Universe in 40 Jumps. Boeke's version was amazingly accurate for the time ...' On which he leaps up and snatches down a copy of Boeke's book from the shelf. Wright goes on: 'I remember explaining Spore to the execs at Electronic Arts [EA, the software company that finances and publishes the game] before we had anything to show. I was trying to explain the content, Powers of Ten and all this. It was pretty clear they had no idea what I was talking about. But they were like: \"Sure, do it.\"' Whether they understood or not, Electronic Arts has invested a considerable amount in the game (reportedly $20m). This is not insignificant at a time when the industry, though still thriving, is beginning to question the value of spending millions on one game (a new title, too, not a sequel), particularly given the growing popularity of cheaper, so-called 'casual games'. Casual games include the lucrative field of internet and mobile-phone games as well as PC and console games typified by Guitar Hero (a karaoke-style game) and Dr Kawashima's Brain Training (in which you solve various puzzles to help sharpen your mind). They are simpler in design, shorter in duration, and aimed at a more mainstream audience. The Nintendo Wii console (with its motion-sensitive remote) has been a particular hit, attracting a broad new fanbase with its range of family-friendly titles. I ask Wright how important it is to court this new type of player. 'It's probably the most important thing happening in the gaming industry. We're seeing that with the Nintendo Wii. That pressure to start serving the whole market rather than this little section.' Does he mean appealing to more women? 'That's a big part, but also the intergenerational market. Families. With Wii, you see kids, parents and even grandparents playing together.' Wright already has a good record on this. According to EA, 20 per cent of Sims players are over 35 and 50 per cent are female. For EA, there's a lot riding on Spore (particularly since the company reported losses of $95m earlier this year). At the same time, EA clearly has faith in Wright and has granted him considerable leeway. A great position to be in, I say. 'Yeah. Kind of,' Wright shrugs. 'For The Sims it was very different. I was always having to convince people it would be fun. That was almost more satisfying \u2013 as opposed to whatever stupid thing you say, everybody says: \"Great idea, go do it.\"' It has been six years in development; the big question now is whether Spore can meet those expectations. At this year's Comic-Con in San Diego, a conference for comic-book nerds, video gamers and hardcore Trekkies, Wright gave a speech in which he said he believed video games had a role in helping people understand sciences. Spore, he said, would make science 'accessible and not academic'. It's a recurring theme in the way he talks about his work: games as semi-educational. How important is it that his games teach as well as entertain? 'I'm not sure teach is the right word,' he says. 'Computer games and simulations are much more powerful [as an aid] to motivate than to teach. I'd rather have a game that got a person interested in the subject than tried to put a lot of facts into their head. It's not a matter of sugarcoating education. Education when done right is inherently fun. There shouldn't be a difference between the two. Our culture has disconnected the ideas of education and fun \u2013 and if anything, I'm trying to reconnect those two things.' It goes back to the way Wright himself was taught. Raised in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of a plastics engineer and an actress, Wright attended a Montessori school up to the age of nine (his 'high point of education'). 'The basis was that you wanted kids to discover principles on their own. Montessori designed toys so kids could discover aspects of maths or geometry just from playing. The kid made the discovery, and it was much more effective than the teacher coming over and saying, \"Here's Pythagorean theory,\" or whatever.' Wright has likened his own games to 'modern Montessori toys'. As a child, he'd immerse himself in pet subjects for months, reading everything he could. Space exploration was a passion. Another was Harry Houdini (a rub-off from his mother, who was an amateur magician. 'I learned how to pick locks,' he says). The Second World War was an obsession, too. 'I had a friend down the street \u2013 we were both into World War Two history and used to play these elaborate historical video games recreating the Battle of Kursk or whatever.' He also built a lot of models: 'ships, cars, planes, mostly from kits'. When Wright was nine his father died of leukaemia and he moved with his mother and younger sister to Baton Rouge, Louisiana. There he enrolled in the Episcopal High School and duly became an atheist. After graduating he took off to Louisiana State University to study architecture, transferred a few years later to Louisiana Tech for mechanical engineering, dropped out, drove a bulldozer for a summer and in 1980 landed up at New School, New York, studying robotics. Robots then led to computers: 'I got fascinated, totally dived in and learned how to programme.' Video games were taking off at the time. 'I thought: people are actually making money from these games. I'll try it. More as an intellectual challenge; I didn't expect to make money.' Wright's first game, programmed on his Commodore 64, was Raid on Bungeling Bay ('this stupid helicopter shoot 'em up') which Broderbund, a small software company, brought out in 1984. It was a fair success, earning Wright enough to live on for a couple of years. That same year, Wright married Joell Jones, the older sister of one of his friends, and two years later they had a daughter, Cassidy. (The couple have recently separated.) While developing Bungeling Bay, Wright became fascinated by a tangential aspect to the game. 'Underneath was a fairly elaborate simulation of factories and towns, a whole infrastructure that wasn't apparent to the player. I was having a lot more fun building that world than bombing it.' How about a game based on that, he thought, where you build your own urban environment. He threw himself into background reading. 'I uncovered the work of Jay Forrester, who wrote a book called Urban Dynamics in 1969,' Wright tells me, before citing other sources, including John Conway's 1970 Game of Life and the 'cell automata' work of a little-known scientist named Liman Wang. The prototype game Wright came up with was a radical departure in gaming terms. In it the player would oversee the development of an entire city, laying roads, building schools and hospitals, installing infrastructure, all the time balancing a long list of interdependent variables (crime rates, population levels, popularity ratings, taxes). Persuading software company Broderbund to back it was no breeze. 'When I first showed them SimCity they were a little confused. I got to this stage where I thought it was done, but they kept expecting it to have this win/lose element. I kept saying: \"No. This is the way it is.\"' Broderbund ended up not publishing, and it sat on Wright's shelf for a few years. Enter Jeff Braun, Wright's future business partner. They met in 1987 at a friend's pizza party in Alameda, California. When Wright showed him his demo, Braun got very excited. Having previously developed fonts for the computer firm Atari, Braun was keen to get into games. Here was the perfect vehicle. 'He's a very bubbly guy,' Wright says of Braun. 'He said: \"I want to play this \u2013 this is great\" and persuaded me to start this company with him to develop it.' Which they did. Two years later Maxis published SimCity. Though not an instant hit, it went on to earn $230m worldwide. The idea for Wright's next game came when his house burned down in an Oakland Hills fire in 1991. Forced to replace all his possessions \u2013 everything from kitchen utensils to furniture, which he hated doing \u2013 Wright got thinking about the value of all this stuff. Which sparked an idea: a game about running a household. But how to make it work? Wright read extensively on human behaviour and systems design: books like A Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander, A Theory of Human Motivation by Abraham Maslow and Maps of the Mind by Charles Hampden-Turner, which provided guiding principles for scoring the happiness of players in the game he came up with. The Sims, based in a suburban home, required that players tend to the various needs \u2013 from dietary to social \u2013 of its family of inhabitants. That meant everything from taking them to the bathroom and getting them to clean, to cooking them dinner. Arguably Wright's greatest achievement was making housework fun. Launched in 2000, The Sims was an instant hit. Three years earlier, Maxis had been bought out by Electronic Arts for $125m. Wright walked away from the deal with a reported $17m in EA stock. The Sims and its spin-offs have since gone on to earn EA in the region of $4bn. A month now before Spore ships, the pressure on the team at Spore HQ is easing up. The main office \u2013 airy, wood-beamed and half empty today \u2013 is covered with Spore flowcharts, storyboards and brainstorming sessions. For Wright, there's time to pause, too, though not for long \u2013 an exhaustive promotional world tour kicks off in a few weeks. 'I prefer to be making the game than talking about it,' he says. Does it bother him that video games are looked down on by so many? 'There are two ways of looking at that. Yeah, this bias against this form of media causes tension. But at the same time, there's some value in being a renegade. Like rock'n'roll. Something that parents don't like, kids are much more into it.' But if video games are rock'n'roll, I say, his games are more like the Beatles than, say ... 'Metallica?' he chimes in. 'Probably. My games tend to be more cross-generational. More accessible. I think parents would rather see their kids play The Sims than Counter-Strike.' No wonder. The first is about family life, the second a violent terrorist-based first-person shooter. But Wright is quick to defend games like Counter-Strike. 'It's funny,' he says. 'If [parents] are just observing the game and not playing it themselves, they're just seeing a surface representation: the pixels on the screen, the explosions, the gunshots. But if you look at kids playing Counter-Strike or [another first-person shooter] Quake, it's really more of a sport. They're very social experiences; they're not antisocial at all. It's all about working together as a team, getting their friends together \u2013 sometimes it's more like playing a game of basketball. If parents could see what the kids were seeing on the screen in a social sense, they would have a totally different perspective on it.' Agree or not, it's Wright in a nutshell. The Montessori defence, you might say: nothing beats playing the game yourself \u2013 and every game, violent or not, has something to teach us. Providing we have a go. \u00b7 Spore is on sale now"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
