The Chicago Sun-Times reported the FBI and the US attorney have launched investigations, adding credence to Post reports from earlier this week that the FBI has refused to corroborate. It is the first time any of Lord Black's papers has reported the claim that he is subject to a possible criminal investigation. The Tory peer, who is set to meet investigators from the US financial watchdog on Monday, quit as Hollinger International's chief executive a month ago after admitting he and other executives pocketed \u00a319m in unauthorised fees. Lord Black has denied any wrongdoing, arguing there was \"no suggestion of any impropriety\" in his resignation from the top job at Hollinger, where he is the controlling shareholder. The FBI and the North Illinois office of the US attorney have not confirmed the investigation, which would add to the crisis at Lord Black's media empire. \"It's our policy that we don't confirm or deny pending investigations,\" a spokeswoman for the US attorney's office said. \"The time we would publicly talk about this would be in the event that we filed charges.\" A spokeswoman for Lord Black said: \"At this point we don't have any comment.\" Hollinger announced last month it was embarking on a strategic review that could see the group or some of its assets sold. Dozens of potential bidders have registered their interest with investment bank Lazard, which is overseeing the review of the company's options. Rather than make outright sales of prize assets such as the Daily Telegraph or the Chicago Sun-Times, the company could try to negotiate a refinancing deal. Lord Black's holding company, Hollinger Inc, has warned it may not be able to cover interest payments on its \u00a370m debt. Recent talks about a possible deal between Hollinger Inc and Dallas-based private equity firm Hicks Muse Tate &amp; Furst were abandoned. Hollinger directors are also facing a lawsuit filed in a Delaware court by 2.6% shareholder, Cardinal Capital Management. Shareholders, led by New York investment fund Tweedy Browne, have been pressing Hollinger to return \u00a3170m in executive payments stretching back to 1995. The company set up a board special committee in May to look into the payments and its investigation is still ongoing. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
