James Marape, who became prime minister after the resignation of Peter O\u2019Neill last month, told PNG\u2019s parliament on Tuesday he would summon Australia\u2019s diplomatic head of mission \u201cto provide an explanation\u201d. \u201cWe don\u2019t intend to have foreign security companies engage in businesses like security which we can do. I will also request to have this contract terminated forthwith.\u201d Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning The $423m Paladin contract is the subject of several reviews in Australia, including one by the auditor general examining all of the government\u2019s contracts for the offshore processing systems on Manus Island and Nauru. That audit is forecast to deliver its report in January 2020. Paladin\u2019s contract \u2013 which currently works out at a cost of at least $1,600 per day for each refugee and asylum seeker, not including food or medical care \u2013 is due to expire next week, and the Department of Home Affairs has refused to clarify whether it would be renewed. Two weeks ago the home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, said that \u201cthe likelihood is there\u2019s a continuation\u201d. Labor has called for the government to release a commissioned Ernst &amp; Young review into the contract \u2013 ordered in March but not yet released \u2013 before it makes any decision. Last week PNG\u2019s immigration minister, Petrus Thomas, said PNG wanted to take over the contracts and he had written to the home affairs department telling them he expected Paladin\u2019s contract to be cancelled. \u201cPapua New Guinean companies now have the capacity and expertise to do the job and should be given the opportunity to participate,\u201d he said. Paladin\u2019s subcontracts with other companies \u2013 most of which have also been controversial \u2013 also expire on 30 June. It was originally planned for the PNG government to take over the running of services and facilities when the Manus Island detention centre was closed in November 2017, however just before before the anticipated date the PNG government said it couldn\u2019t take over because it was entering a caretaker period ahead of a national election. The Australian government engaged Paladin through a limited tender process, which it said was needed because of the rush, however the contract has been renewed several times since. Guardian Australia has also revealed similar contract processes were used to procure the services of Pacific International hospital for healthcare services on Manus Island."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
