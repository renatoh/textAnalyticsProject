Cafu\u2019s goal on the counter-attack gave the Bulgarians a surprise lead on the stroke of half-time, but Renato Steffen levelled for the hosts 10 minutes from the end. Bayern Munich opened their campaign with a one-sided victory in Group D as they brushed aside Rostov 5-0 at home. Robert Lewandowski, from the penalty spot, and Thomas M\u00fcller put Bayern in the ascendency before the break and a second-half brace from Joshua Kimmich and a late Juan Bernat effort completed the rout. It means Bayern have now recorded 13th successive home victory in the competition. \u201cIt was a good start to our Champions League campaign,\u201d Carlo Ancelotti, the Bayern manager, said. \u201cIt was difficult to score early on, we didn\u2019t have many chances. We got there. At the moment, the team is in good condition, both physically and mentally.\u201d Bayern\u2019s triumph puts them top of a tough-looking Group D, ahead of last season\u2019s runners-up Atl\u00e9tico Madrid, who were 1-0 victors at PSV Eindhoven. Sa\u00fal \u00d1\u00edguez\u2019s acrobatic effort in the 43rd minute settled the contest in favour of Diego Simeone\u2019s team, with PSV missing a controversially awarded penalty moments later as Jan Oblak superbly kept out Andr\u00e9s Guardado\u2019s spot-kick. Napoli are the early front-runners in Group B after Arkadiusz Milik\u2019s brace fired them to a 2-1 a comeback victory at 10-man Dynamo Kyiv. Denys Garmash gave Dynamo a 26th-minute lead, but their hopes of earning a point after Milik\u2019s first-half brace were all but ended when the midfielder Serhiy Sydorchuk was sent off in the 68th minute. The match between Benfica and Besiktas in Portugal finished 1-1 as Anderson Talisca\u2019s brilliant stoppage\u2011time free-kick for the Turkish side cancelled out Franco Cervi\u2019s early opener."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
