As they prepare to perform it in its entirety, the band's Wayne Coyne and photographer Lawrence Schiller explain the origins and enduring appeal of the shot \u2026 The black-and-white original is an enigma: a scruffy figure stands by an illuminated wall, transfixed by his own shadow. \"I'd seen it in a Life hardback I picked up at a thrift store maybe 10 years earlier, and I always thought it would be a cool album cover,\" remembers Coyne. \"I think I was actually making music that sounded like that photo, or what I thought the photo sounded like, anyway.\" The photo's title, The Acid Test: Neal Cassady, reveals that this anonymous figure is one of the most iconic \u2013 if elusive \u2013 figures in 20th-century literature. A teenage dropout who fell in with the young Jack Kerouac, Cassady became the inspiration for perhaps the quintessential Beat generation figure, Dean Moriarty, the restless, superhuman drifter of Kerouac's 1957 novel On The Road. By the early-60s, following a meeting with the author Ken Kesey, Cassady had become the amphetamine-fuelled driver for Kesey's Merry Pranksters, a troupe of Californian hippies who piled into a brightly painted bus and set out to introduce the mind-expanding properties of LSD to the stuffy straights of middle America. By this time, Schiller was a photojournalist of some renown, and with a batch of good-quality LSD finding its way into counterculture circles and talk of so-called Acid Tests \u2013 musical events fuelled by Kool-Aid laced with psychedelics \u2013 taking place along the west coast, he set out to document the new scene. Through acid guru Timothy Leary, Schiller made contact with Kesey, who told him the Pranksters were due to hold an Acid Test on Sunset Boulevard. Mid-trip, they skipped down the block to pose for portraits. \"Cassady was there,\" Schiller recalls. \"At one point I went over, and he started dancing with his silhouette. It had a certain poetry to it.\" The Cassady photo ran as part of a feature in Life magazine. \"Can any law keep the awesome drug away from reckless hands?\" screamed the caption. Yes, as it turned out. Moral panic ensued, followed by legislation. \"I saw a dark side to it,\" says Schiller. \"Runaways, 16 or 17 years old, dropping acid and sitting in a supermarket staring at the breakfast cereals. Under the right circumstances it led to very positive experiences, but some ended up with full-blown psychosis.\" The Acid Test: Neal Cassady was published in Schiller's 1966 book, LSD, but languished in relative obscurity until the late-90s. Schiller was pleased it saw the light of day again. \"It wasn't a Pulitzer Prize-winner, but it says a lot with a little,\" he says. Coyne's attachment to the photo is similarly intangible. \"To me, the photo represents a person going into the unknown \u2013 the unknown within themselves \u2026\" The Flaming Lips play The Soft Bulletin at Alexandra Palace, N22, Friday.
