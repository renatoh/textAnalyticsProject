Two years ago the company was close to collapse after an ill-conceived change of image and an overambitious expansion plan masterminded by US retailer Ann Iverson. The company sold off its US business for $1, was forced to launch a \u00a325m rescue rights issue and its auditors warned there was a \"fundamental uncertainty\" that the business was a going concern. But with the aid of Asian conglomerate Malayan United Industries - which underwrote the rights issue and now owns 40% of the company - the company has made a u-turn. The \u00a310.2m profit recorded in the year to the end of January, compared with the \u00a34.1m loss registered a year earlier, was driven by home furnishings, where like-for-like sales rose nearly 20%. That growth has continued in the first weeks of the new financial year and finance director Jim Bellingham said the company was now planning to open one or two specialist home furnishings shops a month. It already has six, and is targeting well-off provincial towns like Nantwich in Cheshire and Sevenoaks in Kent. The company now employs a 40-strong design team, doing commercial and domestic interior designs, and supplying everything from paint to lamp shades. At the same time, Laura Ashley's clothes are also showing double-digit growth. \"We have been working closely with our customers\", said Mr Bellingham. \"They don't want us to be trendy, but they do want us to be up to date, and they wanted a more casual feel\". The stores have been updated and the firm is \"quietly and cautiously\" expanding in Europe. It already operates 63 stores in Europe and plans another six in Germany this year, bringing its total there to 23. Mr Bellingham has also brought back mail-order - axed by Ms Iverson - and has slowed e-tailing development. The firm is licensing out the name, which now adorns goods from carpets to paint and perfume and is considering licensing the brand to kitchens and garden furniture. The shares rose 0.75% to 23p."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
