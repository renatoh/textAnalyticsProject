The ABC Canberra veteran broke down live on air and struggled to read the finance report immediately after airing the Ukraine story. The response to Lane\u2019s raw emotion was supportive, with many listeners contacting Radio National\u2019s Breakfast program to offer support. The host, Hamish Macdonald, thanked readers for their concern. Lane responded to the outpouring of supporting, writing on Twitter: \u201cTweeps, thank you all for your concern. I\u2019m a big softie at heart, and now the nation knows. I was totally pole-axed by @samanthahawley \u2013 and bewildered by humanity.\u201d On social media, listeners thanked Lane for her very human reaction to a tragic story. The Australian Capital Territory Council of Social Service said Lane always demonstrated \u201csupreme professionalism\u201d and showed a \u201ctotally human response this morning to the horrors big and small that you present every morning\u201d. The child, Bridget Irmgard Pagan-Etnyre, was carried by a Ukrainian surrogate mother for Matthew Scott Etnyre, 39, and Irmgard Pagan, 61, according to a report to air on Foreign Correspondent on Tuesday. The ABC foreign correspondent Samantha Hawley traced the child to the Sonechko children\u2019s home where she spoke to one of her carers, a paediatric nurse, Marina Boyko, who had developed a strong bond with her. \u201cYou can\u2019t judge a child as soon as it\u2019s born \u2013 \u2018We don\u2019t like this child, we wanted you to have a Hollywood smile upon birth\u2019\u201d, Boyko said of the Americans\u2019 decision to leave Bridget in Ukraine. \u201cI would say to them that they have an amazing daughter.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
