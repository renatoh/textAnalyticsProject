They are seldom necessary. In one, a train travels into a red sky along a track etched with a swastika; in another, the white of a wide-open eye holds a billowing chimney, a single skull and a handful of black birds trailing lengths of barbed wire. Six years after her death, the paintings and drawings of Stojka, an Austrian-Romany woman who survived Auschwitz, Ravensbr\u00fcck and Bergen-Belsen to become a tireless chronicler of the Nazi genocide against the Roma and Sinti, are the subject of a major exhibition at Madrid\u2019s Reina Sof\u00eda museum entitled: \u201cThis has happened\u201d. Stojka, who had her first child aged 15 and went on to earn her living as a carpet seller, had no artistic training, little in the way of education and, for much of her life, no desire to revisit the atrocities of her childhood. Born to a family of Romany horse-traders in the Austrian state of Styria in 1933, Stojka was not quite five when the Anschluss took place and Nazi racial laws came into effect in the newly annexed land. Three years later, her father, Wackar, was arrested and sent to Dachau. He was murdered at Hartheim euthanasia centre in 1942, and Stojka, her mother and her five siblings were deported to Auschwitz the following year. Stojka\u2019s youngest brother, Ossi, died of typhus in the camp at the age of seven, but the rest of the family survived the war. Stojka clung to life in Bergen-Belsen by eating plants and tree sap as she waited, among the corpses, for the camp to be liberated. \u201cWithin the family, she hardly ever talked about the experiences,\u201d says her son, Hojda, who grew up in Allied-occupied Vienna. But every now and then, there were reminders of what had happened. \u201cI remember very well, when I was about four or five years old, my mum and me were walking along the street. Suddenly she saw two men in uniform: Russians. She was never really strict with me, but at that moment, she grabbed my hand fiercely and told me to stay close with her. I think she panicked.\u201d By the time she reached her early 50s, however, Ceija felt she could no longer keep the past at bay. She began to write down her memories and then \u2013 inspired by a trip to meet the Buraku \u201cuntouchable\u201d underclass in Japan \u2013 she started to paint. Between the late 1980s and her death in 2013, she wrote three books, filled more than 30 notebooks and made more than 1,000 drawings and paintings. \u201cMy mother worked against forgetting,\u201d says Hojda, now 70. \u201cShe wanted young people to know what had happened, to tell them that it should never happen again and to tell them where they came from.\u201d By writing and painting and drawing, he adds, his mother also managed to come to terms with her own life. \u201cShe liberated herself by telling the story \u2013 it was if she finally had power to speak out against it.\u201d Or as Stojka herself put in in one of her poems: \u201causchwitz is my coat, bergen-belsen my dress and ravensbru\u0308ck my vest. what should I be afraid of?\u201d Hojda was surprised by how much his mother remembered and by the extraordinary level of detail in the pictures that record her early life and the Porajmos \u2013 the devouring \u2013 during which up to 500,000 Roma and Sinti were murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators. Bodies, some naked, some dying and some burning, sprawl throughout her work, hemmed in, more often than not, by the inescapable barbed wire. Many of the paintings are personal. One, painted in 1994, shows a red forearm bearing the number Z6399: the tattoo she was given in Auschwitz as a nine-year-old girl. Another shows grey uniform trousers tucked into high black boots \u2013 as seen from the viewpoint of a small child. But there are also images of Stojka\u2019s early childhood \u2013 of horses, sunflower fields and caravans in the days before their owners had to remove the wheels and turn them into wood cabins. \u201cStojka\u2019s vision may not be that of a trained \u2018professional\u2019 but it is very, very sophisticated,\u201d says Manuel Borja-Villel, the director of the Reina Sof\u00eda. \u201cDecades on, she can paint her childhood memories from a child\u2019s point of view. You can see that in the perspective, like when she paints the boots. It\u2019s a child\u2019s way of looking at the world and that requires a visual refinement when it comes to using paint and other materials.\u201d For the next four months, the work of a woman who came late to painting and later still to recognition will share a gallery roof with perhaps the most famous anti-war painting of all time \u2013 Guernica, Picasso\u2019s huge protest at the German and Italian bombing of the Basque town in 1937. The Ceija Stojka International Fund, set up last year to help promote the artist\u2019s life and work, hopes the exhibition will help spread her memories and messages. \u201cThe challenge of this show is to introduce the widest possible public to a talented, self-taught Romany artist,\u201d says Paula Aisemberg, a member of the fund and one of the exhibition\u2019s curators. \u201cBut the exhibition is also about the political and historical need to remember a little-known genocide \u2013 the Porajmos \u2013 so that it doesn\u2019t happen again at a time when far-right racists are winning power in some European countries.\u201d Hojda Stojka also sees echoes of the past in the politics of the present. His mother was scared and furious when the far-right rose again in Austria and would be scared and furious were she still alive to see the state of Europe in 2019. But, he adds, she would also be shouting and leading the fight from the front. \u201cShe always said: \u2018I\u2019m afraid Auschwitz is only sleeping.\u2019 Now it\u2019s more and more like an awakening.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
