Before any major championship he always seems to be, in turn, intense, optimistic, affable, joshing, philosophical. Mention that, now turned 40, he is an elder statesman and his eyes roll in mock indignation. If an old press adversary asks him to rate out of 10 his chances of winning his first major, his eyes blaze and he smart-arse answers that of course they are 10 out of 10 or he would not be here, and that if he was not here they would be less than one. Realistic answer? \"I'm realistically here, aren't I?\" OK, not Oscar Wilde but he does give good pre- tournament value. It is just that when showtime comes around, it has never proved quite so simple. A round here and there tickles the taste buds and gets him ticking - a course record 64 at Muirfield last year, for example, or his 65s at Lytham and Turnberry. But then he blows it. Thirteen Opens and just the one top-10 finish, at Turnberry in 1994, and only 16 sub-par rounds out of 42. For a fellow who won the European Order of Merit seven times on the bounce it is underachievement on a grand scale. And with each year the chances are slipping by. Once he was regarded as the best player never to have won a major. Now he is not even the best Brit never to have won. That is reflected in odds of 80-1, down there with Lee Westwood and Fred Couples. Why, though, is the game of someone with such a ferocious competitive edge and who can be a supreme ball striker apparently unsuited to the particular vagaries that occur over four days of links golf? Part of the answer must lie in his golfing upbringing. His father may have been secretary at Royal Troon on the Ayrshire coast but his formative years were spent whacking the ball around Yorkshire. In essence, his game is based on hitting a high fade, a soaring shot with a hint of cut spin that drifts left to right. This is excel lent for controlling the ball - except when the wind gathers in strength. Good links players, though, especially those who are brought up on the courses around the coast of Britain, hit the ball lower, boring it through the breeze. The same applies to golfers from America's midwest where the wind is also a significant factor. Then there is the control of distance. For a time there was no better player than Montgomerie at hitting the ball a precise yardage; the pin-high ball has been the bedrock of his game. But links golf, with its variably textured fairways and hard, rolling greens, does not play to the yardage chart. \"It may be a contributory factor,\" he agrees. \"I have always been proud of the fact that I can hit a shot, say 178 yards. Not 179 or 177 but 178. And it doesn't matter what the club is. I can hit it that distance. But here we have, say, 180 to the pin but it only plays 160 because of the bounce. So you have to be careful. Then next time, where the wind is different or the ground is softer, is the same shot still 160, or is it 165? Does it play 175 sometimes? So that's possibly a reason why my Open record has been so-called moderate, in that some rounds are good and some are not because of that judgment of distance.\" Most intriguing, though, is the paradox that comes with the Ryder Cup, an event in which the Clark Kent of the links is transformed into Superman. Over three days at the Belfry last September Montgomerie played supreme, undefeated golf, by consent his finest anywhere, to bring 4 points from a possible five. It was truly magnificent, a senior player taking responsibility. So why can he not produce it in the majors? His Ryder Cup record is proof that he is intimidated by no one. He thinks it is down to being relaxed. All he has to do is to recreate that feeling and he will shoot out the lights. \"I think it came over quite strongly that I was very, very relaxed at the Ryder Cup,\" he says. \"I was enjoying myself and when anyone enjoys themselves they are usually good at what they do, and me included. So I must try and wake up wanting to enjoy the day ahead, because when I play my most relaxed golf it is usually my best.\" There has to be more to it than that, though, and that extra factor is anger. Five years ago at Brookline, the behaviour of the Boston crowd towards him as an individual so incensed Montgomerie that, determined to show them, he raised his game to new heights and played out of his socks. He was able to channel his aggression and a guess would be that, three years on, at the Belfry, he could still remember vividly the Mrs Doubtfire jibes and the gags about his bra and, with visualisation, turn them to his advantage. So perhaps he needs to recreate that feeling of antipathy and through it the passion of the Belfry and keep it going for four days. Then we may see the full Monty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
