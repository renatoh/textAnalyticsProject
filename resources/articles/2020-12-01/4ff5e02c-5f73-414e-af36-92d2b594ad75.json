Rae Whitehead, 79, died on 1 December, days after she tested positive for coronavirus in her care home in east Yorkshire. On Tuesday, just seven days later, the NHS began its mass vaccination programme across the UK and her widower, Edward, 84, became one of the first in the world to receive the jab at Middlesbrough\u2019s James Cook hospital. The couple\u2019s son, Dr David Whitehead, 49, a consultant ENT surgeon in Middlesbrough, said he felt \u201cpotential relief\u201d that his father had been vaccinated, but \u201cheartbreak\u201d that his mother could not be saved. He told the PA news agency: \u201cMy father and I are deeply saddened that, had we not put my mother in a nursing home \u2026 she would maybe be alive today and could have had the vaccine today. \u201cHer life slipped away \u2013 a week later the vaccine is being rolled out.\u201d David Whitehead said his mother, who had worked as a civil servant before having children, had spent her life \u201clooking after us and the family\u201d, adding that \u201cshe devoted herself to us\u201d. He said he too had contracted coronavirus in March, and had suffered from a high temperature and a \u201csensation as if my head was being boiled alive\u201d. He described the start of the phased NHS rollout of the vaccine as \u201ca great day\u201d and said he felt proud. \u201cThis is the good thing about the NHS,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s nationalised, we have this ability and power to have these interactions with the large pharmaceutical companies so that this sort of thing can happen. \u201cI feel quite proud that we\u2019ve managed to approve it, a vaccine from a trial, so quickly. It\u2019s a great day and I think it will probably protect a great deal of people.\u201d On Tuesday, 90-year-old Margaret Keenan from Coventry became the first patient in the world to receive the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine after its approval in the UK, marking the start of a historic mass vaccination programme, the largest in the NHS\u2019s 73-year history."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
