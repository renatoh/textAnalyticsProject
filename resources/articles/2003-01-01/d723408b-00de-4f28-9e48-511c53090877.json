I think the longer it [suspension of Stormont] goes on, the deeper those difficulties become. I think there's clearly the potential to resolve them and in many ways Tony Blair acknowledged that when in his speech in Belfast last October. He said that the government had not completed, and I'm paraphrasing his words, the implementation of the Good Friday agreement and that the government would do that. The quicker the government does that, puts forward an implementation plan or a programme to achieve that, then the quicker we get the process anchored and start to get some sustainable stability. I think that's what's required. It has been a bit of a roller-coaster ride, getting to the Good Friday agreement and I think Senator Mitchell at that time said something like, and I paraphrase him again, now you've got the easy bit done, the hard bit is implementing it. And I think that's very true. The implementation by its very notion has been very difficult. The four suspensions of the institutions, the fact that they've only been in place for, instead of for five years, for something like 20 months. All of the other difficulties which have beset the process. But I have to say that if you measure the progress in the last five years, against the previous five years, or the five years before that, then of course it's been quite remarkable the advances that have been made. And if you measure the Irish peace process against for example the situation in the Middle East, then it's day and night of a difference. The British government The key to resolving this is based on the British government being able to commence the process or to complete the process of fulfilling its obligations. Now, there are clearly responsibilities for republicans and unionists and others. I've tried to describe the current crisis as being in three segments. There's, first of all, the British government segment, there's the IRA segment and there's the unionist segment. If the British government is wanting the IRA to do big things, then the British government, I think, will have to do big things to create the conditions where there's a potential to get the IRA to move. And if that's done, if it is possible to get a deal, which involved the two governments and the republicans, then the third segment comes into play, and that is to get the unionists involved and to keep them involved. Because David Trimble has his own difficulties, there might be a question of whether he wants to be in a sustainable institution. But the difficulty for him is that there's members of his party that don't want that and the first test he will have will be the ulster unionist council. That's how I describe those three segments. I also said that I have a problem about the substance of what's likely to come in the coming period and it's a bit difficult. I have not been impressed by the substance of what's been worked out. I'm concerned about the time frame. And I'm concerned about the management of the process, because, I think we should have learnt the lesson of trying to bounce people. Republicans can't bounce Tony Blair, Tony Blair can't bounce republicans, none of us can bounce the unionists. We've been through all of that and the process now needs a thoughtful organic move forward. The unionists Well, I would prefer that there was the relationship with the unionists that it was possible for the domestic parties to Ireland to move ahead. But I don't blame the unionists if they refuse to move, because they can pass the buck to the government and then try to influence the government. And in my last discussion with David Trimble, he refused to be drawn from some of these issues and my clear impression was that why should he show his hand when Mr Blair is in the driving seat. I don't really blame him. The IRA There's quite a lot of speculation in the media back home, that the IRA is expected to do all sorts of wonderful things. I see no evidence of that. Clearly, if there was the potential to achieve that, that's the road that people should be go down. We have made it very clear, we in the Sinn Fein leadership, particularly myself and Martin McGuinness, to Mr Blair and Mr Ahern that there is no point of even going near the IRA, looking for a movement from the IRA unless we're empowered by the government's commitment to the process. So what do we mean? We mean that the institutions will go back and stay in place, it was the British government, it wasn't David Trimble who suspended the institutions. It was the British government, four times! Unionists' commitment to peace And [we] also [need], although it might be more difficult to get, a commitment from Mr. Trimble that he will stay in there or at least that he will not wilfully take down the institutions. In order for the British government to suspend the institutions, the British government had to actually step outside the agreement. There's nothing in the agreement that allows the British government to do this, they had to unilateral do it, bring in new legislation to empower it to suspend. So how can you have confidence in the political institutions if, at the whim of the unionist, the government suspends it. If you reflect on the fact that since partition, these are the first institutions in which nationalists and republicans could have some ownership. And of the five years that could have been institutions, there's only been place for something like 20 months. I always paint up the picture for people if there was some scandal here, under those sort of rules, Margaret Thatcher would still be in power. Policing They need to move on it even if all other parts of this process of negotiation do not succeed. We have a situation on policing that Mr Blair is acknowledging that they have not completed the process to bring about a policing service Envisaged by the Good Friday agreement. But if they want to have a republican involvement in the policing body, then the way of resolving the issue is to do what they have promised to do. As part of this offer to bring a deal, we have argued very strongly that there also needs to be a transfer of powers on policing and justice and that's sort of a natural progression from the Good Friday agreement. It's also important in dealing with, and trying to resolve, this issue on who controls the police. And it's actually quite a big move by us because it's very unlikely that there'll be a Sinn Fein minister of policing. So to move we'd have to go to an Ard Fheis to be able to be part of the policing dispensation. But if we moved to do that would be genuinely a seismic move. The whole thing can be described as bringing about depoliticised civic policing which is publicly and politically accountable. There are three legs: there's the policing board, there's the ombudsman and there's the British secretary of state; and at the moment the balance is titled towards the British side. You have the absurdity of SDLP members of policing board going to meet a British minister to protest about policing. Absurd! You had a situation when allegations were made about the raid in Castlereagh. Was it the policing board? No. There was an MI5 agent appointed to do the investigation. So it should be positioned in the policing board and the balance should be altered in that direction. I think it is fair to say that Sinn Fein will be part of the policing board but not for the service that is currently on offer, such a decision will be taken by a special Ard Fheis. But as president of the party I have no reason to summon a special Ard Fheis at this time. I would like to be able to do that. we will then debate where the party does on this issue. But it can only be done in a changed context. Broadcasting Sinn Fein have put together a menu of all the outstanding parts of the agreement. We gave it to the two governments. So, while there may be die-in-the-ditch issues, if there's to be acts of completion, let there be acts and let there be completion. And when you get to the situation, for example, there's still no provision of Irish language broadcasters, there's still no proper way to receive the Irish language broadcaster A republican response I'll tell you that when there is movement on those issues. I think that republicans obviously have a responsibility to continuously enhance this process and I think republicans have done that and I am not just talking about Sinn Fein. I think the IRA has done it also. Clearly if a British government is serious about completing its obligations then it puts a huge onus on republicans to be imaginative. If a British government is categoric, qualified, conditional, phased, equivocal one would not be surprised if republicans are the same. If a British government is generous both beyond the rhetoric and tries to make it a reality then I think that republicans have to be up for that challenge also. An IRA response The IRA will make its own decisions on these matters and is very jealous, properly so, of its own authority. So you have to take people on their word. If the IRA says that an irreversible process to bring about justice and peace and so on... can or could help to bring about an end to conflict then that has to be a basis on which that organisation has to face up to its responsibility. Completing decommissioning What is an act of completion? It isn't even productive because we are dealing with concepts which haven't been defined. I think it is enough to say if you accept even for the sake of debate these three segments I have outlined, while it is my view that we will get this process to work, it is my conviction. Will we do it between now and 20 March, will we get these three balls in the air by that time? The only way you can make that judgement because the theory of it all fades if you have before you the commitment from the two governments. You can speculate all you like but if you have this in front of you then you can some sense of how far people can be led. In terms of Mr Trimble, the same thing goes. If he has before him what the two governments are going to do and what republicans are going to do then he has some sense of how far he can lead his people. The objective is to bring an end to physical force republicans. If that [the Good Friday agreement] is working then there is an empowerment to bring about what Mitchel [McLaughlin] has outlined. If that is not working then the opposite is the case. In republican activism at the moment you can't argue that politics is working. Whether people are right or not many people see it in black and white terms. On one side it is the IRA's fault, on the other it is the unionists and the British government's fault. I just genuinely don't know how all of this could be sorted out but I think, to tell the truth, that is not a problem. I think that when people decide to do things they will find ways of doing it. The demand on the IRA at the moment to disband, you might as well howl at the moon. You need to look at it in the big picture sense. I want to live in the future and that has to be a future free of all the armed groups. In terms of the project the way to make it work is not to howl at the moon but to go about the systematic process of making change that has been the modality that has taken us to where we are at the moment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
