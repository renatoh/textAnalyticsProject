In a tweet that received more than a thousand likes, Pam Smith wrote to Greater Manchester police to thank them for the gesture towards her grandmother, Josie Birds. \u201cA big thank you to @gmpolice for \u2018arresting\u2019 my Gran Josie today,\u201d she said. \u201cShe is 93 years old and her health is failing, and she wanted to be arrested for something before it\u2019s too late. She has a heart of gold and thoroughly enjoyed it today. Thank you for granting her wishes.\u201d Smith said that Greater Manchester police had \u201cmade an old lady very happy\u201d by arresting her grandmother, adding: \u201cShe is quite poorly and wanted to do something like this while she still has the strength to enjoy it. She\u2019s been good all her life (she says....) and wanted to have an experience to remember! She\u2019s a star.\u201d Greater Manchester police said in a statement: \u201cA few weeks ago, a member of the community approached a GMP PCSO from the North Manchester division with a slightly unusual request. \u201cThe woman mentioned that her 93-year-old grandmother had a request on her bucket list that she was hoping GMP would help her fulfil. \u201cThe request was for the grandmother to be \u2018arrested\u2019 and be taken to one of our police stations so she could experience what it was like to be on the wrong side of the law.\u201d Ch Insp Denise Pye of the force\u2019s City of Manchester division said: \u201cThe focus of our PCSOs is heavily driven by our community and how we can support them \u2026 On this occasion, and for a short period of time, we were able to fulfil the wishes of an elderly lady, and give her a day to remember. \u201cWe can reassure the rest of the community that while this was happening, officers from across the area were continuing with their duties to ensure this short visit had no impact whatsoever on the wider area. \u201cWe want the community to feel reassured in our presence and comfortable in approaching any of our officers when they see us out and about. \u201cWe\u2019re glad to see that we were able to make an elderly lady smile and tick one thing off her bucket list.\u201d It is not the first incident of its kind. In March, Anne Brokenbrow, 104, had her wish of being arrested granted, after relaying her desire to her Bristol care home. Brokenbrow said it was an enjoyable experience: \u201cI had a lovely day, it was interesting. Nothing like that ever happened to me before. They put the handcuffs on, I had the lot.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
