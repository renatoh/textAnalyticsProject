Mean people become nice; the wicked see the error of their ways. But it doesn't always happen. Some folk are just horrible, and it's hard to know if the chief whip, Andrew Mitchell, is one of those. So let's consider the evidence. We know that Big Dave's big stick was sweary in a way that would have seen others arrested. But was this a first display of overweening arrogance? Apparently not. On the always readable blog of Labour peer Lord Harris of Haringey there's a clue to what our potty-mouthed friend the chief whip was like even before he reached the pinnacle of parliament. It is a tale of two Andrew Mitchells. Both were prospective parliamentary candidates, one in Islington South and Finsbury \u2013 he was at the time the leader of the opposition at Haringey council. The other \u2013 the one we know who swears at policemen \u2013 was a candidate in Gedling, Nottinghamshire. At the time, he lived in Islington. Quite a few miles separate Islington and Gedling, but still the potty-mouthed one worried that people might get the two Andrew Mitchells confused. He summoned his namesake to a meeting. You had better change your name, he told him haughtily. I don't think so, came the reply. We don't know how potty-mouth reacted to that rebuff. But with recent events in mind, we can guess. \u2022 There must be serious repercussions from Mitchell-gate, say the police, but life isn't always like that. Indeed, it often appears as if the police themselves are able to make mistakes or disastrous transgressions, without fear of chilling consequences. Last month we mentioned the case of the black London teenager alleged to have been stopped 50 times by the Met. The force wouldn't discuss his case for fear of breaching his privacy. And, we asked, what will happen to the officer whose potentially damning evidence against him in court was directly contradicted by CCTV, allowing the teenager to walk from court rather than face the prospect of prison? And here's the answer. He's going to get some extra supervision in notetaking. Definitely proportionate. We may even send him a new pencil. \u2022 A mountain facing Russian president Vladimir Putin as his administration works to persuade a sceptical British public that he's about more than jailing dissidents and poisoning enemies in London. One supposes that the jolly his cultural organisation Rossotrudnichestvo laid on the other day for a party from Britain has to help. Last week we mentioned Richard Royal, of Conservative Friends of Russia as a key figure on the trip. It wasn't just Conservative Friends of Russia, he said \u2013 though the vast majority were from that group. Royal wouldn't name others. We've since learned that also there were Laurence Durnan, editor of the leftwing website Political Scrapbook, Matthew Elliott of the Tory's favourite pressure group, the TaxPayers' Alliance, and a man from the Times. And after 10 days of meeting politicos \u2013 including a former spy expelled from the UK \u2013 and visiting museums, etc, what was achieved? Not a great deal, but a good time was apparently had by all. It's a start; early days. \u2022 Everything starts somewhere. In Bristol, the independent mayoral candidate George Ferguson started his campaign promising to learn from the best places \"if that isn't too Irish\". Cue grovelling apology. A campaign both begins and ends. \u2022 Finally, as Anglicans gather to choose their next archbishop, let us savour the thoughts of the Reverend Dr Digby Anderson, founder of the Social Affairs Unit, explaining how liberals like Rowan Williams, or others who support abominations such as women priests, are actually playthings of Satan. Let us pray that Rev Digby finds the strength to remain within the Church of England, where he is still a priest. For \"Satan is seen as not only the great tempter but, and this is currently most apt, the instigator of ignorance, the distractor from God and the creator of illusions. The great heretics were, by definition, within the church and they are within it still.\" Pope Paul VI, the Rev says, talked of the \"smoke of Satan entering the temple of God ... Liberals within the church, in their assault on the Church's truth, tradition and order, are doing Satan's work.\" Times are hard. At least he's hiring.
