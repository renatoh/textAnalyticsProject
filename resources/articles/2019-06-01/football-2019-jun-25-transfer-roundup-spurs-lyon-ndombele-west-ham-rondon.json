Mauricio Pochettino has made the 22-year-old France international his prime summer target as he seeks new impetus at the club after spending five years in charge, and negotiations with Lyon are at an advanced stage. The French club were holding out for \u20ac75m for Ndomb\u00e9l\u00e9, who possesses a rare blend of skill and power, and Spurs had previously indicated that they valued him at \u20ac50m. But in a move that stands to delight Pochettino, they have pushed hard towards a compromise fee. They believe that the numbers will be acceptable to Lyon while they also feel that Ndomb\u00e9l\u00e9 wants to join them. Spurs\u2019s current transfer record is the \u00a342m that they paid to take the central defender Davinson S\u00e1nchez from Ajax in the summer of 2017. They will propose a five-year contract to Ndomb\u00e9l\u00e9. Pochettino has been keen to strengthen in midfield, having lost Mousa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 to the Chinese club Guangzhou R&amp;F last January and with Christian Eriksen agitating for a move, it is thought that he would like to sign more than one player in the position. Spurs have held talks with the representatives of Roma\u2019s Nicolo Zaniolo and Ajax\u2019s Donny van de Beek but a deal for either is not thought to be close. It is Ndomb\u00e9l\u00e9 that Pochettino covets and he has told Daniel Levy, the Spurs chairman, that he is precisely the kind of player that the club ought to be signing. Pochettino does not consider his squad to be a particularly young one any more and Ndomb\u00e9l\u00e9, who would become his first signing since that of Lucas Moura from Paris St-Germain in January 2018, would bring fresh dynamism. Funds remain tight at the club as Levy balances the repayments on the new stadium project, although the team\u2019s unexpected run to the Champions League final did bring a windfall. Eriksen remains a key part of the summer puzzle and his potential sale would help to balance the books. Real Madrid have shown an interest in the Dane. Ndomb\u00e9l\u00e9, capped six times by France, has been monitored by a clutch of leading clubs including Real, Manchester City and the Italian champions Juventus. Spurs sense a coup. Andr\u00e9 Gomes has said it was an \u201ceasy decision\u201d to join Everton permanently after completing his move from Barcelona for \u00a322m plus add-ons. The Portugal international signed a five-year contract with Everton on Tuesday having enjoyed a successful season on loan with Marco Silva\u2019s side. West Ham United were also interested in the midfielder but the 25-year-old made it clear to the Spanish champions that he was set on a return to Goodison Park, where his career was revived following a difficult time at the Camp Nou. Gomes\u2019 fee could eventually reach \u00a325m with bonus payments. Securing the former Benfica and Valencia player on a permanent basis this summer was a priority for manager Silva, who also wants to sign Kurt Zouma for the long-term following the Chelsea defender\u2019s successful loan spell. Everton\u2019s new signing said: \u201cIt was an easy decision and I\u2019m very happy to have made it. I know the club made a massive effort to sign me and I\u2019m very happy and thankful to them. I said during the year that I felt part of a family and that is the most important thing to me.\u201d Meanwhile West Ham are pondering whether to step up their interest in Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n after having an opening bid of \u00a310m for the West Bromwich Albion striker rejected. Manuel Pellegrini is an admirer of the Venezuelan after working with him at M\u00e1laga and he hopes to use the news that Ben\u00edtez is set to leave Newcastle to his advantage. Pellegrini wants a new striker after releasing Andy Carroll on a free transfer and selling Lucas P\u00e9rez to Alav\u00e9s. West Ham have had a \u00a325m bid for Celta Vigo\u2019s Maxi Gomez turned down and fear missing out on the Uruguayan to Valencia, who can offer the striker Champions League football. The London club will move for both Gomez and R\u00f3ndon if they can sell Javier Hern\u00e1ndez, who earns \u00a3140,000 a week. A deal for Rondon, whose contract contains a \u00a316.5m release clause, could be easier to pull off given that West Brom, who have just appointed the former West Ham manager Slaven Bilic, missed out on promotion to the Premier League last season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
