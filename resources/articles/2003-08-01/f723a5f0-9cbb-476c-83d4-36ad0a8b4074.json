I would certainly think he will stay in training next year. \"It is great that a tactical race worked out in our favour for a change as it has been a horrible week,\" Tregoning added, referring to the disappointing efforts of Nayef and High Accolade at York. \"Nayef came back with a deep cut and he will need a couple of weeks off. I think it happened in the stalls.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
