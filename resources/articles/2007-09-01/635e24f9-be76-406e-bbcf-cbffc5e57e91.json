Keith Gillespie returned to training yesterday after a knee problem and was joined by the record scorer David Healy and the defender Jonny Evans, calf and ankle respectively, all three injuries having been picked up in the Riga defeat. A win tonight would be more than timely for the Irish, with Spain's home game against Latvia kicking off later in the evening. Sweden, who only drew with Denmark on Saturday, lead Group F on 19 points, with Nigel Worthington's men second alongside Spain on 16, although the Irish still have to travel to both countries. \"We got out of jail on Saturday,\" said Gillespie, reflecting on the Latvia defeat. \"When you look at the other results, they were not too bad for us. Having a game so soon gives us a chance to put things right.\" The Irish lost 3-0 to Iceland in their first game of the campaign and were booed off, although the Icelanders have failed to win since and cannot now qualify. \"Iceland are a strong, physical side,\" Gillespie added. \"However, they have also been inconsistent, so it is a bit difficult to tell what team is going to turn up.\" Heavy rain and strong winds are forecast and that is good news for Northern Ireland, even if the conditions will also suit the Icelanders. James Quinn, meanwhile, who won 50 caps, is in talks with Northampton about terminating his contract and retiring aged 32. \"He has always been there for his country,\" Worthington said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
