Agenda for Change is the government's complete overhaul of NHS pay and working conditions which is a cornerstone of its health reforms. It brings in a new job-evaluated pay structure covering all health posts, based on the principle of equal pay for work of equal value. All NHS staff will also share a common core of working conditions and hundreds of separate pay scales and grades are being merged into three national pay spines. There is a pay spine for doctors and dentists, one for other workers covered by the independent pay review body process, such as nurses and midwives, and one for all other NHS employees including administrative, ancillary and clerical staff. The proposals were first tabled by former health secretary Alan Milburn back in 1999 and are being rolled out from December 1. Why has it taken five years to introduce? The new pay structure applies to 1 million NHS staff covering 650 different types of jobs represented by a number of different trade unions so negotiations were never going to be completed quickly. So who was to blame for the delays? Probably both sides. At one stage the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) threatened to walk out of negotiations in protest at alleged foot dragging by the government. Why the frustration? Members of the RCN voted overwhelmingly in April last year in favour of Agenda for Change because it is will bring its members a 16% pay rise over three years. But other health unions have been more reluctant to support the package. Unison and four other health unions decided to ballot their members twice - once on the principles of the changes and then again after the results of the 12 pilot sites putting the changes to the test were known. What was the result of the unions' first ballot? There was agreement in principle but members were still determined to wait until the outcome of the pilots. What did the pilots show? Initial results from the pilot sites published by the Department of Health this July revealed that around 15% of NHS staff would require \"pay protection\" because Agenda for Change was expected to bring them a pay cut. This was not what the government had expected and caused concern at Whitehall because the unions' second ballot still had to take place. So the unions rejected Agenda for Change in the second ballot? No. They voted to accept the package. Why? The government bowed to pressure from the unions to remove unsocial hours payments from the new pay system and to keep the status quo until a review is carried out next year. The government also agreed to raise payments for staff on the lowest pay band by almost \u00a3400 with a new minimum wage of \u00a311,135. Are all the unions happy? Not quite. Up until the last minute the Society of Radiographers was the only union holding out against Agenda for Change after its 16,000 members rejected the package in a ballot. They were concerned about increases in working hours without extra pay and less money for on-call work. But at the end of November the Society pulled back from a lone fight with the government and decided to work with the Department of Health (DoH) after it received assurances from health minister John Hutton that the new pay system would be monitored for seven years. How much is all this going to cost? Agenda for Change puts at least an extra \u00a31bn on the NHS pay bill and is intended to benefit mostly staff who are the lowest and highest paid. Cleaners and staff on the bottom grade will be \u00a324 a week better off for working fewer hours. This is the result of the DoH increasing the NHS minimum wage from \u00a34.85p an hour to \u00a35.59p. At the top end the most senior nurses can now expect to earn between \u00a366,063 to \u00a383,546 the same as many consultant doctors."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
