On Sunday Trump\u2019s incoming White House press secretary, Sean Spicer, told ABC\u2019s This Week the president-elect would continue to use Twitter to announce policy and make comment on current events. The medium, he said, was a way to avoid mainstream media outlets and get his message directly to the American public. Despite widespread concern over the flagrant provocation and outright disregard for protocol displayed by many of Trump\u2019s tweets, Spicer said: \u201cYou know what? The fact of the matter is that when he tweets, he gets results.\u201d In an interview with CBS 60 Minutes after his election victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump said that he would now be \u201cvery restrained, if I use it at all\u201d regarding social media. He has not achieved that aim. On 28 December, to take one among many examples, he used Twitter to say: \u201cDoing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks. Thought it was going to be a smooth transition \u2013 NOT!\u201d On Sunday, the subject of that tweet sent out sober comments about a number of results he has achieved. \u201cFacing the worst financial crisis in 80 years,\u201d he wrote, \u201cyou delivered the longest streak of job growth in our history. \u201cAfter decades of rising healthcare costs, today nearly every American now has access to the financial security of affordable healthcare.\u201d The latter tweet spoke to a key concern among Democrats, as Trump and Republicans in Congress consider ways to repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Obama is reportedly arranging a meeting with congressional Democrats to consider ways to preserve his signature legislative achievement. The president\u2019s next tweet hinted at progressive fears over Trump\u2019s nomination of a number of climate change deniers to key positions in his cabinet. Obama continued: \u201cWe traded foreign oil for clean energy, we doubled fuel efficiency standards [and] we acted on a global scale to save the one planet we\u2019ve got.\u201d He added: \u201cWe brought home more of our troops [and] strengthened US leadership\u2013 leading with diplomacy [and] partnering with nations to meet global problems.\u201d Obama also said: \u201cFrom realizing marriage equality to removing barriers to opportunity, we\u2019ve made history in our work to reaffirm that all are created equal.\u201d In conclusion, the president tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s been the privilege of my life to serve as your president. I look forward to standing with you as a citizen. Happy New Year everybody.\u201d Obama\u2019s @POTUS Twitter account has 12.9 million followers, compared with 18.3 million for @RealDonaldTrump. As of 5pm ET on New Year\u2019s Day, the president-elect had not tweeted anything since a series of celebratory tweets and retweets sent shortly before the turn of the year. Not long before that, he tweeted a supposedly conciliatory message: \u201cHappy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don\u2019t know what to do. Love!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
