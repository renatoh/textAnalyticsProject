The Wigan captain, already forced to play in the unfamiliar position of prop because of a front-row injury crisis, lost three of his most experienced lieutenants in the heat of this ferocious battle, but still led the Warriors to a win which lifts them above Bradford to third in the table. Craig Smith, Wigan's one remaining fit specialist prop, suffered a knee injury shortly after they had raced to a 12-0 lead in eight minutes, then their scrum-half Adrian Lam was carried off on a stretcher - although the Wigan coach Denis Betts was hopeful that there was no recurrence of the knee problem which last year threatened to end Lam's career. More bad news followed in the second half, when Gary Connolly's involvement was abruptly ended by a collision with Joe Vagana's knee. But Farrell, who had scored the first try and instigated the second for Brett Dallas, simply took on more and more responsibility in a performance which impressed Bradford's coach Brian Noble as much as it did Betts. \"He's a champion player and a champion man,\" said Noble, who in his other role as Great Britain coach may even be tempted to use Farrell as a multi-skilled prop in the tri-nations series at the end of this year. \"He played 80 minutes where it's toughest, and in the last 20 he was really doing some damage,\" added Betts. \"He's been the outstanding player in the game for the last two months. It's just that tonight people have noticed.\" This was a night which held promise for Bradford as well as Wigan. They responded impressively to Wigan's early 12-point blitz and looked the likely winners when Shontayne Hape's try gave them a 16-14 lead early in the second half, with Iestyn Harris adjusting remarkably quickly to the stand-off role in only his second appearance back in league - despite having to make 40 tackles. But crucially they failed to build on that lead, denied once by Kris Radlinski's try-saving tackle on Lesley Vainikolo, and again by their own adventure in running a penalty rather than taking two more points from a kick at goal. After weathering the storm, inevitably it was Farrell who led Wigan back downfield, and a darting break by Danny Orr then sent Mick Cassidy between the posts. Five minutes later and Farrell was revealing yet another string to his bow with a delicate grubber kick which Radlinski won the race to for the touchdown. Farrell landed the fifth of his six goals and Wigan had the game won at 26-16 before Smith returned, with his knee heavily strapped, to struggle over for the final try - an apt summary of this heroic team performance.
