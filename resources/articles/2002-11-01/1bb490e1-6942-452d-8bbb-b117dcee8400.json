Sutton's willingness to drop back into midfield to accommodate the Welshman paid off in the previous round as the Englishman starred in the unusual role against his former club Blackburn. And the 29-year-old is expected to drop back once more as Martin O'Neill struggles with injuries to his regular midfielders. Alan Thompson is almost certain to be ruled out after injuring his thigh in the weekend win at Livingston and Stilian Petrov is another serious doubt after suffering a facial injury in the same game. O'Neill was at least hopeful that the Bulgarian had a chance of playing. \"Stilian trained this morning and he is feeling better by the day,\" he said. \"He is still pretty sore looking but he is up for it and he wants to play. \"He's just beginning to eat now and I was pleased to see him this morning. He is raring to go and another day will help. I am more hopeful than I was two days ago and I will give him every opportunity to play.\" Celta are currently sixth in the Spanish league but have scored only 13 goals in their 11 league games and O'Neill feels that could work to his side's advantage. \"A goalless draw wouldn't be a disaster because we are capable of scoring there,\" he said. \"Spanish teams are difficult to dislodge and generally they are half decent teams. \"But the players are buoyed by the win against Blackburn and, if we go through, then I would be delighted.\" Celtic are battling history, having been knocked out of Europe before Christmas in every season since 1979-80. Moreover the club have not beaten Spanish opposition in seven previous attempts, though they were beaten by Valencia only on penalties in last season's Uefa Cup. O'Neill is once again steering clear of mind games in the build-up after the Celta camp made it clear that they were aiming to win both legs of the tie. Blackburn's confident rhetoric in the previous round came back to haunt them and O'Neill is happy to let the opposition do the talking this time as well. \"I'm not up for pre-match games. The last time we played Blackburn Rovers there was a lot said and a lot of motivation that would have lasted us half a dozen games. \"But this is different and I'm not too concerned about what Celta think. We know we are capable of winning the two ties and we have to play big games to get through.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
