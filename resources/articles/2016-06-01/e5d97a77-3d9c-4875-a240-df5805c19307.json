The first was bite-size, shareable message to be dispersed by and among the party faithful that reaffirms their views. The second was something more off-the-wall and sometimes satirical, highlighting the ridiculousness of politics while at the same time pushing a view itself. Faruqi may be the only person to have thought about it that hard. Mostly, memes just liven up the timeline, prompting a retweet at best, a facepalm at worst and \u2013 most of the time \u2013 a favourite or humourless \u201clol\u201d. The Australian Manufacturing Workers\u2019 Union carved out a name for itself early on in this interminable election campaign with its sometimes unhinged posts to Twitter. The organisation\u2019s communications director, George Simon, told Triple J\u2019s Hack that its Twitter account was maintained by \u201ca group of young people experimenting with creative content\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve been given creative licence and we\u2019ve taken dank and we\u2019ve doubled down,\u201d said Simon. Simon\u2019s bosses were baby boomers, he told Triple J, and as such did not have a clue what was going on. \u201cThey appreciate the fact we\u2019re getting all this popularity but ... they just don\u2019t get it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe see dank memes, whereas they see a frog on a unicycle.\u201d The AMWU had taken some risks, he concluded \u2013 \u201cbut clearly it\u2019s paying off\u201d. And, of course, where there are pioneers, there will always be imitators. On Facebook, where all memes go to die, the ALP Spicy Meme Stash circulates pro-Labor memes while Innovative and Agile Memes covers the Liberal party\u2019s bases. Earlier in June the ALP Spicy Meme Stash declared war on the Innovative and Agile Memes, reportedly over a stolen meme. (The Liberals\u2019 page was accused of ripping off the Labor page\u2019s punchline, 10 Pranks That Went Way Too Far \u2013 which first appeared under a screenshot of a headline about Tony Abbott\u2019s being made prime minister. It\u2019s a matter of principle, you\u2019ve got to assume.) Egregiously, embarrassingly bad examples of both forms of meme abound at #auspol, the name given to the community of Australian politics aficionados on Twitter \u2013 the worst often those created or endorsed by the politicians themselves. (Scott Morrison has even started presenting them at press conferences.) A Liberal party graphic comparing Labor\u2019s 10-year economic plan to the album booklet for Taylor Swift\u2019s 1989 for some reason was derided by Faruqi as \u201chistory\u2019s worst meme\u201d. But bad memes are far from unique to any one party, as much as each likes to call attention to the other side\u2019s bad content. One Twitter user has taken it upon himself to document the worst of the genre from both sides. @WoefulAuspol \u2013 which bills itself as collating the most \u201cterrible\u201d memes \u201cby brokens from the Right and Left\u201d \u2013 has been tracking the worst memes of #Auspol since January 2015. The account\u2019s creator, who asked to be identified only as Adrian of Canberra, told Guardian Australia that he set it up in January 2015, when he noticed sledging over bad content from both sides of the political spectrum. \u201cI just went about collecting really bad memes to try and prove that both sides can be as terrible as each other. I tried to keep it 50/50. But I\u2019ve just posted what I could find or what people have submitted. \u201cI try to only post earnestly bad memes, and stay away from the ironically bad fun memes.\u201d Guardian Australia asked Adrian to share his observations \u2013 as well as the defining examples of the genre. \u2018My favourites are the ones about who is making deals with who\u2019 \u2018Politicians are even authorising bad memes now\u2019 \u2018Official accounts do not understand Simpsons references\u2019 \u2018Then there\u2019s just the downright unhinged\u2019"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
