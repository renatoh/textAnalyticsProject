Allegations by the Newcastle director of rugby Rob Andrew that Leinster had put pressure on the referee to postpone this fixture on Sunday gave extra spice to the game, if any was needed. Given that the Irish arrived unbeaten in any competition this season, they were formidable enough opponents without any winding up from Andrew. Certainly Matt Williams, the Leinster coach, was content to let his players do the talking on the field and refused to be drawn into a slanging match with his opposite number. His main concern was that his side won the match to ensure winning the group and qualifiying for the quarter-finals of the competition. That they did, but in the end it was tight. Underground heating at Leeds ensured this fixture got under way at the third time of asking and, after the delays, Leinster were clearly in no mood to hang about. Their opening try came in the sixth minute when the fly-half Nathan Spooner's pass missed out both centres and found the full-back Girvan Dempsey coming into the line at pace. The try, for the wing Denis Hickie on the overlap, was a formality. Leinster, though, were not having everything their own way and in the 13th minute Newcastle drew level. Inga Tuigamala powered close to the line and the ball was recycled to Jonny Wilkinson who had Tom May, sporting a new bleached hairstyle, in support for the score. Wilkinson and Brian O'Meara - given the kicking duties with the withdrawal of Spooner through injury - exchanged first-half penalties but the Irish should have ensured a lead at the interval when Hickie dropped the ball when he had players unmarked on the outside. Given the fireworks that had gone on off the field the match was a strangely passionless affair despite a late rally by Newcastle. The Irish did just enough and no more, and Newcastle, except when they moved up a gear in the closing minutes, seemed to have their minds elsewhere. The fact that there were only 1,146 spectators rattling around in a stadium that can hold more than 23,000 certainly did not help the atmosphere. Five minutes after the restart the visitors regained the lead when Newcastle turned over possession and the ball was seized on by O'Meara, who stepped inside Wilkinson for a soft try. The England fly-half's woes were compounded when he left the field for stitches. But Newcastle's late rally nearly denied Leinster. A period of pressure saw Tuigamala crash over for a try only for Wilkinson, back on the pitch after treatment, to miss an easy conversion.
