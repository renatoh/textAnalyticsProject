His equations showed that the electron should have a partner particle that was exactly the same mass but which had the opposite charge and magnetic moment. Two years later, Carl Anderson found experimental evidence for Dirac's anti-particle when examining cosmic rays, and named it the positron. By the 1950s, physicists had made antiprotons. Particles of matter and antimatter are identical, except for an opposite electrical charge. An electron has a negative charge whereas its antiparticle, the positron, has a positive charge, and both have an identical mass. Similarly, a proton and an antiproton are the same size and have the same mass but have positive and negative charges respectively. When a particle meets its antiparticle pair, the resulting annihilation turns their masses into pure energy, as determined by Albert Einstein's equation, E=MC2. Antiparticles are not quite as strange as science fiction stories may have you believe \u2013 positrons are widely used in PET (positron emission tomography) scanners. And antiprotons have been produced inside particle accelerators for decades. The question is why they are missing from nature. The laws of physics do not differentiate between matter and antimatter so, at creation of the universe in the big bang, equal amounts of both should have been made. For every particle of matter in the universe, there should be a particle of antimatter. In practice, though, we don't see them. At the start of the universe, cosmologists think, there was probably an infinitesimally small excess of matter particles over antimatter particles. When the particles came into contact and the inevitable annihilations occurred in the earliest seconds of time, the universe was left only with matter particles swimming with copious amounts of energy. Why did this asymmetry happen at the start of the universe? Are there some as-yet unknown differences between matter and antimatter particles, which have made one of them survive preferentially over the course of time? Theoretically there should be no differences, but the theories have not been tested empirically. One way to examine this is to carry out experiments on antimatter. If scientists could detect even the slightest difference in behaviour between, say, an atom of hydrogen (composed of an electron orbiting a proton) and one of antihydrogen (a positron orbiting an antiproton), it might help explain what happened at the start of the universe, and why we only see normal matter around us today. Cern's capture of antihydrogen this week will bring those experiments closer to reality. At its Alpha experiment, scientists trapped 38 antihydrogen atoms for around half a second. Antihydrogen has been produced before but no one had managed to keep it still long enough to make any use or measurements of it. The next step is to create more antihydrogen atoms in a robust way, and trap them for longer. Once we have a steady supply of antihydrogen, it will be possible to better understand the fundamentals: do antiprotons and positrons attract each other with the same force as electrons and protons, for example? There's no reason to think not but, if experiments show otherwise, physics would need some major overhauling. The most promising use of antihydrogen in the future, if we could make and store enough of it, and at a reasonable cost (all of them huge ifs), is as a fuel. Collisions of matter and antimatter release enormous amounts of energy: if 1kg of antimatter came into contact with 1kg of matter, the resulting explosion would be the equivalent of 43 megatons of TNT \u2013 about 3,000 times more powerful than the bomb that exploded over Hiroshima. Producing a rocket or a power station to utilise that energy in a sensible way, however, would be a huge engineering challenge, though not physically impossible. But even when it is fully operational, Cern's state-of-the-art accelerators will produce very few antiprotons, enough to make only a gram of antihydrogen every 100bn years. So don't hold your breath quite yet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
