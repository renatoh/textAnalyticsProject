Johnson-Thompson looked impressive in finishing second to Meghan Beesley in the 200m hurdles in Manchester on Saturday but her coach, Mike Holmes, says that with the world championships in Beijing being her main focus this year she may sit out the defence of the Hypo-Meeting title she won in G\u00f6tzis last year. \u201cKat\u2019s had a little bit of a knee niggle coming out of Prague and Manchester was a bit of tester, and she\u2019s come through that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll have a reflection but G\u00f6tzis is not vital to us. We\u2019ll see how she reacts, the knee is not a serious issue like she had in 2010 but it\u2019s probably only 70-30 that she will go.\u201d Ennis-Hill will also make a late decision over competing in G\u00f6tzis.
