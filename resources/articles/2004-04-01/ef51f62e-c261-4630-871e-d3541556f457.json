Hendry wasted no time in wrapping up a 13-3 victory over Ian McCullough, the same scoreline by which O'Sullivan breezed past Anthony Hamilton yesterday. The six-times world champion resumed this afternoon with a 6-2 lead; he soon extended that to 9-2, but McCullough reduced the arrears with a 108 break. Undeterred, Hendry, who only just edged past Barry Pinches in a deciding frame in the last round, knocked in two centuries after the mid-session break to seal the win. The two tournament favourites will now play for a place in the final. It promises to be a fiery encounter after O'Sullivan's assertion earlier in the season that Hendry \"should go back to his sad little life\". In the other half of the draw, Welshman Matthew Stevens withstood a spirited comeback from Joe Perry to secure his place in the last four with a 13-10 victory. He will play the winner of the match between Graeme Dott and David Gray which concludes this evening. Dott leads 11-5."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
