Scott McDonald, the Australian striker who made an impressive debut for Celtic in Moscow a fortnight ago, was considering a return to his homeland to reconstruct a faltering career only three years ago. After being released by Southampton in 2003, McDonald signed short-term deals at Bournemouth and Wimbledon but, amid the collapse of ITV Digital and lack of money in England's lower leagues, could find nobody to take a long-term chance on him. Yet, when he was on the verge of heading back to Australia, a move to Motherwell materialised and McDonald's 42 goals from 96 league starts earned him a \u00a3700,000 summer transfer to the Scottish champions. Today, he stands on the verge of Europe's elite under the guidance of Gordon Strachan, the very man who opted to free him from Southampton. \"After the collapse of the ITV deal the money was really poor and nobody was taking a chance on young players,\" said the 24-year-old McDonald. \"It got to the stage where I didn't know where my next wage was coming from. I was signing one-month contracts here and there and that is no good when you are trying to improve as a player. \"I felt like going home and starting from scratch. I had nowhere to stay when I left Southampton and my girlfriend and her family took me in. I was offered a contract by Bournemouth, then they went back on their word. I was in limbo. I signed a two-month then a one-month deal at Wimbledon and I'd had enough by the end of it.\" Strachan hinted that McDonald's attitude was largely to blame for his earlier problems but he is in no doubt regarding his current worth. \"He's a more respectful and better person,\" the Celtic manager said. \"He's more understanding of everyone - coaches and players - round about him. He understands now that the people round about him will make him a better player.\" Celtic's 1-1 draw in Moscow hands them an advantage ahead of this second leg but Strachan will urge his players to go for victory rather than a goalless draw. \"Winning the game gets us through, it is as simple as that,\" he said. \"It doesn't matter if we do it 5-4, just do it and we're through. It would be fantastic and give my team another six games, minimum, at the top level, which would be absolutely invaluable.\" Celtic (probable, 4-4-2): Boruc; Wilson, Caldwell, McManus, Naylor; Nakamura, S Brown, Donati, McGeady; McDonald, Vennegoor of Hesselink. Spartak Moscow (probable, 3-4-3) Pletikosa; Shishkin, Stranzel, Soava; Bystrov, Kovac, Mozart, Torbinskiy; Pavluchenko, Titov, Welliton. TV: BBC1 Scotland, kick-off 7.45pm"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
