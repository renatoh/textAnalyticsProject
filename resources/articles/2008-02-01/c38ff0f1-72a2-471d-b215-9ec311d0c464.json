Ten pumps have been sent to the Grand Hotel on Brighton seafront, East Sussex, after fire broke out in a first-floor room service area. An East Sussex fire and rescue service spokeswoman described it as a \"major\" fire but could not disclose further details. Guests at the Grand Hotel were evacuated to the nearby Hilton Brighton Metropole Hotel shortly after 8pm. Janet Ridge, duty manager of the Metropole, said: \"The whole hotel has been evacuated and all the guests have been moved here. We are serving them tea, coffee and sandwiches. \"We have been told that 400 people are coming. But it could be even more than that. We are helping wherever we can.\" Ridge said: \"We heard that it started in the basement. The smoke is coming out of the roof.\" She added that the Kings Road, which runs along the sea front, had been closed to traffic in both directions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
