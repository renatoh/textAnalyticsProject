The \u201cHelen\u2019s law\u201d legislation, named after Helen McCourt, a 22-year old insurance clerk whose murderer has never revealed her whereabouts since he was convicted in 1989, will require parole boards to take into account any refusal to provide information about remains when deciding about release. Gauke said the legal requirement was to tackle the \u201cparticular cruelty\u201d of denying grieving families the opportunity to lay their murdered loved one to rest. \u201cThe Parole Board must consider this cruelty when reviewing an offender\u2019s suitability for release, which could see them facing longer behind bars,\u201d he said. Human rights legislation protects against arbitrary detention, and the proposed law balances this with the need to keep the public safe, the government said. It also allows for cases where a murderer does not know where the body is, such as when it has been moved. McCourt\u2019s mother, Marie, said: \u201cThis legislation will mean that myself and many other families will, hopefully, not have to endure the torture of not knowing where their loved ones\u2019 remains can be recovered from.\u201d Ian Simms, who was convicted of Helen McCourt\u2019s 1988 murder, has repeatedly refused to say where her remains are. He has recently been allowed out of prison on temporary release and was photographed in Birmingham in March, when he told a reporter he did not know the location of the body. Any new law would come too late to help compel Simms to provide more information as his parole process is already under way. It will require primary legislation and full parliamentary approval and the Ministry of Justice could not say when it would be brought into effect. Courts can already pass tougher sentences for murderers who deliberately conceal the location of a body. Marie McCourt has been campaigning for reform for several years and had called for killers to be told they would spend the rest of their lives in prison if they did not reveal the location of their victims\u2019 bodies. Conor McGinn, McCourt\u2019s local MP, said it was \u201ca good day for British justice\u201d. \u201cThis is a hugely welcome and important step forward for the McCourts and countless other families,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing can undo their hurt and pain, but the least they deserve is justice. I want to pay tribute to my constituent Marie McCourt, whose dignity and determination inspired hundreds of thousands of people to support our campaign for Helen\u2019s law.\u201d Linda Jones, the mother of Danielle Jones from Tilbury in Essex, who was last seen leaving home for school 18 years ago, was among the campaign\u2019s backers. The 15-year old\u2019s uncle Stuart Campbell was convicted of murder and remains in prison, but could be released in two years. Brady died aged 79 in 2017 having told Alan Bennett, the brother of Keith Bennett, one of his child victims, that he would tell him where his sibling was buried in his will when he died. No information was forthcoming. Bennett has told how every year before Christmas he drives on to Saddleworth Moor, the location of searches for Keith\u2019s body, and plays a tape recording of the family, including Keith, singing Jerusalem \u201cjust to get a feeling of \u2018we have not forgotten you\u2019\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
