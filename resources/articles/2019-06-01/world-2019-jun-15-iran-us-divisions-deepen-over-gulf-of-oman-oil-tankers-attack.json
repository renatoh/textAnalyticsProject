Politicians in Britain traded angry blows over the incident, after the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, questioned whether there was \u201ccredible evidence\u201d that Iran had attacked the two ships as they passed by its coast on Thursday, rebuffing a Foreign Office assessment that it was \u201calmost certain\u201d that a \u201cbranch of the Iranian military\u201d had carried out the strikes. \u201cBritain should act to ease tensions in the Gulf, not fuel a military escalation that began with US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement,\u201d Corbyn tweeted. \u201cWithout credible evidence about the tanker attacks, the government\u2019s rhetoric will only increase the threat of war.\u201d The comments drew an immediate rebuke from the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, who described them as \u201cpathetic and predictable\u201d. Earlier the FCO had said: \u201cNo other state or non-state actor could plausibly have been responsible,\u201d and pointed to a \u201crecent precedent for attacks by Iran against oil tankers\u201d. The row came as tensions between the regional heavyweight and Washington remained high, three days after an attack that sent tremors through oil markets and sparked fears of widespread disruption to the global oil trade, much of which passes through Gulf waters. Iran has denied carrying out the attacks \u2013 the second strikes in a month on Gulf shipping \u2013 disputing footage released by the US military that purports to show Iranian naval commandos removing an unexploded mine from the hull of one of the crippled tankers. US defence officials said on Friday that prior to the attack, Iranian forces had fired an anti-aircraft missile at a US drone that had been monitoring their activity close to the tankers in the Gulf of Oman. Officials said the Reaper drone took images of Iranian vessels closing in on the two tankers that were attacked but did not say whether there was any visual evidence of the attack itself. President Trump has sent mixed signals over how he wants to address the crisis, which erupted as the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, was in Tehran, carrying an offer of talks from the White House. After Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ali Khamenei, rejected the offer, Trump disowned Abe\u2019s mission and tweeted that it was \u201ctoo soon to even think about making a deal\u201d with Iran\u2019s leaders. \u201cThey are not ready, and neither are we!\u201d However, in the same interview on his favourite television talk show, Fox &amp; Friends, on Friday morning, in which he said \u201cIran did it\u201d, the US president also said: \u201cThey\u2019ve been told in very strong terms we want to get them back to the table.\u201d Hunt was among several candidates for the Tory leadership to attack Corbyn for his remarks. Michael Gove accused the Labour leader of \u201cfailing to stand up for our values of freedom and democracy\u201d. Dominic Raab accused him of \u201canti-American prejudice\u201d. Labour MP John Mann, a leading party critic, also denounced his leader\u2019s comments. Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary, appeared to soften Labour\u2019s stance on the issue, saying that there needed to be further \u201cprocesses\u201d to establish whether Iran was behind the attack. She suggested that Iran could have carried out the tanker attack after taking the \u201cbait\u201d of western sanctions. \u201cThese are extremely dangerous developments and we really have to pause and think about where we are going next,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. Thornberry insisted that the main issue was avoiding \u201cBritish forces being drawn into a conflict of that size\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to give up on this idea that if the United States go into war, especially one engineered by the likes of John Bolton and the neocons, we have to stop and say there are times when we don\u2019t just follow,\u201d Thornberry said. \u201cWe made a dreadful mistake when it came to Iraq and we must not make the same mistake again.\u201d Saudi Arabia\u2019s crown prince blamed Iran for attacks, according to an interview with the Saudi-owned Asharq al-Awsat newspaper. \u201cThe Iranian regime did not respect the Japanese prime minister\u2019s visit to Tehran and while he was there replied to his efforts by attacking two tankers, one of which was Japanese,\u201d the newspaper quoted Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as saying on its Twitter account. The head of the Arab League has called on the Iranians to \u201cbe careful and reverse course\u201d. In New York, the league\u2019s secretary general Ahmed Aboul Gheit said: \u201cWe believe that responsibilities need to be clearly defined. The facts will be revealed, I am sure, it\u2019s only a matter of time. \u201cMy call to my Iranian \u2013 and I call them Iranian \u2013 brothers: Be careful and reverse course because you\u2019re pushing everybody towards a confrontation that no one would be safe if it happens.\u201d And the United Arab Emirates\u2019 top diplomat said evidence indicates that recent attacks against oil tankers inside UAE waters were \u201cstate-sponsored\u201d. But Russia has warned against rushing to assign blame for the attacks and accused the US of using its accusations against Iran to stoke tensions in the region."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
