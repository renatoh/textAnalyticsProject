Bayern Munich and Juventus are among several clubs linked with a move for the Liverpool striker, and Manchester City's manager, Roberto Mancini, has spoken publicly of his interest. Su\u00e1rez reiterated that he is \"very happy' at Anfield but said that, if another team \"with more prospects of competing in international club competition games\" approached him, \"they are very welcome\". The Uruguayan's comments are likely to spark a fierce battle for his signature in time for next season. Su\u00e1rez has been in superb form for Liverpool during this campaign, with 29 goals in 40 games, but admitted that, with the club in danger of missing out on European qualification, they are in a \"difficult moment\". He is under contract at Liverpool until 2017. \"I am very happy at Liverpool but you never know in football,\" said Su\u00e1rez, speaking in his homeland before Uruguay's World Cup qualifier with Paraguay on Friday, in comments reported by the Liverpool Echo. \"A player's ambition is always there, the ambition of wanting to play in elite teams is always there. I'm in a world-class team, an elite team like Liverpool. We have to realise we have a new manager who is imposing a philosophy and a way of playing that the players are adapting to as best we can. We hope it will bear fruit next year. \"If another team comes around with more prospects of competing in international club competition games, which is willing to have me, they are welcome. We would talk to the club. We would see if I want to go, if I don't want to go.\" Last month Liverpool's manager, Brendan Rodgers, said he was convinced that Su\u00e1rez would stay even if the club failed to qualify for Europe. His comments came after face-to-face talks with the player's agent, Pere Guardiola. He has admitted, though, that he expects interest in a player he has described as \"world class\" and deserving of appearances in the Champions League. Su\u00e1rez, who joined Liverpool for \u00a323m in January 2011 from Ajax, acknowledged on Wednesday his behaviour had let him down at times during his career but insisted he had made a conscious effort this season to clean up his act on the pitch. \"I have a very strange way of playing football,\" Su\u00e1rez said. \"I'm my own severest critic and I realise when I make mistakes. \"There are times that I get yellow cards that can influence a game. I have improved and I have to continue improving. \"You can lose some things but you can never lose the slyness, the passion that you have had since you were a kid playing in the street. If I didn't have the character that I have today on the pitch, I don't think that I would have become the player that I am today.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
