Nadia, 18 My uni sent a letter suggesting I bought this book about how to study. I bought it, but still after a year at uni have not opened it or begun to read it, so if you do get told about extra reading, only bother spending your money if you're going to use it - don't waste it like I did! Emma, 19. Think sensibly about how much stuff you take. If it's a long journey to uni, you don't want to be stuck in the car under all your things. Theresa, 18. Tell everyone you're going, and your address at uni - it's always good to get letters. James, 19. Get all your friends' uni addresses, because it's a nice way to keep in touch. Getting mail suddenly becomes a big event when you join uni. Katie, 19. Set aside a certain amount of money for phone calls - money seems to disappear. Budgeting would be a BIG tip. Learn before you go. Emma, 19. You'll have a great time at uni, but don't forget your mates back home, because they'll be thinking of you. I have learnt from my own experiences and realise that old school mates are for life. Tom, 18. Remember to go out lots with your mates from home - you'll miss them when you're at uni. And remember to take photos to remind yourself of the last night you had all together. Simon, 19. Don't take a television with you. It might seem like a good idea, but it can mean that you just stay in your room a lot, and don't socialise, because you prefer the comfort of doing something familiar. John, 20. Enjoy your time at home before you go, and each time you go home for the holidays, because no matter how independent you are, you will miss your parents.
