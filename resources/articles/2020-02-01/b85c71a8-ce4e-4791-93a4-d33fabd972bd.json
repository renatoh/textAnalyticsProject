Vunipola missed England\u2019s convincing 24-12 victory over Ireland on Sunday, having travelled to the Pacific Islands after a relative was taken seriously ill. England will convene in Oxford on Wednesday for their second fallow week of the competition before beginning preparations to face Wales on 7 March. Asked if Vunipola would be available, Jones said: \u201cProbably not. He\u2019s gone home for family business.\u201d The 29-year-old prop also missed last summer\u2019s defeat by Wales in Cardiff through injury and in his absence again Joe Marler and Ellis Genge are set to share the loosehead responsibilities. His brother Billy is also unavailable with a broken arm but Jones praised the impact of Manu Tuilagi, who returned to the side against Ireland, having missed out in Scotland owing to a groin injury. \u201cHe\u2019s powerful,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a powerful backline. We\u2019ve got good movers but power is a very important part of the game and when we don\u2019t have him it\u2019s difficult.\u201d In his post-match press conference after England\u2019s win over Ireland, Jones claimed that his side were so dominant they could have \u201cdeclared at half-time\u201d. Seemingly in reference to having to make an apology for a bizarre remark to a reporter last week, he later said: \u201cIt\u2019s probably a throwaway line, probably need to apologise for it again. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I know you\u2019re not allowed to say anything that\u2019s a little bit different here, so I\u2019ll apologise.\u201d Jones also praised Owen Farrell\u2019s captaincy against Ireland, picking up on what he perceived to be criticism of the player\u2019s leadership. \u201cOwen is not even two years into the job,\u201d he said. \u201cEvery game he captains, he gets a little bit better. It wasn\u2019t about what he did on the field [against Ireland], it was about what he did in the lead-up to the game. \u201cHe\u2019s learning to be a better captain. Captaincy is hard. You have a room of all different sorts of people and you have to try to find the same page for them and that takes experience. He\u2019s doing a great job.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
