The midfielder has been recuperating in Dubai after suffering the injury against Tottenham nine days ago and is not expected to fly to Germany on Tuesday with the squad. Arsenal trail 3-1 from the first leg. Arsenal's manager, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, will address Wilshere's fitness on Tuesday, when it should become clearer whether the 21-year-old is in danger of being ruled out of England's World Cup qualifying double-header in San Marino and Montenegro, which starts a week on Friday. Lukas Podolski hopes to play against Bayern, one of his former clubs, despite revealing on Twitter he has a slight injury. The defender Bacary Sagna is also a doubt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
