Always one to seek an extra edge, the ever-flamboyant Malcolm Allison got in touch with the hypnotist/illusionist Romark (real name Ronald Markham) during his spell as manager at Crystal Palace in the mid-70s. The pair fell out, however, amid reports of an unpaid bill, and Romark apparently placed a curse on Palace. Then, on the eve of Palace's 1976 FA Cup semi-final against Southampton, Romark contacted Lawrie McMenemy's secretary, Val Gardner, and arranged a meeting with the Saints manager. \"I took the coward's way out and agreed to see him,\" McMenemy wrote in a May 2005 Southern Daily Echo column. \"When he came in, his eyes immediately struck me. He had peripheral vision, both eyes staring in different directions. He surprised everyone by asking for two chairs to be placed in the centre of the room facing away from each other two yards apart, then got an apprentice to put his head on one and heels on the other. When he took the chairs away, the lad stayed suspended in mid air. I was even asked to sit on the lad's stomach and still he stayed suspended. George Horsfall, our reserve-team trainer, came in shortly afterwards and, after telling him what had happened, he did the trick all over again. He wouldn't tell us how it had been done, but George was born in India and it may well have had something to do with the old Indian rope trick.\" Ruse or not, it did the trick, Southampton beating Palace 2-0 before going on to upset Manchester United in the final. Romark's work was not yet done, however. The curse apparently transferred to Allison himself, who went on to manage Manchester City, and on the eve of their 1980 FA Cup third-round tie at Fourth Division Halifax, the Halifax manager George Kirby enlisted Romark's assistance. Speaking in the Lancashire Evening Post, the striker John Smith recalled that, two days before the tie, \"I'm sat there with this guy called Romark, and he was saying \u2026 'you will go to sleep now, John Smith, and then you'll overcome the power of Manchester City. You will play the greatest game of your life, John Smith. When I count to three, you'll wake up again.' I was trying not to laugh and I'm thinking, what's all this about? What a load of nonsense.\" Smith would subsequently lay on the winner for Paul Hendrie in a 1-0 win for the Shaymen. \"All the headlines, though, were about that hypnotist,\" said Smith, \"but we beat Manchester City through courage, hard work and belief.\" The mysterious Romark would later attempt to prove his powers by driving blindfolded through the streets of Ilford, only for his journey to reach a rather abrupt end after approximately 20 yards when he crashed into the back of a police van. \"That van was parked in a place that logic told me it wouldn't be,\" he claimed. After being imprisoned for embezzling his mother, Romark died of a stroke in 1982. Another man not shy of self-publicity is Uri Geller, who claims to have used his powers on a number of occasions in football, though not at the behest of any individual in the game. Even during his infamous spell as co-chairman of Exeter City, Geller insisted he would leave the on-field matters to the manager John Cornforth. \"Whilst I advocate a positive work ethic and optimistic outlook, I will absolutely refrain from using any form of paranormal activity,\" he told the club's official website in May 2002. The Grecians were relegated to the Conference 12 months later. Though it's not quite psychic assistance, Bristol Rovers attempted to tap into the art of feng shui in 1999, inviting 'experts' Guy de Beaujeu and Patrick Stockhausen to the Memorial Ground in a bid to bring them luck. \"The two men placed a ceramic frog above the entrance, potted plants in the dressing room and a tank of toy fish behind the goal,\" explained Scott Murray in the Guardian. \"It didn't work \u2013 Rovers lost their next match 1-0 against Gillingham \u2013 and no wonder, as the pair were filming a hoax TV series called Gatecrasher.\" However, Rovers nearly had the last, er, merk, as their form picked up and they eventually missed out on the playoffs by a matter of two points. \"They obviously knew a lot more than they thought because, since then, we have not stopped winning,\" noted a club spokesperson. UP AND DOWN DAYS \"When Peterborough played Newcastle recently, Newcastle could have been promoted and Peterborough relegated on the outcome of the game,\" wrote Kieran Corcoran last week. \"I was wondering how many times has this happened? Has there been a game when a team has gone up or won the league while also relegating the opposition in the process?\" Perhaps the most famous example of this came in May 1976. \"I can remember being in the crowd on the North Bank on a packed Molineux to watch Wolves play Liverpool,\" writes Kevin Porter. \"If Liverpool won they would claim the First Division title, Wolves needed victory to avoid relegation (and send Birmingham City down). For a large part of the match it looked possible the miracle might happen. Steve 'The Tank' Kindon gave Wolves a 12th-minute lead which they held throughout until Kevin Keegan's equaliser 15 minutes from time. Further late goals from John Toshack and Ray Kennedy sealed the home side's fate. QPR had perhaps a even greater reason to recall the date with regret \u2013 had Wolves managed to hang on for a draw Rangers would have claimed their one and only title.\" There are plenty of other examples \u2013 Stoke achieving promotion in 1963 and 2008 while condemning Luton and Leicester to relegation, Sampdoria winning the Scudetto in 1991 with a 3-0 win that relegated Lecce, to name a couple \u2013 but for raw emotion, not much can trump Oxford United v Leyton Orient on the final day of the 2005-06 season. \"Orient needed to do at least as well as Grimsby, who were at home to Northampton, to be promoted, while Oxford needed to win to stand a chance of avoiding relegation to the Conference,\" writes Csaba Abrahall. \"It was a mad afternoon, and the game was poised at 2-2 going into stoppage time. With Grimsby ahead against Northampton, a draw was no use to either team, leading to a bizarre conclusion in which both sides threw everything into attack. Just as Orient broke up an Oxford attack, Northampton equalised at Grimsby, meaning that a draw would do for the Os. But the news wasn't relayed to the players in time to prevent Lee Steele from scoring a winner in a five-against-one situation. So Orient went up, Oxford went down, and fans looked forward to the summer to recover.\" And the raw emotion? Have a listen to this: THE COSSACKS: A CLARIFICATION In last week's TV special we were introduced to the Cossacks and their dramatic run to the cartoon cup final, but we erred on the subtext, writes Oleksiy Pryrodnyy: \"I was born in Ukraine and grew up watching the Cossack cartoons. I don't think Chris Murphy got the meaning of this episode quite right. The \"class struggle\" is a very minor subtext at best. The real meaning of the cartoon, to my best understanding, has to do with the history of the Ukrainian Cossacks \u2013 members of a unique democratic military community created by rebels who were fleeing from prosecution or hardship they experienced under Russian or Polish rule. Part of the mythology surrounding the Cossacks were the daring overseas expeditions they undertook at various times, mostly against the powerful Ottoman Empire. The cartoon sends them in a different kind of expedition: to beat the greatest football powers of Europe, namely the Germans, the French and, toughest of all, the Brits (sorry Spaniards and Italians, apparently your countries' footballing accomplishments were deemed not worthy of making the list). \"From then on, it's all about national stereotypes and different styles of football in each country. The Germans are, of course, extremely orderly and organised, but not too technically brilliant with the ball (I loved how the German centre-forward missed the open goal twice before scoring \u2013 no doubt, foreshadowing Mario Gomez). The French are elegant and artistic, they play football inside the Opera house, display gallant manners (the look and the appearance of the 'French' was heavily borrowed from the Soviet version of 'The Three Musketeers', which was hugely popular at the time; you can even recognise Cardinal Richelieu in the referee), and have exquisite technique with the ball: I think I even spotted one of the 'French' players make a Zidane dribble, way before Zizou himself perfected it. As for the Brits, well, apparently the most interesting thing about them is rain \u2026 And rain is to blame, according to the cartoon, for the rigid positional style of football traditionally prevalent, the kind of football that was exposed during the 1953 Match of the Century, when the great Hungarians ran around the England players not unlike the Cossacks ran around the umbrella-toting British gentlemen. \"As for the Cossacks's style of football, in the way their speed and work-rate dumbfounded their European opponents one could without too much of a stretch see a reference to the ideas of the great Ukrainian coach Valeriy Lobanovskyi, who relied on the superior physical fitness of his players and the idea of 'controlled chaotic movement' for his greatest European victories.\" KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \"In a recent Knowledge, you made reference to Sunderland fans boycotting Sugar Puffs and Northern Rock because of their association with Newcastle,\" wrote Jon Malpass way back in 2006. \"Are there any other instances of companies losing money/sales/etc through their association with certain clubs?\" Everybody knows fans who proudly claim to avoid the products and services whose names adorn their rivals' shirts and stadia but, despite these boasts, evidence of companies actually losing money is scarce. Several of you, however, were quick to point out the unique situation with the Old Firm teams in Glasgow, who currently share the same sponsor: Carling. This all started in 1984, when a small glazing company called CR Smith decided to sponsor both teams, and did so with huge success. Three years later, however, Rangers switched to McEwan's, causing large sections of Celtic's support to stop drinking the beer \u2013 and several Celtic pubs to stop stocking it. The clubs eventually responded in 1999 by returning to shared sponsorship with NTL, and they have continued to stick with this system since. In Italy, meanwhile, a short-lived 'war of the cappuccino' broke out in Rome after Lazio bought Christian Vieri from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 1998. At the time, Lazio's president Sergio Cragnotti ran a food conglomerate called Cirio, which happened to raise its milk prices by about 3p per litre shortly after Vieri's arrival. Roma fans linked the two events \u2013 and were furious at what they perceived as being charged to fund Lazio's purchase. They responded by boycotting cappuccino, thereby reducing milk sales in the Italian capital. More recently, English readers will remember a significant number of Manchester United fans rejecting a number of brands for their continued association with the team after Malcolm Glazer's takeover. Vodafone did subsequently break its ties with the club, despite having time left on an existing contract, but the official reasoning for this was so that it could focus on Champions League sponsorship. Mars, meanwhile, scored a bit of an own goal back in 2006 with its 'Believe' campaign, which effectively supported England's bid to win the World Cup. \"Even though Believe was confined to England, the global playground conspired to enable semi-organised boycotts of the product in Scotland, Wales and, bizarrely, Spain,\" says Dr Paul Springer, author of the forthcoming book Ads to Icons. \"Unfortunately, after another meek exit, even the English were left to grumble 'they're not as big as they used to be'.\" For thousands more questions and answers, take a trip through the Knowledge archive Can you help? \"Fulham's game against Hamburg is apparently at risk due to the volcano in Iceland,\" writes Will Roome. \"Have any other matches fallen foul of volcanoes, earthquakes or other natural disasters?\" According to this article, published just prior to the player in question's move to Manchester United, Javier Hern\u00e1ndez's grandfather represented Mexico at the 1954 World Cup, and his father appeared at the 1986 World Cup,\" writes Cameron Mesnenor. \"Young Javier might very well represent his country in South Africa. Is there a previous case of three generations in one family all earning international caps or making appearances at World Cups?\" \"I was reading the Wikipedia page for Norwich legend Phil Boyer (as you do) and was struck by the factoid that he has the 'rare distinction' of having played over 100 league games for each of four different clubs,\" writes Jon Furner. \"I was wondering exactly how rare this distinction is?\" Send your questions and answers to knowledge@guardian.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
