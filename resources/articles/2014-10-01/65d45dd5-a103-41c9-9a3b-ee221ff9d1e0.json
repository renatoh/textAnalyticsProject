Now, 60 years on, an unpublished story by the late author in which James Bond takes on the Russians and gets involved in a Formula One race, is to form the basis for a new 007 novel by Anthony Horowitz. Murder on Wheels was written by Fleming in the 50s, as one of several episode treatments for a Bond TV series which fell through because the films took over. Many of the plots were turned into short stories including Octopussy, The Living Daylights and For Your Eyes Only, but a few outlines were never published, says Fleming\u2019s great-niece Jessie Grimond. Now, 50 years since the author\u2019s death, the Fleming estate has shown the material to Horowitz as the basis for a new novel. Horowitz, the screenwriter of series including Midsomer Murders and Foyle\u2019s War as well as the author of the hit teenage spy series Alex Rider and authorised takes on Sherlock Holmes, is the latest in a line of writers to don the mantle of Fleming with the estate\u2019s blessing. Predecessors include Sebastian Faulks, Jeffery Deaver and William Boyd, whose novels have variously seen Bond take on a heroin influx into Britain in the 60s, leap through time to the present day, and try to \u201csingle-handedly stop a civil war\u201d in a small west African nation. Horowitz, however, is the first writer to have been given unpublished material to work with. \u201cGiven that Anthony is as brilliant a screenwriter as he is a novelist, we thought it would be exciting to see what he would do with one [of the episodes],\u201d said Grimond. Horowitz plumped for a treatment called Murder on Wheels, which sees Bond on a mission at the N\u00fcrburgring racing circuit in Germany. \u201cIt\u2019s such a good idea. Ian loved cars and driving \u2013 he was friends with Stirling Moss, the Lewis Hamilton of the time,\u201d said Fleming\u2019s niece, Lucy Fleming. \u201cBond\u2019s mission is to make sure a Russian plot to scupper Moss\u2019s race by forcing him to crash is intercepted \u2026 there\u2019s a fantastic race Bond gets involved in.\u201d Bond is well known for his love of cars. In Casino Royale, Fleming wrote: \u201cBond\u2019s car was his only personal hobby. One of the last of the 4\u00bd-litre Bentleys with the supercharger by Amherst Villiers, he had bought it almost new in 1933 and had kept it in careful storage throughout the war \u2026 Bond drove it hard and well and with an almost sensual pleasure.\u201d Fleming\u2019s work will serve as the \u201cstarting point\u201d for Horowitz\u2019s novel, said the Fleming estate, with the book \u2013 currently known as Project One \u2013 to include the characters M and Miss Moneypenny and be set in the 50s. It will be published next September by Orion in the UK and HarperCollins in the US. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that Ian Fleming\u2019s extraordinary character has had a profound influence on my life, so when the estate approached me to write a new James Bond novel how could I possibly refuse?\u201d said Horowitz, a lifelong Bond fan. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge challenge \u2013 more difficult even than Sherlock Holmes in some ways \u2013 but having original, unpublished material by Fleming has been an inspiration. This is a book I had to write.\u201d Malcolm Edwards, group publisher at Orion, described Bond and Horowitz as \u201ca match made in publishing heaven\u201d. He added: \u201cAnthony is a writer of exceptional skill and I have no doubt he will deliver a book that will resonate and delight Bond fans around the globe.\u201d According to the Fleming estate, more than 100 million Bond books have been sold worldwide. Fleming himself wrote 14 Bond books \u2013 his last 007 title, Octopussy and The Living Daylights, was published in 1966. As well as Faulks, Deaver and Boyd, authors including Kingsley Amis and John Gardner have also written official Bond novels. The authorised Bond title will be the latest in a series of fresh takes on much-loved characters, from Sophie Hannah\u2019s riff on Poirot, The Monogram Murders, to Horowitz\u2019s Sherlock Holmes novel, House of Silk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
