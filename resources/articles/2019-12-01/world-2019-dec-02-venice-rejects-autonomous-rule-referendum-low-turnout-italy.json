Though the majority of those who did vote supported Venice separating from its mainland borough, Mestre, the referendum failed to reach the 50% threshold required for it to be valid. The vote was preceded by heated debates after devastating floods in November, and pro-separatists had anticipated a higher turnout. \u201cWe were expecting a much better result,\u201d said Marco Gasparinetti, who leads the Gruppo 25 Aprile activist group. \u201cWe\u2019ll now take some time to reflect to understand what we can do going forward for the good of our city.\u201d Those who campaigned for autonomy have pledged to appeal against the result, arguing that the quorum was illegitimate as the referendum was only consultative. The floods further exposed Venice\u2019s fragility, with separatists believing that the lagoon city would be better equipped to deal with its myriad problems by having control over its own affairs. Venice has 11 inhabited islands and was in control of its own administration until Benito Mussolini\u2019s fascist regime combined it with the industrial Mestre in 1926. The plan worked relatively well until Venice\u2019s population declined, Mestre\u2019s grew and money that was intended to preserve the former got diverted into developing the latter, bringing with it shopping centres and huge hotels. Venice\u2019s dwindling population remains one of its biggest concerns: it has fallen from about 175,000 in the postwar years to 55,000 today. Many people have been driven away by mass tourism and the recurrent aqua alta, or high water. Triple the number of people live in Mestre, a budget destination for tourists whose only aim is to see Venice. The latest referendum followed failed attempts to separate in 1989, 1994 and 2003. The Venice mayor, Luigi Brugnaro, was accused of trying to sabotage the vote by encouraging people to abstain. Nicola Pellicani, a parliamentarian with the centre-left Democratic party, who lives in Mestre, also opposed the referendum. He told the Guardian: \u201cThe outcome showed that the referendum was anachronistic. There is a lot of bad feeling in the historic centre towards the mayor but we can\u2019t split the city over this. We now need to focus on the mayoral elections in May and work towards building a strong alternative.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
