This is a juicy, unoaked Tempranillo with fresh, strawberry fruit and a nip of tannin. 2003 Capitel dei Nicolai Valpolicella Classico Superiore, Tedeschi (\u00a36.99, Sainsbury's) This ridiculously under-priced Italian red is rich, dry and concentrated with notes of tea leaves and dried fruits. The wine is deliciously balanced with a finish that lasts for minutes. 2003 Petalos del Bierzo, Descendientes de J Palacios (\u00a39.99, Corney &amp; Barrow, 020 7265 2400) Made entirely from the little-known Mencia grape in the wilds of north-west Spain, this is a spicy, old-vine red that reminded me of Cote Rotie. It's peppery, concentrated and nicely oaked with flavours of plums and blackberries. 2001 Bowen Estate Coonawarra Shiraz (\u00a313.99, The Australian Wine Club, 0800 856 2004; www.australianwine.co.uk) Doug Bowen makes some of the most elegant wines in Australia. This finely crafted, scented, complex, age-worthy Shiraz disproves the theory that Coonawarra is better suited to Bordeaux varieties like Cabernet Sauvignon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
