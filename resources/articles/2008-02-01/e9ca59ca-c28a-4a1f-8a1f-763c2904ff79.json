But with [Didier] Drogba, [Michael] Essien, [Salomon] Kalou back in contention, Chelsea are back to their true strength. It will be interesting to see what condition the players return from the African Cup of Nations. \"Now Avram Grant has to face a very interesting issue: Drogba or [Nicolas] Anelka, or both? They are rather similar, in terms of qualities and position on the pitch, each of them a centre-forward. I'm sure it's a welcome problem for Avram and a major problem for the Olympiakos defenders. \"It's huge boost to have Frank Lampard and John Terry back. Lampard's goals are so important to Chelsea, as he again proved on Saturday.\" Liverpool v Internazionale \"Liverpool were knocked out of the FA Cup by a shock Barnsley win but such things happen in football and will have little bearing on the Inter clash. \"In Europe Liverpool play very much on the strengths and weaknesses of the opposition. They study their opponents in detail and we can expect a very tactical game at Anfield. Normally Liverpool are dangerous at home, they hardly give anything away, let alone concede a goal. \"But Inter are having a great season, they are one of the very best in Europe now. We are in for a high-speed match because Inter are masters of the sudden counter. [Zlatan] Ibrahimovic is their point of reference, he can hold the ball up front while everybody pushes forward, with [Julio] Cruz, [David] Suazo and the rest. \"To see Ibrahimovic in action at Anfield and to watch [Fernando] Torres against the Inter defenders will be very interesting. Liverpool in Europe are always a tough proposition. They can play with a different level of concentration and determination from what they produce in the Premier League.\" Arsenal v Milan \"Since the draw I've felt that Milan could not have got a worse proposition than Arsenal. I believe that at this time Arsenal are one of the very top teams in Europe. They combine great quality with great speed. They will be very different from the team beaten 4-0 at Old Trafford at the weekend. \"United prevented [Cesc] F\u00e1bregas from having any effect, a key factor for their dominance. But [Emmanuel] Adebayor, [Mathieu] Flamini and [Ga\u00ebl] Clichy will be back against Milan, for a very different Arsenal. We know that Milan can rise to the challenge in crucial matches but this is a very difficult moment to face Arsenal. \"Arsenal defend with 10 men and attack with six. They are a very organised side, full of talented players. If you leave them any space, they counter-attack with four to five players at such pace that the opposition cannot figure out what's hitting them. \"Milan can count on their huge experience and, as I've said, they always give their best and more on such occasions. But to have a chance with Arsenal they'll have to be in top physical condition. They will need their quality players in their best form and it is vital for the likes of Kaka and [Clarence] Seedorf to recover in time. They will need a strong midfield to face Arsenal and [Andrea] Pirlo is a must. If Pato recovers in time it will be a big bonus for them. \"Arsenal have Adebayor on extra-ordinary form but the whole team play great football. Milan will have to endeavour to score an away goal, which would give them a boost for the return leg at the San Siro. \"Both Arsenal and Milan play a very technical game, centred on possession and team organisation. As soon as Arsenal win the ball back they dash forward with great passing and deft touches. But Milan too can play great possession and it will be a massive match.\" Lyon v Manchester United \"It will not be an easy game for United because Lyon are a tough team. After an uncertain start to the season Lyon are back to their form in the French league and are not easy to beat. \"I know Manchester United are after the Champions League, particularly in the season of the 50th anniversary of the Munich tragedy. I was at Old Trafford for the derby against City and I could sense that the very moving ceremony before the kick-off affected the United players deeply. \"It happens like this, in football. There are emotions so strong that you cannot get back to business as usual, however you may want to. But United have shown their outstanding recovery abilities against Arsenal, even without players such as [Cristiano] Ronaldo and [Carlos] Tevez. \"Manchester United managed to do to Arsenal what Tottenham did in the League Cup - with a determined pressing game, not conceding spaces, not letting them play and attacking them at every opportunity. If United keep their concentration and play to their best, they can go all the way in Europe.\" Roma v Real Madrid \"It's a very exciting clash. Real will not have Robinho, a major loss to them. He's the one who's made the difference over the last few matches. \"We'll have to wait and see what kind of performance Roma can produce, their record so far has not been good in these top encounters, and they'd better watch out for the Real Madrid counter attacks. \"Real Madrid have fully recovered their winning mentality. It happened over the last 12 games of last season, now they are doing great, and I congratulate them. \"Roma have to realise that you have to play the round over two matches, they have quality player who can play at high tempo and can surprise the Spanish champions. Both teams have special players capable of special feats, there is quality on both sides.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
