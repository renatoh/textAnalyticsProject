I\u2019m not here trying to burn a bra or anything and say: \u2018We need to take over,\u2019 but give credit where it\u2019s due.\u201d The England and Manchester City goalkeeper \u2013 who was rested from Friday\u2019s 1-0 victory over Argentina \u2013 sometimes suspects that patronising comments about the supposed limitations of her female counterparts are really a form of shorthand for dismissing the entire women\u2019s game. \u201cIt\u2019s just a bit of a cop-out, isn\u2019t it, just an easy way out,\u201d says the 34-year-old, who was born and raised in Santa Monica. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve seen my share of bad goalkeeping. I\u2019ve had my moments too. But I\u2019ve also seen some excellent female goalkeeping. \u201cIt does frustrate me; it makes me think: \u2018Come on, let\u2019s see you do better.\u2019 It would be fun to get the general population doing stuff with us. To say: \u2018If you think it\u2019s so easy, get in goal.\u201d Bardsley, who opted to represent England because of family connections in Stockport, believes mixed education is the way to eradicate such prejudice. \u201cFemale goalkeepers are seen as equals in academies now,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to set a good example for the younger boys so they\u2019re used to seeing us women around, making great saves and scoring great goals. Just normalising the idea of women playing football is a massive part of what we need to do.\u201d As befits a highly articulate product of California State University, where she majored in graphic design, Bardsley has a compelling blueprint for change. \u201cBoys and girls should play alongside each other in academies [at professional clubs],\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019ve done it in the past but health and safety have stepped in and stopped us. But I did it when I was growing up in the US. I trained alongside full-grown men at college and worked with some great male keepers. It helped me 100% with speed of play, speed of reactions and strength. The mindset they gave me was invaluable. \u201cIf you speak to girls who play football alongside lads they\u2019ll tell you that you almost have to earn the right to play with them. It\u2019s annoying that you have to do that, but once you\u2019ve done it the barriers are down.\u201d Technically, the differences between the sexes are perhaps surprisingly small. \u201cTypically, male goalkeepers play a bit higher,\u201d she says. \u201cTheir reaction speed in terms of angles and parrying shots means they\u2019ll probably be three yards further out than us. But, technically, the set positions are just the same.\u201d Chelsea\u2019s manager, Emma Hayes, has reopened a long-running debate about whether female goalkeepers\u2019 invariably smaller stature dictates that the frames of their goals should be contracted. \u201cWhat are the social implications?\u201d says Bardsley. \u201cWe\u2019ve fought so hard to change the perception of female athletes across the planet and I don\u2019t know that it would be beneficial.\u201d Hers is a powerful, distinctive voice epitomised by the opening exchanges to this interview with a handful of journalists on the Normandy coast. KB: \u201cBonjour, tout le monde. Are we good?\u201d Press: \u201cYes, Deauville\u2019s a nice town KB: \u201cIt looks like a fake town, doesn\u2019t it? Something out of Disneyland or Bicester Village \u2026 But how are we all?\u201d Press: \u201cGood\u201d KB: \u201cFeel the energy! Gooood!\u201d Now at her third World Cup, she feels higher value should be placed on keepers of both sexes. \u201cThe constant message I heard growing up was: \u2018If you\u2019re unfit you go in goal,\u2019 or: \u2018If you\u2019re crap you go in goal.\u2019 How do we change that, how do we give goalkeeping more respect? \u201cPeople have to realise the game has changed loads. Look at Ederson, Alisson and the impacts they\u2019ve made by playing out, but also being good shot stoppers and having a presence. It\u2019s an impactful position now. \u201cIt\u2019s about how you influence the back four, how you communicate with those in front of you. Essentially you\u2019re a defensive pivot.\u201d Phil Neville\u2019s determination to transform England into a slick\u2011passing, ball-monopolising side involves considerable building from the back, with Bardsley and her colleagues sometimes expected to serve almost as sweeper-keepers. Significant emphasis is placed on their footwork. \u201cThe longer we can dictate that possession the more momentum we can create and the more opportunities we\u2019ll get in the final third,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be doing keepy-ups or anything like that in my box, but if I\u2019m needed as an outlet then I\u2019m there for it.\u201d She suspects her role\u2019s continuing evolution has not been matched by a wider appreciation of its nuances. \u201cJournalists and pundits need to become more aware of the intricacies of good goalkeeping,\u201d says Bardsley, before smiling to herself. It is the cue for her to issue the small gathering of reporters \u2013 assembled before Carly Telford wore the gloves against Argentina \u2013 an invitation to join her for some specialist training before Wednesday\u2019s final Group D game against Japan in Nice. It is an overture no one has, as yet, dared accept."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
