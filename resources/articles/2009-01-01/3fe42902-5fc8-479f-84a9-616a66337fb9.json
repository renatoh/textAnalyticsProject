Or maybe not. In fact it was - gasp - FIFA 2009, with sales of 2 million in the UK. Impressive stuff and deserved too - FIFA 2009 is a leap forward for the series, especially online. Bear in mind though, those 2 million sales were on multi-format. The biggest selling single format title was the slightly underwhelming Mario Kart Wii. Other big sellers include Call of Duty: World at War, GTA: IV, Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games and er, Carnival Funfair. The latter two, along with Mario Kart, will probably still be selling big throughout 2009 as well. Damn Nintendo and their chart-hogging format. Anyway, surprised by any of the games on the best seller list? Or maybe by some that didn't make it?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
