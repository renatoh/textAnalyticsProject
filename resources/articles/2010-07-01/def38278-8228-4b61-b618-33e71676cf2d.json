Out, so it seemed, was the divisive tub-thumping positioning, along with the legislate-first-think-later style of government. In its place was the prospect of cross-party public administration which was deliberative, consultative and calm. No Conservative seemed more in tune with the new times than Michael Gove. What a shame, then, that the same Mr Gove was yesterday defending a decision to ram schools reforms through without full parliamentary scrutiny on the basis that Labour had once displayed similar haste. The education secretary's bill will allow schools to turn themselves into academies without consulting the council. Where the issue is the removal of extra-parliamentary consultation it is surely especially important for ministers to provide the time for a thoroughgoing consultation with parliament itself. Yet instead of a white paper, which invites responses on detailed proposals and gives the select committee time to get its teeth into principles, we have a bill which may be law before Mr Gove has even met that committee. And instead of line-by-line scrutiny in a standing committee \u2013 with scope to consider representations, and time for parliamentary alliances to be formed \u2013 the detailed drafting of the law will be finessed on the floor of the House, a procedure ordinarily reserved for responding to emergencies. The only emergency concerns the hasty promise to get extra academies on the road in time for the new school year. No wonder Mr Gove's customary charm wore thin yesterday, as he struck a shrill note \u2013 suggesting that the heated debate that took place during the election campaign was a substitute for cool scrutiny now. He is quite right to say many of the issues have been well-rehearsed, but quite wrong if he thinks this is a reason to rush. On the substance of the proposal, there are reasoned positions on both sides. Mr Gove cites intriguing evidence about schools which have raised their game on gaining independence, and he is also sincere (if optimistic) in his conviction that independence works to the benefit of the poor. His critics, by contrast, have all sorts of well-researched worries about a world of free schools \u2013 worries about shared services, worries about special needs and worries about the potential for schools that make their own admissions to become elitist. In place of the devil of discord, it ought to be possible to find the angel of reconciliation by brokering over the detail. Instead, proposals with complex effects are being rammed through at break-neck speed. And the devil is very possibly lurking in the absence of detail."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
