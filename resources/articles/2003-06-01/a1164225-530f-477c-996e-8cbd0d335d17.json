The England captain has been linked with a move away from Old Trafford on and off for the last few months, even though he has pledged his loyalty to the club he joined as a trainee in 1991. Laporta is one of the six candidates for the Barcelona presidency in the elections that will be held on June 15 and is hoped to be voted in if he could pull off such a transfer coup. \"I cannot deny that we have presented a project to Manchester to sign David Beckham and briefly we will comment what the situation is,\" Laporta told a press conference called to discuss his presidency bid. \"At the moment I cannot say anything more but I trust that we can sign him.\" Laporta is certain his bid for the presidency will be successful even though he finished behind Lluis Bassat when candidates were shortlisted. \"We are firm candidates to win the elections for our project and the team and because we are the change that Barca needs,\" Laporta added. Laporta said he was \"waiting for news in the coming days\" on Beckham after also revealing a deal to take Turkey goalkeeper Rustu Recber to the Nou Camp if he wins the elections has been \"signed and closed\". Laporta claimed it would not be easy to complete the signing of the England captain, who would command a fee of around \u00a330m if United were prepared to sell him. And interestingly he claimed Barcelona could have competition for Beckham's signature, adding: \"Dealing with a world-class player there are always going to be other clubs interested in him.\" The man who will be Laporta's sporting director if he is elected, Sandro Rossell, added that the project \"was liked\" by Manchester United because \"they believe it is solid\". Moreover, he believes the conversations \"are going well\" and that the issue will be concluded \"certainly before next season\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
