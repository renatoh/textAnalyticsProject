The broadcaster, which has an impressive record of attracting high audiences for its US imports, has snapped up the UK rights to legal drama The Lyon's Den before it has even opened on American TV. In it, Rob Lowe plays a lawyer who is offered a partnership at a prestigious law firm after the suspicious suicide of one of the firm's partners. \"I am delighted to have signed up The Lyon's Den at the recent screenings. It's a good addition to CSI and all the other US shows we've got,\" said Five's director of acquisitions, Jeff Ford. \"The Lyon's Den is all about quality and good acting. It's got great talent in front of and behind the camera.\" Mr Ford is hoping to recreate the success of CSI: Crime Scene Investigates, which he bought after having seen only a pilot, and which now regularly pulls in more than 2 million viewers - more than the West Wing manages on Channel 4. Set in Las Vegas, it focuses on a team of scientists and technicians who collect and analyse forensic evidence, and regularly beats shows on Channel 4 and BBC2. US legal drama Law and Order also has a loyal following on Five, which recently snapped up the rights to Channel 4's cult hit Dawson's Creek and Alias, a US spy drama series that also made its terrestrial debut on Channel 4. Lowe quit the West Wing last year amid rumours that he was unhappy that his co-stars earned more than him. The award-winning show, based around a fictional US president called Josiah Bartlett, revived the actor's career after a decade of anonymity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
