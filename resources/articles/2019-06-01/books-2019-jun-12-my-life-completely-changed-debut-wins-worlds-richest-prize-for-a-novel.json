The 33-year-old debut novelist says she kept thinking she must have misunderstood or hallucinated the news. \u201cI didn\u2019t speak at first, then I reacted with great joy, but then I also felt really uncertain,\u201d she says. \u201cI couldn\u2019t really believe it had happened. It was just a quiet little moment in the grass with my baby and my life was completely changed.\u201d Ruskovich\u2019s first novel, Idaho, had won a prize awarded to writers including Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk and last year\u2019s winner, Irish novelist Mike McCormack. Public libraries around the world nominate their favourite novels to form a very long longlist (141 books this year). Idaho was put forward for the prize by just one library: a branch in Bruges, Belgium. Set in the mountains where Ruskovich herself grew up, Idaho tells of a mother who kills her younger daughter with an axe while the family is chopping logs in a clearing. But the judges said the book was no thriller, rather that it \u201cgradually uncovers the psychological abysses that would explain the inexplicable\u201d. \u201cThe deed remains the deed, and the murderous evil of it stays ambivalent and mysterious to the end,\u201d they said, as they announced its victory from a shortlist that included the Booker-winning Lincoln in the Bardo by George Saunders. \u201cEmpathy and love stand next to cruelty and crime. Individual guilt, trauma and pain are looming as large as eventual forgiveness and the ability to live in half-knowledge. Ultimately, Idaho evolves into a masterpiece on the redeeming and regenerative potential of music, poetry, literature and art.\u201d Ruskovich says the crime at the heart of the novel stems from an uncanny experience she had while cutting firewood with her parents. After arriving at a clearing where \u201ceverything was beautiful, and there was the sound of grasshoppers and crows sunning themselves on the logs\u201d, she immediately had \u201cthis intense feeling of grief as if the place itself had a memory and I had just stepped into the memory. \u201cI just knew something terrible happened there. I\u2019ve never had an experience like that in my life. I\u2019ve received feelings from different places but this was different. My parents said it was like I was in a mild trance that whole day, they could tell something was wrong with me. I couldn\u2019t get it out of my system so writing the novel was the process of figuring out what I imagined had happened in that place,\u201d she says. Ruskovich grew up in the Idaho Panhandle, on Hoodoo Mountain, with her family living for a time in tents. Like the characters in her book, it was \u201cvery, very rural\u201d, with an hour\u2019s drive to high school every morning. \u201cIt\u2019s like nowhere on earth. It\u2019s very beautiful but I do feel there are so many sinister pockets in Idaho, including the place I grew up,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was a wonderful place to grow up, so intense and vivid \u2026 but all around our loving family property there were pockets of poison, lots of backwoods, dangerous people. Good people, too, but we were robbed many times. It was kind of a scary place to grow up when I think back on it.\u201d Winning the International Dublin award, she says, will mean she can \u201creturn much more vigorously to my writing\u201d. She and her husband recently moved from the \u201cghost town\u201d of Idaho City to Boise, where she teaches creative writing while writing fiction. \u201cIt\u2019s such a shocking amount of money to have won! I can\u2019t believe there is a prize like this for a single novel. I don\u2019t know exactly what I\u2019ll do with it but I feel I can now make choices that will ultimately really benefit my writing,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been the biggest honour of my life having a book out in the world and having readers.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
