World football's governing body said in a statement: \"Fifa fully acknowledges the significance of the poppy appeal and the ways in which it helps commemorate Remembrance Day.\" But on wearing poppies on shirts, they said: \"Players' equipment are that they should not carry any political, religious or commercial messages. The same regulations are applied globally, and uniformly, in the event of similar requests by other nations to commemorate historical events.\" The FA are still talking to Fifa and have not ruled out being allowed to wear the Armistice Day emblem. An FA spokesperson said: \"We are still in dialogue with Fifa and have not completely [written off] the possibility of poppies being allowed on the kit on Saturday. Their training kit will carry the emblems and this will be auctioned off with the proceeds going to the armed forces.\" The Poppy Appeal, which is in its 90th year, is run by the Royal British Legion. A spokesman for the charity said: \"We appreciate that showing support is not always possible under some regulations and we would never seek to impose ourselves in these situations.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
