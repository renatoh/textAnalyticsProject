The ground was little more than half full yesterday, and not just because punters were put off by the \u00a325 ticket price, steep considering that no county sees more rain than Glamorgan. The forecast had predicted cloud cover and drizzle by the afternoon, but it was gloomy only in the England dressing room as Wales strutted to victory with 51 balls to spare. Last week, Glamorgan had been plundered for 438 by Surrey in the C&amp;G Trophy and eight of that side were on duty yesterday: two of the changes fortified their bowling attack with the South African all-rounder Jacques Kallis included on the grounds he had played for the Welsh county in 1999, and the Somerset seamer Steffan Jones. Nick Knight and Trescothick opened for England. Knight played a lazy shot to Kallis before Trescothick, having hit the first four balls of Andrew Davies's fifth over to the boundary, perished at third man trying to make it five. And there was always Darren Thomas to come on. The bowler had been slogged into history by Surrey five days before, nine overs disappearing for 108. His first five overs that day cost 70 runs but at the end of his first spell yesterday his figures read 5-1-12-2 with Michael Vaughan and Graham Thorpe disbelieving victims. Thomas did make amends with his next over, his last of the innings, which went for 12, but by then England's only one stand of note, between Andy Flintoff and Alec Stewart, had ended thanks to a superb catch by another one of Glamorgan's England discards, Matthew Maynard, and 189 for nine was a poor return even if the wicket's bounce was variable. Hoggard started by trying to take Croft's head off but succeeded only in overstepping. His third over lasted 10 balls and cost 24 runs. Croft hit the first four deliveries to the boundary. He quickly departed for 30 off 26 balls but the damage had been done. Steve James and David Hemp added 132 for the second wicket at a leisurely pace to leave Kallis with a walk-on role two overs from the end. It was a day when the winners, Kallis excepted, would have preferred to have been in the losers' dressing room. Croft, ostracised since turning down an invitation to tour India last winter, said: \"It was strange preparing for this game because passionate Welshman though I am, my ambition since boyhood has been to play for England.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
