Thumped 5-0 by Arsenal in their next game, Joe Royle's team have slid inexorably out of the light and into the undergrowth where they continue to scuffle about with increasing uncertainty, their legs entangled and their brains befuddled. This was a truly awful match, redeemed in the eyes of Southampton by one touch of real class from Dan Petrescu. Glenn Hoddle's views on certain aspects of life may be peculiar but there is no doubting his ability to organise a side, and City had neither the wit nor the quality to turn matters round after the Romanian's delightful volley. Royle's sides are never short on effort, and he did win the FA Cup while at Goodison Park, but there appears something antique about Royle's methods now. Of the teams promoted last season, City were clearly the least able of the three, and it is of no surprise that they have struggled. Their one player of genuine class is Andrei Kanchelskis who, although long past his prime, remains capable of inflicting damage, provided somebody gives him the ball in the right area. City have no such midfielder, consequently Kanchelskis finds himself marginalised, particularly at Maine Road where Royle's team have lost nine times this season. Forced to attack, City flounder and become increasingly susceptible at the back. \"Two strikes against us in 180 minutes and no points,\" grumbled Royle, in reference to both this match and the previous 1-0 home defeat by Tottenham. Their own 1-0 win at Newcastle had infused City's long-suffering fans with a cautious optimism, which quickly evaporated in the face of excellent goalkeeping by Paul Jones and a towering performance in the centre of defence by Dean Richards. And even when Petrescu clearly handled the ball in the second half, no penalty was given, with the referee Jeff Winter unsighted and his assistant similarly so. \"I always felt they didn't believe they could get the result,\" said Hoddle. \"They keep getting a glimmer of light but it's all about getting a couple of back-to-back wins.\" City have managed that once this season, against Southampton and Bradford City, and time is fast running out. After the unexpected three-point bonus at St James' Park, this was to have been the start of a run of seemingly productive matches for Royle's team, against Southampton and Aston Villa at home, Bradford City and Everton away. It is now doubly essential that they win away against Bradford a week on Saturday. With nine matches remaining, five of them away, City cannot be written off, although it is difficult to be optimistic after this disjointed, uninspiring performance. Royle insists that morale has never been a problem, which may be true, but lack of talent clearly is. Royle's admission that \"at times we've lacked a bit of guile\" was simply preposterous. There was no guile whatever in this game. Essentially there was little to choose between City and Southampton. The difference was that Hoddle made far better use of his limited resources within a framework his team were comfortable with. Royle, faced with a building collapsing in the wind, seems capable only of blaming the weather. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
