In a sensational debut season, he missed out on the drivers' championship and was the most popular and beloved sportsman in the country. Now, after an even more impressive follow-up year, he looks set to win the thing - all the more so when he went seven points clear in the championship at Singapore last weekend - and no one seems all that bothered. Odds are that, even if he does become the first Briton to take the title in more than a decade, he'll be beaten to BBC Sports Personality of the Year by a Mansfield swimmer no one had heard of until six weeks ago. Even as the formula one season reaches a climax, it's hard to avoid the ambivalence towards Hamilton. Some have gone off him a bit, others have stopped noticing him. I'm sure he hasn't changed from the fresh-faced rookie of last year, the real person whose humble backstory, down-to-earth approach and boyish enthusiasm for cars we could all relate to. He's probably still as caring a son, as devoted a brother, as passionate a sportsman. And he is a better driver than ever. So where has our creeping apathy come from? You don't have to look any further than formula one's patent-approved, tried-and-tested personality-leaching machine. You could see it at work on Hamilton from the very start of the year, starting with his decision to move to the incomparably rock 'n roll nation of Switzerland (because, lest we forget, he was getting too much sass from shoppers in Stevenage supermarkets). Quickly, he lost the ability to say anything interesting in public and the mischievous side that we glimpsed last year - even his sense of humour - seemed to die by the day. There's something impressively clinical in the way modern-day formula one sucks the colour and character out of its stars. And this in a sport that once boasted more playboys than a Hugh Hefner stag weekend. Since the 1990s - under the influence of the relentless and robotic Michael Schumacher - the devil-may-care image of motorsport has been replaced with a bland new world of corporate sheen. Formula one drivers - men who can out-gadget James Bond - now seem to have all the sex appeal of high street accountants. Serious, hardworking and well paid, yes; likely to get the blood pumping, no. With so much money at their disposal and so very many supermodels, helicopters and casinos to spend it on, you'd think these men would make fascinating public figures. Notwithstanding tales of Kimi Raikkonen pulling his trousers down in nightclubs, watch his press conferences and you'd think he spends his evenings reading the train timetable. I'm not saying that we want him getting his kicks in public. Just to be reminded that these commercial frontmen have a human side. Even the \"bad boy\" of the track, Fernando Alonso, seems to have succumbed to industrial torpor - there's been nary a peep out of him all year. Other sports are making their stars more personable, and trying to create engaging role models, but formula one drivers are happy to remain distant and cold. I know it's not all their own fault. Those helmets, for instance, don't help. How can you feel close to a sportsman when he spends more screen-time behind his tinted visor than Darth Vader? Sports lovers are an emotional bunch, we like to see our heroes grunting with effort, wincing in pain, even crying, dammit! Hamilton could be having a nervous breakdown beneath that helmet and we'd never know. I blame the protectionism of Bernie Ecclestone's travelling circus and the mentality of the triple-glazed, electric-fenced, shoot-on-sight paddock. Every part of the formula one experience is handed to us sterilised and hermetically sealed; every driver appearance is a climate-controlled commercial exercise. It's not just that this show is run by control freaks who don't want us to see how it all works. There's a real whiff - detectable even from the TV - of patronage; that this sport is being played by and for a breed more rarefied, and wealthier, than us, and we should be grateful to be allowed to watch along on our plebeian televisions. I really love motorsport. I even love formula one. But I wish it would get down from its pedestal and start acting like it was made of a piece with the rest of us. In MotoGP Valentino Rossi - one of the highest-earning sportsmen in the world - saturates his sport with his vivacious, volatile, slightly mad personality, and is adored for it. Maybe once Hamilton has this championship safely stowed, we could see him take a real risk - and let his hair down."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
