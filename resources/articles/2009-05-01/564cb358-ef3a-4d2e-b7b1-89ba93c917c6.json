Two, because more than ever Sir Alex Ferguson needed a deep reservoir of talent to hold off the Anfield revival, Chelsea's wealth and power and the fragile beauty of Arsenal. An Arsenal side, that is, who threatened to send United to Hull and back next weekend in pursuit of Ferguson's 11th Premier League honour. If relief swept Old Trafford at the end of an artless game it was because a defeat to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's men might have forced the defending champions to travel to the KC Stadium on Sunday in need of a point, four days before a Champions League final against Barcelona in Rome. United's cathedral was in triumphalist mode long before this anxiety-ridden 0-0 draw. Fans arrived in Roman centurion hats and verses of Que Sera, Sera floated through the stands. But the final conquest was about as clear-cut as Carlos Tevez's answer to a question from Sky about whether he wanted to remain a United player next year. \"Very difficult\", smiled El Apache, in his Argentina shirt. The story of United's campaign, though, is not the loss of talent but its relentless acquisition, as Gary Neville testified on the pitch. Neville spoke of \"the quality and depth of the team, all 20 players\", and pointed out that Federico Macheda, the 17-year-old Italian super-sub, \"could have won the league for us, and he's not even getting a medal today\". The big-match stalwarts of Ferguson's latest creation have carried them over the line, as big-match stalwarts always do. Edwin van der Sar, Patrice Evra the centre-half pairing of Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand (injured yesterday), Cristiano Ronaldo, Darren Fletcher, Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney: these were the prime-time warriors in a season when United, curiously, won only one of their six games against fellow members of the league's immutable Big Four. Around this core spun a constellation of older heads (Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes et al) and understudies who will offer imperilled Hull no rest on Sunday. Tevez is generally one of those invaluable back-up men, as are Park Ji-sung , Anderson, John O'Shea, Nani, Danny Welbeck and the precocious Macheda, whose stunning late goal in the 3-2 win over Aston Villa on 5 April helped jolt United out of a trough. Six days later Macheda struck again in a 2-1 win at Sunderland. The debate about which has been the finest of Ferguson's championship-winning teams will fill the hours on flights to Rome. But this is surely his best and most well-balanced squad: a fact that reflects clever planning and the immense wealth of the club. This was United's 64th game of the season. A weaker squad might have buckled under the pressure of Liverpool's pursuit. Here we see the value of investing in young talent as well as of late-season experience. United have won 18 of their last 21 Premier League matches while scooping up the Carling Cup and a place in the final of the European Cup, which they won in Moscow last year. You wait 26 years for a league title and 11 come along at once. United's walk through the wilderness was even longer than the minimum 20 years Liverpool will have spent watching rivals claim a prize that was once on permanent show at Anfield. Coronation No18 was the one Sir Alex Ferguson has worked towards since he took his Aberdeen team to Liverpool in the 1980s and witnessed their power. Recently he recalled: \"We were sitting in the dressing room at half-time, 2-0 down, and one of my players said: 'Come on lads, two quick goals and we're back in it.' They'd only conceded 19 goals in three years at home. It was a great Liverpool team then.\" Aberdeen lost 4-0. Cut to yesterday, where United finished playing 4-5-1, with Ronaldo alone up front, to resist strong Arsenal pressure. Crushed, like Wenger's team in the title race, is all talk of retirement. Ferguson threatened to go on for five more years and is clearly animated by the thought of inflicting a 19th league title win on Liverpool. \"It'll make it more special if we get in front of them,\" he said. \"We've got a young team, and next year we're going to go for it again.\" Amusingly, he picked out the 1-0 win at Stoke on Boxing Day as a turning point. United had just returned from winning the Club World Cup in Japan, after which their supporters had chanted \"bring on the Martians\". Only a first-team squad assembled over many years and with great skill could have advanced so successfully on so many fronts. Ferguson affirmed that point after yesterday's game, declaring: \"I could have picked two teams today.\" Now we await Liverpool's response. The pendulum shifted Manchester's way almost as soon as Kenny Dalglish's side had won the last of the Anfield club's 18 titles, 19 years ago this month. Graeme Souness's three-year reign greased the chute, and not only because he sold the story of his triple heart bypass to The Sun in an article that appeared on the third anniversary of the Hillsborough disaster. On the Kop, those days are synonymous with Paul Stewart and Torben Piechnik. And while Michael Owen, Steve McManaman, Robbie Fowler and Steven Gerrard all emerged in the 1990s, Liverpool fans also have sharp memories of Julian Dicks, Neil Ruddock, Oyvind Leonhardsen, Phil Babb and the infamous Sean Dundee (five games, no goals), regarded by many as the all-time biggest Liverpool dud. Since the last of the Boot Room boys (Roy Evans), Liverpool have tried to rebuild through the mass importation of French (G\u00e9rard Houllier) and Spanish (Rafa Ben\u00edtez) expertise. They are closer than ever to returning to the summit but will have to make the right moves in the transfer market this summer to cancel out the improvements United themselves are bound to make. Through all those 19 years, United have built a succession of title-winning sides, all of which evolved into the next one, as Liverpool's used to do. Between 1991-92, for example, Ferguson bought Peter Schmeichel from Brondby, Steve Bruce from Norwich, Dennis Irwin from Oldham and Eric Cantona from Leeds while the FA Youth Cup winning golden generation were fed into the first XI. Then came Roy Keane, Ferdinand, Ruud van Nistelrooy, Rooney, Carrick, Vidic and so on. These acquisitions have formed an almost perfect continuum. Ryan Giggs was there in 1993, when United ended a 26-year wait for the title, and he was there again yesterday, slower, greyer and with a hint of a bald patch around his crown, but no less integral to the team's evolution over a decade and a half. By the end, the world's fastest man, Usain Bolt, whose global profile is probably higher even than Ronaldo's, was holding a camcorder to his own delighted face. Twenty-four hours after teaching Ronaldo how to run better, Bolt radiated the innocent joy of a schoolboy seeing wonders for the first time. This is some spell for Ferguson to have cast over 23 years, and there is still the biggest clash of all to come in Rome. To Liverpool fans, of course, it is a diabolical brand of magic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
