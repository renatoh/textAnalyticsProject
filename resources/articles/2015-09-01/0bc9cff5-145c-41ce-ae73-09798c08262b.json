The midfielder has looked a shadow of his former self in recent weeks and Advocaat is at pains to stress it was the board\u2019s decision to award him a new contract in the summer. \u201cI see Cattermole just as all the other players, part of the squad,\u201d said the Sunderland manager. \u201cThe club made the decision to award him a new contract. He is from the region and did really well for me last season. When they asked me about him, I said if we can keep him, let\u2019s do it. But the final decision was that of the club.\u201d That represents quite a departure from a few months ago when the former Holland manager described a highly influential dressing-room figure as \u201cour controller\u201d. Now, though, Cattermole appears in danger of losing his place to the former France defensive midfielder and Rubin Kazan loanee, Yann M\u2019Vila. \u201cCattermole has to find last season\u2019s form,\u201d said Advocaat whose bottom-placed side seek their first league win of the season at home to Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday. \u201cBut it\u2019s not just him, the majority of the team has to perform better. It\u2019s not only about Cattermole.\u201d Last month Sunderland\u2019s manager cut an extremely unhappy figure as he fretted publicly about the weakness of his squad. Since then the arrival of, among others, the \u00a37m forward Fabio Borini from Liverpool has improved his mood but Advocaat is under no illusions as to the team\u2019s enduring limitations. \u201cOur first priority is to avoid relegation,\u201d he said. \u201cOur squad is better than last season but from what I have seen from other clubs and their spending, other clubs are better too. Advocaat has warned Sunderland fans that patience could well be required and any improvement incremental. \u201cI don\u2019t think the league table really takes shape until the end of December,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s when we\u2019ll know where we are. It may be the end of December before you see the best of Sunderland. \u201cAt certain moments I believe we can play a little more attractive football than last season but, knowing what other clubs have done, staying away from relegation is the most important thing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
