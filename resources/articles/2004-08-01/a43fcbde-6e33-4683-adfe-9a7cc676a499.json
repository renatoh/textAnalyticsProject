There's no shortage of protests on single issues or denunciations in letters columns, but little sense of any more general engagement between local people and local political parties. Most of us don't want to participate; most of us don't want to vote. Parliamentary byelections, which used to be the occasion for boisterous local involvement, now attract a pittance of voters: even contests where the outcome is in real doubt, such as Leicester South, where the seat changed hands on a turnout hardly above 40%, are now a minority sport. And as central government gradually sucks the purpose out of local government, the local political battle is doomed to remain a sad and shrivelled affair. So it's poignant to have reacquired a book I bought when it first appeared in 1970, and have pined for now and then since a \"friend\" purloined it: The Other Oxford, by Charles Fenby, which deals with an era when local politics frequently raged and sizzled. It starts with the Oxford election of 1880, when the level of jiggery pokery, always high in Oxford, soared to a mark that led to the unseating of the successful Tory and the suspension of the writ, meaning that Oxford was forced to do without an MP for five years. To their credit, the Tories made little attempt to conceal the tricks they'd been up to. Asked to produce the receipts for the party's spending, their principal agent said he'd had them destroyed as they'd probably have confirmed \"quasi-corrupt\" practices. None of the accounts during his stewardship had ever been anywhere near accurate. Indeed, he proudly claimed, he had never fought a pure election in Oxford. But Fenby's story is mainly concerned with a father and son: Walter Gray, who built the Tory party in Oxford, and Frank, who destroyed its hegemony. The party's day-to-day affairs were run by two lawyers who, though partners, had long since ceased to speak to each other, and communicated through their long-suffering managing clerk. Walter Gray was the master manipulator, who undermined the Liberals' standing in the city by destroying a Liberal-dominated savings bank. In the following crash, its chairman, a Liberal alderman, killed himself. He was one of the best men who ever lived, Walter Gray later said. The book's hero, though - and he is a hero to Fenby, despite his talent for bending and breaking rules, and despite their eventual falling-out - is Frank Gray, a studied eccentric and showman who lived in style at Shipton, a few miles out of the city, in a house of which one wing was used to accommodate tramps. (Gray was devoted to tramps and in the interests of empathy spent a time on the road himself.) Large numbers of guests were invited to weekend parties, where their host fired a shotgun to wake them at 6am. \"What he found intolerably tedious,\" his biographer says, \"was the interval between sensations.\" He certainly engineered plenty of those. One was the battle to bring motor buses into Oxford when the council, sticking to trams, refused to sanction them - an enterprise in which he was joined by his friend William Morris, later a great motor car tycoon. At a meeting called to rouse public opinion, Gray made a speech of such incendiary fervour that riots ensued, a tram was overturned and attempts were made to set fire to it. Gray and Morris then went to the Daimler factory and persuaded the company to let them have a couple of buses destined for Salford - the letters SAL being replaced with OX. In 1922 Frank crowned his career by getting elected Liberal MP for Oxford, ending more than 40 years of Tory supremacy. But the Tories petitioned against his re-election in 1923. Evidence of Liberal malpractice, especially the ripely confected financial accounts, was overwhelming enough for his term to be ended - though, while his agent was found guilty of corrupt practices, Gray was cleared. As editor of the evening Oxford Mail from its launch five years later (he was only 23, but his uncle was the managing director), Fenby was close to Gray, and lived for a while in the house at Shipton, though he was evicted for failing to giveenthusiastic support in the Mail to one of Gray's stunts. These included the opening of a zoo; Mail readers were asked to subscribe to a fund to purchase an elephant. Gray died in 1935, on his way to Africa in the hope of recovering his health. Given the general torpor of local politics, one or two latter-day Grays might be therapeutic. They wouldn't make it cleaner, of course, but at least they might light it up.
