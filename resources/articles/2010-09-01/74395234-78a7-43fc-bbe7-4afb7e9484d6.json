I suspended Janet Jackson in mid-air and poured a vat of honey over her to make an effect. A smarter person might have created this effect on a computer in 10 minutes \u2026 Do you prefer directing megastars or new bands? When you work with a new band, your decisions can form their identity. Big DIY with imaginary budgets is how I roll. Where do your ideas come from? My background was, weirdly, in science and art. Why are music videos important? Music videos are often spoken of as \"low culture\" because of their accessibility, so it's great when a song is given a lease of life through the video. Favourite video Madonna \u2013 Open Your Heart Worst video It's one of my own but I can't tell you which. Kinga Burza: Video romantic who's shot promos for Katy Perry, Kate Nash and Marina And The Diamonds Hits Katy Perry \u2013 I Kissed A Girl; Kate Nash \u2013 Foundations; Peaches \u2013 I Feel Cream How did you start? I did my first video for my ex, who was in a band. Then I found Kate Nash at a gig. She grew with me; she hadn't been filmed before so we were both learning. What's the best thing about your job? I listen to a track and something comes into my head. I then make it a reality. It's never going to be exactly as it was when I first heard it, but it's so satisfying. Why are female video directors so rare? I don't get why there are so many men; it's not like I'm a mechanic. I'm just kind of girly anyway. Where's the oddest place your work has taken you? With Katy Perry's video I had five days to do and \u2026 we ended up using a castle where they'd filmed porn and horror films. But there was one white room. The runner had to clean it a lot. Favourite video Michael Jackson \u2013 Thriller Worst Carly Simon \u2013 Why Marco Brambilla: New York-based artist who teamed up with Kanye West for Power How did the team-up with Kanye come about? He approached me after seeing my piece Civilization [a Dante's Inferno-style epic]. My first response was that videos weren't something I did, but he's a risk-taker and let me do what I wanted. What was the idea behind it? I kept coming back to the lyric about how \"no man should have all that power\". It's a comment on how celebrities are built up and brought back down by the public. Was it tricky to put together? I photographed Kanye and made a collage using Caravaggio and Michelangelo paintings. It took me a week on Photoshop to work it out. Would you do another pop video? Kanye is a one-off, I think. Right now, I'm doing a piece called Evolution. It's a sequel to Civilization, a sideways scroll in 3D. It's taken 14 months to do. Favourite video Elton John \u2013 I Want Love Worst video You could put 20 hip-hop videos together and it would be hard to work out who was the artist. Nova Dando: Designer who works with Kele Okereke and La Roux Hits Klaxons \u2013 Echoes; MIA \u2013 Jimmy; Hercules And Love Affair \u2013 Blind; La Roux \u2013 Bulletproof How did you get started? I moved into a warehouse building and Saam [Farahmand, video director] was my flatmate, and all my friends were in bands. Did you want to work with videos when you grew up? I was obsessed with MTV. I kind of meandered into this job and didn't think about it, but it's good because I can reference any music video. Where's the oddest place work has taken you? I did the Top Of The Pops special with La Roux and got to be in the audience. I had wanted to be on Top Of The Pops for ever. Any plans to work on a film? I like the fast pace of videos. I would like to do a film, but in a few years. At the moment, my ambition is to do a world tour with someone like Kylie, Madonna or Grace Jones. Favourite video Peter Gabriel \u2013 Sledgehammer Worst video Steklovata [Russian boy band] \u2013 Nowiy God"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
