Chadli is set to undergo a medical at West Brom on Monday in a deal worth around \u00a313m, with the Belgium international expected to be the first of several signings made in a frantic few days before the transfer window closes. Chadli\u2019s pace and creativity are just what Albion need to give everyone at the club a lift after a frustrating summer in the transfer market. Albion have made only one permanent signing in this window \u2013 Matty Phillips from Queens Park Rangers \u2013 and Sunday\u2019s goalless draw at home against Middlesbrough underlined the weaknesses in their squad. Signed from FC Twente for \u00a37m in 2013, Chadli made 40 appearances for Spurs last season in all competitions but more than half of those were from the bench. This season the 27-year-old has not featured for Spurs or even been named among the substitutes, forcing him to look elsewhere in search of first-team football. Tony Pulis, the Albion manager, is targeting four other players before 11pm on Wednesday, with another striker likely to be a priority if Saido Berahino departs. Stoke City are expected to make a renewed attempt to sign the out-of-favour forward on Monday in a deal that could be worth up to \u00a320m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
