It was widely assumed, for example, that Parker's England chances would be improved by the move, with White Hart Lane a more familiar venue for Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson than The Valley. And while Charlton's main experience of European football was a brief foray into the Anglo-Italian Cup, Tottenham have a rich history of European football, albeit at the back end of the past 40 years. But Parker's decision to turn down the club he supported as a boy looks smart now, given the conflicting fortunes of the clubs. Charlton's sparkling win over Chelsea on Boxing Day, with Parker again the driving force in midfield, lifted them to fifth and kept them on course for a place in Europe. Woeful Spurs slumped to defeat at Portsmouth and were kept out of the relegation zone only by a last-minute equaliser for Newcastle at Leicester. Parker was persuaded to stay at Charlton by Alan Curbishley, who is one of Tottenham's top targets to succeed the sacked Glenn Hoddle. David Pleat has been put in charge until the end of the season, but Spurs have lost all four games since that decision was announced and one suspects if Curbishley or Martin O'Neill became available, Spurs would jump at the chance to snap them up. Charlton midfielder Graham Stuart is confident their manager will, if asked, come to the same decision as Parker. 'The speculation doesn't mean anything to us because over the last couple of years he's been linked with so many jobs. I think he's quite comfortable here. He's allowed to run the club as he wants. The chairman stays in the background and let's him get on with it. There's a lot to be said for that.' Pleat is under no illusions about the task ahead of him. 'It is early in the season, but we are very aware of our position. Charlton have had an excellent result and it is up to us to try to put something right that has gone wrong.'
