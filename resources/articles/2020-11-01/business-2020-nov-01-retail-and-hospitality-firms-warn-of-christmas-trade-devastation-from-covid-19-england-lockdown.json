The next two months should be the most lucrative time of the year for the high street but 500,000 shops, restaurants and pubs will have to close on Thursday and remain shut until 2 December. Shoppers usually spend around \u00a350bn on goods other than food in the weeks leading up to Christmas as they gift clothes, toys and the latest technology to friends and family. But the new measures will force about 363,000 specialist stores to close, leaving major retailers such as Marks &amp; Spencer and John Lewis with mountains of stock to shift through their websites and the click-and-collect services still allowed to operate. The challenge faced by retailers is underlined by the prediction that shopper numbers in England will drop by about 80% during the November lockdown as Britons are told to shop only for essentials. Diane Wehrle, insights director at Springboard which tracks shopper numbers, said the restrictions meant retailers would now miss out on \u201cessential weeks of Christmas trading, including Black Friday\u201d. During the spring lockdown, the closure of non-essential retail stores meant the high street missed out on \u00a31.6bn of sales each week. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said the importance of the festive shopping period meant losses are certain to be much bigger and would impact the viability of \u201cthousands of shops and hundreds of thousands of jobs\u201d. The fashion retailer Next said even a fortnight-long lockdown would cut its sales by about \u00a357m. Richard Lim, the chief executive of Retail Economics, said the new lockdown was a \u201cdevastating blow\u201d for the industry. \u201cSmall retailers remain in survival mode and profits made during the festive period will determine whether they continue to trade into the new year,\u201d he said. Analysts said the closure of the high street would push shoppers into the arms of online specialists such as Amazon. The British Independent Retailers Association said a quarter of independent retailers did not survive the last lockdown and the sector risked being \u201cdecimated\u201d by a second. Waterstones managing director James Daunt said the pandemic had been \u201cvery, very, very, very, underline \u2018very\u2019 as many times are you like, good for Amazon\u201d but bad for small high street businesses. The bookseller could still despatch web and click-and-collect orders from its stores but independent stores would not have that infrastructure to fall back on. \u201cFor a big retailer like Waterstones there is a narrow and difficult path through this but I worry for people without that additional capability,\u201d said Daunt. Even before the lockdown was announced Amazon had warned the tilt towards online shopping meant even it was going to be \u201cstretched\u201d to meet the huge volume of orders expected. Similarly Gary Grant, the founder of The Entertainer, has warned that couriers were \u201calready overloaded\u201d and the toy industry would face a struggle to get toys into children\u2019s hands in time. Lim said the shift towards online shopping this Christmas would now be of \u201cepic proportions\u201d and there were serious doubts over whether the industry could cope. \u201cThere will be a strain on websites, warehouses and, crucially, delivery networks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe industry just isn\u2019t set up for such a colossal switch to online.\u201d The weeks of frenetic socialising in the run-up to Christmas and new year are also extremely important for Britain\u2019s struggling pubs, restaurants and hotels. Some venues bank as much as 40% of their annual profits between Halloween and January. But this year nearly 53,000 pubs, restaurants and cafes in England will have to shut, according to data from the retail estate adviser Altus Group. Hospitality firms were already buckling under the strain of existing restrictions such as the 10pm curfew. UKHospitality, the industry trade body, said the costs of a second lockdown would be \u201ceven heavier than the first\u201d as some businesses, such as nightclubs, had never even re-opened. Kate Nicholls, its chief executive, said the hospitality industry had been \u201cpushed to the limits\u201d by the pandemic, with many venues already closing. \u201cFor those that have survived, viability is on a knife edge.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
