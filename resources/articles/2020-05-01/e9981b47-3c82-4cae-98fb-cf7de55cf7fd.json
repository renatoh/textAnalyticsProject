On Thursday the force released a report saying the prime minister\u2019s special adviser \u201cmight have\u201d breached health protection regulations when he embarked on a 52-mile round trip to the town of Barnard Castle with his wife and son on her birthday. Officers might have intervened to send him home had they caught him on the trip on 12 April, or fined him if he refused, the report said. His 260-mile journey to Durham on 27 March did not break health protection regulations, the report concluded, though it made no finding in relation to \u201cstay at home\u201d government guidance. Cummings has denied any wrongdoing and said the journey on 12 April, Easter Sunday, was to test his eyesight. The prime minister and cabinet continued to stand by him on Thursday. As part of their inquiry, detectives examined the aide\u2019s press conference on Monday, where he repeatedly said that he had done nothing wrong, and concluded he probably did. Police stopped short of a definitive declaration of rule-breaking because lockdown regulations had not been tested in the courts, sources with knowledge of the force\u2019s thinking told the Guardian. They were keen not to appear to act as \u201cjudge and jury\u201d, it is understood. Durham is one of the forces least likely to issue fines, and said it would not act retrospectively against Cummings, whose trips were revealed by a joint Guardian and Daily Mirror investigation. Mike Barton, a former chief constable of Durham police, said of the report: \u201cThis is not an exoneration \u2026 They would have told him to go home [during the Barnard Castle journey] and if he refused they would have fined him.\u201d He said the police statement on Cummings\u2019 journey from London to Durham contained thinly coded criticism: \u201cThey are [in effect] saying he broke the guidance to stay at home, but not the regulations that were put into law. But clearly he has flouted the government plea to stay at home.\u201d Sir Peter Fahy, a former chief constable of Greater Manchester police, said: \u201cPeople will be puzzled. How is the PM saying the Barnard Castle trip is legal when Durham police say it is not? It is an uncomfortable position the police have been left in. The public have to feel that people in positions of power are complying with the law. That\u2019s where there is a danger.\u201d Robin Lees, the retired chemistry teacher who spotted Cummings in Barnard Castle and took a note of his car registration number, said he welcomed the police conclusion. \u201cI did not need to drive 60 miles to test my eyesight \u2013 I knew it was him. Lots of Tory MPs have said he should resign but I guess that is up to him,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t really decide on his motivation but his statement does match mine. They [the police] said he broke the rules, just like the other two \u2013 Scottish chief medical officer Catherine Calderwood and government scientific adviser Neil Ferguson. They did not get fined but they did resign.\u201d The Durham police statement said: \u201cDurham constabulary have examined the circumstances surrounding the journey to Barnard Castle (including ANPR [automatic number plate recognition], witness evidence and a review of Mr Cummings\u2019 press conference on 25 May 2020) and have concluded that there might have been a minor breach of the regulations that would have warranted police intervention. Durham constabulary view this as minor because there was no apparent breach of social distancing. \u201cHad a Durham constabulary police officer stopped Mr Cummings driving to or from Barnard Castle, the officer would have spoken to him, and, having established the facts, likely advised Mr Cummings to return to the address in Durham, providing advice on the dangers of travelling during the pandemic crisis. Had this advice been accepted by Mr Cummings, no enforcement action would have been taken.\u201d Nick Thomas-Symonds, the shadow home secretary, said: \u201cThe police have confirmed what we all knew, that Dominic Cummings broke the rules he helped to write. The country cannot afford for this saga to carry on. Only Boris Johnson can draw a line under it. \u201cKeir Starmer has said that if he was prime minister, he would have sacked Dominic Cummings. Boris Johnson should follow that advice. If he does not act then he will send a clear message that there is one rule for his closest adviser and another for the British people.\u201d Continuing to back Cummings, a No 10 spokesman said: \u2018The police have made clear they are taking no action against Mr Cummings over his self-isolation and that going to Durham did not breach the regulations. The prime minister has said he believes Mr Cummings behaved reasonably and legally given all the circumstances and he regards this issue as closed.\u201d In their statement Durham police said of Cummings\u2019 decision to drive from London: \u201cDurham constabulary does not consider that by locating himself at his father\u2019s premises, Mr Cummings committed an offence contrary to regulation 6 of the Health Protection (Coronavirus, Restrictions) (England) Regulations 2020. (We are concerned here with breaches of the regulations, not the general government guidance to \u2018stay at home\u2019).\u201d The force had carried out an exercise to establish the facts. It was asked to do so on Monday morning by Steve White, the acting police, crime and victims\u2019 commissioner for Durham, who oversees the force. On Friday the Guardian and the Daily Mirror revealed Cummings had driven from his London home to his parents\u2019 property in Durham on 27 March, at a time when the public were being told to stay at home to stop the spread of the coronavirus. The Durham inquiry said there was \u201cinsufficient evidence\u201d to back claims that Cummings was in Durham again on 19 April, and that the prime minister\u2019s top aide had denied it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
