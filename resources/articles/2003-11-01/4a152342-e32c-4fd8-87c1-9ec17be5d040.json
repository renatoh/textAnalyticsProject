If you're a nervy novice, it's enough to make you wonder why you didn't just book a short city-break instead. Knowing you have comprehensive ski insurance is one way of easing the anxiety. However, as a new campaign by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office highlights, 34% of 18 to 34 year olds who take spur-of-the-moment skiing breaks don't purchase adequate cover. Going off-piste is one thing, but this is a risk too far. Perhaps it's the range and complexity of insurance products on the market that is leaving us a little snowblind? A decade or more ago, we would normally buy our insurance via our travel agent and expect to be covered for just alpine skiing. Now there are myriad products available, and a variety of ways to purchase them. But the boom in the range of winter sports - snowboarding, heli-skiing, snowmobiling and so on - also means that checking the small print is more important than ever. After all, you may think you have secured bargain cover, but is it going to restrict you from doing everything you want to do? When you consider that one-in-10 skiers requires some form of medical treatment - usually for knee-ligament damage or broken limbs - your first priority when sourcing ski insurance is to make sure you are covered for all medical eventualities, be it a bent wrist on the nursery slope, through to a life-threatening slip into a crevice on a glacier. Ask the following questions of the small print: \u00b7 Does the personal medical expenses cover exceed \u00a32m, especially if you're travelling to the US? \u00b7 Does the insurance offer liability cover for the same amount in case you injure someone else (or their equipment)? \u00b7 What does the insurance define as \"extreme sports\"? \u00b7 Will you be paid \"inconvenience cover\" if you are hospitalised? \u00b7 Will any physiotherapy costs be met once you are back home? \u00b7 Are you covered for racing, especially the traditional informal class races at the end of the week? If you are skiing in a European Union country, make sure you have an E111 form, too. Pick one up from a post office for free - it will cover general medical costs in any member state. But don't, as the FO stresses, ever let it be a replacement for insurance because it will not cover additional costs such as rescue and repatriation; rather it will only help smooth along any hospital treatment if there are any problems with getting through to your insurers. It's also worth considering whether you could just do with a \"carte neige\" if you're skiing in France or Switzerland. You can buy one of these top-up insurance schemes from any ski school or tourist office for about \u00a325. They will cover winter sports - on or off-piste - in these countries for a season, and are particularly useful when you already have general travel cover though an annual policy and don't want the expense and hassle of sourcing additional winter-sports cover. The cover is relatively limited though, so make sure you know the policy details beforehand. Beyond medical cover, you also want to find out about rescue cover, cancellation compensation, and equipment damage or theft, so ask the following questions, too: \u00b7 Are you covered for all forms of rescue and repatriation? (Air ambulances can cost about \u00a315 a minute, and the cost of being repatriated - especially if you need three seats to lie down - can be as high as \u00a33,000.) \u00b7 Are you covered for piste closure? (Look for at least \u00a320 a day cover). How many hours should the pistes be closed before you qualify for a pay-out? Sometimes, policies don't include the nursery slope drag lifts. \u00b7 Are you covered for missed ski classes and avalanche disruption? \u00b7 Does your insurance stipulate that you lock up your equipment when you stop for lunchtime? \u00b7 Is there a difference to the level of cover depending on whether the equipment is your own or hired? \u00b7 Is the cover new-for-old, or is compensation calculated according to the age of the stolen or broken equipment? \u00b7 What are the terms of the baggage delay? (Will it cover the cost of hire equipment if an airline \"loses\" your equipment?). \u00b7 How long will you have to wait for money if you make an expensive equipment claim? (This is important because you don't want to be waiting for days before you can start skiing again.) \u00b7 What does the policy mean by \"off piste\"? (Are you covered without a qualified instructor? Some policies also don't include snowboarding in their basic winter-sports cover even though it is extremely popular.) Annual insurance policies that include winter sports - even if only for a specified amount of days a year - are usually the best value. You may even be covered for winter sports without realising it. However, there are a few points worth checking: are children covered, too, especially when travelling alone on school trips? Do you have worldwide cover, or just for Europe? Is there a restriction on the amount of consecutive days that you can be on holiday, (commonly, 31 days)? Finally, take the insurance documents with you, because some rescue teams and hospitals may want to see them before agreeing to treat you. You may even be asked to sign a form confirming that you are insured as you're being loaded into a helicopter. \u00b7 How To Buy... by Leo Hickman is published by Guardian Books.
