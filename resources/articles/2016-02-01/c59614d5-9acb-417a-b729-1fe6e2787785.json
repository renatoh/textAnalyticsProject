This weekend, the country\u2019s relationship with continental Europe was again in the balance, and in the town associated with the battle in 1066, the war fronts, albeit less sonorously, were being drawn up among potential voters in the EU referendum on 23 June. \u201cI\u2019m Anglo-Saxon to the core,\u201d said Sussex businessman Paul Johnson, visiting Hastings with his wife Catherine. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we learn from history? The Normans took over. I have watched Europe become a monster in my lifetime. Now it\u2019s going to eat the Tory party. It\u2019s a shambles, a dreadful state of affairs. The sooner we get out, the better.\u201d An unscientific straw poll suggested, however, that this is not a majority view. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a lot of east Europeans here,\u201d said Ann Sheldon, a retired music teacher. \u201cA lot have gone already and I\u2019d hate to see more go. I used to think I\u2019d like to get out of the European Union but now I\u2019m not so sure. Hastings does well out of foreign students and the like. I feel a lot more comfortable here on the south coast, where you actually meet a lot of foreign people, than when I lived in Derbyshire, where you met none. I can tell anyone who asks that this hand-out notion is rot. Shame on you David Cameron for that rot. I\u2019m not convinced change is for the better. We\u2019re a bit too small a country to be going it alone; it doesn\u2019t feel like that\u2019s the way the world is nowadays.\u201d Running a flower stall in a cobbled lane lined with independent cafes, Lisa Reeder has made up her mind. \u201cI will vote to stay in. I think we\u2019d lose a lot of foreign trade otherwise. I think it would make it more difficult to keep any illegal immigrants out, if that\u2019s what people are worried about, because the French wouldn\u2019t care so much. I holiday in France and I like being able to just hop on a train and go; it\u2019s nice and easy. I wouldn\u2019t like that to start getting complicated.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t really know if I\u2019ll vote,\u201d said Louis, the 25-year-old deputy manager of the 1066 Bakery in Hastings town centre. \u201cI have family in Spain and I want to be able to come and go there as much as I want. I think staying in Europe is definitely far better financially for us.\u201d When the Normans defeated King Harold\u2019s army on 14 October 1066, it took one very bloody day to achieve the victory. A few miles from Hastings is Battle Abbey, erected on the site of the battlefield by William the Conqueror, to atone for the bloodshed. Yesterday, Spanish student Marco and his Scottish girlfriend, Amy, both studying in Hastings, were paying a visit. Both are dreading the next four months of tortuous national political sparring. \u201cThe thing I dread is that, as with the Scottish referendum, we\u2019re now going to be fed a whole loads of lies and counter-lies. It just makes politicians look like hypocrites,\u201d said Amy. \u201cLook, we\u2019re the generation that counts, and we\u2019re Europeans. We don\u2019t care if Michael Gove lives in the past and still hates the French, we\u2019d love to have Angela Merkel as a leader. Never mind giving 16-year-olds the vote, I think we should take it away from over-65s.\u201d Marco, however, is impressed by the prime minister. \u201cI think to go to Brussels and try and get something for your country is a good thing. I don\u2019t know if what he got is any good or not, but he did do this.\u201d Inside the cafe at the abbey, there is an inscription on a wall from WC Sellar and RJ Yeatman\u2019s humorous book, 1066 and All That. \u201cThe Norman conquest was a \u2018good thing\u2019. As from this time onwards, England stopped being conquered and thus was able to become \u2018top nation\u2019.\u201d Everyone approached by the Observer in Hastings and Battle agreed on one point. \u201cI need to know more,\u201d said Sami Al-Rahman, a cab driver, on his way into the east European supermarket for his favourite pepper sauce. \u201cIt\u2019s all to play for and we can\u2019t afford to get it wrong.\u201d Johnson\u2019s wife, Catherine, remarked that without the Norman victory \u201cwe wouldn\u2019t have had the Domesday book\u201d. Her husband retorted: \u201cAnd when did you last enjoy a read of the Domesday book?\u201d She laughed: \u201cAnglo-Saxon to the core? I think all this history is getting him. He\u2019d better not have a look at my family tree!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
