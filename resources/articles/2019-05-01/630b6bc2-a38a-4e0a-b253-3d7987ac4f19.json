The former prime minister told an audience in London on Monday evening that although he would be voting for the party on 23 May, \u201cit would\u2019ve been better if we\u2019d been able to fight it in a clearer way\u201d. He encouraged remainers to \u201cvote for one of the other anti-Brexit parties\u201d if they cannot bring themselves to vote for Labour. The party\u2019s current stated policy is that it would support a second referendum under certain circumstances. Earlier on Monday, the deputy leader, Tom Watson, insisted Labour stood for \u201cremain and reform\u201d and said it seemed inevitable that a confirmatory referendum would be needed for the party\u2019s MPs to agree to any Brexit deal. On Sunday, the shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, expressed doubts that a Brexit deal could pass parliament if it did not include a confirmatory referendum, warning that up to 150 Labour MPs would reject an agreement that lacked one. On Monday night, Blair also threw his weight behind holding another vote. He told the event hosted by the Guardian at the Barbican centre that while Labour were right to accept the result of the EU referendum, another public poll in the event of unsatisfactory Brexit negotiations should have been party policy from the outset of talks. He predicted the European elections on 23 May would \u201cnot [be] good news for the Tories or Labour\u201d and said that, while a no-deal Brexit was \u201cvery unlikely\u201d, politics in Britain was \u201cin a unique state of unpredictability\u201d. Politicians had lost sight of the importance of discussing domestic issues such as cuts to funding for health services and police and the lack of opportunities for young people amid Brexit chaos, he said. \u201cThe great irony of Brexit is, the future of the National Health Service is decided in Westminster. The person who\u2019s got the opportunity to do something about knife crime is Theresa May not Jean-Claude Juncker [the EU commission president],\u201d he said. \u201cBrexit\u2019s distractive effect is almost as bad as the destructive effect.\u201d Blair\u2019s criticisms of indecisiveness extended to the Conservatives. \u201cMy view is that both the main parties have made the same mistake if you try and face both ways you end up pleasing no one,\u201d he said. Ultimately though, Labour was an anti-Brexit party and the majority of its MEP candidates had \u201clong credentials in fighting the case for Europe\u201d. Although he lamented that \u201cit would\u2019ve been better frankly if the avowedly remain parties had been standing under one banner\u201d, Blair stressed it was important for remainers to vote in the election because gains for Brexit parties in Europe could sway the way MPs approach the UK\u2019s departure in parliament. Adding that he believed that the leave vote had been partially fuelled by legitimate concerns over immigration and globalisation, Blair said the \u201cbiggest tragedy\u201d of Brexit was \u201cthat it\u2019s the answer to nothing\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
