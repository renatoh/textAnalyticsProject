(You'll need a GameCity day pass to get in). Sadly, many of the prizes that publishers promised to deliver haven't shown up! We're not sure if they just haven't arrived, haven't been sent or have somehow got lost in transit. So if you can come tonight, bear in mind you're most likely playing for fun and curry, rather than amazing game goodies. Oh dear. I'm sure nothing else can go wrong! GameCity has been great fun so far and I've got some cool stuff to post - I'll be starting that tomorrow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
