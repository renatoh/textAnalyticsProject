And here, Jack Klaff - actor, thinker, lay scientist and spinner of dazzling yarns - offers a sparky, off-the-wall perspective of the scientific state we are in. The Whole Shebang details his experiences as professor of the public understanding of science at a Brussels think tank. One is tempted to think of it as a brilliant shaggy science story, but he assures us that it is all true. This, though, is the man who wrote Bluff Your Way in the Quantum Universe. Either way, Klaff has the experience and authority to enthral: he reels us into his meditation on time, quantum mechanics, nanotechnology, genetics, the relationship between art and science and what it means to be human. He may be a smartarse, but he is a fantastically entertaining one, and he performs this quirky show with a freshness that suggests he is making it up as he goes along. Which, of course, he might be. It is hard to pull off this kind of thing without making the audience feel either stupid or smug, but Klaff succeeds because he treats difficult concepts like adventures, can move from Einstein to Gertrude Stein in a single breath, and knows that, though mapping the human genome may be a scientific miracle, so is holding your own child in your arms. This is a show touched by both erudition and humanity - a rare combination. Make time for it. \u0095 Until August 27. Box office: 0131-226 2428.
