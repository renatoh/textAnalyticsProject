Over the years, the Australians have proved themselves to be better than the English at EVERYTHING. Everything, that is, except football. But now that a friendly has been arranged between the two countries at Upton Park on February 12, Australia have the perfect opportunity to beat the Poms at footy for the first time ever, thus relieving England of its last scrap of cultural dignity. \"Australia have an excellent team now,\" a nervous Sven-Goran Eriksson scatted exclusively on the FA's jazzy new website, doing his best to ignore David Davies's unnecessarily intrusive look-at-me drum solo. \"We know this from the many players they have playing at the top clubs in the Premier League,\" continued Eriksson, getting his excuses for another discordant Macedoniaesque debacle in early. And in 15/8 time. Elsewhere, Aussie coach Frank Farina was putting more wind up Eriksson than Rolf Harris can blow into an Australian clich\u00bf. \"I'm absolutely rapt,\" he began in words which can only possibly be delivered in an Australian accent (go on, try it), \"that Soccer Australia has been able to confirm this historic match against England. The players will be determined to give something back to the fans and get a good result to further improve upon our international reputation.\" Now let's remember that this game is supposed to bolster England's confidence before their Euro 2004 qualifier against Liechtenstein in March 29. Oh dear, eh? TOTALLY GROSS, MAN It was, claimed one paper, a \"Gross Injustice\". Others, picking up the in-no-way-unoriginal theme, preferred \"Gross Misconduct\" or \"Just Gross\". No wonder that, at one point this morning, the Christian Gross puns were looking as overexposed as Liverpool's back four against Basil/Basle/Basel/Barrllll. But inevitably, after a display of defending so loose and comical even MC Hammer's pants circa 1991 would have taken umbrage, the inevitable soul-searching started to take place. \"I really don't know how to describe how I feel,\" admitted a confused Sami Hyypia, before making a decent stab at it. \"They were quicker out of the blocks than us and we just watched them play,\" he howled. \"Every season you expect to do better than the last and I admit I expected us to go through to the next stage.\" And Danny Murphy concurred. \"We have to question our mental attitude at the start of the game,\" he admitted, snatching an industrial-sized tub of St John's Wort out of his cabinet. But not everyone was upset by Liverpool's defeat. The Fiver's favourite Swiss daily, Blick, said: \"[Basil/Basle/Basel/Barrllll] threw the legendary Liverpool out of [Big Cup] - let Switzerland rejoice. Now opponents like Real Madrid wait.\" Tages Anzeiger branded the result \"perfection\" and added that Basil/Basle/Basel/Barrllll's performance had \"made dreams come true\". And even Jamie Carragher was in upbeat mood as he looked forward to an exciting Euro Vase campaign. \"I'd rather win that than go out of [Big Cup] in the quarter-final,\" said Carragher. Well, he should know. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I was in the library last night until 11pm doing my work and I have a deadline for an assignment which I have to complete by Friday. It is a hectic lifestyle. It is a nightmare\" - Team Bath student Kevin Watson on the preparations for playing Mansfield in the FA Cup first round this weekend. He doesn't mention the \u00a3100,000 sponsorship deal the side have just signed with fashion designer Ted Baker, funnily enough. DI CANIO AND DI DICKS If there was one thing that made the Fiver sick as a wee nipper, it was having weekly maths and spelling tests on the same day. That was why we so often developed crippling stomach aches on Friday mornings, which usually shifted in time to go in for double games in the afternoon. It was a mystery that, amazingly, was never solved. Paolo Di Canio has not been so lucky. A quick look at the dates of his West Ham sickies reveals that he often develops strange injuries before long-distance away games - a \"FACT!!!\" that the club's most committed ever player, DI Julian Dicks, yesterday pointed out to the Sun. If there is one thing that makes Paolo Di Canio sick - apart from the prospect of playing Sunderland away on a cold January night - it's former hot-headed players shouting their mouths off. \"DICKS is a TRAITOR to West Ham!\" whispered a beatific Di Canio while coochy-cooing a baby. \"He has criticised ME for not playing in away games, suggesting I'm NOT really injured when the fixtures in the NORTH of England are played!\" he simpered, before breaking off to help an old biddy cross the street. \"Why would I DELIBERATELY want to miss matches when I have SUCH an influence on the results? It's CRAZY!\" Then Di Canio spotted a beautiful garden rose and rushed over to drink in its glorious fragrance. \"Fans should not FORGET what HE was really like!\" he laughed gaily. \"HE couldn't wait to RUN to LIVERPOOL to sign for them!\" said the man who last year couldn't wait to run to Manchester United to sign for them. \"Then, after a year, when he was KICKED OUT for NOT BEING GOOD ENOUGH for Liverpool, he came running back to West Ham, TRYING to be a hero! He didn't come back for love, that's for sure. I'd LOVE to stay here next season - even if we're relegated. That is real love and passion for the club!\" The Fiver, for one, cannot recall a greater display of love and passion - or indeed a longer one. \"It's easy to try and be a hero by kicking, fighting, using the elbow and screaming a lot,\" continued Dicks's polar opposite. \"But it's a lot harder to be a total professional for every second of the day, setting a good example to the younger players.\" Too hard, evidently. THE RUMOUR MILL Bobby Zamora has been attracting more suitors. Southampton, following the example set by Middlesbrough and Spurs, have sent emissaries to enquire about the Brighton player's availability. Arsenal's Matthew Upson, currently on loan with Reading, is in Manchester City's thoughts. Middlesbrough and Celtic are both keen on Barcelona defender Michael Reiziger. NEWS IN BRIEF Newcastle boss Rir Sobby Bobson is warning fellow Big Cup hopefuls Dynamo Kiev to take nothing for granted against Juventus. \"Six or seven will come into the team and they will roll up their sleeves,\" he insisted, unconvincingly. Paul Gascoigne is pondering joining the plumbers and IT specialists of the Northern League side Morpeth Albany to regain fitness. He will earn \u00a330 a game. If all goes through Gazza should be making his debut on December 7 against Willenhall Town in the FA Vase third round. Bayern Munich coach Ottmar Hitzfeld hopes Owen Hargreaves will be happy to remain a squad player - but admits he cannot prevent him moving to the Premiership. Hitzfeld told German newspaper Muenchner Merkur: \"If he really wants to go and play in England, we cannot change that.\" Nicolas Anelka has been left out of the France squad for next Wednesday's friendly against Yugoslavia. \"I had a long discussion with Anelka this weekend but I stand firm,\" manager Jacques Santini said. \"I think we have enough good strikers, and for precise reasons I want to maintain a certain stability within the team.\" TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO ITV1: Big Cup highlights (11.30pm) This drunken drivel comes courtesy of Andrew Payne.
