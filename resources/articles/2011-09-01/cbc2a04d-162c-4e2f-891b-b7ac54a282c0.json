He's driven to rob banks at the behest of McBride's criminal non-mastermind, with buddy Ansari roped in for comic effect. In fact, comic effect seems to be all this is after. Like a dodgy pizza, it's enjoyable at the time but nutritionally dubious, a bit thin, and just about gone cold by the time it's finished. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy (15) (Thomas Alfredson, 2011, UK/Fra/Ger) Gary Oldman, Tom Hardy, Benedict Cumberbatch. 127 mins A very British spy thriller that dispenses with all that hasty pacing and coarse action in favour of well-tailored men talking in rooms. A complex, classy cold war mole-hunt that demands attention, but rewards it richly. I Don't Know How She Does It (12A) (Douglas McGrath, 2011, US) Sarah Jessica Parker, Pierce Brosnan, Greg Kinnear. 89 mins Carrie Bradshaw gets a proper job, a husband and children, but predictably struggles to juggle (and satirise) work-life issues, in a movie that acts like this is a new phenomenon. The Change-Up (15) (David Dobkin, 2011, US) Ryan Reynolds, Jason Bateman, Leslie Mann. 112 mins A family career guy and his playboy-slacker buddy magically swap bodies, lifestyles, etc. Cue mix ups, hook ups and life lessons. Tomboy (U) (C\u00e9line Sciamma, 2011, Fra) Zo\u00e9 H\u00e9ran, Malonn L\u00e9vana. 82 mins A tender junior Boys Don't Cry, as 10-year-old Laure lies about her gender when she moves to a new town, and learns about sexual identity even as she struggles to maintain the deception. You Instead (15) (David Mackenzie, 2011, UK) Luke Treadaway, Natalia Tena. 80 mins Neat little romcom exercise in which two incompatible musicians get handcuffed together at T In The Park festival. Turnout (18) (Lee Sales, 2011, UK) George Russo, Ophelia Lovibond. 97 mins Authentic Brit drama in which a smalltime Hoxton coke dealer has to recover his girlfriend's holiday funds and turn a profit. Atrocious (15) (Fernando Barreda Luna, 2010, Spa/Mex) Cristian Valencia, Clara Moraleda. 74 mins Another \"found footage\" horror (Spanish teens investigate a ghost myth), wavering between showing us scares and honouring its faux amateur premise. Episode 50 (15) (Joe Smalley, Tess Smalley, 2011, US) Josh Folan, Chris Perry. 78 mins Even less convincing paranormal mockdoc in which a reality TV crew investigates an asylum. Big Fat Gypsy Gangster (15) (Ricky Grover, 2011, UK) Ricky Grover, Omid Djalili, Peter Capaldi. 91 mins Gangster mockumentary on a recently released convict that looks to cult cameos to liven the formula (Tulisa, Derek Acorah, etc). West Side Story (PG) (Robert Wise, Jerome Robbins, 1961, US) Natalie Wood, Richard Beymer. 151 mins 50th anniversary reissue for gangs of New York musical. Out from Friday Killer Elite A tournament of testosterone as Jason Statham and Clive Owen fight to the death. Pearl Jam Twenty Anniversary rockumentary directed by Cameron Crowe. Out from Tue Crazy, Stupid, Love Ryan Gosling helps divorc\u00e9 Steve Carell get his mojo back. Drive Gosling again, this time at the wheel of an old-school road thriller. Jurassic Park Reissue of the CGI dino blockbuster. Warrior Tom Hardy leads the Rocky of mixed martial arts movies. Tucker &amp; Dale Vs Evil Backwoods comedy turning hillbilly horror on its head. Newsreel 1 Up-to-date document of London life. Mademoiselle Chambon Hard choices in a French mid-life love story. Page One: A Year Inside The New York Time Fly-in-the-press room documentary. Soul Surfer Biopic of shark-victim surfer Bethany Hamilton. Ultrasuede: In Search Of Halston Appreciation of the 1970s fashion designer.
