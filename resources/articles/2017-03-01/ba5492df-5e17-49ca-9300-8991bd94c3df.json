Plainly intended to be definitive, their 10th album stays true to the scything, mid-paced attack that had such an impact on fledgling extreme metal in the late 80s, but in contrast to 2014\u2019s Inked in Blood, this is no perfunctory delivering of familiar goods. Latest recruits Kenny Andrews (lead guitar) and Terry Butler (bass) have brought renewed focus to both songwriting and sound: the former\u2019s blistering, old-school solos are uniformly stunning and Butler\u2019s chemistry with drummer Donald Tardy lifts the likes of breakneck opener Brave to levels of intensity that Obituary haven\u2019t reached for years. Meanwhile, slower fare such as End It Now and It Lives bring guitarist Trevor Peres\u2019 unerring grasp of groove and dissonance together with some of the sharpest and most insidious hooks these legends have ever brandished."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
