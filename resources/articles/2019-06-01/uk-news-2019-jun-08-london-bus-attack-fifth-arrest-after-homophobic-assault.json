Melania Geymonat and her girlfriend, Chris, had been travelling on a bus in north London, and say they were attacked after refusing to kiss each other on demand for a group of young men. The attack is being treated as a hate crime by the Metropolitan police. The assault \u2013 during which a phone and a bag were stolen \u2013 happened in the early hours of 30 May. A 16-year-old boy was arrested on suspicion of robbery and aggravated burglary on Saturday morning, Scotland Yard said. Four other men between the ages of 15 and 18 have already been arrested on suspicion of robbery and aggravated grievous bodily harm and are being questioned separately. Speaking to the BBC on Friday, the couple said that they would not be frightened into hiding their sexuality after the attack. \u201cI was and still am angry. It was scary, but this is not a novel situation,\u201d said Chris. \u201cI\u2019m not scared about being visibly queer. If anything, you should do it more. \u201cA lot of people\u2019s rights and basic safety are at risk. I want people to feel emboldened to stand up to the same people who feel emboldened by the rightwing populism that is, I feel, responsible for the escalation in hate crimes. I want people to take away from this that they should stand up for themselves and each other.\u201d Geymonat added: \u201cThe violence is not only because we are women which are dating each other. It\u2019s also because we are women.\u201d Describing the incident in a Facebook post on Friday, Geymonat said she and her girlfriend were subjected to homophobic abuse while being beaten up. \u201cThey started behaving like hooligans, demanding that we kissed so they could enjoy watching, calling us \u2018lesbians\u2019 and describing sexual positions \u2026 The next thing I know is that Chris is in the middle of the bus fighting with them. \u201cThe next thing I know is I\u2019m being punched. I got dizzy at the sight of my blood and fell back. I don\u2019t remember whether or not I lost consciousness.\u201d After a photograph of the couple\u2019s bloodied faces went viral on Friday, politicians condemned the attack. Theresa May said: \u201cThis was a sickening attack and my thoughts are with the couple affected. Nobody should ever have to hide who they are or who they love and we must work together to eradicate unacceptable violence towards the LGBT community.\u201d The Labour party leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said: \u201cWe must not, and will not, accept this homophobic and misogynist violence in our society. Solidarity to Melania and Chris, and to all in the LGBT+ community for everything they endure for simply being who they are.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
