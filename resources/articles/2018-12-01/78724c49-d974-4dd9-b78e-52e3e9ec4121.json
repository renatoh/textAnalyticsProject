G\u00fcndogan has been booed more than once by Germany fans since he and Mesut \u00d6zil posed for a picture with the Turkey president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in May. G\u00fcndogan has also been insulted by a German politician on Facebook and attacked on social media. \u201cWe have to deal with it,\u201d the midfielder said. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy because I lived it in the summer as well. I know how that feels and it hurts. But at the end we have no other choice but to stay strong and try to go through that period and try to do our best on the pitch. Yeah, to keep being successful, that\u2019s what matters.\u201d Sterling was allegedly racially abused by Chelsea fans last Saturday. G\u00fcndogan, asked how the forward had been since, said: \u201cHe has been normal. I think he made his point clear through Instagram, giving a statement on that. I don\u2019t know if there is any more to say but this is obviously something that doesn\u2019t belong anywhere in the world.\u201d Chelsea have suspended four supporters pending an investigation and their manager, Maurizio Sarri, has described what happened as \u201cdisgusting\u201d and spoken out against discrimination. G\u00fcndogan said of Sterling: \u201cI think he got a lot of support this week. I think also the way Chelsea reacted was good. It\u2019s something we all have to fight; we all have to play our individual roles to make it better for everyone.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
