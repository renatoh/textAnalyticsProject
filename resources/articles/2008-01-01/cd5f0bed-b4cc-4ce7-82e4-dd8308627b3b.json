Paul Dhaliwal, 19, told the father of Carlos Sousa Jr, 17, who was killed, that the two of them and Dhaliwal's brother, Kulbir, yelled and waved at the tiger but insisted they never threw anything into the pen to provoke the cat, according to a search warrant affidavit obtained by the San Francisco Chronicle. \"As a result of this investigation, [police believe] that the tiger may have been taunted [or] agitated by its eventual victims,\" according to Inspector Valerie Matthews, who prepared the affidavit. \"This factor contributed to the tiger escaping from its enclosure and attacking its victims.\" Sousa's father, Carlos Sousa Sr, said Paul Dhaliwal told him that they stood on a 3ft-high (one-metre) metal railing a few feet from the edge of the tiger moat. \"When they got down they heard a noise in the bushes, and the tiger was jumping out of the bushes on him [Paul Dhaliwal],\" the documents said. Police found a partial shoeprint that matched Paul Dhaliwal's on top of the railing. The papers said Dhaliwal told Sousa's father that no one was dangling his legs over the enclosure. Authorities believe the tiger leaped or climbed out of the enclosure, which had a wall 1.25 metres (4ft) shorter than the recommended minimum. The affidavit quotes reports of a group of young men taunting animals, the Chronicle reported on Thursday. Mark Geragos, a lawyer for the Dhaliwals, has repeatedly said they did not taunt the tiger. Tests on Paul Dhaliwal showed his blood alcohol level was twice the legal limit for driving. Kulbir Dhaliwal, 24, and Sousa also had alcohol in their blood but within the legal limit. Kulbir Dhaliwal told police that the three had smoked pot and each had \"a couple shots of vodka\" before leaving for the zoo on Christmas Day. Zoo spokesman Sam Singer said he had not seen the documents but believed the victims did taunt the tiger. \"Those brothers painted a completely different picture to the public and the press,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
