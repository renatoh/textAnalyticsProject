A second Michael Owen goal in two games helped the home side to their second win of the season, leaving City looking at three successive defeats. Since one of those came at lowly Doncaster that is bad enough for Pearce, though perhaps more worryingly is the fact that for the first time in three games City were not hard done by. Shay Given's woodwork was not rattled here, Graham Poll did not send anybody off by mistake, City were not at all unlucky except in encountering a Newcastle side rejuvenated by Owen. The striker could have had a hat-trick in the first half alone, but his main contribution was in making every Newcastle attack look threatening. Considering the scoreline that was probably an illusion, yet Newcastle know that with Owen's pace and sharpness up front chances will always come. Owen takes the pressure off Alan Shearer and gives width to the Newcastle attack in exactly the same way Craig Bellamy used to do and his finishing is infinitely superior. That said, Newcastle could have done with him finishing one of his second half chances to steady their nerves at the end. Disappointingly, there was little controversy for the referee and his assistants to sort out over their fancy new radio sets. Even more disappointingly, the cummerbunds they wear to carry the battery pack turned out to be some sort of streamlined undergarment invisible to the naked eye. The radios seemed to work, for what it is worth, but who needs them? Instant communication between all four officials is hardly one of the game's most pressing problems, is it? If this idea catches on, then coaches will soon want to talk to their players in the same way instead of semaphoring from the technical area and the authorities will not find it easy to say no. Why should officials be the only ones with the technology when the actual entertainers have to interpret hand signals? Talking of entertainment, it is pleasing to note that this game actually contained some. It was not a classic, by any means, but it was an open and honest tussle between two teams playing 4-4-2 and making dozens of mistakes. Tyneside is immune to most Premiership trends, so it can be expected to resist boredom for some time yet. City served notice of attacking intent by almost taking the lead after six minutes. Antoine Sibierski did everything right in reaching Joey Barton's free kick, leaving Alain Boumsong marking space and getting good headed contact on the ball, yet with the whole of the goal to aim at he unerringly picked out Shay Given's hastily outstretched arm. Finishing of a much higher class was demonstrated 12 minutes later at the other end as Newcastle went in front. Lee Bowyer threaded a diagonal pass into space between City defenders and Michael Owen proved that little bit sharper then Richard Dunne in reaching the ball first and to poke it into David James's bottom right corner. Owen then spurned a much easier chance to score when Alan Shearer pounced on a Sylvain Distin mistake and sent him clear on the goalkeeper, only for James to save a rather hesitant shot with his legs. The former Liverpool striker shot narrowly over from a tight angle just before the interval. Owen began the second half by not quite managing to reach a cross from Shearer, then saw James leave his line to cut out Bowyer's attempt to find him. Lee Clark was next to try, hoisting a cross over from the left that Owen read and got a toe to, though not enough to divert it past James. All City could manage were a few misdirected Dunne headers from set pieces. James entertained us by heading a Distin back-pass off his line at the end, before in the closing seconds Owen teed up Shola Ameobi from point-blank range, only to see him shoot wide. Owen might have to get used to that. Man of the Match: Michael Owen - Cost a lot of money but has made a big difference to Newcastle. Should have scored more than just the one from a succession of chances, but already a big hit and earned a big cheer for tracking back to dispossess Stephen Ireland near the corner flag. Still settling in and can only get better."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
