Not here", "bodyText": "Spiritualized - Songs In A&amp;E (Universal/Spaceman) \u00a311.99 Jason Pierce, the sole constant member of Spiritualized, has long obsessed over the notion of death. Since his early days in Spacemen 3, he has rhapsodised the transformative, near-death effects of opiates; during the Noughties, he has marshalled celestial choirs to his cause. Over six albums, Pierce has mixed a potent thematic elixir of religiosity, love and drug use in which his romanticised end wavered perpetually just out of shot. And then Pierce nearly died of double pneumonia. Songs in A&amp;E is the album recorded before Pierce landed in intensive care in 2005. The timing is key. Full of laboured breathing and the bloop of ventilators, it is eerily prescient, given Pierce had to be revived twice by medics. The killer song here (if you will) is the masterful 'Death Take Your Fiddle' in which a ravaged-sounding Pierce sings about being in a coma. It's hard to peel Pierce's misfortune away from this album, but it is illuminating. Once you do, A&amp;E sounds like Pierce crying wolf once again, only with diminishing returns. His last two albums - Let it Come Down and Amazing Grace - were decent, workaday exercises for his by-now familiar hobbyhorses, lacking the sublime wallop of his best 1997's Ladies and Gentlemen We Are Floating in Space and 1992's Lazer Guided Melodies. A&amp;E does not reverse the trend, however seductive the tale that now wraps itself round it like surgical gauze. Throughout, his voice is mixed far too high. Songs like 'I Gotta Fire' and 'Sitting on Fire' take Pierce's familiar conceits nowhere new. Everything good about this record is good despite the stench of hospital that surrounds A&amp;E, rather than because of it. 'Death Take Your Fiddle' is a great song, full stop. 'Sweet Talk', meanwhile, features the first recorded instance of Pierce noticing the outside world, with a couplet sneering at the war. Naturally, there's still a 'hurricane' raging 'inside [Pierce's] veins' on 'Soul on Fire'; this album would hardly be allowed out under the Spiritualized banner without one. But now that Pierce has cheated death, it is worth remembering that this is not the album he brought back from the other side. That's the next one. And that is the one I'm dying to hear."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
