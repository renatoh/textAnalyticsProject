But the harbingers have been there for some time if anybody had cared to look. England's social and cultural ties that bind have been weakening and corroding for decades. As a nation we are a lost tribe \u2013 disoriented, brooding and suspicious. There is no sense of collective purpose or shared destiny. It is a directionlessness intermingled with a destructive new conviction that a cornerstone of Englishness \u2013 a commitment to fairness \u2013 is being torched. Those at the top are in the forefront of the charge to grab what they can without any sense of their proportional and due dessert, or accompanying responsibility to the society of which they are part. Of course there is no excuse for wanton criminality \u2013 as the prime minister, the archbishop of Canterbury and the leader of the opposition all said in a dutiful chorus and which was echoed afterwards by many of the repentant looters themselves in the magistrates' courts. But that does not help us much. We need to know why, and we need to get beyond invocations to better policing, tougher penalties and better parenting, however much they may be needed as part of the solution. The emergent consensus is that there was not even a higher political or social purpose behind what happened: it was mindless, feral youths and gangs \u2013 their members unparented \u2013 looting for the flat-screen TVs and trainers to which they wrongly felt entitled. It was an abysmal new social low. Yet from the tweets and BlackBerry messages (BBM) it is clear that something more subtle and even more worrying was happening \u2013 and that there is a thread linking last week's destruction to other events that have recently hit our streets. It was only in April that there were arrests in Bristol as young squatters occupied a local store that Tesco wanted to turn into a Tesco Express \u2013 eight police officers were injured in the violent disturbances. And recall the shock at students running amok in their protests about tuition fees last autumn. Then it seemed there was a thin carapace of legitimacy about the violence: opposition was explicable and violence at the margins of protest, while never to be condoned, can take place. But there were also Clockwork Orange dimensions (Alex and his \"droogs\") alongside Lord of the Flies aspects (Jack Merridew's murderous boy tribe) to all these events. Our kids were summoned by tweet and BBM to have some evil fun (as some of the articulate looters have even described it), to break free from the dreariness of their lives and for a moment to rule the roost, cocking a snook at the \"Feds\" (the police). Anthony Burgess's and William Golding's warnings about the thinness of our social norms have proved ominously prescient. Now we discover that the wells of disaffection and readiness to make mayhem run much deeper than the unwanted side-effects of political protest. This should not be a surprise. Of course Laura Johnson, from a \u00a31m house in Orpington, or Alexis Bailey, a classroom assistant in a primary school, were apparently caught up with the disadvantaged looters. Just as baby-boomers, rich and poor alike, were part of a larger common life experience so are today's under 30s. The Unicef report that in 2007 placed Britain bottom of 21 industrialised countries in the way it treated its children did not only single out child poverty as a cause of the problem \u2013 other factors included the factory-like education and training system, poor relationships with family and friends, the low subjective sense of wellbeing and the risks of everyday life. Add to that picture private shopping centres that allow no public place for kids to gather, inadequate and now closing youth clubs, being routinely questioned by police just for being under 25, and being ordered to disperse, even if there are only two of them \u2013 all these impact on an entire age group. The dutiful, non-rioting young may work hard for their qualifications, degrees and apprenticeships. But they too could be forgiven for asking themselves: for what? The country is economically stagnating. For anybody young and unlucky to be trapped in one of our sprawling sink estates through the bad luck of birth, what chance is there? Are their vanishing prospects in any sense deserved or fair? And the larger question that hangs over them all \u2013 where is Britain going? Meanwhile, those at the top take as much as they can get away with. It is simply accepted that the highest rate of tax is without purpose because so many organise their affairs not to pay it \u2013 even famous knights such as Philip Green or Richard Branson, now reportedly considering moving part of his business to Switzerland. There is no word of disapproval from our financial and political elite; instead both enjoy knighthoods, and like the Murdochs, privileged access to the top. We are arriving at a major turning point in our national life. It is not enough to talk of being tough on crime and the causes of crime. We need an entire root-and-branch reshaping of our economy and society \u2013 where both rewards and punishments are judicious, proportional and deserved, and all within a revived and larger understanding of fairness. We cannot let the brute bad luck of birth dictate destinies as lethally as they do in Britain. Nor can rewards be so gigantic for so little contribution or genuine innovation \u2013 or responsibilities be so widely evaded. We need a good capitalism and the good society that accompanies it. That is not where we are in August 2011. Instead a triumphant conservative right who dominate our national discourse \u2013 even while incredibly insisting that the country is in thrall to liberal dogma \u2013 believe that what has happened is validation of all it believes. There should be a crackdown that includes curfew and water cannon, say some from this perspective. Prison must be uncompromisingly tough with no early release or bail. A 100,000-strong e-petition is calling for convicted looters to lose their benefits. All of this is understandable; already five people have died in the looting. There is a collective insistence that the looters should receive their comeuppance. Fairness \u2013 a doctrine that cuts across left and right \u2013 requires no less. But crucial tests must be passed. We should not hurt ourselves more than the looters have by moving to a vengeful police state and creating a new, more bitter class of dispossessed. Above all, we must do what works. This requires a recognition that we examine our society in the round. It all connects. The wellbeing of the top and middle depends on the relative wellbeing and opportunities of those at the bottom. Societies cohere or they perish. England on this score fares astonishingly badly. Our social housing estates are, in Lynsey Hanley's words, vast people lockers. Once in, very few move out. A third of the bottom 10% of wage earners in 2001/2, reports the Work Foundation's Bottom 10 Million programme, were still there in 2008/9. Once unemployed, you are twice as likely to stay unemployed. It is utterly demoralising, but those at the bottom are emotionally ill equipped to deal with a world of permanent knockbacks and refusals. As an American study has shown, by three-and-a-half a child of a welfare family has cumulatively heard many, many fewer words than a middle-class child \u2013 and a tenth of the words of encouragement. Meanwhile, the better off have become ever better at \"opportunity hoarding\" \u2013 securing the places at the best schools (often by buying them)and, through their networks, securing the internships now so crucial for job offers. Is this fair? The luck of birth ever more determines life chances \u2013 the experience of many of those who went on the destructive rampage last week. They speak the truth when they say there is nothing for them. It is not an excuse: it is a social reality that requires redress. But the prime minister and his government are sure of the diagnosis. Resisting an independent inquiry that might argue differently, the solution is a police-led crackdown, they say, reinforced by social security penalties on the criminality of a feral underclass \u2013 and we should all be grateful that David Cameron flew back from holiday to put some spine into what until then was a lily-livered response. The rest of Britain is in good health, they add. Moreover, it accepts the need for a massive roll-back of the state \u2013 including the police whose capability will allegedly be unaffected by a 20% reduction in police budgets \u2013 to retain a triple-A credit rating on our relatively low national debt. Already the police leadership is challenging this narrative; vengeful policing as the arm of a politicised police state but with far fewer resources is doomed to make matters worse. But the rest of us should make common cause. What happened last week was enormous, and it requires a better thought-through response than Mr Cameron's. Of course the unprecedented rapidity and severity of the spending cuts \u2013 on everything from educational maintenance allowances to youth clubs and the police \u2013 have contributed to the malaise and must make matters worse. But they are not its cause, which runs deeper still. Britain's credit rating \u2013 which the spending cuts are aimed to preserve \u2013 is a means, not an end. We need to understand what constitutes fairness: that we should receive our due dessert in proportion to our contribution \u2013 and society has a duty to mitigate the good and bad luck that comes its members' way through no merit or fault of their own. And then we need to act to create the capitalism and society that lives these values from the top to the bottom. It will be a Britain that has recovered its purpose; a prospect in which to believe \u2013 and one less likely to be disfigured by last week's riots. Henry Porter: 'We will wear the great shame of these riots for a very long time' People who were abroad over the last 10 days will return to a different country from the one they left. England has been changed, perhaps permanently, by what has happened. The confidence we had in the basic success of our society was shattered, together with the idea that we could always muddle through, getting more right than we did wrong \u2013 because of our innate decency and tolerance. The riots have delivered as great a shock to England as the home-grown suicide bombers did in 2005. Actually, last week may be even more shocking because we have no one else to blame \u2013 no foreign extremist ideology to hand, no external threat of any kind. This was ours to own \u2013 a materialist, ugly, violent Olympiad of lawlessness, mortifyingly laid bare for the world to see. We go round in circles obsessively describing it, but there are as yet no completely adequate explanations, nothing that encompasses the whole dreadful episode. However, we can be sure that along with the burning buildings, our self-esteem and the certainty about who we were also went up in smoke. It doesn't matter if you tend towards the school of thought that says this was the result of years of corrosive liberal lassitude, or the opposing view that insists we got here after years of economic neglect and privation \u2013 the fact remains that our society produced students, apprentices, school workers, middle-aged men with steady jobs, mothers, fathers and kids as young as 11 who all joined organised gangs to loot and burn down their neighbourhoods. This was us at our very worse, and it is significant that while the riots spread to cathedral cities and market towns, they did not cross England's borders to Wales and Scotland, a fact that will certainly encourage a sense of differentiation in both countries. Nor did they take light in the Muslim community, which in Birmingham produced a heroic self-discipline in the face of a terrible loss, something that should go a long way to redeeming the legacy of 7/7. To be caught up in a riot \u2013 as I was in Brixton 30 years ago and in Los Angeles in 1992 \u2013 is terrifying. But the fear is soon followed by anger and shame, because one of the key experiences of a riot is that it is demeaning to see people behave so badly. You come to doubt humanity itself, which is especially hard if those you are watching represent a pretty wide demographic of your fellow citizens. We always knew about the English vices \u2013 the binge drinking, the cases of child cruelty, the bullying and yobbishness \u2013 but somehow we maintained the illusion of a mature English order. That is no longer feasible, and without this important myth, we are going to find it much more difficult to define ourselves and face the world. The riots will be at the back of our minds for years to come and we will wear their shame for a very long time indeed for this reason \u2013 quite a lot of what happened was avoidable and specifically not the product of despair and economic hardship. The greed and opportunism on display in Britain will seem incredible to those around the world who have so much less than we do. Imagine the disbelief of the tens of thousands who have risked torture and death by demonstrating every day for freedom in Syria. Our rioters must seem like a lot of spoilt children. It seems extreme to say that we are all implicated, but we elected the politicians who ignored problems such as the growth of gangs, benefit dependency and the pockets of despair in our cities. And we allowed our society to become cynical and contemptuous of old values, a trend which is apparent from the celebrity-obsessed media to the sneering tone in so much of the public discourse. We failed to hold those at the top of the pile to account for the lapse of standards and their hypocrisy \u2013 politicians, bankers and journalists have all been guilty of serious abuse, but few have felt the full force of the law in the way that rioters are now. That also applies to the behaviour of the police, which I will come to later, but the general point is that public opinion was lax on some matters and found no way of making itself felt on others. This should change. The choice we have is this: either we do the hard thinking about our society, top to bottom, or we simply limit our understanding of these events to an epidemic of criminality. The latter is easy enough because people's behaviour was utterly inexcusable, and those on the streets looting, terrorising and burning knew perfectly well that they were doing wrong. One only has to look at the sorry procession of rioters going through the courts to know that. There were no clenched fists of defiance, just gormless opportunists who had been caught with a looted TV, power tools, trainers or new electronic keyboard. The ones I saw in Westminster magistrates court could barely articulate their thoughts, let alone any ideological creed. These people are going to be treated much more harshly. Society has lost patience with them and in this \"fight back\" there will be much that is unfair and indiscriminate. Right or wrong, that impatience is likely to affect attitudes found in police stations, benefit offices, housing departments, social services and the courts. People will be made to take responsibility for the lives and actions, even if that is sometimes unjust and they have not the slightest experience of doing so. This isn't an easy issue \u2013 we are pulled first one way, then the other. But the worry must be that we fail to comprehend the intricate causes of this episode \u2013 the lack of self worth and hope in the youths who jumped at the opportunity to run riot \u2013 and more importantly the behaviour of the police, who rather astonishingly have become the heroes of the hour. There remain serious questions about the killing of Mark Duggan in Tottenham and the investigation by Independent Police Complaints Commission, which leaked that Mr Duggan had fired, when he hadn't. From the point of view of youths, who are routinely harassed by police stop-and-search operations and who know that police evidence presented in inner-city courts is often cooked up, it looked very much like an extra-judicial killing. The police were slow to react and despite the bravery of the available officers, the disturbance got out of control, to the degree that some even believe the Met held back to make their point about the effect of government cuts. This cannot be true but the response was inadequate and the command flawed, and one has to wonder if the reaction had been faster whether this shaming disorder would have spread across the country. In these circumstances, it perhaps behoves the police to display far less indignation when it comes to claiming responsibility for regaining order last week than they have. But we are where we are. There's a long way to go before English society regains its self-respect, and that will only happen if we allow reason to edge out fear."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
