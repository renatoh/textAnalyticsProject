The industrious rapper from Peckham \u2013 AKA Nathaniel Thompson \u2013 kicked off 2019 by releasing his fifth album, Big Bad, a sprawling 18-track field study of urban life and strife delivered in his distinctive, unhurried and often seismic baritone. Featuring guest spots from local fixtures (Labrinth, Wretch 32) and US imports (Lil Yachty, Swizz Beatz), it confirmed the 36-year-old\u2019s status as UK rap\u2019s self-assured kingpin. In April, Giggs joined his admiring collaborator Drake on stage at one of the latter\u2019s O2 extravaganzas; this current tour will conclude with his own headline show at Wembley Arena. On a subzero night in Glasgow, it is a relatively stripped-back experience: just Giggs prowling back and forth in a black T-shirt, trackie bottoms and an eye-catching gold medallion that would not look out of place in Raiders of the Lost Ark. Despite the venue\u2019s toweringly high roof, the packed room thrums with the energy of a basement club night. An early highlight is Terminator, a martial advance of regal fanfares and dense drum fills, featuring doomy warnings to would-be rivals looking to move up the food chain. It sets a rolling, relentless tone as Giggs daisy-chains tracks together, with only the occasional pit stop to address the crowd and sip what looks like a pint of Guinness. \u201cThis is the exercise segment!\u201d he shouts cheerily as the beats crank up. Grime MC JME makes an unexpected guest appearance for the strident 2015 track Man Don\u2019t Care, perhaps the prickliest song ever to mention digestive biscuits. On newer track Baby, Giggs is more playful, test-driving chat-up lines over an addictive bass hook. There is a noticeable audience leap at the opening bars of KMT, his collaboration with Drake \u2013 while the crowd loyally echo that hit\u2019s sporadic \u201cOK, OK\u201d refrain, they are also word-perfect on Lock Doh, Giggs\u2019s sonically sparse but lyrically saucy ode to abundant romance. It is the stealthy standout in a crammed, rambunctious hour, and its theme of being in-demand suits him well. \u2022 At O2 Victoria Warehouse, Manchester, on 3 December. Then touring until 6 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
