It read: \u201cWe Choose Love.\u201d The voters of Pinellas county, the biggest and most significant swing county in Florida, had just helped Trump into the White House after backing Barack Obama in two straight elections, and as the day wore on, Oliver\u2019s parishioners joined him in the street with signs echoing his message. \u201cI knew a lot of people were afraid of what was to come. People of color, LBGTQ people, those that practice a different religion, people who live in the margins of society,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had seen some threats, but we didn\u2019t know then what this Trump presidency was going to bring.\u201d Now, with Trump announcing his 2020 re-election bid on Tuesday just 100 miles to the east in Orlando, and with Pinellas set once again to play a pivotal role in that election, Oliver\u2019s church in the historic Allendale neighborhood close to downtown St Pete is a hive of activity. Rainbow-colored Pride banners, Black Lives Matter and Co-exist flags hang outside meeting rooms, nurses gather to discuss collective bargaining rights, affordable housing advocates plot their lobbying strategies - all community groups doing what Oliver calls \u201cthe work of the resistance\u201d. \u201cWe decided as a church to open our space to any group doing work for justice in the community,\u201d he said. \u201cAdvocating healthcare for all, advocacy work around what people of color are experiencing, gun reform, women\u2019s reproductive rights, all those things that are under threat right now.\u201d And while the pastor says the activism is social rather than political \u2013 \u201cwe\u2019d organize equally as hard if a Republican championed these values,\u201d he insists \u2013 the target is unmistakable. Even the public messages on the church\u2019s marquee, which have occasionally landed Oliver in hot water, are focused directly on controversies that Trump has fomented: \u201cWhite Supremacy is the real crisis,\u201d read one, and at Christmas: \u201cWe can\u2019t worship the child in the manger while turning our backs on the child at the border.\u201d \u201cThe best thing about the Trump presidency is that he has motivated a lot of people to pay attention and work together and find tangible ways to love each other,\u201d Oliver said. If history is any guide, whichever way Pinellas county voters swing next November will decide if Trump wins another four years in the White House. The heavily populated county at the western end of Florida\u2019s I-4 corridor has backed every winning presidential candidate, five Republicans and four Democrats, since 1980, the anomaly of the 2000 election excepted. It was also the largest of only four Florida counties, out of 67, that swung to Trump in 2016 after supporting Obama in the two previous contests. \u201cTrump won Pinellas by barely 1% so it\u2019s not like we\u2019re in the middle of a red county,\u201d said Barbara Scott, chair of the Pinellas Democratic party. \u201cThe county is a swatch of America. In St Pete, you could easily be in California \u2013 they lean left big time. In the north part of the county there are a lot of retirees, people who are older, more conservative, and in the middle you have this mix, the older population and young families, who are 30s to 50s. \u201cWe\u2019ve pushed south Pinellas, I believe, strongly to be blue, and the middle part is now leaning really blue. And we\u2019re going to turn the north part of this county purple. That\u2019s our plan to deliver Pinellas in 2020.\u201d For Democrats hoping to oust Trump, recent developments have been positive. Charlie Crist, a former state governor, reversed 33 years of Republican dominance to flip Florida\u2019s 13th congressional district, incorporating the lower two-thirds of Pinellas county, in 2016. In last year\u2019s midterms, the county went blue again by backing Andrew Gillum and Bill Nelson in their ultimately unsuccessful statewide campaigns for the governor\u2019s mansion and US Senate seat respectively. Scott, however, insists there is no room for complacency, and soon after becoming county chair following the midterms called together party leaders of neighboring Tampa Bay area counties to discuss strategy for 2020 and beyond in what she calls the \u201cbay blue bloc\u201d. \u201cI knew we could do more,\u201d she said. \u201cThe Democrat is not going to get elected by just commenting on how horrible a president Donald Trump is.\u201d A coordinated campaign focused on ground-level canvassing, Scott believes, will be crucial, and activists are already knocking on doors months before a Democrat is even nominated to challenge Trump. \u201cGrassroots is grassroots is grassroots,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re canvassing Democrats who didn\u2019t vote in the midterms, or maybe 2016, and we\u2019re asking \u2018hey, what issues are important to you, what issues would encourage you to vote for a candidate?\u2019, so we can focus our targets for next year when we have that candidate.\u201d Steve Schale, a Democratic strategist who was Obama\u2019s Florida campaign chair, believes the county is crucially significant. \u201cIn 08 and 12, Obama\u2019s first real general election campaigning in Florida was both times in Pinellas, and that wasn\u2019t accidental,\u201d he said. \u201cI hesitate to say the person who wins Pinellas wins Florida, but it\u2019s hard to see a scenario where a Democrat loses Pinellas but wins Florida. \u201cPinellas now is a very expensive place to live, so there is that squeeze on people. One of the things we leaned into with Obama was his plan to reform the tax code by cutting middle-class taxes.\u201d Republicans locally agree on the importance of the economy and voters\u2019 personal finances when it comes to making a decision, but believe that works in Trump\u2019s favor. \u201cPinellas proved that you could have a Republican president with a message that reaches the blue-collar, working-class Democrat,\u201d said Anthony Pedicini, a senior GOP strategist and adviser. \u201cThe strategy has to be the proof to those white, male Democratic blue-collar voters that the economy is better, that their situation in life is better, they\u2019re making more money and able to invest in their families and their futures, and that President Trump is the one helping them to do that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
