Sadly, the question is pretty much rhetorical. We fly to Europe more often and more cheaply than ever before, but many Britons rarely see the point of learning another language. Indeed, the government let them off the hook two years ago in abolishing the requirement to learn a foreign language at GCSE level. Languages are perceived as difficult, so less confident pupils tend to drop them. Headteachers, mindful of their position in school league tables, have little incentive to persuade them otherwise. So no one cheered when Jim Knight, the schools minister, reported that while GCSE entries in modern languages had fallen - by 14% in German and 13% in French - grades were improving. It would have been appalling if they had not. Mr Knight also reported that the number of pupils studying Arabic and Mandarin is increasing, and the fact that more than 300 additional students sat GCSE Arabic last year than in 2004 is promising. But it does not begin to compensate for the overall decline. This year's improvements in the A*-C pass rates for English and maths are welcome. The government has listened to business complaints about school leavers' struggles with literacy and numeracy. And as the Association of Graduate Recruiters has found, most big companies do not rate competence in a foreign language as important, preferring skills such as team-working and oral communication. However, university language departments are alarmed. Pupils without a foreign language GCSE do not go on to study a language at A-level. They have already ruled out a degree involving a foreign language because faculties demand some evidence of linguistic ability. The Department of Education insists modern language teaching is in a \"period of transition\" and that the requirement for all primary school children to have the chance to learn a language by 2012 will eventually bear fruit. True, students on postgraduate courses in primary teaching are now being encouraged to learn to teach the basics. But the postgraduate class of 2011 will have fewer linguists than ever before. What is more, picking up rudimentary French - and it is nearly always French - is a waste of time if a child has to spend the first two years of secondary school waiting for their classmates to catch up. Similarly, a smattering of Chinese is next to useless if pupils have no opportunity to revisit the subject later on - which is unlikely, unless they are lucky enough to attend one of the 60 specialist language colleges that teach Mandarin. More sophisticated setting in the early years of secondary school is necessary if children are to make any progress. There are high hopes for the Languages Ladder, which offers short and digestible language courses for learners of all ages. By next month a few learners will be able to choose from up to 21 languages, although the lack of good teaching materials for the more obscure languages is currently a large obstacle to success. The irony is that students have more opportunity to read and listen to languages than ever before. Thanks to the internet, the days of re-reading the same textbooks and relying on stock tapes of Spanish conversation are over. Learning a language nurtures precisely the communication skills that employers say they value. That is why the government should make amends for its misguided decision to sideline foreign languages at GCSE by giving undergraduates an incentive to take up practical language classes. In the meantime, universities need to say that they value language A-levels. Business is not the only arbiter of the value of learning languages: if we struggle to understand debates going on throughout the rest of the world, Britain suffers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
