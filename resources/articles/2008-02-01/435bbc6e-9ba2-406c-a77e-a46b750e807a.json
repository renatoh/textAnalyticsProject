The world and his four wives appear to have weighed in on this one - it's \"Don't Get Your Niqab In A Twist\" all over again - and every man jack of them seem to have forgotten a fairly important fact. That is, that the UK passed the Human Rights Act in 1998, and that even if this act were to be repealed we would still be subject to the European Convention on Human Rights. (In fact, the HRA98 was actually passed more or less with the specific goal of cutting down on the number of cases that were being taken directly to the very costly Strasbourg process). So even if Sheikh Omar Bakri were to be elected Prime Minister in 2010 and to pass the Sharia (Implementation of) Act 2011, then it would still have to be consistent with the ECHR. The first person to be sentenced to be stoned to death for adultery would appeal, the Sharia Act would be found to be in breach of the Human Rights Act 1998, and the law would fall apart. Or if the Rt Hon Sheikh Omar Bakri MP were to have the wit to repeal the HRA first, they would appeal directly to the European Court of Human Rights which would find the Sharia Act in breach of the ECHR, and the House of Lords would therefore rule that the Sharia Act was invalid. That's the way constitutional law works in the UK these days. So more realistically, whatever system of institutionalised sharia the Rt Rev Rowan is anticipating, we know that it's going to have to be one that is compatible with European human rights law, particularly with regard to not discriminating between individuals on grounds of sex, race, religion or lack thereof or sexual orientation. Any attempt on the part of sharia courts to implement a version of sharia which discriminates against women would simply end up as a nice little earner for Matrix Chambers and Ms Cherie Booth QC. So having squared that away, can we return to the debate over the rights and responsibilities of religious minorities and/or the position of religion in civil society, without getting it quite so tangled up in groundless doomsday scenarios please? Thought not. Ah well, have fun. For more on the debate on Islamic law, click here"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
