But he doesn\u2019t always like other people to see him play golf \u2013 which would explain the black plastic bags covering the windows at the Trump National Jupiter golf club: to keep out reporters\u2019 prying eyes. On Saturday, the president hosted the Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe, at his Palm Beach golf club for some diplomatic links, after the pair met for talks in the White House on Friday. Reporters who had tagged along for the trip were surprised to discover that they were to remain holed up in a clubhouse basement \u2013 with no way to glimpse what was happening on the course outside. Jennifer Jacobs, a White House reporter for Bloomberg, tweeted: \u201cTrump\u2019s press corps has been placed in a basement suite at Jupiter golf club. Black plastic over windows to give Trump privacy as he golfs.\u201d Jill Colvin of the AP also tweeted a picture of the makeshift coverings. A White House pool report said: \u201cPhotographers were instructed not to take pictures on the grounds of a \u2018private club\u2019.\u201d Japanese reporters were also unable to see Trump and Abe in action. After about four hours at the club, Trump, who once memorably described himself as \u201cthe best putter\u201d, tweeted a picture of himself and the Japanese leader on the golf course. \u201cHaving a great time hosting Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the United States,\u201d Trump wrote. No jacket for the president on Saturday: Trump was bedecked in a white T-shirt and white baseball cap. Abe wore cream pants and a navy shirt, and the pair appeared to be high-fiving. Abe said had been looking forward to his golf game for some time \u2013 and he opted for some time-honored flattery of his US counterpart by suggesting his command of the clubs wasn\u2019t a patch on Trump\u2019s. \u201cI am looking forward for our weekend in Florida with Donald,\u201d Abe said. \u201cMy scores in golf is not up to the level of Donald at all.\u201d The Japanese PM did, however, cast himself as a man who eschewed the conservative approach. \u201cMy policy is never up, never in \u2013 always aiming for the cup.\u201d As for the result of the leaders\u2019 game, reporters remained in the dark."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
