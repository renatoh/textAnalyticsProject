The world's most popular search engine has turned its attention to the problem of digging out scholarly gems from the mass of material thrown up by its internet searches. The new scheme builds on the DSpace \"superarchive\" developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and now copied by more than 100 universities, including Cambridge, to hold academic papers, technical reports, drafts of articles, and other work by an institution's academic staff. Because these archives store papers before they are published in expensive journals, they are seen as a major step towards freer publication and the circulation of ideas. Cranfield University, which does most of its research geared to business and industry, was one of the universities to use the DSpace model, but wanted to make its research better known. As Simon Bevan, the university's systems information manager, commented today: \"You can make papers available electronically, but are people going to find them? Because everybody uses Google, papers are suddenly far more accessible and usable and retrievable.\" He added: \"It is a means for us to spread the word about Cranfield, for business to buy into our work and find out what we do.\" Mr Bevan admits some academic staff at Cranfield and other participating universities have been reluctant to put their work into the DSpace archive - partly because of the extra work involved and partly concern about exposing pre-publication articles to public scrutiny before they have been refereed (and often substantially altered). \"A lot of universities found resistance by academics to doing this work. Hopefully this will encourage our academics to submit their work and they will benefit.\" Google is being linked to the universities via a search process set up by the Online Computer Library Center (OCLC) a non-profit computer library service based in Dublin, Ohio. A pilot test of the project is just getting under way. If all goes as planned, the search feature could appear on Google in a few months, MacKenzie Smith, associate director of technology for MIT's libraries, told the Chronicle of Higher Education. \"A lot of times the richest scholarly literature is buried. As more and more content is on the web, it's harder and harder to find the high-quality stuff that you need,\" she said. The participating universities have tagged all the materials in their superarchives with \"metadata tags\" - hidden codes that contain catalogue information and summaries - that can help a search engine like Google's sort through the material. The universities involved in the pilot are the Australian National University, Cornell, Cranfield, European University Institute, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis, Minho, Ohio State, Parma, University of Arizona, Calgary, Oregon, Rochester, Toronto, University of Washington, Wisconsin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
