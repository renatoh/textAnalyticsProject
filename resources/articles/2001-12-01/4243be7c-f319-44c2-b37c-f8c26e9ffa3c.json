Here we don't hurry, never worry?' I could only nod dazedly. I was beyond speech. We were eating lobster and drinking fruit punch in the sun. On a catamaran. In the Caribbean. Surely I'd died and gone to heaven. Marise gazed about with satisfaction and continued to eulogise her native island. 'Not like a big city here, not like London. I tell you, that place is too fast. Me, when I go, I prefer staying with my cousins in Slough. St Martin is like Slough, no? Very chilled place, everyone happy?' I looked around at the expanse of golden beach as the azure sea gently lapped at my feet and the rainbow-coloured fish darted just below the surface. Slough didn't immediately spring to mind, but I was loth to disagree with my charming hostess. It was time for another dip in the ridiculously blue sea, not a debate about the merits of Slough. Physically, mentally, I was a million miles away. My first foray to the Caribbean; I envisaged stepping into the Lilt ad, skipping along sandy beaches screeching: 'Totally tropical' at the top of my voice. St Martin was far more refined than that; it was positively grand. One almost had to dress up for breakfast in the hotel, and I even saw someone wearing a bejewelled sarong to the pool. But attire like this is pretty par for the course in La Samanna, hotel of choice for celebrities and the financially advantaged. I wandered through my suite attempting to find something amiss, anything to pass critical comment on. 'Aha. This is my least favourite type of basin.' But no, both bathrooms were up to my exacting standards, my massive balcony enjoyed unbroken views of the sparkling sea and the enormous living- room was long enough for a truly satisfying skid, should anyone think of risking their gem-encrusted sarong in such a manner. Such a palatial suite deserved a suitably majestic occupant, so I pretended to be the reincarnation of former guest Jackie Kennedy Onassis, and swanned down to the beach in oversized sunglasses and turban. Should the powder-fine sand, convenient beach bar and delightfully warm seas fail to enchant you, there are all sorts of water sports on offer at La Samanna - diving, sailing, jet-skiing - and an array of bronzed gods and goddesses to instruct you. There's also a fitness centre, a yoga instructor and a brand new spa to keep you fully entertained without ever having to leave the immaculate grounds. However, I was far too busy being Jackie O to do anything but sip my daiquiri and concentrate on looking enigmatic. I was missing one essential St Martin accessory that Jackie would never leave home without: a brand new husband. This is a hot spot for honeymooners, and La Samanna is the perfect place to celebrate your nuptials in style. But you'll have to navigate St Martin's split political personality before you go up the aisle. At only 37 miles square, this is the smallest territory in the world to be under the jurisdiction of two countries. So you land in Sint Maarten, part of the Netherlands Antilles, but a couple of miles up the road and suddenly you're in St Martin, part of the French Caribbean. Due to complex French residency requirements, weddings take place on the more liberal Dutch side. Two distinct languages, currencies and cultures have co-existed since 1648, and everyone seems to muddle along happily. The entire island is duty-free, so you can stock up on the latest haute couture or bling-bling diamond rings in the French capital, Marigot, or the Dutch one, Philipsburg. After exercising your credit card in the designer stores you can recharge in one of the local 'Lolo' restaurants along the seafront. The local fare is top-class home cooking Caribbean-style but if you're a bit of a gourmand, you can eat like a king on St Martin. The French influence is especially evident in the superb cuisine on offer in restaurants like Le Chanteclair in Marigot, or in La Samanna's own eatery. Who needs a new husband when you can eat lobster all day? They've got holidays down to a fine art on St Martin. Golden beaches, sunshine all year, watersports, golf, horse riding, deep-sea fishing - you name it, you can try it here. Tourism is the main source of income for the islanders, and everyone is exceptionally hospitable and welcoming; schoolchildren stopped their games to wave as I was driven past their rather dilapidated school and the hotel gardener solicitously inquired whether Madame was 'feeling well rested' every morning. I'd never been so well rested in my life, but I affected a sad smile and a whispered: 'Quite well, thank you' in the manner of Jackie, mid-marital crisis. The red-carpet treatment certainly helped with my own VIP fantasy, but it also reminded me that I was the odd one out , the wannabe with a cheap sarong in the exotic playground for wealthy Peter Pans. I was the wide-eyed arriviste without a numbered account to my name on the magic island where all your holiday fantasies can come true, and all major credit cards are accepted. Spend your life in a pinstriped suit, but secretly yearn for the simple life? You can pretend you're Robinson Crusoe and sail to the tiny island of Tintamarre and recover from the shipwreck under a palm tree. No need to fashion hunting spears from driftwood - lunch will be fresh conch and rum punch, rustled up by the excellent chef who travels back and forth daily to cook sumptuous meals for would-be castaways. If home is in a concrete jungle, play at being Tarzan and hike through the verdant Pic Paradis, or impersonate an eco-warrior with the acerbic TJ at La Loterie farm, and tut-tut when he points out the villas and deluxe hotels standing in a former rainforest. Or you could just lie by the pool all day instead. The moment you get even slightly overheated, a courteous waiter will be on hand with iced water and chilled fruit kebabs. So, was this paradise regained in St Martin? I contemplated this taxing question over another poolside daiquiri. I could say that I found it all a bit Caribbean-Lite - a sanitised, manicured sojourn in the sun, with just a dash of European and Caribbean spice. I could say that, but it would be a nit-picking comment that would be made only by the sort of person who doesn't usually holiday with the high rollers, but backpacks with the impoverished. The sort of person who deserves a fortnight in a malarial swamp, burning leeches from her gangrenous limbs if she forgets all the wet Monday mornings slumped on the Tube, dreaming of being somewhere just like St Martin. If you've got deep pockets and a permanent tan, you know all about St Martin already. If you're getting married, La Samanna is probably top of your honeymoon wish-list. If you deserve the holiday of a lifetime, then go now. Golden beaches, scarlet lobsters and blue skies await. It's as damn near heaven as you can get in this lifetime and no, Marise, it's nothing at all like Slough.
