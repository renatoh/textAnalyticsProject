Last week I was at a primary school in Birmingham where a troupe of RSC actors were performing a pared-down version of both parts of Henry IV and Henry V as part of the RSC\u2019s ongoing First Encounter initiative that introduces pre-secondary school children to Shakespeare. The Famous Victories of Henry V was a genuinely lively affair and for the most part the children seemed gripped by the story of young prince Hal growing from boy to warrior king. Director Owen Horsley may have compressed the story into 90 minutes but this wasn\u2019t the Henrys-lite. The language was all Shakespeare\u2019s; the themes, humour and emotional undercurrents survived intact and the acting was excellent. Just at a more manageable length for the under-11s. I reckon that no child is too young to get a taste of Shakespeare. The earlier the better, because as with quadratic equations and algebra, too often a fear factor sets in with Shakespeare alongside an idea that it\u2019s going to be difficult to understand and boring. Definitely before children have been exposed to the misguided idea that Shakespeare is primarily there to be studied to pass exams rather than to entertain. Oily Cart once produced a show called In a Pickle, inspired by The Winter\u2019s Tale for the under fives, and it was very lovely. No, it wasn\u2019t Shakespeare\u2019s The Winter\u2019s Tale, but it was a prompt for a lifelong journey exploring the plays. Both my kids were lucky enough to benefit from the Globe family performances, a workshop and activities followed by the chance to see the second half of one of the productions in the season. It\u2019s a reminder that when it comes to seeing Shakespeare a bit of pre-performance preparation doesn\u2019t go amiss. My youngest rated seeing Shakespeare at the Tobacco Factory\u2019s Twelfth Night right up there with The Lion King, which is of course a version of Hamlet. But as Michael Coveney pointed out in his review of the RSC\u2019s Famous Victories, Helen Mirren would not approve of such early exposure to Shakespeare. A couple of months ago Helen Mirren, no mean performer of Shakespeare herself, suggested that children should first see a Shakespeare play at the age of 13 or 14 and should be banned from reading Shakespeare until they are 15 or so. I can see where\u2019s she\u2019s coming from \u2013 there is nothing so alluring to teenagers as something they are not supposed to access, and brings to mind the image of pages of Romeo and Juliet and King Lear being sold illegally on street corners. But I reckon that just as learning a language comes easier the earlier you begin, so Shakespeare is best encountered young when you are without prejudice. The RSC\u2019s First Encounters initiative reminds that Shakespeare shouldn\u2019t be a struggle for children but a genuine pleasure."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
