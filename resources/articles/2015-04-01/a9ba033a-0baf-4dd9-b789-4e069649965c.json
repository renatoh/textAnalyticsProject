Naturally it\u2019s great to be having a fight with the Ferraris. I think for us as a team \u2013 and I think still today that Mercedes are still the best and we are working as hard as we can to keep up with this momentum that we have \u2013 that they are pushing very hard to close up. The closest his rivals came to the world champion on track, however, was as he exited the pits from his first stop, a moment he acknowledged was key in the race. \u201cI think I had a decent gap and then all of a sudden I was coming out of the pits and they were right there,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think I had a fairly slow pit stop and naturally that\u2019s really why, I guess, the gap closed up. \u201cI came out of the pits, braking into turn one and I saw them in my left mirror and I\u2019m like: \u2018Oh my God, this is close.\u2019 But it was so much fun. Really good fun.\u201d His team-mate Nico Rosberg, who was pipped for second by Kimi Raikkonen at the end, was philosophical in turn about what had been a tough race. Having lost a position to Raikkonen at the start he was determined to come back. \u201cI felt that the car was awesome, so went full on the attack straight away and was happy to get by Kimi and Sebastian [Vettel],\u201d he said. \u201cGreat fight with them, that was very exciting at that point in time. Then dropped back again behind Sebastian after a pit stop so had to get him over and over again.\u201d Rosberg confirmed it was a brake problem that allowed Raikkonen to slip past on the penultimate lap. \u201cUnfortunately I was struggling with brakes a little bit throughout the whole race and just lost them.\u201d he said. \u201cTwo laps from the end I lost the brakes, so I went straight on and had to carry the car home for the last two laps.\u201d But it is perhaps Raikkonen who will come away best pleased from Bahrain. His contract concludes this year and he has been told by Ferrari\u2019s team principal, Maurizio Arrivabene, that any discussions about him re-signing with the Scuderia depend on his on-track performance. Hence there were reasons to be very optimistic after he finished in second while his team-mate, Vettel, came home fifth. \u201cWe had decent speed today. I think we just have to keep working and improving the whole package,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure we will get there and we can fight every weekend after that. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with the team and I think many people didn\u2019t expect after last year that we would be in this position this early.\u201d \u201cThe whole package has gone forward,\u201d he added. \u201cA big chunk of it is the engine but you cannot give all the credit to them. The car has improved a lot, there\u2019s a lot more down force, it\u2019s handling a lot better. People are working more closely, which has helped us get to where we have now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
