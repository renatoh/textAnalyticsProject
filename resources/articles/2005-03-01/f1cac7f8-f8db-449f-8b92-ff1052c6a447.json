I was a sailor in the Greek merchant navy for years before becoming a chef and, during that time, I completely fell for the sea, for its strange mix of beauty and danger. Cooking in my London restaurants satisfies my creativity but still I have this need to escape the bustle, to let out my anarchic side, to sail away from civilisation. I was brought up in Athens but spent 22 years away from Greece, and it was only once I'd returned that I realised the essential nature of all Greeks: we're flirty, sociable and we love spending time in places that are difficult to get to. I return about 10 times a year to visit my family and source food for my restaurants, and twice a year I indulge my passion for sailing. A group of up to six of us take out a friend's boat - a beautiful 49-footer called Larne. Our days tend to follow a certain pattern, and once the morning's sailing is complete I can indulge my other passion: gathering and preparing our food for the day. We only take dry goods on board at the beginning of our two weeks, and perhaps some tomatoes. The rest is dictated by what we can find on our travels. I bake the bread and we fish off the side of the boat or on the rocks. We might even hunt the odd wild rabbit or catch an abandoned cockerel. There are wonderful greens to pick on the islands, like wild rocket that grows to a metre in height and is so peppery that it hits your palate like a punch. Sometimes, if we're lucky, we come across a tea plant. In the period of the full moon we take wicker baskets, attach corks to the side and then tie them to ourselves with a long string. Then we dive for sea urchin. At this time they are full of delicious eggs. Once we've gathered enough (it usually takes a couple of hours), we open them up, scoop out the eggs, bottle them in olive oil and lemon juice and serve them on bread for lunch. At dinner we sit on our boat underneath the constellations and start discussions that can go on for days. There is no electricity so we make do with moonlight, starlight and a tiny lamp to let other boats know our location. My favourite dinner is red mullet. The Mediterranean red mullet is smaller than the Atlantic one and has more flavour. There is no doubt that all fish from the smaller seas have more flavour to them. Greece hasn't got the infrastructure to make it accessible to everyone so there are endless places that haven't changed for 150 years, and it's easy to find small hidden bays and spend the day imagining you are on a deserted island. Some are dry and rocky where only oregano can grow, and you're hit by pungent waves of it. Others, such as the islands along the Turkish coast, are amazingly lush and the sea is a vivid turquoise. Nearly a third of all Greeks live in Athens but most have come from the islands or the countryside and they all have a couple of secret places. I love sailing because there are no roads to follow and, like most Greeks, I prefer the sea to the mountains. It can be hot sailing in the summer but, personally, I love the heat. That's why the heat in the kitchen doesn't bother me; give me 35 degrees and I'm at my best. If someone asked me, 'If you could do anything in your life what would you do?', the answer would be easy: I would design and build my own boat so that it could fit 15 to 20 tables on the deck. Then I would sail around the Greek coast, stopping at marinas and serving a few simple and delicious Greek dishes. If I could, I would do it tomorrow. My really Greek places Monemvass\u00eda This incredible Byzantine town, on a huge rock jutting off the coast of the Peloponnese, was once a bustling medieval seaport. People still live in the houses and it's an unspoilt Byzantine gem. Are\u00f3poli A formidable Peloponnese coastal town which was named after Ares, the god of war, for its efforts in the War of Independence, this is also the home of the best bread in Greece. They don't make it with yeast, just fermented flour and water which they let rise for nine hours, so it has a very strong taste. In September, when the wild quails migrate from Greece to North Africa, they make a wonderful stuffed quail bread. Kythira Known as the island of love - being the birthplace of Aphrodite - this is mythologised as a place that only the lucky few have succeeded in reaching. It's off the southern coast of the Peloponnese with rocky and wild plunging valleys and a mesmerising coastline: perfect for watching dramatic sunsets. It's also the ideal for birdwatchers because in September and October thousands of migrating birds settle on the mountains. The crabs and lobsters and wonderful. Kalavrita This is a beautiful town that sits against the backdrop of Mount Khelmos. The food is fabulous, and the area is covered with snow during the winter and is good for skiing. The island has a painful history - in the Second World War the Germans killed all the males living there, and you can still sense the legacy of the tragedy. Pelion A peninsula off the central Greek region of Thessaly, this has some of the best beaches in Greece and the landscape is characterised by lush forests and orchards. It produces wonderful food because of all the rare herbs that grow wild. Try Spedzofai, a casserole of sausage and pepper. Symi This small rocky island in the Dodecanese has a beautiful picturesque harbour town called Yialos. If you arrived and didn't know where you were, you might imagine you'd ended up in Venice. The island was occupied by the Italians for centuries and liberated after the Second World War but its Venetian architecture remains intact. It is great for walking and there are spectacular views from the forested plateau in the interior of the island. Thassos Thassos is home to the best shrivelled olives ever, and it's easy to reach as it's only a short boat ride from the mainland. There are picture-book beaches and it's surprisingly free from the large resorts that scar islands like Rhodes and Paros. It's very good for families because there are lots of facilities and it never gets very hot. Lesbos This large island in the eastern Aegean near Turkey has dense oak and pine forests. There is a good co-operative producing dry fruits and preserves and amazing olive oil, and they do a wonderful Greek version of Parmesan cheese called Ladotiri. It matures inside olive oil and is very peppery. The island also produces exceptional anchovies. Red mullet/Barbounia Serves 4 1kg red mullet; 200ml olive oil; salt; pepper; a small amount of flour; two sprigs of rosemary. Salt the fish and roll it in flour. Slowly heat the olive oil with the rosemary. Fry until both sides are brown. Serve with lemon wedges. Sea Urchin on toast Serves 4 A bunch of spring onions, chopped finely; a tablespoon of ouzo; 30ml lemon juice; a bunch of coriander, chopped finely; 100g ripe plum tomatoes, skinned and chopped finely; 100ml extra virgin olive oil; 30 sea urchin; 6 rustic bread slices. Combine the spring onions, ouzo, lemon juice, coriander, tomatoes and most of the olive oil in a bowl. Add the urchins and season with salt and pepper. Let this marinate while you grill the bread. Brush the bread slices with the remaining olive oil and grill over a medium heat until both sides are lightly coloured. Spread the sea urchins over the toast and serve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
