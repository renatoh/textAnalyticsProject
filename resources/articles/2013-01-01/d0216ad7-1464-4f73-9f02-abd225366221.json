I'm sure the supporters just want to see a committed performance and I'm not sure how committed they were once we conceded the second goal. There's no time to shirk your responsibilities. We're professional people: you've got to take the responsibility that goes with it.\" Chris Powell was delighted with his Charlton side's display. \"I think we've been very positive away from home this season. We were again today, and I think that showed.\" Millwall 0-2 Burnley Sean Dyche challenged his players to keep building on their three successive league wins after he made a winning first return to his old club as Burnley manager. \"It's good fun climbing the table like this: the feelgood factor is there. I want us to win as many games as possible and who knows where that can take us? That's the challenge. We're in the hunt right now.\" For Millwall it was a second defeat in three at home. \"We didn't do enough,\" said Kenny Jackett. \"Burnley showed more hunger and desire and that's disappointing. We started poorly, and we didn't defend well, not with everything we've got, not for our life, which is what we do when we're playing well. And the rest Nicola Zigic saved Birmingham from defeat at home to Brighton with a last-minute equaliser in their 2-2 draw. \u25a0 Derby and Nottingham Forest drew 1-1, Jamie Ward earning the home side a point. \u25a0 Ipswich and Barnsley also drew 1-1, with teenager Danny Rose heading an 89th-minute equaliser for the visitors. \u25a0 Bristol City manager Sean O'Driscoll's first game in charge ended in an away defeat at Leeds. \u25a0 Peterborough held in-form Hull to a 1-1 draw via midfielder Grant McCann's late penalty. \u25a0 Sheffield Wednesday's home game with Wolves ended goalless \u2013 Dean Saunders's side failing to record a single shot on target. \u25a0 And Watford thrashed Huddersfield 4-0, with Matej Vydra scoring twice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
