Ian Holloway, the Blackpool manager, is hopeful that the club can put together a new contract offer to prevent Taylor-Fletcher from following in the footsteps of Charlie Adam and David Vaughan, who have secured immediate returns to the Premier League following relegation. Adam joined Liverpool for \u00a37m, while David Vaughan was signed by Sunderland on a free transfer. Taylor-Fletcher joined Blackpool from Huddersfield Town in 2007 and the forward has played 145 games for Blackpool, scoring 23 times."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
