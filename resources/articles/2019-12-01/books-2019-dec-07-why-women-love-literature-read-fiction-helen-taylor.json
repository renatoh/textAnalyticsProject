Her preference is 19th-century novels. She likes to retreat to \u201cthe safety of the scroll and papyrus of earlier centuries\u201d. But in her claustrophobic community during Northern Ireland\u2019s Troubles, it marks her out as a threat. Even her best friend sees her habit as \u201cdisturbing\u201d, \u201cdeviant\u201d and \u201cnot public-spirited\u201d. The narrator is confused. \u201cAre you saying it\u2019s okay for him to go around with Semtex but not okay for me to read Jane Eyre in public?\u201d A woman doesn\u2019t need to have grown up amid sectarian violence to relate to the narrator\u2019s difficulties. Even in peacetime Bristol, where I occasionally flaunt my literacy in public \u2013 usually while stationary, but not always \u2013 I often run into difficulty. A woman reading a novel in a coffee shop, or on a park bench, or on public transport always runs the risk of someone \u2013 almost always a man \u2013 sidling over and asking: \u201cSo. A reader, huh?\u201d Or, maybe: \u201cHave you read any\u2026 um, um\u2026 Patrick O\u2019Brian?\u201d Or more likely, something completely un-novel-related. It\u2019s as if they assume I\u2019m bored, or sad, or killing time until a man absorbs my attention. Usually, I am reading for work \u2013 so hard to explain this to the interrupter without inviting further interruption! \u2013 and yet I can\u2019t help noticing that this never happens when I am on a laptop, when I might after all be doing something socially useful, perhaps involving a spreadsheet or a credit card. But if I am reading: who knows? There is something about the female bookworm, face obscured by a novel, hidden within plain sight, possibly pondering the bigger questions of life, possibly fantasising, that can serve as an affront. The onus has long been on women to facilitate easy human relations, and lone reading is an occupation that is not compatible with the social self. Damian Barr, author and founder of the Literary Salon in London, thinks that reading can still be a \u201crebellious and dangerous activity\u201d for women. \u201cThere are men who still find it threatening and dangerous when a woman picks up a book,\u201d he says. When he interviewed Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland, for his salon, he was appalled at the abuse she had received for talking about novels. \u201cPeople would say that reading fiction is not important, she should be running the country. Why is reading less valuable to a leader than, say, playing golf?\u201d This goes some way to explaining the depth of feeling expressed by the women surveyed in a new book by Helen Taylor, Why Women Read Fiction: The Stories of Our Lives (Oxford University Press). Taylor, emeritus professor of English at the University of Exeter, surveyed more than 400 female readers to see how they relate to fiction. The responses are striking in their violence and intensity, in the sin and guilt associated with reading, as well as the defiance. One mother described how she tells her family that she is going downstairs to sort the laundry just so she can steal 10 precious minutes with a novel. Another wrote that for her, reading novels was \u201cfractionally less important than breathing, but only just\u201d. Others fear being caught in the act. The idea that fiction is a female domain is taken for granted by most people involved in books. According to Nielsen Book Research, women outbuy men in all categories of novel except fantasy, science fiction and horror. And when men do read fiction, they don\u2019t tend to read fiction by women, while Taylor claims that women read and admire male novelists, rarely making value judgments. Women are not only keener buyers of fiction \u2013 surveys show they account for 80% of sales in the UK, US and Canadian fiction markets \u2013 far more women than men are literary festivalgoers, library members, audio book readers, literary bloggers, and members of literary societies and evening classes. It is also for the most part women who teach children to read, both at school and at home; and women who form book clubs \u2013 often actively shutting out men. Ian McEwan once wrote: \u201cWhen women stop reading, the novel will be dead.\u201d Back in 2005, he and his son culled the library of his London house and took stacks of books to a local park to give away. He said every woman he approached asked for three, whereas every man \u201cfrowned in suspicion, or distaste\u201d and usually said something like: \u201c\u2018Nah, nah. Not for me. Thanks, mate, but no.\u2019\u201d The history of fiction has always been a history of women readers. From the 18th century, the novel itself was aimed at a new class of leisured women, who didn\u2019t receive formal education in science or politics. The male writers and critics who wrote and appraised the first novels legitimised the form, but Taylor says they \u201cwere quickly overtaken by women writers of sensation and romance fiction. Women took to it as a way of learning about other lives, fantasising about their own relationships and narratives that allowed them to challenge their own subordinate position to men.\u201d Though there have been histories of women\u2019s reading, Taylor\u2019s spirited, engaging study is the first that tries to capture how fiction matters to contemporary women of different ages, classes and ethnic groups. She says that when she tells men the title of her book, they get defensive. \u201cThey say, \u2018But I read fiction too!\u2019 I say, \u2018I\u2019m sure that\u2019s true, but far fewer men do.\u2019 When I scratch beneath the surface to find out why they have read a certain novel, they never give me an emotional answer. It\u2019s always: \u2018Well, it\u2019s because I\u2019m very interested in stories about the first world war or the Victorian period.\u2019 Or they say they did history at university and want to follow up certain ideas. Or that they quite like to read Martin Amis because his characters are funny.\u201d Louise Doughty, author of nine novels, including the bestseller Apple Tree Yard, notes that her male readers often express \u2013 or possibly dress up \u2013 their admiration for her books \u201cas an act of anthropological research\u2026 One very sweet note from a man said, of Whatever You Love, \u2018I learned more about how women feel from your novel than I did from decades of research I commissioned in my job as an advertising executive.\u2019 The implication was he read it from a sincere desire to discover something \u2018other\u2019, rather than discovering a universal truth about human nature.\u201d Jonathan Coe, author of The Rotters\u2019 Club series, considers himself unusual in attracting an equal male-female readership. But he, too, feels that men and women seek different things from fiction. \u201cI dislike generalisations, as a rule,\u201d he tells me, \u201cbut if the male reader\u2019s choice is more thrillers or fantasy, while women are more likely to go for \u2018literary\u2019 fiction, that suggests to me that women read books to understand themselves, and men to escape themselves.\u201d Taylor says that it is rare to find men expressing the way in which reading has impacted on their emotional, spiritual and sexual lives. While her correspondents for the book frequently refer to how novels make them feel, their appetite for fiction is \u201cgluttonous\u201d and \u201comnivorous\u201d; one says she has a \u201cprint tooth\u201d and another likens reading to \u201csecret eating\u201d. William Thackeray called fiction \u201csweets\u201d \u2013 to ensure a balanced diet, he also recommended \u201croast\u201d, by which he meant nonfiction. It\u2019s surprising how enduring these puritanical associations have proved; fiction is still seen as \u201ca slippery slope to idle self-indulgence\u201d, as Taylor has it. One of her correspondents wrote: \u201chaving an affair is dangerous, masturbation requires solitude and privacy. Reading a book offers both without anyone noticing.\u201d Some readers are less restrained. Taylor\u2019s book includes Pierre-Antoine Baudoin\u2019s 1760 painting, La Lecture (The Reader), which depicts a young woman apparently masturbating with one hand while stroking the pages of a novel with the other. And while for many, reading is an intensely personal activity \u2013 \u201ca lifeline\u201d, \u201cmy best friend\u201d, \u201cthe love of my life\u201d \u2013 it is also an activity that women share with other women. The contemporary book group can trace a lineage back to 17th-century Bible study groups, 18th-century Parisian salons, as well as progressive suffrage groups where women have gathered together to self-educate. The sharing of reading is \u201csomething women undoubtedly do automatically in ways that are inter-generational, gregarious and collegiate,\u201d says Taylor. I\u2019m currently on at least four active WhatsApp threads about fiction with people who have no connection to the publishing world. There\u2019s my local book group of school mums exchanging messages about Madeline Miller\u2019s novel, Circe; my mum (a retired teacher) sending me pages from the Edith Wharton she\u2019s reading; a friend who has been weeping over Colson Whitehead\u2019s latest; and several about Elizabeth Strout\u2019s book, Olive Kitteridge, which I bought for two of my best friends. We send each other lines from the book that most resonate, and we have all recommended it to our mothers \u2013 and so the chain of bookish messages proliferates. Kate Mosse, novelist, playwright and founder director of the Women\u2019s prize for fiction, suggests that book clubs provide an excuse for women to spend guiltless time with their female friends. \u201c[It] has a sense of there being a purpose to it \u2013 it\u2019s not simply leisure \u2013 so women allow themselves to take time out of day-to-day life.\u201d Women also use books to gauge one another\u2019s aptness for friendship. \u201cFor me, if someone doesn\u2019t value Wuthering Heights (or thinks it overblown, or baggy, or too wild), then I like them just a tiny bit less.\u201d Sharmaine Lovegrove, publisher of Dialogue Books, recognises that women\u2019s book groups often act as \u201cgatekeepers of our culture\u201d. She made a conscious effort to start a different sort of reading club: she launched a year-long literature course, Rewriting the Canon, held at Liberty department store in London, with the aim of expanding the western canon to include more writers of colour. In collaboration with gal-dem magazine, she drew up a list that included Passing by Nella Larsen, Giovanni\u2019s Room by James Baldwin and Their Eyes Were Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston. It ended up looking very different from \u201cwomen sitting around drinking wine in Wiltshire or Richmond\u201d. It\u2019s striking how many women in Taylor\u2019s book talk about fiction giving them social mobility. A lot of her correspondents described themselves as having come from working-class or poor backgrounds where there were no books in their house, but through libraries, schools, friends and extended family, they had pulled themselves up. Being accepted as a good reader has long been one of the ways for women to achieve greater social status, Taylor says. Meanwhile, there are many female authors who understandably feel ambivalent about whether to embrace this bond with their female readership. Roxane Gay once noted that: \u201cMale writers get treated as intellectuals, women writers get treated as friends.\u201d Will their writing be dismissed as \u201cdomestic saga\u201d or \u201cchick lit\u201d? Will it be a sure route to pastel-coloured book jackets? Responding to a comment by Norwegian author Karl Ove Knausg\u00e5rd that \u201creading is feminine\u201d, novelist and essayist Siri Hustvedt took issue with the idea that the activity should somehow be \u201ctainted\u201d for being associated with women. It elides a historical double standard: literature is sidelined as a fey, womanly business; but for centuries only a privileged class of boys were taught literacy skills. Asked what she thought posed the biggest threat to literature, Hustvedt said: \u201cThat it becomes, in the eyes of culture, a highly feminised form. Far more women read fiction than men, and because of this, novels have become marginalised as serious texts.\u201d It\u2019s a prime concern to Mosse as founder of the Women\u2019s prize for fiction. \u201cImplicit in that is the idea that men\u2019s opinions matter more; that if something is predominantly considered a female activity, then it is not as valuable and important.\u201d And even if women are speaking to other women, why would that be any less meaningful than men speaking to other men? \u201cWomen artists must be allowed to focus on their own achievements, their own writing, their own voices without always being asked to consider the external response to it.\u201d Hilary Mantel spoke to Taylor about her fear of being \u201cLittle Womaned\u201d \u2013 boxed as an author who is incapable of writing about the \u201cwider society\u201d because she \u201ccannot pull away from personal preoccupations\u201d about what women want. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that Hilary Mantel wanted to get entirely away from a female world with her Tudor series because she wanted recognition,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cBut at the same time: what could be better as a writer than to feel you are speaking directly to women who see you as a friend? Why would any author object to that? You can say it\u2019s fluffy, but actually it\u2019s real and rather magical. Let\u2019s speak up for the fact we read fiction because we want to explore our feelings. We cry at the end of a romantic novel because we are both moved by someone else\u2019s plight but also because it\u2019s stirring up bittersweet things in us.\u201d Emotional intelligence is something of which women are rightly proud. A woman will often be called upon to play the family peacemaker, to ease social relations, to mediate friendships. She might find in Emma Woodhouse or Dorothea Brooke, say, instructive examples. Taylor feels this needs to be celebrated along with the ways in which women share the fiction that warms, comforts and sustains them. I ask Coe whether he sees marked differences in the way men and women respond to his novels. \u201cFemale readers in the signing queue will sometimes tell you directly how much a book has moved them, whereas male readers will say how much they share my enthusiasm for obscure bands like Hatfield and the North,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I think, essentially, they are saying the same thing: it\u2019s just that men sometimes need these proxies, these intermediaries \u2013 football, music, etc \u2013 as a way of voicing their emotions.\u201d Taylor says she \u201calways warms to men who read novels\u201d and I agree \u2013 we both married our husbands partly because they were keen readers of fiction. It\u2019s no coincidence, I\u2019m sure, that the most emotionally intelligent men I know regularly read and enthuse about women writers. \u201cI love that they\u2019re not reading just to get facts,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cI think they\u2019re reading fiction to try and understand the world from an oblique perspective. Fiction takes you on indirect routes to truth.\u201d Why Women Read Fiction: The Stories of Our Lives by Helen Taylor is published by Oxford University Press (\u00a314.99). It will be Radio 4\u2019s Book of the Week starting 13 January What we\u2019re reading Miyuki Watanabe Currently I\u2019m reading The Alchemist [by Paulo Coelho]. It\u2019s really inspiring, I love it. I do like nonfiction \u2013 biographies, environmental [texts], anything that helps me broaden my empathy \u2013 but that\u2019s true of fiction as well. After delving into nonfiction, it\u2019s nice to go back to fiction and have an easy read before bed. I think women are more empathetic [than men] and more social \u2013 women read fiction to get into the mindset of others. And a lot of women have book clubs and things with friends \u2013 I think that\u2019s a female thing. That\u2019s unfortunate though \u2013 everybody should have a book club! Liz Burdon I\u2019m reading a series of children\u2019s books about refugees, by Alan Gratz. I\u2019m interested in refugees, so I\u2019m reading around the subject and finding it fascinating. Fiction is the best way into history and into humanity. I\u2019m from Dublin originally and if anyone is interested in the history of Ireland I urge them to read Dubliners by Joyce first \u2013 and then look at the history. There\u2019s definitely a difference between what men and women read. In my teaching career, I saw boys who were reluctant readers get completely into reading if you find the right genre. It was all about genre for them. Rebecca Vile I just started reading My Sister, the Serial Killer [by Oyinkan Braithwaite]. I\u2019m only at the first chapter, but it\u2019s getting me in, which is good. I just thought I\u2019d try something new \u2013 I read a review of it in a couple of different newspapers. I\u2019m trying to get into reading more fiction, because I wasn\u2019t into it for a while but I think it helps your brain. It expands you in a different way. My husband just reads dry academic stuff \u2013 forget it, I am not going there. Marie-Claire Chappet I\u2019m rereading The Catcher in the Rye [by JD Salinger]. A friend said it was worth rereading as an adult \u2013 we both read it when we were 10 or 11. I still love it, but I want to be like [the protagonist Holden Caulfield] a lot less! As an adult, you\u2019re like, \u201cPoor boy\u2026\u201d Women are more curious [than men], that\u2019s probably why fiction appeals. I guess we\u2019ve got more to escape from, haven\u2019t we? And we\u2019ve got more access to other kinds of perspectives, because we\u2019re othered by society. I try to read an even balance of men and women, but my tastes veer more towards female writers. Linda Cyrus I like to share books with my daughter. The last book I read was [a memoir] about a woman who has mental health problems \u2013 Sour [by Tracey Miller]. Now I\u2019m trying Queenie [by Candice Carty-Williams]. Women like to read about love and romance \u2013 it feels like a way of settling your mind, taking away today\u2019s mental stress. Just fix it yourself, rather than reading the news all the times, because the news is really depressing. Gwen Coffey I\u2019m reading Tales of the City [by Armistead Maupin]. It\u2019s lovely. I\u2019ve seen the TV version and it\u2019s so close to the book that I know what\u2019s going to happen but I\u2019m still enjoying it. Women have a bit more imagination [than men]. I know the fantasies I get into when reading \u2013 I live it. I\u2019m in love with a character in a book, I\u2019ve been in love with him for a couple of years now. He\u2019s a policeman in Tony Parsons\u2019s books and he\u2019s been stabbed, shot, buried alive\u2026 I think: I must save him!
