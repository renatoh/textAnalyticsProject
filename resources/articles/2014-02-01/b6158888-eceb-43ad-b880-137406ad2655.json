Firstly I\u2019d like to thank my friends and family for ... well, they didn\u2019t do anything really. I don\u2019t think they even read this to be honest. So next I\u2019d like to thank ... Ellie Violet Bramley ... for feeding me tweets and pictures all night! Emily Mackay ... for correcting my spelling all night! Michael Hann ... for buying me an entire bottle of red wine to see me through this, seriously I could not have done it without you Adam Boult ... for keeping everyone happy on social media and working out how to embed stuff during difficult periods Mee-Lai Stone ... for keeping this liveblog in pictures, what a pro! Tshepo Mokoena ... for finding some people who couldn\u2019t spell Ellie Goudling and finally ... and I\u2019m tearing up here guys ... Fred McConnell ... for literally making about 17,000 gifs during the last two hours, most of which I didn\u2019t even have time to use ... But most of all ...sniff ... sob ... I\u2019d like to thank you, the reader, for reading ... I\u2019d like to dedicate this live blog to you. And if you need to invoice me for the microphone then go ahead! *THUD* It\u2019s all over until next year! Unless someone is going to make me liveblog ITV2 which is DEFINITELY not in my contract. There will be so much more to come: galleries, roundup blogs and podcasts ... head to theguardian.com/music for all that. For now, though, here\u2019s a critical appreciation of the night from chief pop critic Alexis Petridis! I think Rudimental speak for Britain right now It\u2019s Pharrell and Nile Rodgers playing my least favourite song of 2013! What a way to end six hours of live blogging! It\u2019s fine, though, they\u2019re doing a medley! Good Times! And Happy! And Shiny Happy People! \u201cClearly intoxicated\u201d Look! A full list of winners! I think Alex Turner saying \u201cinvoice me for the microphone if you wanna\u201d and dropping it on the floor has to be officially the least rock\u2019n\u2019roll thing I\u2019ve ever witnessed. Even Bill Grundy might have been a bit \u201cmeh\u201d. Speech! Alex Turner says, oh I don\u2019t know, something about swamps and cycles or summit, Josh Halliday will let us all know in a minute Emeli Sande. She had to turn up, didn\u2019t she? And there was me thinking I could not bother finding out how to put the accent on the \u201ce\u201d this year! She\u2019s presenting British Album and the winner is ... Arctic Monkeys for AM! They\u2019ve done the double for a third time! Coldplay and the Manics have managed it twice but this is a record triple. We pay our news reporters for a reason, you know. And that reason is they find out what actually happened rather than just sit in the office drinking wine and failing to hear what\u2019s being said on the telly. Josh Halliday is at the O2 and here\u2019s the full Kate Moss quote as written by David Bowie: \u201cIn a somewhat other-worldly acceptance speech delivered by the model Kate Moss, Bowie thanked his fans and made a surprise intervention in the Scottish independence debate. \u201cDavid has asked me to say this: In Japanese myth, the rabbits on my old costume that Kate\u2019s wearing live on the moon. Kate comes from Venus, and I from Mars. I\u2019m completely delighted to have a Brit for being the best male. I think it\u2019s a great way to end the day. Thank you very much \u2013 and Scotland, stay with us.\u201d The problem with Bastille is they\u2019re just not drum\u2019n\u2019bass enough. Said nobody, ever, but still: here they are with Rudimental for, ahem, Bastimental. And it is bloody mental, mate. Is this nearly over yet? Jimmy Carr\u2019s presents the award for British Video and it all depends on the spelling ... who has the easiest name to spell? It\u2019s One Direction - Best Song Ever! Who knew those guys were popular on social media? Lorde wins International Female Solo! She says her brain is exploding. Tell me about it m8, I\u2019ve been live blogging this since about 5pm It really has got confusing. Nick Grimshaw is now onstage kissing James Corden. Did Michael Hann order some acid on my slice of takeaway pizza? Noel Gallagher is onstage. He reads out the nominees for British Male Solo Artist. And doesn\u2019t say any jokes. Which is, frankly, disappointing (at the GQ awards he announced \u201cWelcome to the Tory party conference\u201d). Anyway, the winner is ... David Bowie! He won this award back in 1984 donchaknow? Noel says: \u201cYou maniacs didn\u2019t actually think he\u2019d be here did you? He\u2019s too cool for this shit!\u201d Kate Moss accepts the awards instead. And says something about Japanese myth and rabbits that I literally couldn\u2019t fathom. It\u2019s all got quite confusing. Ellie Goulding is getting melismatic with an acoustic guitar and what looks a bit like her dressing gown. Oh, and now it\u2019s gone ravey dubstep (ravey dubstep in the sense that Taylor Swift goes ravey dubstep). And now Stomp are onstage. What more could you ask of a rock star? The voting is now closed for British video! Stop using hashtag Brits followed by the correct spelling of an artist who got enough YouTube views to ... OK, I\u2019m bored of this now Nile Rodgers accepts the award. Surprising, that, as Daft Punk normally turn up to the opening of an envelope. Even if it\u2019s clearly just junk mail. Nile says: \u201cThe robots had an amazing vision!\u201d It\u2019s groundhog day! As if Cesc Fabregas presenting an award in 2012 wasn\u2019t weird enough now he\u2019s back! He loves this stuff! He apologises for beating Man City last night, because everyone at the O2 is clearly wearing sky blue. Anyway the winner of International Group is ... Daft Punk! Bastille: \u201cWe just make music for ourselves, really ...\u201d Don\u2019t tell me lads, and if anyone else likes it it\u2019s a bloody miracle, right? A Disclosure auditions to be the next Bez. Which is NO MATCH for this ... It\u2019s Disclosure! And Lorde! Together! And not just to present an award to Bastille or whatever - they\u2019re playing live and it\u2019s a minimal house take on Royals that I am reliably informed will turn into White Noise at some point. Seamless, right? Updates time. 1) Pharrell clocked Keith Lemon\u2019s fake Pharrell hat and liked it (presumably IRL and not on Facebook). 2) The Guardian\u2019s Harriet Gibsone missed her dinner. Reasons as yet unknown. Harsh. But fair. Now it\u2019s time for non-new rave Katy Perry to tell us the winner of British Single ...Rudimental - Waiting All Night! Beyonce says: \u201cNow I need you all to help me out.\u201d Simply write hashtag Brits then sing along to her most YouTube\u2019d chorus (no misspellings or RTs) etc etc etc. Anyway, despite surprising lack of stage show the crowd seemed to love that. Caspar who is there says it helps that everyone is pissed. Who needs a stage show when you have bottles of wine on tap? Did you read that? IT\u2019S TIME FOR BEYONCE She dedicates XO to ... umm, it was a bit of a mumble but we think \u201cher fans\u201d. She\u2019s on sparkling form tonight, as indicated by her dress. Jesus, did James Corden script this? I\u2019m not the only person loving Corden\u2019s lols tonight Rosie Huntington-Whiteley is here to announce the winner of Global Success Award ... which we know is One Direction. I think Sam Smith also got the nod for Critics Choice at some point too. It was hard to tell \u2013 it looked more like Corden was just flirting with him, to be honest. Great speech by the 1D ... How happy are Arctic Monkeys right now? This happy Remember everyone: you can vote by tweeting hashtag Brits plus a name spelled correctly of an artist on the list of most YouTube plays (RTs don\u2019t count) ... got it?! GO! Alex Turner: \u201cAlreet. There\u2019s that \u00a315 we put on One Direction to win down t\u2019drain innit?\u201d He can\u2019t be bothered reading a list of thank yous though It\u2019s a big one! Lily Allen and her hair are onstage to announce British Group. And the winner is ... Arctic Monkeys! They\u2019re on course to become the first band to ever win British Group and British Album three times. Rudimental\u2019s album has \u201cmore bangers than a barbecue at a fireworks factory\u201d. I honestly think that could be the worst joke ever written. \u201cThe finest showman performing anywhere in the world right now ...\u201d Well he did say RIGHT NOW ... it\u2019s Bruno Mars! Performing Treasure! With trumpets! His stripey t-shirt is not much of a match for aztec new rave tbqh Not everyone happy with that Bastille victory Here is that aforementioned Katy Perry\u2019s aztec new rave look ... James Corden is making jokes with One Direction about prison rape. I will level with you, I could not have predicted that tonight. Fearne Cotton and Tinie Tempah are announcing the winner of British Breakthrough Act ... Christ this is moving fast ... it\u2019s Bastille! Bastille are up for about 712 awards tonight so that\u2019s one down 711 to go. But what will the exciting speech hold? \u201cEr, wow.\u201d Kylie and Pharrell are onstage to announce the winner of International Male Solo Artist ...Bruno Mars! Mars won it back in 2012 as well. What a factoid that is! Mars is onstage with about a dozen guys. It said \u201csolo artist\u201d mate. Some people ... Someone in the office just shouted: \u201cJAMES CORDEN HAS TWEETED HIS SELFIE!\u201d I wonder if Lester Bangs ever experienced anything like this? BREAKING: Katy Perry has gone new rave. UPDATE: Aztec new rave WERE YOU EVEN LISTENING TO CORDEN?!? MISSPELLINGS WON\u2019T COUNT!!! Ellie Goulding speaks: \u201cPrince! Thank you so much I am genuinely in shock.\u201d She\u2019s shaking she\u2019s so happy, which is how I think we all feel right now. \u201cWho can kick off the awards in the coolest style possible?\u201d It\u2019s Prince and 3RDEYEGIRL presenting an award. \u201cThe O2, I remember this place!\u201d says Prince. Then Corden interrupts to take a selfie. Such lols that guy. Prince is now thanking everyone for coming to his shows in every single venue in London. And now it\u2019s time for the winner of British Female Solo Artist ... Ellie Goulding! Corden tells us to vote using our hashtags. All you have to do is tweet #Brits and then the name of one of the artists who got a certain amount of YouTube plays to make the nominees list, or something. Oh, and misspellings and RTs won\u2019t count. What could be easier? If anyone can follow an incendiary opening song it\u2019s James Corden, amirite? \u201cHello, good evening\u201d he says before mentioning MasterCard. Hold on to them hats guys. Arctic Monkeys kick things off with R U Mine? They are joined onstage by lots of lazers and some fire. Matt Helders is on impressive falsetto duties, but who cares about falsetto when you\u2019ve got a massive \u201cA\u201d and \u201cM\u201d burning away in the background? One Direction are the night\u2019s biggest winners! Or, at least, they\u2019ve got their hands on the night\u2019s biggest award ... Harriet Gibsone has sure been working hard on that red carpet she loves so much. Here\u2019s Pharrell hanging out with Haim! Posted without comment Imagine being the sort of person who isn\u2019t excited by the Brit awards 2014 presented by James Corden. Go on, just imagine. You can\u2019t can you? Because clearly no such person exists. And we\u2019re now only 15 minutes away from it happening - woooooooooo! Rosie Swash has now left to go to some swanky party or other. But not me. I would never leave you, dear reader. Never. Not even if I was invited to the parties that everyone else is invited to. Seriously, I wouldn\u2019t. I just prefer the company of you guys. Anyway, earlier I promised you facts, and so here are some facts of things involved in this year\u2019s ceremony ... - 29 projectors - 10000 balloons - 30 lasers - 16,500 square meters of carpet - 4000 china tea cups in the party - 3156m of barrier - 2.8m mirror ball - 540 delivery trucks ps can anyone else work out what the 2.8m mirror ball means? Surely there aren\u2019t nearly 3m of the things?! Kieran Yates also appears to be at the Brits and this is what they\u2019re feeding the press contingent. If you\u2019re reading live from Alabama I can only imagine the jealousy you\u2019re feeling right now at seeing the real thing as God intended TJ For those of you sitting around wondering \u201cwho would win if the results were decided by social network performance alone\u201d (and that\u2019s got to be at least 1,237 of you, right?) there is good news: advertising technology company RadiumOne have carried out some research. And the winners, judged by number of stories shared online or some such thing, are as follows: \u00b7 One Direction would take home the gongs for British Video, British Single and British Group \u00b7 Disclosure would take home the awards for British Album of the Year and British Breakthrough Act \u00b7 John Newman would be awarded best British Male \u00b7 Best Female would be Ellie Goulding \u00b7 Bruno Mars, Pink and Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis would take home international honours So now you know. Although of course the awards are actually decided by shadowy illuminati lizard people so this all means nothing. TJ There are some Brit award occurrences you can set your watch by: 1) A drunk music executive will wander across the camera and care less about ruining the shot 2) The dreaded Lifetime Achievement style medley at the end 3) Tinie Tempah will turn up in a nice suit. RS Rapper Iggy Azalea showcases the \u201chere\u2019s my bum\u201d red carpet pose which is as weird as it is ubiquitous. RS James Corden has arrived, bringing with him the unmistakable sound of a thousand hearts sinking across the land. Laura Mvula does ruffles. So now. RS I was hoping the Arctic Monkeys would make like they did in 2008 and come dressed as, if not farmers, something obscure, like the Bullingdon Club or a 1982 curling team. Ah well. Looking a bit like Roxy Music has its attractions. RS Harriet Gibsone, also tirelessly getting pissed working at this year\u2019s ceremony, is excited to report that Beyonc\u00e9 is indeed backstage at the Brits meaning speculation that she\u2019s performing looks likely. I mean, she could just be a massive James Corden fan, but ... TJ Calvin Harris closes down the armpit party. His look tonight is \u201cI made a ton of money and moved to LA. Suck it, losers\u201d. RS Jessie J goes all Sochi. Safe to say the lilac lipstick is utterly terrifying. RS STOP LOOKING AT DRESSES EVERYONE! Here is what people are eating at this year\u2019s Brits, courtesy of our on-the-ground reporter Caspar Llewellyn Smith who curiously always seems to be at these things rather than in the office blogging them. Whereas I always curiously seem to always be here in the office merely reporting the fact that celebrities are tucking into ... well, to be honest, I\u2019ve no idea what the hell this is. More updates as they arrive. TJ Rita Ora\u2019s right armpit has arrived. The night can officially begin. RS I\u2019m not usually a fan of fishtail dresses but the intense puceness of this one makes Foxes look like a mermaid. Maybe Tom Daley isn\u2019t the only one making a Splash!... .... ... I\u2019m sorry. I\u2019m so sorry. RS Tom Daley has turned up and I don\u2019t think I have ever seen a man do that with the sleeves of a suit before. RS Pixie Lott, not nominated and destined to turn up at the Brit awards until the end of time (or the end of the music industry, whichever comes first). RS John Newman (no relation to Paul) with an outfit like Terence Trent D\u2019Arby and a pose like an unamused police officer. Style props for the white socks and slip-ons. RS Just a refresher for those who want to put some serious money on the outcome of tonight\u2019s awards - here\u2019s who\u2019s competing for what ... Best British male solo artist David Bowie Jake Bugg James Blake John Newman Tom Odell Best British female solo artist Birdy Ellie Goulding Jessie J Laura Marling Laura Mvula British group Arctic Monkeys Bastille Disclosure One Direction Rudimental British breakthrough act Bastille Disclosure Laura Mvula London Grammar Tom Odell British single (judged on sales) Bastille \u2013 Pompeii Calvin Harris and Ellie Goulding \u2013 I Need Your Love Disclosure \u2013 White Noise Ellie Goulding \u2013 Burn John Newman \u2013 Love Me Again Naughty Boy feat Sam Smith \u2013 La La La Olly Murs \u2013 Dear Darlin\u2019 One Direction \u2013 One Way Or Another Passenger \u2013 Let Her Go Rudimental feat Ella Eyre \u2013 Waiting All Night Mastercard British album of the year Arctic Monkeys - AM Bastille - Bad Blood David Bowie \u2013 The Next Day Disclosure \u2013 Settle Rudimental \u2013 Home British producer Ethan Johns Flood and Alan Moulder Paul Epworth International male solo artist Bruno Mars Drake Eminem John Grant Justin Timberlake International female solo artist Janelle Monae Katy Perry Lady Gaga Lorde Pink International group Arcade Fire Daft Punk Haim Kings of Leon Macklemore Ryan Lewis Critics\u2019 choice Sam Smith British global success award tba Pharrell Williams and his wife Helen Lasichanh bring the sparkle in co-ordinating (ish) outfits. I\u2019m gonna take a punt and say that Pharrel\u2019s suit is Saint Laurent. If not, I apologise. If I\u2019m right you owe me \u00a31 million. Mastercard not accepted. RS \u2022 UPDATE: Lavin have been in touch to say the suit was by them, not Saint Laurent! This is the first time I\u2019ve ever seen a picture of Bastille and I may not be the first person to bring this up but, doesn\u2019t Chris \u2018Woody\u2019 Wood (great rap name) look like Corey Feldman? RS Look, if I was 15 this is exactly the kind of outfit I would have want to wear. Red, Lycra, see-through in random places, and accessorised with matchy-matchy lipstick and hair. And that, after all, is a major part of what being a popstar is all about. RS Conor Maynard, you say? Here he is! RS Boy George has arrived with what I sincerely hope is a bit of creatively applied makeup and not a facial wound. And I am excited about his arrival, even if the youngster over his shoulder has a look on her face that says: \u201cBoy who? Screw this, where\u2019s Conor Maynard?\u201d RS Ah, Ellie Goulding. She of animatronic voice and dainty clothes. Usually I get an email with the words DRESSING RELEASE in frightening capitals telling me who is wearing what and by who, so Jane Public can know exactly which dress is out of her price range. But not this time. Not yet, at least. Fans of pale pink corset dresses that are wildly inappropriate for anywhere but the red carpet will have to remain ignorant. For that I am sorry. RS In this Rudimental style sandwich, DJ Locksmith (left) and Amir Amor (right) are the scrumptious artisan walnut-inflected sourdough bread and Kesi Dryden and Piers Agget are the flavourless tomato and disappointingly rubbery mozzarella, frankly. Well, I\u2019m just saying what we\u2019re all thinking! RS There\u2019s a lot going on here, all of which I love. But the short version is: Xscape for Generation Rent. RS Jordan Stephens and Harley Alexander-Sule, AKA Rizzle Kicks, set the bar at a reasonable height for the men folk with a variation on several \u2018key trends\u2019 from this season\u2019s menswear \u2013 giant collars, burgundy and a coat with vague military undertones (overtones? Innertones?). And they arrived at the 02 a staggering five hours before the Brit awards. Either they\u2019re presenting some sort of ITV 2/3/4 backstage/behind the scenes with Fearne Cotton/Edith Bowman/Someone from TOWIE or they are, as my schoolfriend used to say, keenos. RS As we all know, there are few things more exciting in pop than the night several hundred Mastercard employees get pissed together while someone onstage hands an endless stream of awards to Emeli Sand\u00e9. But if there is something more thrilling than that then surely that thing is the Brit awards red carpet? Let\u2019s hope so because we\u2019re going to be blogging it from now until the real thing starts on ITV from 8pm. Rosie Swash will be here to take you through the night\u2019s fashion thrills and fails, whereas I (Tim Jonze) will be keeping you updated with any gossip from the O2 and perhaps even some interesting facts about tonight\u2019s ceremony. For starters here\u2019s list of 10 things you can expect from tonight\u2019s show, including a Prince appearance and the chance for Arctic Monkeys to pull off a historic double. There are rumours circulating that we might see Beyonce perform, or that Prince might do a sneaky aftershow at Kentish Town forum a la Justin Timberlake last year. Before we find out all that though here\u2019s Harriet Gibsone who\u2019s so keen to get to the Brits she\u2019s been making YouTube videos of herself there since about 2pm ..."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
