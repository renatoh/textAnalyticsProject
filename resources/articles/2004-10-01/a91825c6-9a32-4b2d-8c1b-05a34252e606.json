Like all social strata, the celebrity classes would collapse without solidarity. However, it is also healthy to loudly diss a fellow celeb, as this makes you look subversive. The celebrity-on- celebrity put-down works best at a high-profile award ceremony. Jarvis Cocker established the archetype when he harangued Michael Jackson at the Brit Awards in 1996. Elton John did it beautifully at the Q Awards - on hearing Madonna's name as a nominee in the Best Live Act category, he cried: 'Oh, f*** off!' Lauren Bacall's assertion at the Venice Film Festival that Nicole Kidman was 'not a legend, she's only a beginner' was deliciously fuelled by spite. But Robbie Williams inviting Liam Gallagher to a fight at the 2000 Brit Awards was not as accomplished. It smacked of a publicity stunt rather than genuine loathing. *NB: When I say 'all other', I mean 'all other A-list celebs'. Being friends with a lesser celebrity would be fame-hierarchy suicide."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
