When I went on to the Sky website to order a broadband, phone and TV package, every apartment listed in the block was on its database \u2013 except mine. I called customer sales to ask what the issue was, and was told this can happen with the database and the firm could add my address manually. The call ended with me finalising my order and providing direct debit details and confirming an installation date. I was told I would be provided with an activation date in the next few days. Weeks later, and after hearing nothing about my internet, I contacted Sky to see what had happened. It told me no broadband or phone order existed, and it couldn't add an order as my address wasn't in its database \u2013 despite it providing me with TV at this point. I've wasted three weeks so far trying to get connected to the internet. Why on earth is this so difficult? JB, London The issue arose because your property was, for some reason, not listed with BT Openreach: a property must be before a phone service can be installed. It seems both you and Sky tried unsuccessfully to get Openreach to amend this \u2013 eventually it did. As for errors in the sales process, Sky TV customers in larger apartment blocks are dealt with by a third-party company and it seems this company said yes to your broadband but then did not alert you that installation was impossible. Sky says you should have been told about the unmatched order earlier, for which it is sorry and has offered 25% off your bill for three months. It has now set a date to install your broadband and phone services. We welcome letters but cannot answer individually.
