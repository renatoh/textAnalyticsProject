There\u2019s creepy nursery rhyme on Ring-a-Ring O\u2019Roses, classic French chanson on Lying With You, trippy sprechgesang on Songbird in a Cage (guest-written by Paul McCartney in full acid mode: \u201cflying through the sky, all our senses reeling\u201d), and disco on Deadly Valentine and Sylvia Says. A few of the melodies that she and producer SebastiAn alight on resolve too neatly, running their course as predictably as a romcom. Equally, it is this firm resolution that makes Les Oxalis and the title track so satisfying \u2013 and the latter is the best thing she\u2019s ever done. With a funk bassline muffled as if by goosedown, she finds the heretofore untapped erotic potential of Aled Jones\u2019s Walking in the Air, whose lyrics she quotes in an ASMR-triggering whisper."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
