We just never imagined Yellow Magic Orchestra, the original cyberpunks, would age as well as the German pioneers of electro-pop have. When they appear behind laptops for this, their first UK show since 1980, you get the shock of the old: with his grey hair and suit, bassist Haruomi Hosono looks like a member of a cruise ship jazz ensemble; Yukihiro Takahashi resembles a 50s spiv in his white jacket, bowtie and trilby; and Ryuichi Sakamoto, all silver mane and smart-casual wear, could pass for a trendy lecturer - or, to cite a YMO song title, a hi-tech hippy. They sound contemporary, though: the textures and effects, courtesy of extra musician Christian Fennesz, a recording artist in his own right with a tendency to coat everything with hiss and static, are worthy of electronic radicals such as Autechre. Where Kraftwerk's music could be solemn and, well, Teutonic, YMO's was often funny and fast, more bullet train than trans-Europe express. And yet tonight, the emphasis is less on their playful than on their poignant side. With its oriental tonalities and aching melody, Mars has an irresistible momentum and the faintest nuance of a chord sequence - it is the birth of trance, basically. Rydeen, the only \"classic\" that YMO deign to play, evokes the gleaming gorgeousness of a 21st-century cityscape, while Flakes locates the sadness at the beating heart of a modern technopolis. For the second half of their set, Takahashi, previously triggering beats with gadgetry, uses a proper drumkit, and YMO sound more like a conventional band, though Wonderful to Me is the loveliest jazz-rock, like Weather Report forced at gunpoint to produce byte-sized pop. As they take a bow at the end, they appear diffident, but there is no need: these gentlemen helped invent the future."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
