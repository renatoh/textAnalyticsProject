The more often Liverpool strike late, the stronger that conviction grows, claimed the midfielder. Lallana was speaking in the wake of Saturday\u2019s dramatic victory by his team at Villa Park, where Liverpool trailed until the 87th minute but ended up winning 2-1, with Sadio Man\u00e9 scoring the decisive goal in the fourth minute of stoppage time that preserved their six-point lead at the top of the Premier League. It was the third time in a week that Liverpool had come from behind to win, following the 2-1 triumph over Tottenham and the Carabao Cup victory over Arsenal. The Gunners had led 3-1, 4-2 and 5-4 at Anfield, only for J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s team to recover each time and prevail in a penalty shootout. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like a sixth sense,\u201d said Lallana. \u201cWe knew at half-time [against Villa] that, if we got one goal, it\u2019s going to count. We got it late but we still had time. It doesn\u2019t surprise me that we got a second goal.\u201d The midfielder said the win over Arsenal fuelled the whole club, even though none of the players who had began that game started at Villa. \u201cWe made 11 changes but as a squad you still gain momentum just from being there, even the lads who didn\u2019t play,\u201d he said. \u201cWe took that and, even though we weren\u2019t at our best in the first half [at Villa Park], it helps towards the \u2018never say never\u2019 [attitude]. We\u2019ve just got that momentum.\u201d Lallana says opponents know it too, making them fearful that Liverpool are going to strike late on again: \u201cTeams worry when it\u2019s late,\u201d he said. John McGinn, the Villa midfielder, said Liverpool\u2019s relentlessness wore his gallant side down. That was despite the fact he had detected vulnerability among the visitors after Mahmoud Tr\u00e9z\u00e9guet put Villa 1-0 up. \u201cA lot of their players were arguing and you could tell they were uncomfortable in the first half,\u201d said McGinn. \u201cWhen teams start arguing with each other you normally know you\u2019ve got them. But at the same time you have to respect that they are such a good team they just regroup, get together and go again.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t give up, they keep going and they probably tired us out too much right at the end,\u201d continued McGinn. \u201cChances were coming and we were trying to keep them at bay but the ball just keeps coming back at you. It was two sloppy goals from our point of view but teams like Liverpool do that to you, like Manchester City did [to Villa the previous week]. They just drain you mentally.\u201d Having seen his team fall to each of the top two within the space of a week the Villa manager, Dean Smith, foresees the title race going down to the wire again. \u201cI think they\u2019ll go toe-to-toe until the end of the season,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
