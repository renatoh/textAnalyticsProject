Senator Joe Lieberman of Connecticut led the attack, ridiculing Mr Dean for his comment that the capture of Saddam Hussein had not made the US safer. \"I don't know how anybody could say that we're not safer with a homicidal maniac, a brutal dictator, an enemy of the United States, a supporter of terrorism, a murderer of hundreds of thousands of his own people ... in prison instead of in power,\" Mr Lieberman said. He made his remarks in response to Mr Dean's observation that 23 US troops had been killed since Saddam's capture last month, and that \"for the first time American fighter jets [are] escorting commercial airlines\" because of security concerns. Mr Dean suggested that instead of spending $160bn in Iraq, the Bush administration \"should have ... followed up trying to get Osama Bin Laden.\" Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts challenged Mr Dean over a recent statement in a newspaper interview that he would withhold judgment on the guilt of Bin Laden. \"What in the world were you thinking?\" he asked. \"I understand Osama bin Laden has essentially claimed responsibility for these terrorist acts and as an American I want to see he gets what he deserves, which is the death penalty,\" Mr Dean replied, adding though that a president should not presume anyone is guilty. Senator John Edwards of North Carolina said Mr Dean had \"no plan to reduce the tax burden on middle-class families\" and representative Dick Gephardt of Missouri said the front runner had supported trade bills that led to the loss of manufacturing jobs. The debate took place 15 days before the Iowa caucuses, when registered party members gather in closed meetings around the state to choose the candidate they will support. The caucuses are the first contest for Democratic presidential hopefuls to garner support ahead of the national convention, when delegates from all 50 states will meet to select a Democratic challenger to George Bush. Seven of the nine Democratic hopefuls participated in the debate. General Wesley Clark preferred to campaign in New Hampshire, which will hold the nation's first primary on January 27. Al Sharpton was in South Carolina seeking votes ahead of that state's February 3 primary. Not all nine hopefuls are likely to survive the Iowa and New Hampshire caucuses, which leaves many of Mr Dean's rivals scrambling to make the cut, and explains the vehemence of their challenges. From the outset of his campaign, Mr Dean has tried to position himself as an alternative to congressional Democrats, many of whom voted for legislation authorising the Iraq war. Besides stressing his opposition to the war, Mr Dean said he had opposed President Bush's signature education bill, which cleared congress with overwhelming bi-partisan support. \"What has happened to so many Democrats in congress is that they've been co-opted by the agenda of George Bush,\" he said. \"And what we need is a Democrat who's going to stand up to George Bush.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
