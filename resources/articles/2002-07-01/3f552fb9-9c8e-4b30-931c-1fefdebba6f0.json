One is a self portrait by the artist photographer Sam Taylor-Wood - wife of White Cube gallery owner and contemporary art dealer Jay Jopling - and the other a superb portrait by the Pre-Raphaelite painter Sir John Everett Millais of his friend, the painter Louise Jopling. Both were acquired with grants from the Art Fund. The heritage lottery fund also gave \u00a3240,000 towards buying the Millais from a private collection. Sam Taylor-Wood works in photography, film and video. However the large print she made last year is called Self-portrait in Single Breasted Suit with Hare - a bleak joke about her recent treatment for cancer. The Millais portrait of Louise Jopling is regarded as one of his greatest portraits. It marks his move from his Pre-Raphaelite period to a more sombre, introspective style. He completed the painting - as a present for her son, his godchild - in five marathon sittings, and Mrs Jopling complained of the exhaustion of maintaining the bold upright standing pose for hours on end. She was herself a notable painter, and a campaigner for women's rights and votes well into the 20th century. Curator Peter Funnell said it filled a gap in the gallery's collection. \"This is a tremendous acquisition - we weren't able to borrow this portrait for the Millais exhibition a few years back, and it was probably the most glaring omission.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
