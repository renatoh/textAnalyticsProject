Indeed, as I walked out of the cinema, I felt that I was back in India, having just seen another Bollywood film \u2013 equipped with all the cliches, implausible scenarios, cheap sentimental manipulations, dance routines, violence and feelgood, hero-meets-heroine happy ending. The critical acclaim surrounding the movie is puzzling. I have nothing against escapist rags-to-riches storylines. Nor do I object to western directors attempting to make films in and about India. On the contrary, the critical perspective of an outsider can serve as a healthy antidote to the jingoistic self-congratulation that seems ubiquitous in Indian movies. However, I do take issue with the fact that most representations of the subcontinent tend to two extremes. On the one hand are the images of perpetually modernising urbanity in places such as Mumbai and Bangalore, with ostentatious displays of new wealth; on the other, voyeuristic scenes of dire poverty, slum dwellers and beggars, who remain untouched by the seeming economic growth. These are true enough. But they are not in the least representative of the larger India, which lies and moves outside the metropolitan cities. It is convenient to forget that until 200 years ago, India did not have a unified existence or a national identity; that it was a collection of kingdoms, each with its own subculture and history, and often with its own language. To be sure, a sense of national identity exists in the minds of most Indians today. But what drives and dictates the everyday life of the average Indian depends largely on the subculture to which he or she belongs. The life of a woman selling flowers, speaking in Malayalam in Kerala is quite different from that of someone making sweaters and speaking Dogri in Kashmir. It certainly is not all about cricket or making money. More importantly, many people, particularly in rural India, lead content and happy lives without worrying about earning more or having a college education. Their ambitions are modest, and seldom move beyond planning for the week ahead. Yet, with a very few exceptions, how many books or movies about India have attempted to capture this diversity? That movies in India often fail to do so is sad enough. Should directors from the west also end up subscribing to the same stereotypes about India and the notion of \"an Indian culture\"? I would be the first person to admit that India has too many problems. It may be the world's largest democracy. But it does not have a good record on human rights: torture in police stations and the death penalty are yet to be outlawed. Corruption is rife. Defence spending greatly exceeds education and healthcare in the national budget, even as children die of malnutrition and preventable diseases every minute. I cannot recall the last time that a movie handled any such issue sensitively. That Indian film-makers often fail to do so should not come as a surprise \u2013 not least due to the presence of a government-run censor board \u2013 and the threats of vandalism and disruption when any question of a sensitive nature is addressed. Few will forget the riots that followed the screening of the lesbian-themed Fire or any film that dealt with the communal riots in Gujarat. Fortunately, directors from the west are not constrained by such fears or insecurities. What a pity, then, that precious opportunities, resources and talents have been wasted in producing yet another rags-to-riches wish-fulfilment movie."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
