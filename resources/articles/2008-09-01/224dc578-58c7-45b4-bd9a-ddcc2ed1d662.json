Our trip to Spain was the first time I'd driven on the right. My husband, the map reader, is a poet, so naturally doesn't drive. I planned to collect a car at Malaga airport and visit the Picasso museum before heading off to the Alpujarras. Struggling with the unfamiliar gears in heavy traffic, I was relieved to spot a side street with parking. When we came out of the museum the map reader strode confidently across the city centre leading us back to the car. But in the baking heat none of the streets looked familiar. Eventually, a greengrocer asked if we had a problemo and kindly drove us around until we found the car. The relief was incredible, but despite his careful directions we didn't find the main road out of town and it was early evening before we finally left the city. By the time we arrived in Berja it was dark and though we drove round town several times we found no signpost to Ugijar. We'd been travelling for 14 hours and I was exhausted, but my son's friend had malted milk biscuits in his luggage and after two I stopped sobbing. Then the poet found a road. A couple of miles on, it narrowed and began to climb, one hairpin bend following another. Luckily I was too busy wrestling with the Polo's steering wheel to be that aware of the ravines. We saw no other traffic, no sign of habitation. At midnight we reached a lake and I refused to continue. My son's friend began to cry and ring his family back home. The poet took him down to the lake to listen to the frogs and for a manly talk before we uncomfortably settled down for the night. When dawn came I knew I'd made the right decision. The road was a crumbling track one car wide, the valley thousands of feet below. When we reached our destination our hostess was astounded. 'No one takes that road,' she said. 'You should have rung me from Berja, you were 20 minutes away. I would have come to get you'. Pauline Liu-Devereux, St Erth, Cornwall \u00b7 Have you had a crap holiday? If so, tell us about it.
