FO advice on safety The Foreign Office has issued a new leaflet of advice for personal safety and information for victims of rape and sexual assault abroad, following a record number of cases reported to British consular staff overseas last year. The leaflet has advice on personal safety and how to find help after an assault. Elizabeth Lyall, of the Suzy Lamplugh Trust, which supports the initiative, said: \"This needn't ruin people's holidays. They need to take the same safety precautions that they do at home. These assaults are not just being reported by young women. It is happening to men as well.\" Leaflets can be ordered by phoning 020-7008 0187 or emailing publicity.consular@gtnet.gov.uk. The guidelines can be found at fco.gov.uk."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
