Doing the washing-up before bed is one of those steps beloved by cleaning and productivity experts. It sounds simple to stick to, but in practice can be easily avoided with the simple words: \u201cI\u2019m just leaving them to soak.\u201d You know they are a physical reminder of your laziness \u2013 an extra job for tomorrow and a bacteria farm \u2013 but you\u2019re full and tired, and Springwatch is about to start. Is there any harm in it? \u201cI think there are other things that are more important to worry about, in terms of hygiene,\u201d says Lisa Ackerley, a food-safety expert. \u201cBacteria on [dirty dishes] will breed overnight, but if they go into the dishwasher the next day and they\u2019re thoroughly washed then there won\u2019t be a problem. Those germs aren\u2019t going to start crawling all over the kitchen.\u201d However, if you don\u2019t have a dishwasher \u2013 which uses a higher water temperature than our hands could withstand \u2013 and you\u2019re washing by hand, \u201cthen it\u2019s probably better to get them done the night before. But I wouldn\u2019t lose sleep over it if you do it every now and then.\u201d Conversely, is there a danger we\u2019re being too clean? One study in Sweden in 2015 suggested that children who grew up in households where the dishes were handwashed had a lower risk of developing allergies because they were exposed to more microbes. Ackerley says we \u201chave to be careful\u201d when we complain about being too clean. \u201cWe need to make sure we reduce the risk of getting an infection, while also allowing the microbiome [the body\u2019s community of bacteria] to be healthy.\u201d The main exception to this rule, she says, is if you have been using a chopping board and knife to prepare raw meat, especially chicken, which carries a high risk of being contaminated with campylobacter, the most common cause of food poisoning. Utensils and boards should be washed straight away, says Ackerley. \u201cIf I don\u2019t have access to a dishwasher, I would use an antibacterial cleanser. I\u2019m not advocating using masses of it all over the place, but I would use it in those circumstances on the work surface and chopping board.\u201d Incidentally, Paltrow\u2019s lifestyle business, Goop, just happens to sell washing-up liquid as part of a cleaning kit \u2013 yours for just \u00a364."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
