Search for \"tablet\" and you get no such comparison offered. How about Asus Transformer? No, no comparison. Samsung Galaxy Tab? No. PlayBook? No. TouchPad? No. iPad? Still yes. From which you can probably conclude that as far as Amazon is concerned, there are only two tablets in the Christmas race at the moment. And also conclude that Apple is probably relieved that it doesn't have to rely only on selling through Amazon for its revenues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
