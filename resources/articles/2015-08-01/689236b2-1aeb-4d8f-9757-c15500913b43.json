Leyla and Arif Yunus were convicted of \u201cfraud\u201d and other crimes related to their NGO work at a trial in Baku. International observers and journalists were refused entry to the court and only a handful of diplomats were allowed to attend. A charge of treason, purportedly for spying for Armenia, is also pending against the couple, but it has been sent to a separate court for consideration. Leyla Yunus is the director of the Institute of Peace and Democracy and before her arrest had been documenting the treatment of political prisoners in Azerbaijan by the authorities. Arif Yunus is a historian and political activist. Leyla was arrested on 30 July last year, five days after organising a press conference calling for an international boycott of the European Games, which were held in Baku in June this year. Arif was arrested a few days later. Amnesty believes the charges against the couple were fabricated in retaliation for their legitimate human rights work and criticism of the Azerbaijani government. Levan Asatiani, an Azerbaijan campaigner at Amnesty International, said: \u201cThese absurd charges have resulted in harsh sentences for Azerbaijan\u2019s prominent human rights defenders Leyla and Arif Yunus. We urge the government to quash these convictions. Leyla and Arif Yunus are prisoners of conscience and they must be immediately and unconditionally released. The judicial system has once again revealed itself to be no more than a cynical tool by which President Ilham Aliyev crushes any dissent or criticism of his regime. His government\u2019s human rights record is simply shocking.\u201d Leyla and Arif Yunus both suffer from serious medical problems and their health has deteriorated further in detention. On Thursday, Arif Yunus lost consciousness during the court hearing. He suffered two strokes in April 2014 and his family fears that he may not survive another. Leyla Yunus has been diagnosed with diabetes and hepatitis C and has reduced vision in her left eye but the authorities have refused to transfer her to a hospital. She has reported being threatened, harassed and ill-treated after asking for medical care. The Foreign Office has expressed grave concern over the judgment, the Minister for Europe, David Lidington, said: \u201cI am deeply troubled by the sentencing handed down to Leyla and Arif Yunus. A number of aspects of the conduct of the trial reinforced the impression that the verdict was politically motivated. These included restrictions on diplomats and other observers accessing the court room. The apparent deterioration of Leyla and Arif\u2019s health during the past year in pre-trial detention is also particularly worrying. We regularly raise concerns over Azerbaijan\u2019s poor human rights record and will continue to pay close attention to developments in this area. We will also look for further opportunities to urge Azerbaijan to abide by its international commitments and respect the rule of law, while taking concrete steps to improve the human rights situation in the country.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
