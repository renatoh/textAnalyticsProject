We were only interested in a couple of things: going out and dressing up. When we were 18 we decided to give it a go in London and moved down from Lancashire. We rented a flat just off the Harrow Road and I joined a band. One week, I spent all our rent money paying for the band's rehearsal. The other members were all going to pay me back but didn't give me the money in time. We had to somehow get the money together for the rent. Both of us had loads of secondhand clothes. Gerardine could make her own clothes and had a wardrobe full of unusual items. We heard that a new bit of Camden Market was being set up next to the Electric Ballroom, so we went down and got a stall a few pitches back from the front. We took just over \u00a3100. The rent was \u00a318 a week, so we were quids in. We decided to go back the next morning and caught the night bus at 3am from the Harrow Road to get the front stall and almost doubled what we had made before. Every Saturday morning for eight years we were in Camden at first light. We ended up with 16 stalls. That started our story. We were the first sellers of Doc Martens and set up our Red or Dead label. We were the first to sell secondhand clothes \u2013 they call it vintage now \u2013 on a large scale. This was in 1981. We knew there were lots of other people who shared our taste because they were out there in all the clubs in London and Manchester, but we didn't realise how big the market was. We learned so much. It was like going to college to learn about design but doing it from a market stall. Every week or two Jean Paul Gaultier used to come down. He was just starting out and would buy lots of secondhand clothes and Doc Martens. We had people like Marc Almond \u2013 all the pop stars of the time \u2013 because it was new to everybody. Within 18 months we were taking five grand a day. Gerardine and I would race to see who could take \u00a32,500. We used to go home on Saturday night, get a loft ladder and stuff all the notes in an old biscuit tin. We would crash out, then in the morning get it down, spread it all out and just count it. It wasn't on the agenda to be fashion designers. Without that lucky break that Saturday morning we wouldn't have had Red or Dead or the vintage festivals we put on. It all stemmed from that stall. We owe Camden a lot \u2013 it is part of our DNA. Wayne Hemingway is the face of the new Camden Town iPhone app"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
