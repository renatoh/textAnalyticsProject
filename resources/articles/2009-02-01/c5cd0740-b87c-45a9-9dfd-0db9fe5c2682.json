To celebrate Valentine's Day and President's Day, Rosen constructed a portrait of America's 44th and 16th presidents using over 5,600 cupcakes at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington DC. Each cupcake served as a pixel of colour, and the treats were promptly eaten by the museum's visitors after the installation piece ended on Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
