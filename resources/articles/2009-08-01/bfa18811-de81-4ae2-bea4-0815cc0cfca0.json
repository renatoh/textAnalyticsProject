Although it is a very long time since the catenaccio period of Italian football, when a combination of man-marking and a sweeper system stifled opponents and left spectators in a torpor, Capello still craves a high degree of order. The goals conceded by his side in Wednesday's 2-2 draw with Holland will have been an affront to him. He made an attempt to dismiss them as aberrations that have to be tolerated at this time of the year. \"The World Cup is not in pre-season,\" he said, acknowledging that his side had not been completely ready. \"We moved the ball too slowly at times. Sometimes it was long balls when we should press.\" Rustiness was supposedly excused, but there was a glint of Capello's real reaction to the follies in Amsterdam. He corrected someone who spoke of two lapses in concentration. \"No,\" said the Italian, \"three times we fell asleep.\" In addition to the goals, he had in mind the moment when Arjen Robben went clear in a move that ended with his attempt going over the bar. It would be enlivening to hear Capello reveal his true feelings about the defensive work since he has been appointed. There have been half-a-dozen clean sheets in 16 matches under his supervision. That is mediocre, but in context the statistics appear shabbier still. Trinidad and Tobago, Andorra (twice), Ukraine and Kazakhstan fill five places on the list. England can afford only to take a trace of satisfaction out of denying the United States a goal at Wembley in May of last year. Those opponents are 12th in the world rankings at the moment, five places behind Capello's squad. There is, of course, a case for categorising the main errors on Wednesday as brainstorms. It should be a very long time before Rio Ferdinand or Gareth Barry next tee up attackers with a calamitously misdirected pass. Beyond all that is a suspicion that the back four and the men in front of them have not gelled as well as they must do at the World Cup for which England will qualify, with two games to spare, if they beat Croatia at Wembley next month. Whatever prospects England have in that tournament will be undermined if the lack of rigour persists. Capello is yet to come up with a back four and a defensive midfield that can be trusted. The consolation for him is that the candidates are of a high calibre. He must, for example, be thankful to have Barry, Ferdinand, John Terry and Ashley Cole at his disposal. As a unit, however, the rearguard provokes misgivings. There will be a rush to fault Glen Johnson. Even so, he is not the first full-back to be reduced to a state of alarm by Robben and nobody had ever supposed that resistance was his forte. His work on the overlap secured his move from Portsmouth to Liverpool, but now he is at Anfield, with all its expectations, there will be a demand that he becomes steelier when the opposition have the ball. On Wednesday, Wes Brown's candidacy for right-back was enhanced. Indeed, players who are injured often find that their reputation rises steeply. The reality is that the Manchester United defender, when he next appears for England, will quite conceivably be chastised for not bringing the ball out of defence with the same fluency as Johnson. England need time to prepare and they will not get it until the gap between the close of the Premier League season and the start of the 2010 World Cup. Capello, unconsciously channelling so many of his harassed predecessors, sighed that just 10 players had been in condition to train on Monday. The following day the workload could not be too great, so close to the match itself. The most he can do is bring about a stable environment. He has remarked, teasingly, that he knows who his goalkeeper will be next June. He should let everyone, including his squad, in on the secret. Clarity can only reassure the back four. Considering his age and recent shoulder surgery, there must be reservations about David James resuming between the posts. Ben Foster has work to do to supplant Edwin van der Sar at Old Trafford when the Dutchman recovers from surgery on his hand. In theory, this is a promising period for Robert Green. The flaws in defence left him to show off his shot-stopping against Holland. Without him, England would have been defeated and the margin might have embarrassed Capello. Once again, the decision to meet leading sides in away friendlies has served the squad well. A game at Wembley would never have provided so much to consider. Capello will be encouraged that England, for all the difficulties, found a way not to be beaten."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
