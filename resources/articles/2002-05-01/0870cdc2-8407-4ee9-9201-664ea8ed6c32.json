In the last round of matches Somerset were well positioned against Leicestershire, only for rain to deny them the opportunity to press home their advantage. On this occasion they were thwarted by Sunday's rain and Surrey's batsmen. On Saturday evening Somerset had worked their way into a promising position, only for play the next day to be washed out. Yesterday could still have produced a thrilling finish but the prospect was denied by Surrey's ambition to remain undefeated. The day's proceedings began with promise of greater excitement. Surrey's Ian Salisbury cracked a half-volley from Matt Bulbeck to the cover boundary before being dismissed off the next delivery, caught by Mike Burns at suicide short-leg. But then the pattern of the day became clear, Ian Ward (67) and Ally Brown (48) settled down to put on 83, drawing the day Surrey's way. Alec Stewart (53) and Alex Tudor (44) were similarly dogged, adding a further 87 as Surrey posted 332. In hot evening sun, that mocked Sunday's miserable monsoon, Tudor had the satisfaction of Marcus Trescothick's scalp before everyone was allowed to go home. Elsewhere in the top division Richard Blakey's 83 was the highlight of the day at Headingley as Yorkshire's contest with Hampshire petered out to draw and rain brought the same result in a premature end to the match between Sussex and Leicestershire, with no play possible on the final two days. In the Second Division a brilliant unbeaten 111 from Jason Gallian guided Nottinghamshire to a seven-wicket victory over Northamptonshire at Trent Bridge. Gallian shared in a third-wicket stand of 183 with Usman Afzaal (88) as Notts passed their winning target of 230 in the 52nd over. Northants had earlier been bowled out for 159 in their second innings with Andy Harris taking seven for 54. Jack Russell frustrated Durham, his dogged unbeaten 78 enabling Gloucestershire to claim a draw having followed on at Chester-le-Street. And Essex, on the second day of their game, stood at 93 for three in their first innings having earlier bowled Derbyshire out for 158. Ashley Cowan was the pick of the bowlers with three for 41."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
