Evra's popularity in France has been grievously harmed by his contribution to France's troubles in South Africa, with the United left-back not forming a part of Laurent Blanc's squad since serving a five-game ban imposed by the national football federation. Marseille have some of the more vociferous fans in Europe and their one-time manager, Jean Fernandez, believes Didier Deschamps's players should target the man who was deposed as France captain in the wake of their early and ignominious exit from last summer's competition. \"It will be his first match in France since the 2010 World Cup, so people are certainly going to boo him,\" Fernandez said. \"Deschamps can play on that and tell whoever's directly up against Patrice to wind him up as much as he can until he snaps and eventually is booked. If that happens, Evra won't be able to defend effectively. \"That could be key in the end because his aggression is a big part in winning the ball back and you can't lose control. If you win [the tackles against him], you can move forward. If you lose them, you retreat.\" United are set to announce on Monday that Evra, who has been with the club for five years, has agreed a new four-year contract. The 29-year-old had considered leaving Old Trafford, tempted by the possibility of playing in Spain, but has decided to stay."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
