It was three days since Boris Johnson had announced a draconian lockdown, and, in a horrifyingly fearful time, it was not difficult to feel immense gratitude to those health workers risking everything to save lives. But was anyone else really going to turn out to clap? Few can have predicted the wall of noise that followed that first Thursday night and every Thursday since \u2013 the applause rising from doorsteps, the smiles and waves between neighbours who had never previously spoken to each other, the new national ritual that, for many, became the clearest fixed point in the week. Isolated in our homes, we were speaking together as never before. After nine extraordinary weeks \u2013 in which millions stood at their windows or doors to cheer and clank saucepans, hospital forecourts filled with applauding health workers, and landmarks the length of the country were illuminated in NHS blue \u2013 the woman behind Clap for our Carers spoke out this week to say that Thursday\u2019s burst of applause, in her view, should be the last. \u201cTo have the most impact, I think it is good to stop it at its peak,\u201d said Anne-Marie Plas. \u201cWithout getting too political,\u201d she said, she agreed with those who felt the national moment of applause was becoming politicised. \u201cI think the narrative is starting to change, and I don\u2019t want the clap to be negative.\u201d The message had got through on social media at least, where countless accounts urged their followers on Thursday, if this was indeed the last clap, to \u201cmake it a good one\u201d. The Twitter account of Visit Blackpool, temporarily rebranded Do Not Visit Blackpool, was typical: \u201cIt\u2019s the last hurrah for #ClapForCarers tonight so let\u2019s give an extra loud clap! Thank you to our NHS and key workers for their dedication.\u201d It made for a particularly emotional moment, as applause and cheers again swelled above the nation\u2019s streets, and health workers gathered once more to embrace and acknowledge the nation\u2019s thanks. North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Trust marked the occasion by posting a video of some of its staff applauding. \u201cTonight is the final #ClapforCarers \u2013 and we wanted to give YOU a round of applause as we clap for the country.\u201d In truth, of course, \u201cthe clap\u201d has been highly political from its first incarnation, when Rishi Sunak and Boris Johnson emerged from their Downing Street front doors to clap in front of the assembled camera crews, even as the medics they were thanking warned of the terrifying crisis hurtling towards them. A few weeks in, a beaming Matt Hancock, the health secretary, posted a video of himself applauding with colleagues on a departmental rooftop, adding: \u201cA huge THANK YOU to our incredible NHS and social care staff. We can never thank you enough for all that you are doing for the nation.\u201d With hundreds of people dying each day, and NHS and care workers appallingly exposed by an ongoing lack of PPE, the replies were caustic. As Britain\u2019s crisis has intensified, bringing horrifying and shaming numbers of deaths, a flailing government and \u2013 most recently \u2013 political scandal, the country\u2019s gratitude has not faded, but applause has increasingly felt for many like an inadequately simplistic response. With increasing numbers of health workers calling for the ritual to end \u2013 one, in the Guardian, describing it as \u201ca sentimental distraction from the issues facing us\u201d \u2013 the fate of the weekly clap was perhaps sealed. Will the connections it forged last beyond the current crisis? \u201cTen weeks ago I drew the curtains to see if anyone but me knew anything about this clapping and the figures of strangers were standing there at the windows,\u201d the novelist Linda Grant tweeted immediately after 8pm on Thursday. \u201cNow they\u2019re familiar faces.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
