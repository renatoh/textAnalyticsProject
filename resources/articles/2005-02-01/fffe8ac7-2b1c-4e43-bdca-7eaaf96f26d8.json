Holland, two places above Sven-Goran Eriksson's team, are apparently the sixth best side in the world. This is only a friendly yet it should stretch England more than the home World Cup qualifiers next month with Northern Ireland (109th in Fifa's table) and Azerbaijan (115th). Eriksson is notorious for a lack of interest in the outcome of preparatory matches, but even his indifference has its limits. Though England's 1-0 loss to Spain in Madrid is now notorious for the home supporters' racist chanting, the manager has not forgotten how abjectly his team performed that November night. Before any second-half experiments take place at Villa Park he needs to see far more concentration and sharpness. His selection to meet Marco van Basten's team looks predictable, particularly considering injuries to Sol Campbell, Nicky Butt and Alan Smith. Stewart Downing, 20, will be in the party that is announced this evening but the novelty of watching a left-winger in Eriksson's line-up ought to be postponed until the later part of the game. Recent outings at Chelsea and Manchester United showed that too much should not be demanded of him just yet. The manager must give thought to the left flank. Ashley Cole and Wayne Bridge were miserable playing together there in Madrid and, though Eriksson might try that pairing again in the future, the Chelsea full-back is out of form. No one was surprised by reports that Jose Mourinho wants to bring Cole to Stamford Bridge. The England manager has already suggested that Shaun Wright-Phillips will appear on the left of midfield. The fact that he is right-footed need not be an insuperable problem, particularly if Cole supplies width with his overlapping runs. Wright-Phillips has collected three caps without starting and, at 23, it is time to test Kevin Keegan's claim that he will be impossible to drop once a place is found for him. Another 23-year-old, Andy Johnson, is less heralded but should also be picked. England (possible): Robinson, James, Green, G Neville, Terry, Ferdinand, A Cole, Carragher, King, Bridge, Beckham, Lampard, Gerrard, Wright-Phillips, Dyer, Hargreaves, J Cole, Jenas, Downing, Rooney, Owen, Johnson, Defoe."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
