Human rights groups last week staged a protest against Gulnara Karimova, the 39-year-old eldest daughter of Uzbekistan's dictatorial president Islam Karimov, being included in the fashion week. Her label, Guli, had been scheduled to present its spring 2012 collection at New York's Lincoln Centre this Thursday. Karimova has held several high-level positions in her father's government, which is notorious for its human rights record. She is Uzbekistan's ambassador to Spain but, on top of her fashion career, has also been a pop singer using the name Googoosha. She showcased Guli at New York fashion week last year, and at Milan in 2009, but activists had not been aware of her identity. Karimova's image has this year been further damaged by leaked US embassy cables which commented on her character, describing her as \"something like a robber baron\" and also \"the single most hated person in the country\". At the launch of New York fashion week last week, groups including Human Rights Watch staged a demonstration. Organisers IMG said: \"As a result of various concerns raised, we have cancelled the Guli show on 15 September.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
