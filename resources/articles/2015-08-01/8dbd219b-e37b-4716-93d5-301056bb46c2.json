Or it might not even be a cook book: it could be a television star\u2019s memoir \u2013 Sue Perkins, co-presenter of the Great British Bake Off, say, or soon to be Top Gear\u2019s Chris Evans \u2013 or a football autobiography like Big Sam from manager and former player Sam Allardyce, or the thrilling working life of a pop star, like On the Road, marketed with the enticing query, \u201cWant to know what really goes on during an Olly Murs UK tour?\u201d Or it might be a straight spin-off from a television programme, such as A-Z of Pointless from actor turned quiz show host Alexander Armstrong, Dick &amp; Dom\u2019s Christmas Jokes, or Gogglebook from the people who brought you Gogglebox. The clues are in the announcement of more than 500 titles to be published on Super Thursday, 8 October, the publishing industry\u2019s major assault on the Christmas market, previewed inFriday\u2019s Bookseller. The date will also see the launch of the third annual Books Are My Bag, a celebration of books and bookshops, with events including signings and readings across the UK and Ireland. The artist Grayson Perry has designed a limited edition bookbag, following last year\u2019s sell-out version by Tracy Emin, and there will also be a children\u2019s version featuring the Charlie and Lola characters of Lauren Child. This year 503 books will be published in hardback on Super Thursday, twice as many as in an average week, and 300 more than than in the following week. The list is heavy on celebrity memoirs, whose grip on the bestseller lists was said to be on the wane. It includes Sirs Tom Jones and Terry Wogan. The latter\u2019s Those Were the Days, billed as \u201ctales of love, loss and friendship from a national treasure\u201d, is presumably an update on his last autobiography, Is It Me?, published in 2001. However Tom Tivnan, features editor of the Bookseller, thinks the list is more solid and more varied than in previous years. \u201cThe celebrity memoirs are still there but the publishers are being much more judicious, and going for the surefire winners\u201d he says. \u201cThe day of the silly advance has also largely gone. It\u2019s good to see Brian Blessed on the list, but it\u2019s very unlikely that the publishers will have paid a huge amount of money to get him.\u201d His other predictions for bestsellers include, in fiction, Martina Cole, Robert Harris and Conn Iggulden, and in non-fiction, the new book from Bill Bryson, The Road to Little Dribbling, his first travel book in 15 years. He also notes some real heavyweights, the sort of book traditionally published in the early autumn or spring lists: he credits British Museum director Neil McGregor\u2019s 2012 History of the World in 100 Objects as the game changer. The spin-off not of a television show but of a BBC Radio 4 series sold more than 100,000 copies in the US alone. The endlessly imitated formula, turns up this year in architectural historian Dan Cruickshank\u2019s History of Architecture in 100 Buildings. This Christmas the historians and heavyweight biographers include Charles Moore\u2019s second volume of his Margaret Thatcher biography, Justin Bates\u2019s life of the poet Ted Hughes, and Andrew Marr\u2019s poetry history of We British: An Epic in Poetry. Tivnan is also struck by the number of books for children on the list \u2013 including the first of a four-book deal which raised eyebrows in the trade, Pharrell Williams\u2019 Happy. Williams sold 13.9m copies of his song Happy last year, when it became the most downloaded track in UK history, and his publishers are confident he can carve a similar swath through the children\u2019s book market with an initial print run of 250,000 copies. There are also new children\u2019s books from Michael Morpurgo, whose War Horse inspired a multi award-winning play and film; Eoin Colfer; Jacqueline Wilson, whose Little Stars is eagerly awaited by her thousands of young fans; Reiver Rat from Gruffalo creator Julia Donaldson; and Carry On, by a rising star in the field, Rainbow Rowell, author of the bestseller Fangirl. \u201cThat\u2019s got to be good news, to see publishers building the children\u2019s market as a cornerstone of their business,\u201d Tivnan said. \u201cTraditionally these books were published for the summer holidays, but in targeting the Christmas market they are hopefully building the adult readers of the future.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
