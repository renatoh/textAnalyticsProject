They all say that, of course, but DeGale showed enough power and slickness in stopping the unbeaten American Brandon Gonzales in four rounds at Wembley to suggest he deserves the opportunity to make his case. DeGale is now the mandatory challenger for Froch\u2019s IBF belt but, if Froch decides to vacate and fight the former WBC middleweight champion Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Jr in Las Vegas, DeGale could yet be manoeuvred into an IBF world title fight against either his old foe George Groves or Mikkel Kessler. And the likable 28-year-old will be hugely encouraged that his promoter, Eddie Hearn, has promised a world title next \u2013 with the possibility of a mega-fight against Froch next year. \u201cThat\u2019s the one I want,\u201d said DeGale. \u201cI always said that I am all wrong for Froch. I have huge respect for him, but when we fight I am very confident in beating him.\u201d Recently he told the Guardian exactly why in brusque, bullet-point style: \u201cHe\u2019s slow. Technically his feet are all over the place. His chin is up in the air. He holds his hands down.\u201d Whatever happens next, DeGale has plenty of options and opportunities \u2013something that didn\u2019t seem the case when he considered quitting last year. \u201cI have been boxing injured since I won the European title [in October 2011],\u201d DeGale said on Saturday night. \u201cI had a problem with a knee. I had something called Gilmore\u2019s groin. For two and a half years I have been getting through fights and being paid, if I am being brutally honest. \u201cThe last couple of fights boxing on [Channel] Five I was rubbish. I was just getting through them. But now I\u2019m injury-free and fighting at Wembley Stadium, not shopping centres. These big stages are what I am made for.\u201d Three of DeGale\u2019s previous six contests had been at Bluewater shopping centre in Kent, not far from the Dartford tunnel. There was a sense his career was stuck in a traffic jam. But at Wembley Stadium, he had his mojo back. Would the punch that hurt Groves have floored him? \u201cListen, if anyone hits you on the chin you are probably going to get hurt,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t be in the position to be hit with one of the swinging right hands.\u201d DeGale\u2019s trainer, Jim McDonnell, also believes he has the tools to give Froch all the trouble in the world. \u201cBoxing is all about styles,\u201d he said. \u201cFroch has a chin, an engine, and he\u2019s a true soldier but James has amazing talent. George Groves is fast but James is faster. His hand speed is amazing and he has such a fast jab. He could dominate fights just with his jab.\u201d McDonnell added: \u201cPeople don\u2019t realise he can punch too, but I have seen what he has done with good fighters in the gym. He\u2019s not like some fighters who can only do in for five to six rounds. He spars 15 rounds. He is there for the full journey. He\u2019s the real ticket.\u201d DeGale has a lot of knockers but his CV remains impressive: British champion in his ninth fight; European champion in his 12th fight; and only a solitary blemish on his record \u2013 to Groves, who fiddled and flicked his way to a highly contentious majority points verdict. On Saturday night, when he was asked whether he would take on Groves again immediately, he shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t need him,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m moving on with my career. He had his chance of a rematch and he didn\u2019t take it. Now is my time.\u201d But asked whether it could happen in the future, DeGale\u2019s stance softened and he offered a few words of solace for his bitter enemy. \u201cI think so with our rivalry,\u201d he said. \u201cLet\u2019s be real, he\u2019s a good fighter. He\u2019ll come back and he will win a world title.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
