Porter sounds great, engages with audiences, and sings songs you can go away humming - and he's sentimental, which puts off hardcore jazzers but hooks a big slice of everybody else. Liquid Spirit is Porter's debut for Blue Note, and its title track is the kind of gospelly, handclapping swinger the singer excels on, while Lonesome Lover is a coolly smouldering mid-tempo feature that could have graced a Blue Note set back in the 1960s. The steady-gaze frankness of Hey Laura is a standout, and Wolfcry is delivered with an expert ballad eloquence almost in Tony Bennett's range. But it's the funky groovers on which he sounds most at home, such as the organ-swirling, horn-pumping Free, and a teasingly casual account of the 60s hit The In Crowd. It's a better balanced Porter album than formerly, and as classily polished and confident as is usual from Blue Note."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
