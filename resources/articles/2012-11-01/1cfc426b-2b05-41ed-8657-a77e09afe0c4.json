It was a relieved Arsenal manager who departed Goodison Park and a tribute that concentrated on the spirit but not quality of his players told of a team struggling to keep pace with the leading lights of the Premier League. While the Everton manager seethed at the referee Michael Oliver's refusal to award a penalty for a foul by Mikel Arteta on Steven Pienaar and bemoaned a recovery that fell short of victory, Wenger focused instead on the prospect of a brighter future for Arsenal. They offered only sporadic glimpses of an encouraging present at Goodison, a ground where they had won on four of their past five visits, as they failed to capitalise on Theo Walcott's first-minute goal or show the quality and confidence to justify Moyes's prediction. \"I thought 1-1 was a fair result and it is a good point here,\" said Wenger, who at least was spared the criticism he received from Arsenal supporters in the goalless draw at Villa Park on Saturday. \"The game was played with remarkable intensity and we had to show good spirit to get away with a point because Everton were really up for it. I am pleased with the spirit we showed. We have played eight of our 14 league games away from home now \u2013 against both Manchester and Liverpool clubs \u2013 and if we play well at home we have the chance to come back.\" Everton were indeed \"up for it\" \u2013 after a slow and costly start \u2013 but an improvement on recent displays lacked the finesse in front of goal to restore momentum to their own pursuit of the top four. Moyes savours night games under Goodison lights but the old ground was subdued before the seats had been warmed as Arsenal took the lead with 52 seconds on the clock. Collecting the ball just inside the Everton half, Walcott cut in from the right and evaded the challenge of Phil Jagielka before finding Aaron Ramsey lurking on the left of the area. Walcott continued his run unchecked, Ramsey returned a fine reverse pass having drawn Tony Hibbert inside and the England international had time to steady himself before curling a right-footed finish into the far, top corner. An exquisite goal to mark Walcott's return from injury. Wenger added: \"We had a few more chances on the counterattack but we didn't do well with the final ball. We could have been more clinical.\" Arsenal's celebrations were still flowing when Laurent Koscielny suffered a groin injury that may keep him out for three weeks but, with Jack Wilshere, Santi Cazorla and Arteta dominating, the disruption was not initially felt. Everton were stunned by the early setback. Gradually, however, Leighton Baines and Pienaar began to pick their way around Bacary Sagna at right-back, Marouane Fellaini started to hold up play up front and they hauled themselves back. Pienaar was fortunate to keep his place at the expense of Bryan Oviedo but repaid Moyes's confidence with an instrumental role in the equaliser. The chance appeared to have gone when Pienaar held off three challenges in the Arsenal midfield and released Nikica Jelavic only for Wojciech Szczesny to smother. But the visitors conceded possession cheaply as Sagna played Arteta into trouble and Pienaar dispossessed his former Everton team-mate deep in Arsenal territory. The ball broke for Fellaini who controlled with his chest and stroked a left-footed shot into the bottom corner from 22 yards. Szczesny had little chance with the Belgium international's seventh goal of the season. Thereafter Arsenal enjoyed plenty of possession but only half chances for Olivier Giroud, whereas Everton had less of the play but carried the greater threat. Jelavic, who has been ill in recent days and was not in Moyes's plans on Tuesday, shot wastefully over after beating Per Mertesacker and denied the outstanding Baines a clean run on the Arsenal goal when he took the ball despite being in a clear offside position. Pienaar also failed to capitalise on several incisive runs into the Arsenal area though one was halted by a pull from Arteta. Moyes, who could be without Baines at Manchester City on Saturday with a hamstring strain, said: \"It was a certain penalty. We played against a really good Arsenal team and referees' decisions often decide big games like this but we got nothing tonight. The players had to earn everything because we were never getting a jot from him.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
