Throughout her press conference on Saturday, Lam adopted a resolute, unapologetic and defensive tone that her critics labelled arrogant and insincere. In her opening speech, she stuck to her justification of the bill, insisting it was to seek justice for a young Hong Kong woman murdered by her boyfriend in Taiwan \u2013 a rationale that many doubted because Taiwan had already said it would not receive the murder suspect. She said she was acting out of \u201cempathy\u201d towards the victim\u2019s family. Lam defended the bill as \u201ca good thing\u201d that would facilitate international cooperation in bringing fugitives to justice and said she was \u201cperplexed by the extreme reaction\u201d of people who opposed such a \u201claudable objective\u201d. She suggested it was because they hadn\u2019t examined the content of the proposed legislation. \u201cTo withdraw the bill will be erroneous. I cannot accept it as it\u2019s a needed objective,\u201d she insisted. Even while acknowledging that hundreds of thousands of people opposed the bill, which could result in suspects being sent for trial in mainland China, Lam insisted it was not the bill that was the problem, but the inadequate communication. And even then, she appeared to blame the opponents, saying she didn\u2019t understand why the communication was not effective enough. Throughout the press conference, Lam was repeatedly asked whether she would still characterise the protests as a \u201criot\u201d as she did on Wednesday after the mass protest assembled. After trying to dodge the question several times, she eventually said it was the police authorities who had dubbed it a riot and she agreed with them. Journalists also asked whether she felt compelled to apologise to the unarmed people who had been shot at by police with rubber bullets and teargas, and hit by batons, and whether she would consider releasing innocent people who had been arrested. She insisted that \u201ceverything must be done according to the law\u201d and it was \u201conly fair and reasonable\u201d for the police to enforce the law. She argued that some of the protesters had instigated violence by throwing bricks at officers. Lam refused to apologise but said she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d over injuries among the police, before acknowledging that journalists and ordinary people had also been hurt. To a barrage of questions on whether she should resign over her decision to carry on pushing the bill despite the million-strong protest last Sunday, Lam adopted a defiant tone, stressing that she had served Hong Kong for 40 years and would continue to \u201cuse my experience to create a better future\u201d. She thanked the pro-government legislators and those who had supported the bill, but did not mention her political opponents and citizens who had blocked it, and emphasised that it had only been suspended to restore peace. The press conference was stopped abruptly after 90 minutes; Lam simply walked out, ignoring dozens of journalists who continued to shout out questions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
