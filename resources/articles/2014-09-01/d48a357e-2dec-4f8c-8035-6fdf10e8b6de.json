Wood is Tom Selznick, returning to the concert hall after a catastrophic bout of stage fright, his glamorous wife Emma (Kerry Bish\u00e9) caught in the sights of an unseen assassin as he wrestles with the terrors of La Cinquette. Recycling riffs (visual and thematic) from Argento\u2019s Opera and De Palma\u2019s Snake Eyes, this English-language Spanish production has set-piece spectacle to spare. The script may be clunky but the execution is slickly tense, with Mira playing (as Eric Morecambe would have it) all the right notes in all the right order."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
