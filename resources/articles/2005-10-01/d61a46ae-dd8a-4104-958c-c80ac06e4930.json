Scott Tod, which operates 2,200 cash machines, yesterday laid some of the blame for its woes at the door of the media. It said \"unprecedented press criticism\" of fee-charging ATMs had made many people resistant to paying a charge to withdraw their own money. It also blamed a number of \"poor business decisions\" - a not-so-veiled attack on the former chief executive, Nick Tod, ousted in August after a strategy dispute. Mr Tod, whose father Roger founded the company and still works there, is now demanding a shareholder vote aimed at restoring his seat on the board and removing David Massie, the chairman who removed him. He has requisitioned an extraordinary general meeting, and given the company 21 days to call it. Yesterday's results statement said the company had lost almost \u00a34m in the year to June 30, compared with a \u00a3399,000 profit last year. It added that Mr Tod had been replaced by Lawrence Watts, the former chief operating officer. Last night, Mr Massie said the company had started the year with the market expecting almost \u00a32m profit. He said: \"There has to be a question of accountability there. He [Mr Tod] was chief executive.\" The shares closed down 1p at 15.5p. They traded at more than 70p little more than 18 months ago."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
