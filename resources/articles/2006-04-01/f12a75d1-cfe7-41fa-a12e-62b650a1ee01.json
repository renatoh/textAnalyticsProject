In deciding to award the north-east regional FM analogue radio licence, the last one serving more than 2 million people, to Saga, Ofcom appears to have signalled a gap in the area's commercial market for the older audience. There were several applicants with a similar proposition, in contrast to rock, children's and speech pitches, from a total of 13 applicants. Saga's mix of easy listening, from Bing to Sting, was the format which the regulator decided best achieved the criteria defined by section 105 of the Broadcasting Act. Saga will be delighted to have won a station which, were it to dispose of it, could achieve a future price tag of \u00a320m, particularly on the back of a recent decision to take their national digital service Primetime off DAB's Digital One multiplex, controlled by GCap Media. The economics of delivering commercial radio services to the 50+ audience are challenging, because advertisers are not prepared to pay the same cost per thousand (cpt) for advertising as younger audiences. In the West Midlands, where Saga has another FM licence, it achieves about 50p cpt, which would be unsustainable for a standalone operator. But Saga can square the circle because it uses its stations as promotional devices for other Saga products, so that the radio station benefits from advertising others can't achieve. Why did Murphy leave RDF Media? Stuart Murphy's abrupt departure from indie RDF after just three months has prompted the predictable response that he just didn't fit. The lack of PR spin (from both sides) suggests their parting was neither totally amicable nor planned. As controller of both, Murphy successfully navigated the transition from BBC Choice to BBC3, as well as surviving a change of director general, a new director of TV, and moving channel controller chairs at BBC1, 2 and 4. He may be an opinionated executive, but he is not without good interpersonal skills. As a colleague on the executive of the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International TV Festival, he was always brimming with creative ideas, especially about talent, and pitched them with panache. A more plausible reason for his short tenure at RDF is a lack of clarity of role. As controller of BBC3, the turf is defined, with a clear brief to commission the most distinctive public service programmes for the target audience from a fixed budget. As creative director at RDF the job was more amorphous - in fact his first task was probably to carve out the scope of the role, aware of the big personalities around him. There is speculation that Murphy will return to the BBC. But going back rarely works. My money is on him hooking up with a small production company just carving out a niche in a market where his creativity can really make an impact. Will Disney's Desperate gamble pay off? Disney's announcement that its top Touchstone-produced shows Desperate Housewives and Lost will be available free over the internet in the US represents a big strategic shift for a company expert at maximising revenue from content by exploiting it through every available window, from pay television to DVD. It's also a vote of confidence by the Hollywood studio in advertising, still the main revenue source of its ABC TV network. The programmes will be streamed with advertising from leading clients including Unilever, embedded with the content. It will not be possible to fast- forward the ads (as it is for Sky+ users) because ABC will control the rate at which the video stream is delivered. Disney's experimental service is a bold innovation which appears to recognise the necessity to test new delivery platforms, and is motivated, in part, by the fact that people are already downloading \"hot talked about shows\" using peer to peer networks before they are shown on conventional TV, without paying a penny. While there is some doubt about the technical quality of the Disney service, expect other shows to be added quickly. Although not yet available in the UK, it's a business model which will be adored by advertisers and copied by other Hollywood studios."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
