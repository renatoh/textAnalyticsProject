Assume that the Trump administration \u2013 which lies so easily and so often on matters big and small \u2013 can tell the truth about the Mueller investigation. Forget the cover-up about separating families at the border and jailing children. Pretend it has fully embraced the death toll of more than 3,000 Americans in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. Imagine Trump\u2019s inauguration crowds really were exceptionally large. Let\u2019s just give the new attorney general, Bill Barr, the benefit of the doubt, based on his service in the George HW Bush administration if nothing else. Let\u2019s also assume his four-page summary of the special counsel\u2019s investigation is the very best case he can make on behalf of the man who just hired him. That case would sink any other leader in any other western country. Any previous president of the United States would need to start lawyering up for impeachment. As Barr points out, the Mueller report is divided into two. One part is about Russian interference in the 2016 election, which Trump has repeatedly dismissed as a Democratic excuse for why Hillary Clinton lost. The second part is about Trump\u2019s obstruction of justice in seeking to halt the Russian investigation. According once again to Trump\u2019s own attorney general, making his best possible case for his boss, Mueller declined to make \u201ca traditional prosecutorial judgment\u201d about whether Trump committed the crime of obstruction. So Barr made it for him. Strip away all the legal throat-clearing, and he decides the case is \u201cnot sufficient\u201d. Quoting Mueller, Barr writes: \u201cWhile this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him.\u201d Now, you might be wondering why a sitting president would sail so close to the wind that he might just be guilty of obstruction of justice. Normal people sitting on a jury, or voting in an election, might be curious as to why a president would possibly, maybe, commit a serious crime \u2013 depending on your reading of the law and Trump\u2019s intent \u2013 to stop an investigation into Russian interference in his own election. Then again, normal people asked the same questions of Richard Nixon, who infamously demonstrated that the cover-up could be worse than the crimes of Watergate. It might be too much to imagine this tweet-raging president quitting office under threat of impeachment, as Nixon did. But it\u2019s not too much to consider the impact of this cover-up on voters in next year\u2019s elections. As for the Russia investigation itself, Barr says Mueller writes that \u201cthe investigation did not establish that members of the Trump campaign conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in its election interference activities\u201d. \u201cCase not proven\u201d on two counts sounds like the end of a long Democratic dream. It\u2019s actually a blessing. For starters, Mueller\u2019s considerations were narrowly drawn and judged but the issues he has surfaced \u2013 and the investigations he has spawned \u2013 are far broader. In particular, US and state attorneys in New York are peeling away the layers of the stinking onion that is the Trump family business. Those layers include hush money to a porn star, fraudulent statements to lenders and insurers about real estate, a sham family foundation and corruption involving foreign donations to an inaugural committee. In short, a president who may or may not be guilty of obstruction of justice doesn\u2019t suddenly grow a halo of legal purity while running for president. And he doesn\u2019t clean up his act in office, either. Both Congress and the southern district of New York have a very long way to go. They might just find out why Trump was so determined \u2013 even if he didn\u2019t commit a crime, in the view of his own attorney general \u2013 to stop the Russian investigation. Especially if the investigation Trump feared was far more about his business than his election. Much like last year\u2019s elections, the Mueller report has done Democrats a huge favor. Winning both the Senate and House would have set up a titanic clash between Congress and the White House, the kind of clash White Houses have often won in time for re-election. In the same way, a clear and damning Mueller report would have set up a titanic clash over impeachment: a process that would fail in this Republican-controlled Senate, no matter the evidence presented. There will be many Democrats disappointed Mueller did not scream \u201cGuilty!\u201d and that impeachment remains on hold. But party leadership, and election veterans, know short-term disappointment offers a long-running advantage. It means a year of more congressional revelations and a year of more indictments. It means the 2020 election can be forward-looking about Trump\u2019s fitness for office, rather than backward-looking about the last election. It means more consideration of corruption and less talk of collusion. Voters, as well as lawyers, may struggle to define collusion and to prove conspiracies beyond reasonable doubt. Even when a presidential candidate goes on national TV to ask the Russians to hack his opponent\u2019s emails. But what voters readily understand is the stench of corruption around a man who promised to drain the swamp. Populism tends to lose its popularity when the populists are more concerned with personal profit than public service. With a large field of talented candidates running to drive Trump from office, Democrats can look forward to a long and fine discussion of what standards of conduct and character we expect from a president. Within minutes of Barr\u2019s summary of the Mueller report being released, Trump told reporters the report was \u201ccomplete and total exoneration\u201d. That\u2019s because, in this White House, the words \u201ccomplete and total\u201d have come to mean \u201cpartial and unfinished\u201d. With so many legal threads hanging half-pulled from the rags that still cover Donald Trump, the undressing of this president has only reached the end of the first tease."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
