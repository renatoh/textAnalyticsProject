The term haka, although associated with the war dance version used by the All Blacks, describes all forms of Maori dance and performance. There are many variations but the All Black use Ka Mate, Ka Mate, one specifically intended as a precursor to battle. The word is made up of two parts: ha - translates as breath, ka - to ignite or energise. As such, the Haka is a way to ignite the breath, energise the body and inspire the spirit. Haka history It was the 1905-06 All Black touring side to Britain who popularised the haka. It was performed at the first Test against Scotland on 18 November and against Wales . The 'Invincibles' that came to Britain in 1924-25 had their own haka, which was written by two fans on the voyage over. New Zealand lock Read Masters, in his tour book, recalled seeing the following translation of the song in the local press: 'Now we are in England feed us, feed us! Or we will tear you! Tear you!!!' Biscuits were sent to the All Blacks stating that in return the senders expected to stay in one piece. The call The haka leader, normally an All Black of Maori descent, spurs on the team, before leading the dance, with the following chant: Ringa pakia (Slap hands against thighs) Uma tiraha (Puff out the chest) Turi whatia (Bend the knees) Hope whai ake (Let the hip follow) Waewae takahia kia kino (Stamp the feet as hard as you can). The full Ka Mate Haka Ka mate! Ka mate! (It is death! It is death!) Ka ora! Ka ore! (It is life! It is life!) Tenei te tangata puhuru huru (This is the hairy person) Nana i tiki mai (Who caused the sun to shine) Whakawhiti te ra (Keep abreast! Keep abreast!) A hupane kaupane! (The rank! Hold fast!) A upane kaupane whiti te ra! (Into the sun that shines!!). How to face the Haka There are 15 large Kiwis chanting in your face. Do you run, hide or go nose to nose? 1. Into the valleys In November 1905, a Wales team (and the crowd) burst into an 'awe-inspiring' version of Land of my Fathers after the haka. 2. The Campese The Australia winger and full-back preferred to ignore the haka ritual completely and warm up with a ball until the war dance ended. 3. The Nose Job In November 1989, at Landsdown Road, Ireland captain Willie Henderson led his whole team forward to face the haka.
