The saga of Wenger\u2019s future will finally be resolved this week, with an announcement set for Wednesday \u2013 the day after a meeting of the full board, which Wenger himself will attend as usual. Wenger has made it clear he thinks he ought to be allowed to continue into what would be his 22nd season at the club while he says he knows \u201cwhat I would like to happen\u201d. The chairman, Sir Chips Keswick, announced on 9 March the decision on the manager\u2019s future would be taken mutually and Wenger has now put the ball into the board\u2019s court with what amounts to a demand for them to back him. The Frenchman is expected \u2013 overwhelmingly so \u2013 to stay, despite the opposition of a voluble section of the club\u2019s fanbase. Nobody has said, for sure, that he will do so. The majority shareholder, Stan Kroenke, will be at the meeting, together with his son, Josh, who joined the board in 2013. Also in attendance will be the chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, Keswick, the directors Ken Friar and Lord Harris of Peckham, and the club secretary, David Miles. Wenger said: \u201cWe live in a society that always wants change but, at the end of the day, football is about making the right decision and every company is about making the right decision. That\u2019s why I say it\u2019s not about popularity, it\u2019s about competence and I have not got that responsibility. It\u2019s the board who has to decide who will lead the club in the future and, if they want me, I have to decide: \u2018Do I say yes or no?\u2019\u201d Wenger was asked about the format of the meeting and whether he might have to make a presentation to the directors that outlined why they should persist with him. \u201cThe best presentation? Watch the game [from Saturday],\u201d he said. \u201cAnd there can be no doubt.\u201d It has long been accepted that Wenger, whose contract expires next month, has had the offer of a two-year deal on the table since the early months of the season. There has been persistent talk that he agreed, in principle, to the terms of it in December. But more recently the dynamics appeared to have changed, with Gazidis pushing his \u201ccatalyst for change\u201d agenda in response to the team\u2019s slump, which began at the end of January. They lost seven of 12 matches in all competitions and, despite an end-of-season rally, they finished fifth in the Premier League and missed out on Champions League qualification. Gazidis has come to feel that tweaks and improvements have to be made to various structures, including coaching and scouting, but Wenger has made plain his opposition to some of them \u2013 particularly the notion of a director of football. A power struggle has developed between him and Gazidis, and Wenger was evasive when he was asked whether he felt he retained the board\u2019s backing. \u201cI don\u2019t think I can answer that question at the moment,\u201d he said. Wenger did confess to a regret \u2013 he ought to have resolved the issue of his future sooner. He talked immediately after the Cup final about how the \u201cuncertainty\u201d over it had affected the players. He added: \u201cFor me the contract does not have a special meaning but, because of the debate, I should have sorted that out earlier.\u201d The club captain, Per Mertesacker, one of the stars of the Wembley win, said of the manager: \u201cHe was happy but quiet after the game. We\u2019re all waiting for Tuesday. There was great relief on Saturday night but it didn\u2019t feel as if it was the end. We don\u2019t know how the decision will go. I\u2019m sure he wants to continue.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
