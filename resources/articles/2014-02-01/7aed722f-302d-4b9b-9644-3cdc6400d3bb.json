West Ham go 10th, 22 points behind Liverpool in fourth four points above the bottom three. A point above West Brom takes them above Sunderland, who drop to 18th, on goal difference - they both have 24 points. Cardiff are going down. Probably. Night! Full-time: West Brom 1-1 Chelsea: A great point for Chelsea, one that consolidates their position in the top four. Willian shoots! West Brom block! Corner! In the sixth minute of added time! Victor Anichebe races on to a long pass in behind Cahill, beating the Chelsea defender for pace and storming into the area - but Cahill gets back to deny him! Oof, ah. Mourinho\u2019s face, though. Oh Chelsea! GOAL! West Brom 1-1 Chelsea (Anichebe): The pressure tells, just as it did against Everton and Liverpool! And it\u2019s Victor Anichebe, West Brom\u2019s saviour against Liverpool, who has headed past Petr Cech. There was a bit of flapping there. West Brom deserve it. There are roughly five minutes left at The Hawthorns. Chelsea are being pinned back. Here\u2019s where they could do with Jay Tee. \u201cBrazil 82,\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cWest Ham 14. The beautiful game.\u201d Full-time: Hull 0-1 Southampton: Jose Fonte\u2019s goal is enough for Southampton. West Brom, who are all over Chelsea, should have had a penalty but David Luiz is not penalised for pulling Victor Anichebe\u2019s shirt. Hull are running out of time. Southampton are closing in on victory. \u201cThree wins on the trot and suddenly we\u2019re in the top half?\u201d says David Carrington. \u201cHow the hell did that happen?\u201d I\u2019m not sure, but I hope you\u2019ll agree that it\u2019s not too late to make a charge for the top four. GOAL! Sheffield Wednesday 0-3 Wigan (Fortune): A good result for Wigan at Hillsborough. Full-time: West Ham 2-0 Norwich: West Ham were largely dismal but found a way; it\u2019s their third successive 2-0 win and they go 10th. Hello, mid-table obscurity. GOAL! West Ham 2-0 Norwich (Diame): The points are West Ham\u2019s! Mo Diame races the length of the pitch against an exposed Norwich defence and his weak shot takes a deflection and dribbles into the bottom corner. Thievy has blootered a great chance wide for West Brom. Chelsea want to wake up sharpish. It\u2019s finished in the game I\u2019ve not been covering - and it\u2019s Cardiff 0-0 Aston Villa. That\u2019s a result that doesn\u2019t do much for either side. Chelsea have been looking for a second goal to finish West Brom. But they haven\u2019t found it and now the hosts are pressing. A free-kick from Snodgrass, a header from Bassong and a save from Adrian. West Ham hold on. GOAL! Huddersfield 0-2 Nottingham Forest (Paterson): The second of the evening for Jamie Paterson. John Ruddy has the thousand-yard stare on. But Chris Hughton should also take a bit of the blame - Norwich were in control and he handed some sort of initiative back to West Ham by taking off Hooper and Redmond. GOAL! West Ham 1-0 Norwich (Collins): James Collins breaks the tedium by glancing in a free-kick from the left. It\u2019s a horrible piece of goalkeeping from John Ruddy, who came for the ball and got nowhere near it. A huge goal for the hosts. GOAL! Leyton Orient 1-3 Bristol City (Flint): The visitors restore their two-goal advantage. GOAL! Yeovil 1-1 Millwall (Morison): It\u2019s ok, no need for Steve Lomas to return. GOAL! Bolton 0-1 Burnley (Vokes): A big goal at the top of the Championship. It was Jose Fonte\u2019s goal for Southampton at Hull. Unlucky, Rickie Lambert. WEST HAM HAVE A SHOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! But John Ruddy has made a magnificent save to deny Mo Diame after he was flicked clear by Nolan. Actually that Southampton goal might go down as Jose Fonte\u2019s - his shot was the third out of four. It was blocked on the line but may have been over. Er, isn\u2019t that what goal-line technology is for? GOAL!!!!!! Hull 0-1 Southampton (Lambert): After a preposterous scramble, featuring three great saves by Steve Harper, Rickie Lambert finally puts the ball away at the fourth time of asking, slamming home from six yards out! Norwich have had all the chances tonight and Hooper has wasted their best one. While it was a good save by Adrian, Hooper really should have scored after being played through but he shot at the goalkeeper\u2019s legs. Over at The Hawthorns, Foster beats away a stinging drive from Samuel Eto\u2019o as Chelsea look for a second. GOAL! Yeovil 1-0 Millwall (Ralls): Bring back Steve Lomas! GOAL! Huddersfield 0-1 Nottingham Forest (Paterson): A fine header from Jamie Paterson. GOAL! Brighton 1-0 Leeds (Ulloa): Will everyone please stop kicking Leeds? \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but notice the advert for General Manager, Events at Manchester United, advertised alongside your minute-by-minute. Could this mean the end for Moyes?\u201d says Huw Alexander. \u201cNot sure if ability to make a nice prawn sandwich is a requirement.\u201d They\u2019re off again at the Hawthorns. Chelsea lead 1-0 thanks to Ivanovic\u2019s goal. Hard to believe, but West Ham are badly missing Andy Carroll. Marco Borriello hasn\u2019t made much of a difference since replacing Carlton Cole, who was at his oafish worst. \u201cI just had to loan the club I play for \u00a312 so we had enough to pay our \u00a3135 subs for the rest of the season,\u201d says Mark Judd. \u201cLuckily, that hasn\u2019t been picked up by the FIFA Fair Play people. I\u2019m hoping they aren\u2019t following your MBM so keep it to yourselves.\u201d Now Olsson has drifted a shot just wide at Upton Park, Norwich still making all the running. \u201cI just \u2018tuned in\u2019 to the MBM and was skimming over what I\u2019d missed,\u201d says Jimmy Lacey. \u201cIn my haste I thought David Hopkins had referred to \u201csubbuteo favourite Paul Peschcisolido\u201d, which made me laugh and which also turned out to be the most entertaining thing that had happened in any of the games so far.\u201d A cross from the right finds Jay Rodriguez at the far post. For some reason, he tries a scissor kick instead of a header. He does not score. \u201cThe much maligned Aly Cissokho, nee Traore, was actually very accomplished against Arsenal,\u201d says Jerome Mallon. \u201cI was sat near the touchline left back area on Saturday and his performance almost shocked me as much as the first 20 minutes, bravo!\u201d Kevin Nolan is clear in the area, decides to take a touch or 17, gets the ball stuck under his feet and then sets Norwich on the counter-attack with a poor pass to Matt Taylor. Norwich attack and Adrian has to make a save from Hooper (I think). \u201cWhy is that we only hear about player value disparity when City play,\u201d says Joe Rega. \u201cSurely the Chelsea Cash on Pitch coefficient against WBA must be one of the greatest in the history of the English Oil Oligarchy League. Why no mention?\u201d This is developing into a tedious evening. It\u2019s being reported that Paul McShane has been taken to hospital with a suspected broken ankle. \u201cWBA vs CFC,\u201d says Pauline Shaw. \u201cYou were saying...?\u201d That\u2019s right, facts are offensive now. You guys. \u201cIs that treasured memory allowed to be only three days old?\u201d says Ian Copestake. \u201cNot actually Liverpool\u2019s Shanklyesque battering of Arsenal but Aly Cissokho crying during the minute\u2019s clap for Shankly\u2019s own Tony Hately. I know we Merseysiders are a sentimental lot but I have been carrying that image with me ever since and wish the boy nothing but the best for the rest of what started out to be a very difficult season for him.\u201d GOAL!!!!!!!!!!! West Brom 0-1 Chelsea (Ivanovic): Branislav Ivanovic belts Chelsea into the lead just before half-time. What a goal machine. He was unmarked at the far post at a corner and volleyed in from close range. Huzzah! They\u2019re off again at Upton Park... West Brom have been stubborn and hard to break down. Chelsea haven\u2019t had a shot on target yet. \u201cI dislike Ian Dowie immensely, for no other reason than the fact that I was something of a Competitive Dad and was playing Championship Manager with my two sons in the mid 90s,\u201d admits Brian Rafferty. \u201cI was Man Utd and made the mistake of popping to the shop when it was my eldest son\u2019s turn. I returned to find them sniggering and discovered that had spent all of my transfer money on Dowie. I went mental!\u201d I\u2019m sure you did! Kids, eh? Half-time: Hull 0-0 Southampton: We wouldn\u2019t have it any other way. There have been three goals in the top two divisions in England. Well played, everyone, way to keep us all entertained. The injury to Paul McShane means they\u2019re still playing at the KC Stadium. Half-time: West Ham 0-0 Norwich City: It\u2019s been as exciting as we all thought it would be. GOAL! Leyton Orient 1-2 Bristol City (Lisbie): Kevin Lisbie does what Kevin Lisbie does. Iain Dowie has just referred to something called a \u201cleg race\u201d. A new take on the old-fashioned foot race. It\u2019s all Chelsea at the moment. David Luiz rattles one just over. GOAL! Sheffield Wednesday 0-2 Wigan (Maynard): Waghorn\u2019s corner is bundled in by Maynard for his second of the evening. Chelsea have threatened for the first time, Eto\u2019o making a nuisance of himself on the right but eventually Billy Jones hacks behind after a scramble. GOAL! Watford 1-0 Birmingham (Deeney): Deeney dupes Birmingham with his own ineptitude. He takes a massive swing at the ball and makes contact with fresh air, but while Birmingham\u2019s defenders are doubled over laughing, he then batters a shot high into the net. You might have noticed I haven\u2019t said much about the match between West Brom and Chelsea. That\u2019s because there\u2019s not much to say. GOAL! Sheffield Wednesday 0-1 Wigan (Maynard): A cool finish from Nicky Maynard gives Wigan the lead. That\u2019s the night\u2019s first goal in the Championship. Southampton hit the bar! A dipper from Jay Rodriguez has Steve Harper beaten but it\u2019s not quite accurate enough for the first goal of the evening. Gary Hooper has just accidentally volleyed James Tomkins in the chest. However the West Ham defender is not Chico Flores, so he just gets on with the game. We\u2019ve still not had any goals in the Premier League. \u201cDefeats are best enjoyed through the outlet of abusing your own team/manager,\u201d says David Hopkins. \u201cI have fond memories of Phil Brown substituting fan\u2019s favourite Paul Peschcisolido rather than useless loanee Stern John, to be met by 30,000 voices informing him he didn\u2019t know what he was doing. Again, better than Socrates.\u201d Another chance for Norwich! They break from a corner, Hooper, Redmond and Snodgrass combining to set up Bradley Johnson, who is denied by a last-ditch tackle from James Tomkins. He looked certain to score. The camera cuts to Assem Allam at the KC Stadium. Weirdly he\u2019s not dressed as a tiger. \u201cLeeds 4- 3 Liverpool, Nov 2000 if I recall correctly,\u201d says Patrick Crumlish. \u201cIncredible match and four goals from Viduka. Also, we still beat them to a Champions League spot and won three trophies that year, so it didn\u2019t really cost us anything.\u201d How can you not enjoy a match that featured Christian Ziege scoring for Liverpool? \u201cEverton were hammered by Newcastle in the mid-90s at Goodison and Evertonians weren\u2019t too bothered, because We\u2019d love it, love it if they went on to win the Title,\u201d says Gary Naylor. \u201cHow did that turn out?\u201d I think they won, Gary. West Ham are living dangerously. Robert Snodgrass beats the offside trap, Redmond releasing him with a lovely chipped pass, but his shot is blocked by Adrian, who\u2019s saved West Ham again. The hosts have been poor. GOAL! Torquay 0-2 Northampton (Sinclair): Poor old Torquay. Shane Long has headed against the the post for Hull and George Boyd, just on as a substitute, saw his rebound pushed over by Boruc. Peep! They\u2019re underway in the 8pm match between West Brom and Chelsea. GOAL! Leyton Orient 0-2 Bristol City (Barnett): Probably West Ham\u2019s fault. GOAL! Torquay 0-1 Northampton (Sinclair): Northampton lead in the 12-pointer in League Two! Meanwhile Paul McShane is being taken off on a stretcher after that collision with Steve Harper. George Boyd comes on for him. An excellent move from Norwich almost brings them the first goal at Upton Park, Nathan Redmond twisting Guy Demel inside out and then crossing for Hooper, whose stooping header was tipped behind by Adrian. Rickie Lambert has had another chance for Southampton but couldn\u2019t take it. Paul McShane has injured himself trying to deny him. Actually, so has Steve Harper. The two collided. \u201cSimon McMahon needs to start living in the present,\u201d says David Hopkins. \u201crazil 82 were all well and good, but last night I got to see Derby beat QPR by a dodgy goal to nil, royally annoying Joey Barton and his amazing topknot hairdo in the process. Socrates? Schmocrates.\u201d This is the same Joey Barton who was taking sideswipes at Javier Pastore the other day. The man has not an ounce of self-awareness. GOAL! Leyton Orient 0-1 Bristol City (Baldock): Former West Ham legend Sam Baldock has given struggling Bristol City an early lead against high-flying Leyton Orient on his return to east London. What a chance for Rickie Lambert to give Southampton the lead! A cross from Adam Lallana was headed to the striker, who was around 12 yards from goal, and he took a neat touch to set himself before bending his shot inches past the post. He really should have scored. No one\u2019s scored yet or done anything. Bah. \u201cMaybe we could riff on defeats for your team that you strangely enjoyed?\u201d says Simon McMahon. \u201cYou\u2019d probably know a thing or two about that yourself..\u201d FA Cup final, 2006. Next. Peep! Who likes football? Then this is the place for you. \u201cJust watching a programme on Sky about the Brazil 82 side,\u201d says Simon McMahon, gently ushering the ladies to form an orderly queue. \u201cAs Buddy Holly said, oh boy! The fact that Scotland actually led them through a 20 yarder into the top corner by Dundee United legend Dave Narey remains one of my fondest football memories, as indeed does the hiding we eventually suffered, such was the beauty of the football.\u201d Were they as good as Sven\u2019s England? \u201cWasn\u2019t Werner Herzog made to eat his shoe?\u201d pedants Oliver Pattenden. \u201cI daresay you should start prepping that hat, werner herzog-style - surely wilshere\u2019s goal against norwich earlier this season was just a smidgen more exciting?\u201d says Rick Grant. Oh, that is obviously a great shout - but what makes the Hazard one so special is both the speed of his stabbed finish, which made Tim Krul look like a dweeb, and the sense that this is a player who is reaching a scary level. And here are the teams at The Hawthorns. Ramires replaces Frank Lampard in midfield for Chelsea, while Fernando Torres is fit enough for a place on the bench after returning from injury. West Brom: Foster; Reid, McAuley , Dawson, Ridgewell; Yacob; Amalfitano, Morrison, Brunt; Thievy, Berahino. Subs: Myhill, Mulumbu, Lugano, Dorrans, Gera, Anichebe, Vydra. Chelsea: Cech; Ivanovic, Cahill, David Luiz, Azpilicueta; Ramires, Matic; Willian, Oscar, Hazard; Eto\u2019o. Subs: Schwarzer, Cole, Mikel, Lampard, Schurrle, Salah, Torres. Referee: Anthony Taylor. As for Hull, Alex Bruce is in for the injured Liam Rosenior, while Calum Chambers steps in for Nathaniel Clyne in Southampton\u2019s one change. Hull: Harper; McShane, Bruce, Davies, Figueroa; Elmohamady, Huddlestone, Livermore, Meyler; Jelavic, Long. Subs: Jakupovic, Quinn, Koren, Brady, Boyd, Sagbo, Aluko. Southampton: Boruc; Chambers, Fonte, Yoshida, Shaw; Cork, Schneiderlin, S. Davis, Lallana, Rodriguez; Lambert. Subs: K. Davis, Clyne, Wanyama, Ward-Prowse, Guly, Hooiveld, Isgrove. Referee: Martin Atkinson. The teams are starting to roll in. West Ham are unchanged from the win over Aston Villa, while Robert Snodgrass replaces Anthony Pilkington for Norwich. West Ham: Adrian; Demel, Collins, Tomkins, McCartney; Noble, Taylor; Downing, Nolan, Jarvis; C Cole. Subs: Jaaskelainen, Reid, Armero, Collison, Diame, Borriello, Nocerino. Norwich: Ruddy; Martin, Yobo, Bassong, Olsson; Tettey, Johnson; Snodgrass, Fer, Redmond; Hooper. Subs: Bunn, Whittaker, van Wolfswinkel, Pilkington, Hoolahan, Elmander, Garrido. Referee: Michael Oliver. Oh God. It\u2019s happened. It\u2019s finally happened. Chelsea are top. More to the point, Jose Mourinho is top and no one will fancy chasing the ultimate frontrunner. It\u2019s a truly amazing achievement that he\u2019s still manfully maintaining the pretence that his primary target this season is to sneak into the top four. What a crafty, conniving, shameless genius. Don\u2019t believe a word of it, of course, he\u2019s just trying to pull the wool over your eyes. Over all of our eyeses, actually. And then, BAM. It\u2019s May, Chelsea have won the league by 26 points, John Terry\u2019s happy and Mourinho is even smugger than usual, all pleased with himself because he\u2019s spent the last nine months telling lies to a gullible Geoff Shreeves, which is just really mean, because Geoff thought they were friends. But forget about all Mourinho\u2019s woe-is-me at little-old-Chelsea evasion. They\u2019ve meant business for a while, first when they went back to basics after those defeats at Sunderland and Stoke in December and then when they developed into the smooth but scintillating counter-attacking force of nature that swept past Manchester City and Newcastle. With Eden Hazard at the wheel, the Chelsea bus simply drove through both. Who needs Juan Mata? Lots of people. I need Juan Mata. You need Juan Mata. But not Chelsea, not if they\u2019re going to be playing like this. If anyone scores a better team goal this season than Hazard\u2019s second against Newcastle, I\u2019ll buy a hat and then I\u2019ll eat it and then I\u2019ll go the nearest hospital. Chelsea will fancy a victory against West Brom tonight, although it has been pointed out that the Hawthorns has been a graveyard for their managers in the past two seasons, with Andre Villas-Boas and Roberto Di Matteo given the chop after defeats there. That\u2019s probably not going to happen to Mourinho, is it, not least because West Brom have not won since Pepe Mel\u2019s arrival. Their defeat to Crystal Palace on Saturday saw them drop into the bottom three, a situation that definitely isn\u2019t causing much mirth in some quarters, although they have managed stubborn 1-1 draws with Everton and Liverpool in their previous home matches. It\u2019s not a great time to be for West Brom \u2013 especially as they have to pretend they like poor, misunderstood, thoughtful, moral Nicolas Anelka \u2013 but at least they can take some comfort from how tight the bottom half of the table is. An unlikely scenario it may be, but a win could move them up to 13th. And if West Ham beat Norwich at Upton Park tonight, they could rocket up from 15th to 10th. They were 18th before they beat Aston Villa 2-0 on Saturday, Kevin Nolan continuing his recent renaissance with both goals. But Sam Knows, as they so often say in east London. Dead and buried a few weeks ago, now they\u2019ve even won a game without Andy Carroll. Crucially, they\u2019ve got their defenders back; the win over Villa featured their 12th clean sheet of the season. They\u2019re starting to breathe a little easier but they\u2019re not out of the woods yet. Far from it. Like Norwich, who come into this game boosted by holding Manchester City at Carrow Road, they\u2019re still only two points above the bottom three. It sure is a funny league. No one seems to be having much fun at Norwich but they can also go 10th with a win. Finally we\u2019ve got Hull v Southampton, who are currently the only team in mid-table. Hull are 11th. They go 10th if they win and their new strikers, Shane Long and Nikica Jelavic, are both scoring. Yet they\u2019re also only four points above struggling West Brom in 18th place. Confused? Good.
