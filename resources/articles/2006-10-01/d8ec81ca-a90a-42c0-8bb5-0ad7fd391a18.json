Last summer we put prices up [by up to \u00a310] to get them in line with everyone else's but we received a lot of phone calls, emails and letters from individual fans telling us they were being priced out, and we have also listened to the concerns of official and unofficial supporters' groups.\" With attendances having plummeted by almost 18%, Wigan's prices for future Category A games are also \"under review\" and expected to be fixed at a maximum of \u00a330. The club, who typically charge \u00a320-\u00a330 for Category B and C fixtures, have also launched a series of initiatives designed to attract supporters for particular games including \"bring a kid for a quid\" and \"bring a mate for a fiver\". Wigan, who drew a modest 16,235 for Saturday's 4-0 trouncing of Manchester City, are following the example of Blackburn Rovers, whose crowds have diminished by around 20% during the past four seasons but who saw their gate boosted by about 10,000 when they slashed prices to \u00a315 for Sunday's visit of Bolton. \"We've been telling Wigan that people, and particularly those with children, could no longer afford to watch them,\" added Mark Ashurst of the Latics Independent Supporters Association. \"Wigan deserve credit for listening but we feel there is a big, and increasing, distance between Premiership clubs and their fans these days, which is partly responsible for crowds going down.\" Attendances have also dropped at Bolton, Manchester City and Newcastle, declining by almost 12%, 6% and 4% respectively this season. \"The lazy thing for clubs to do is to blame falling attendances on unusual kick-off times but if there are a lot of empty seats, pricing has to be a big factor,\" said McCann. \"If grounds are full and rocking everyone enjoys the experience and the atmosphere definitely transmits itself to the pitch. Players don't like performing in front of empty seats.\" As Brenda Spencer, Wigan's chief executive, reflected: \"We realise we cannot just expect people to turn up. We are keen to try and attract long-term supporters who will keep coming back.\" Premiership prices \u00a366 Arsenal v Everton Cheapest tickets are \u00a332 on Saturday \u00a353 Newcastle v Charlton For a seat in the Platinum Club \u00a346 West Ham v Blackburn Category B game at Upton Park this Sunday \u00a339 Bolton v Manchester Utd Cheapest tickets are \u00a331 at the Reebok \u00a337 Portsmouth v Reading Price for all matches at Fratton Park \u00a335 Watford v Tottenham The Hornets have one price this weekend"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
