There is no plot. Instead, the original cartoons are dramatised as sketches, punctuated with songs on Peanuts themes - variations on 'Isn't it hard being a kid?' Schultz's wit doesn't lend itself to boom-boom stage laughs. Nor does the sardonic mood of the strip lend itself to show tunes and slapstick dance routines. Luckily, under the direction of Arthur Whitelaw who produced, co-wrote and directed the original Broadway version, the talented young cast throw themselves into the job with gleeful professionalism. Robin Armstrong thankfully doesn't aspire to be very canine as Snoopy, preferring the vulnerably human cool of the original cartoon. The rest of the cast stride gamely down the gangplank of lines that should never have left newsprint before diving into the frothy waters of yet another music-hall number. This is a valiant stab at the futile task of rendering Schultz's black-and-white ink drawings into all singin', all dancin' primary colours. Grown-up Charlie Brown fans will probably find it more in the spirit of Peanuts merchandise than in that of the original cartoons, but their children are likely to leave the theatre demanding a course of tap lessons."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
