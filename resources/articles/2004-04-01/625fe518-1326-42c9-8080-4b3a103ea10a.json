But Martin O'Neill's team will need to play much better at the El Madrigal stadium next week than they did on their own ground against a Villarreal side that showed more ambition and determination at Parkhead than Barcelona had in the previous round. The Spaniards took an early lead through Josico but Celtic equalised through Henrik Larsson on another night of unremitting drama. Roared on by a huge home crowd Celtic stormed the Villarreal area but failed to make an immediate breakthrough and promptly paid the price when Villarreal's first attack yielded the game's opening goal. It was a poor one for the Scots to concede as Roger Garc\u00eda flighted in a cross more it seemed in hope than expectation and the unmarked Josico rose to get the slightest of touches, leaving David Marshall helpless. It was the last thing Celtic needed after their adventurous start but it was a priceless away goal for Villarreal, whose confidence duly soared as first Jos\u00e9 Mari went close with a free header from a cross by Rodolfo Arruabarrena and then Sonny Anderson raced clear on to a through ball from Juan Riquelme but sent his shot wide. It took Celtic some considerable time to regain both their composure and the momentum - but at least now they were aware of the threat the Spaniards posed on the counter-attack. It was certainly an engrossing encounter and in another flurry of activity Stephen Pearson was booked for a foul on Josico, Stilian Petrov saw a fine effort touched on to the outside of the post by Jos\u00e9 Reina and Josico was shown a yellow card for exacting revenge of Pearson. It was proving to be a fraught evening for the home fans, who almost suffered further just before half-time when Jos\u00e9 Mari should really have done better than shoot over as he took a pass from Riquelme in his stride. The start of the second half was every bit as explosive as the first as the two teams launched themselves into the fray with renewed fervour. Initially, it was the Spaniards who looked more dangerous as first Sebastian Bettaglia saw a shot blocked by Bobo Balde, then Marshall did well to race out of his goal to deny Anderson. Scotland's champions-elect were again proving resilient in the face of an onslaught but in the 54th minute were denied their reward by an incident that will long rankle at Celtic Park. Larsson had raced forward to block Reina's attempted clearance and when the ball rebounded into the net the Swede turned away in jubilation - until he noticed the assistant referee's flag signalling handball against him. It looked to be a harsh decision and O'Neill certainly thought so as he prowled up and down the touchline in such a fury that eventually the referee had to have a quiet word. But there is nothing like perceived injustice to get Old Firm fans going and as the stadium rocked to one Celtic attack after another there was a certain inevitability about the equaliser. It duly came after 64 minutes and predictably fell to Larsson, who took full advantage of Reina's flap at a Didier Agathe cross to nod home. The Swede, having a rollercoaster night, then missed a fine opportunity after being picked out by Pearson before, after 82 minutes, Alan Thompson was booked for a foul on Jos\u00e9 Mari and will now miss the second leg through suspension."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
