In the US, the results have included onstage duets with Bruce Springsteen and the inclusion of I'm Wrong About Everything on the US version of the High Fidelity soundtrack. But in Britain even the presence of his sister, Generation Game hostess Melanie Stace, cannot sell out his first British show in a decade with a band - here The Radical Gentleman. Harding is a jocose stage figure, drinking pints of beer, wearing a shirt so gaudy Marti Pellow would have demurred, and repeatedly charging into the crowd. When he introduces I'm Wrong About Everything with a tambourine perched precariously on his head it seems strangely logical. Yet, while joviality is infinitely preferable to sullenness, it does vitiate his emotional resonance or the acerbic Warren Zevon-esque lyric to The Devil Inside Me, in which he claims, possibly untruthfully, to have assassinated John F Kennedy and polluted the oceans. Perhaps Harding is simply too eclectic. He sings a couple of old English folk songs accompanied only by his guitar; for the encore he covers Matching Mole and updates Waterloo Sunset; and he is, by turns, country, powerpop and, inevitably, Loudon Wainwright III on Goth Girl, with its lines about her boyfriend looking like Pete Murphy and not being able to afford to take her to see Nine Inch Nails. Somewhere the essence of John Wesley Harding is lost. Still, there are moments to savour, invariably taken from the new album. Our Lady of the Highways (a duet with Steve Earle on record, but with bassist Chris Von Sneidern on stage) is so beautiful Willie Nelson could cover it. The comforting Bad Dream Baby (with Von Sneidern covering for the record's Jimmie Dale Gilmore) is perfect, superior-period REM powerpop, while People Love to Watch You Die has the widescreen chorus the remainder of Harding's songs aspire to. He delivers it with his right foot astride his amp, as if he were James's Tim Booth. More where that comes from and things might just start to turn around."}, "isHosted": false}}}
