The Belgium international moved to Stamford Bridge last summer from Marseille for \u00a333m after rejecting offers from West Ham and Crystal Palace but only made his full Premier League debut in Monday night\u2019s victory over Watford, having been restricted to substitute appearances by the manager, Antonio Conte. Another goal in the 4-3 victory after Batshuayi\u2019s heroics in sealing the title for Chelsea against West Brom at the Hawthorns on Friday meant the 23-year-old has now scored three times in just 212 minutes of action, although he remains philosophical over his lack opportunities. \u201cThere were a lot of frustrations, but this is a big club, with a lot of good players,\u201d said Batshuayi. \u201cI need to understand it a bit too. I\u2019m a bit younger than some of the other guys. I can only keep on working hard. We have a very good squad, with lots of good players. Lovely and humble lads too. Chelsea feels like a big family. When you can work in those conditions, day in, day out. That\u2019s magnificent. Of course there were frustrations because I didn\u2019t play a lot. \u201cSo enjoying myself with the teammates wasn\u2019t always that simple. But I also understood that I had some to work to do. But I\u2019m happy. My team-mates have always been supporting me. They encouraged my to grab my chance and advised me not to let my head down. They are happy for me now. That\u2019s very positive.\u201d While uncertainty remains over the future of Diego Costa this summer, Batshuayi\u2019s status as part of Conte\u2019s squad next season is also in doubt given his lack of action this season. But the player who scored 17 goals in Ligue 1 last season showed his determination to succeed by turning up at Chelsea\u2019s training ground the day after his winning goal against West Brom for an unscheduled gym session. \u201cFriday was a magical moment. Like in a dream,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t lose my head either. I kept on working. Because I knew there were some important games to come. I knew I could get my chance against Watford, so from Saturday morning I started focusing on this game. I wanted to perform well. \u201cI wanted to make the fans and the manager proud of me. I didn\u2019t give up and today the team and I have been rewarded. That\u2019s good for everybody.\u201d Chelsea had offers to take Batshuayi on loan in January but the striker, who made his breakthrough at Standard Li\u00e8ge in his homeland, was adamant he wanted to fight for his place. \u201cOf course this is a lesson for me. A period that\u2019s been very hard for me, but I\u2019ve also learned a lot,\u201d said Batshuayi. \u201cI\u2019ve made a lot of progress. As a man, mentally, but also physically. And tactically too. That\u2019s a given with a manager like Antonio Conte. He likes you to work, work, work. Every day.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
