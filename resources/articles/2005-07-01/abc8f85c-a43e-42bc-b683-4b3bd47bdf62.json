It wasn't an easy film to finance, and over the years we (the producer, Graham Broadbent, and I) tried everything. It could be a period movie! It could be a musical! We could do it with performing mice! The one thing we didn't think of was asking Danny Boyle - celebrated for making films about zombies and junkies - to direct it. Mind you, by that stage I would quite happily have rewritten it for zombie schoolchildren and junkie saints. Danny's great gift is to give the people around him the space and the motivation to stretch themselves. If he asks you to do something, you think - well, if Danny says I can do it, then I probably can, because he's right about everything else. When he suggested that I write Millions as a novel, it was a magical moment for me. I'd always wanted to write a children's book. The moment he said it, I thought, of course! Sometimes you just need the right nudge from the right person. I'd worked on Millions for so long by then that it felt like an illness. Danny's suggestion was a miracle cure. It turned years of frustration and rejection - of sitting in meetings being asked \"yes, but where's the relevance?\" - into a huge advantage. Because I'd lived with the story so long, I was really sure of it. Writing the book, I felt as fearless as a 10-year-old. It was like those fantasies you have of being a child again but with a grown-up brain. I don't think any writer has ever been as lucky as I was then. By the time I was finishing the book, we were already shooting. If I was having a bad day, I could wander down to the set and pick up some new ideas. I once found Alex and Lewis (the two leads) playing Jenga with piles of fake money. I put it straight into the book. Any time I was stuck, I could wander around my own creation. Imagine if, on a slow morning, Tolkien had been able to stroll down to Mordor and talk it over with a bunch of affable Orcs. More important, working on the film forced me to look modern childhood in the eye. Anyone who writes about children is bound to draw on their own childhood. But the auditions for Millions made me see that childhood is different now. We asked each of the hundreds of hopefuls what they would do if they found \u00a3200,000. If you'd asked me at their age I would have asked for a boat or a helicopter or some other ticket to adventure. Almost uniformly they asked for things with bar codes and brand names. If you'd compiled a hundred answers to that question 20 years ago, you might have got a catalogue of sweets and fantasies. If we cut those audition tapes together, we'd have a shopping list. The odd thing is that even though I'd worked on the idea for such a long time, it was only then that I found out why it exerted such a pull on me. Of course, stories about people who find bags of money are not new. Danny had already done one (Shallow Grave). So had Chaucer (The Pardoner's Tale). But I don't think anyone's done it with children before. If Millions works, it works because it's timely. When I was first working on it, I thought the comedy would come from the fact that children don't really understand money. I came to see that the real comedy lay in the fact that they understand it so well. The reason why no one has done this story with children before is that children have never been so caught up in the business of getting and spending before. If Millions has any power, it comes from the fact that it celebrates both the heedless generosity and the heedless greed of modern children. In the shadow of the G8 summit, that's a thought that seems to have . . . well, relevance. \u00b7 Millions (published by Macmillan) won the CILIP Carnegie medal, 2004."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
