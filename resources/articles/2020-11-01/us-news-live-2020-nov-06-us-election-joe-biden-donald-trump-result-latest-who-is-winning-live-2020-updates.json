You\u2019re going to be the next president of the United States.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports from Philadelphia: The city erupted shortly after the presidential race was called for Joe Biden here Saturday morning. People driving down Broad Street, a main avenue that runs through the heart of the city, were honking, cheering, and applauding loudly. One worker cleaning the streets said it felt like the Eagles, Philadelphia\u2019s football team, won the Super Bowl. Now I\u2019m at the Pennsylvania convention center, which is where votes are being counted and has become the epicenter of protests and celebrations in recent days. There were loud cheers of \u201clock him up\u201d and \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d. Donna Widmann, a teacher here who helped get her students and their families registered, said she\u2019s hasn\u2019t been able to stop crying. \u201cSo much emotion has happened in the past four years, man, and it just feels really good,\u201d Widmann said. \u201cI can\u2019t stop crying.\u201d Hillary Clinton, who lost the 2016 presidential election to Donald Trump, celebrated Joe Biden and Kamala Harris\u2019 victory. \u201cThe voters have spoken, and they have chosen @JoeBiden and @KamalaHarris to be our next president and vice president,\u201d Clinton said in a tweet. \u201cIt\u2019s a history-making ticket, a repudiation of Trump, and a new page for America. Thank you to everyone who helped make this happen. Onward, together.\u201d Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have both updated their Twitter bios to reflect their victory in the US presidential election. Joe Biden has already won the presidential election, and the president-elect is now adding to his electoral college vote count. The AP has just announced Biden also won Nevada and its six electoral votes, bringing the Democrat\u2019s electoral vote count to 290. If Biden maintains his lead in Georgia, his final electoral vote count will be 306, well above the 270 needed to win the White House. That also means Biden\u2019s electoral vote count will be identical to the electoral votes that Donald Trump won in 2016. Trump has repeatedly characterized his 2016 electoral college victory as a \u201clandslide\u201d. Residents of Washington, DC, which leans heavily Democratic, took to the streets to celebrate after Joe Biden was declared the winner of the presidential election. Foreign leaders have already started offering their congratulations to Joe Biden and Kamala Harris after they were declared the winners of the presidential election. From the Canadian prime minister, Justin Trudeau: The country\u2019s new vice-president-elect, Kamala Harris, sent a tweet celebrating her and Joe Biden\u2019s win as a victory for the conscience of the nation. \u201cThis election is about so much more than @JoeBiden or me,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt\u2019s about the soul of America and our willingness to fight for it. We have a lot of work ahead of us. Let\u2019s get started.\u201d President-elect Joe Biden has released a statement, thanking the American people for their support. \u201cI am honored and humbled by the trust the American people have placed in me and in Vice-President-elect Harris,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIn the face of unprecedented obstacles, a record number of Americans voted. Proving once again, that democracy beats deep in the heart of America.\u201d Echoing the themes of his campaign, Biden called on Americans to unite in this time of crisis. \u201cWith the campaign over, it\u2019s time to put the anger and the harsh rhetoric behind us and come together as a nation,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for America to unite. And to heal. \u201cWe are the United States of America. And there\u2019s nothing we can\u2019t do, if we do it together.\u201d Donald Trump is showing no signs of conceding, after Joe Biden was declared the winner of the US presidential election. \u201cWe all know why Joe Biden is rushing to falsely pose as the winner, and why his media allies are trying so hard to help him: they don\u2019t want the truth to be exposed. The simple fact is this election is far from over,\u201d Trump said. The simply fact is that this election is over. The final votes will continue to be counted in dozens of states, but there is no way for Trump to come back in the presidential race at this point. \u201cBeginning Monday, our campaign will start prosecuting our case in court to ensure election laws are fully upheld and the rightful winner is seated,\u201d Trump said. The president\u2019s reelection campaign has filed lawsuits in multiple battleground states this week, but several of them have already been dismissed, and Biden\u2019s team has dismissed them as \u201cmeritless.\u201d It\u2019s also worth noting that Trump does not have to concede, although it is considered a hallmark of the peaceful transfer of power. The fact of the matter is, Biden has the electoral votes to win the White House, and he will be sworn in as president in January. Joe Biden has been elected the 46th president of the United States, denying Donald Trump a second term after a deeply divisive presidency defined by a once-in-a-century pandemic, economic turmoil and social unrest. Biden won the presidency by clinching Pennsylvania and its 20 electoral votes on Saturday morning, after days of counting votes and record turnout across the country. The win in Pennsylvania took Biden\u2019s electoral college vote to 284, surpassing the 270 needed to win the White House. The American people have replaced a real estate developer and reality TV star who had no political experience with a veteran of Washington who has spent more than 50 years in public life and twice ran unsuccessfully for president. With turnout projected to reach its highest point in a century, a fearful and anxious nation elected a candidate who promised to govern not as a Democrat but as an \u201cAmerican president\u201d and vowed to be a unifying force after four years of upheaval. The result also marked the historic rise of Kamala Harris, who will be the first woman and the first woman of color to serve as vice-president in American history. The homepage of the conservative-leaning website Drudge Report, which has moved away from Donald Trump in recent months, currently has a picture of the president with a caption taken from The Apprentice: \u201cYou\u2019re fired.\u201d With Joe Biden\u2019s victory, Kamala Harris will be the first woman, the first African American and the first Asian American to become vice president. Harris is the fourth woman to be on a major party\u2019s presidential ticket -- after Geraldine Ferraro in 1984, Sarah Palin in 2008 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. Harris is the first woman to be on a successful ticket. She will be sworn in as vice president in January. The networks have also declared Joe Biden to be the winner of the US presidential election. The call came after a new batch of ballots came in from Pennsylvania, pushing Biden\u2019s lead in the state over 30,000 votes. Some outlets, including CNN, have not yet called Arizona, so they currently show Biden\u2019s electoral college vote count as 273. But with or without Arizona, Biden has surpassed the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Joe Biden has won the presidency by clinching Pennsylvania and its 20 electoral votes, the AP has just announced. Biden\u2019s electoral vote count now stands at 284, surpassing the 270 needed to win the White House. Donald Trump has been defeated, and Biden will become the 46th president of the United States in January. Joe Biden\u2019s lead in Arizona has narrowed, after the latest update from Maricopa county, the most populous county in the state. As of now, Biden\u2019s lead in the battleground state stands at 20,573 votes, or 0.6% of the total vote, which is down from 29,861 votes earlier today. As a reminder, the AP has already declared Biden to be the winner of Arizona, and the Guardian follows the AP\u2019s calls. However, a number of other outlets have not yet called the state, and election analyst Nate Cohn said the latest batch of ballots would likely prevent a call for now. Some of us might have thought Donald Trump meant to say that his campaign was holding a press conference at the Four Seasons hotel in Philadelphia. But the Four Seasons would like to make very clear that that is not the case. \u201cTo clarify, President Trump\u2019s press conference will NOT be held at Four Seasons Hotel Philadelphia,\u201d the hotel said in a tweet. \u201cIt will be held at Four Seasons Total Landscaping\u2014 no relation with the hotel.\u201d Meanwhile, the actual site of the Philadelphia press conference appears to be next to an adult bookstore. It\u2019s unclear why the Trump campaign is holding a press conference at Four Seasons Total Landscaping in Philadelphia today, as the president announced this morning. A Washington Post reporter could not reach anyone at the company for comment, but she did note that the Internet has started doing what it does best: trolling through online reviews. Here is Donald Trump again, falsely claiming he won the election, when he is actually on the road to defeat. \u201cI WON THIS ELECTION, BY A LOT!\u201d Trump said in a new tweet. In reality, Joe Biden is ahead in Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania, and the Democratic nominee could soon be declared the next president of the United States. The president does not seem to be taking his potential defeat very well, but he may have found a way to cope for the time being. According to a White House pool report, Trump has just arrived at his golf club in Sterling, Virginia. Donald Trump\u2019s team has alleged fraud in various battleground states, without producing any evidence to back up those claims. Election officials have consistently defended the integrity of their vote counts, and one official seems to be a bit fed up with the baseless accusations. Katie Hobbs, Arizona\u2019s secretary of state, said in a tweet, \u201cMy office has been putting out information for months about how election processes work in the state &amp; all we do to ensure security &amp; fairness. If you haven\u2019t been paying attention, that\u2019s on you, but don\u2019t show up when you don\u2019t like the result &amp; scream fraud w/no evidence.\u201d Hobbs\u2019 comments come as some of the president\u2019s allies have flocked to vote-counting sites in Arizona to protest the vote count. Some of the protesters have been seen carrying firearms. This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Martin Belam, and I\u2019m working on this beautiful Saturday here because we somehow still don\u2019t have an official winner in the US presidential election. I am as flummoxed as anyone. But Joe Biden holds leads in Nevada and Pennsylvania, so additional updates from those states today could help him reach the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. Stay tuned. Twitter has again masked some of Donald Trump\u2019s recent tweets as being misleading. Calvin Woodward has undertaken the task of factchecking president Donald Trump\u2019s baseless claims about the election over the last few days. It\u2019s nearly a long read. Here are some of the bullet points. TRUMP: \u201cWe\u2019re hearing stories that are horror stories ... We think there is going to be a lot of litigation because we have so much evidence and so much proof.\u201d Trump produced no evidence. TRUMP: \u201cIn Pennsylvania, partisan Democrats have allowed ballots in the state to be received three days after the election and we think much more than that.\u201d It was the state supreme court. TRUMP: \u201cOur campaign has been denied access to observe any counting in Detroit.\u201d That\u2019s false. TRUMP: \u201cThe election apparatus in Georgia is run by Democrats.\u201d The elections is overseen by Republican secretary of state Brad Raffensperger. TRUMP: \u201cIf you count the legal votes, I easily win.\u201d This is baseless. TRUMP: \u201cANY VOTE THAT CAME IN AFTER ELECTION DAY WILL NOT BE COUNTED!\u201d Not true. There\u2019s plenty more where that all came from: AP Fact check \u2013 Trump\u2019s errant assault on election integrity And that is it from me today, thanks for sticking with us \u2013 Joan E Greve will be here shortly to bring you the rest of the day. I\u2019ll see you all here tomorrow \u2026 It might seem like the election is going on forever, but there is a deadline. In fact, there are a few. 8 December is the deadline for states to resolve any disputes over the selection of their electors of the electoral college. Then on 14 December the electors meet in their respective state capitals to formally vote for the president and vice-president. The Senate counts those votes on 6 January, and then the inauguration takes place on 20 January. If you missed it yesterday, here\u2019s an interesting look from Jeffrey Crouch at the Hill on the curious question of whether Donald Trump is able to pre-emptively pardon himself before he left office. Crouch looks at it like this: Article II of the Constitution contains broad, virtually unlimited clemency language that allows the president to forgive any federal crime. However, the Constitution is silent on the self-pardon question, and there is no example of an American president ever following through on a self-pardon attempt. The case for a self-pardon being constitutionally allowed rests heavily on the principle that the Constitution does not forbid the practice, therefore it should be permissible. Crouch cautions that this may have consequences though: A Supreme Court case suggests that such a move is akin to admitting guilt. In other words, a self-pardon would ultimately be self-defeating because it would supply the impetus needed by Congress to deploy the ultimate constitutional remedy for abuses of power: impeachment. He sets up another possibility though \u2013 using the 25th amendment Trump would temporarily step down from the presidency at some point before the official end of his term, leaving Pence to take over as acting chief executive. Acting President Pence would pardon Trump, who could then become president again or resign from office. Read more here: The Hill \u2013 Like it or not, a Trump self-pardon may be coming soon Donald Trump has announced there will be a press conference in Philadelphia at 11.30am \u2013 that\u2019s 4.30pm if, like me, you are in London. Brian Stelter, CNN\u2019s chief media correspondent, speaking for a lot of us here, I think. If you\u2019ve been enjoying Georgia taking days to count an election, then I have good news. They\u2019ll be doing it again in January, because there are going to be two pivotal Senate run-off races, which could still flip the Senate away from the Republicans. In fairness that count should go a bit faster. Republican David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff will face off in a 5 January runoff for Perdue\u2019s seat. Libertarian candidate Shane Hazel was able to get enough votes so that neither Perdue nor Ossoff was able to clear the 50% threshold needed for an outright win. It became clear earlier this week that Democrat Raphael Warnock and Republican Kelly Loeffler are headed for a runoff on the same day for Georgia\u2019s other Senate seat. Nationally, Democrats and Republicans can each already count on 48 seats in the Senate. Republicans lead uncalled races in Alaska and North Carolina, so the ultimate balance is likely to come down to what happens in the Georgia runoffs. If Democrats win the Georgia seats, it would leave the Senate split 50-50, with the vice-president serving as a tie-breaker. If Joe Biden is in the White House, that would mean a vice-president Kamala Harris would be the deciding vote in the Senate. If Donald Trump wins a second term, then it would be Mike Pence, the current vice-president. Democrats had hoped to wrench control of the Senate from Mitch McConnell, the Republican majority leader, and raised millions of dollars to fight the GOP candidates in states such as Maine, Kansas, Iowa and South Carolina. But larger-than-expected Republican turnout prevented a \u201cblue wave.\u201d There\u2019s more here: Georgia becomes center of battle for Senate as races head to runoff elections President Donald Trump appears to be on the move and about to go \u2026 somewhere? Linda Feldmann, who is on press pool duty today has this update: Pool has been Covid-tested and is now waiting in motorcade on WH south driveway, destination unannounced. The weather is spectacular \u2013 57 degrees, will hit 70s by early afternoon, not a cloud in the sky. The US confirmed 126,480 new coronavirus cases on Friday, a record number for a third day in a row. At the White House, chief of staff Mark Meadows was reported to have tested positive for Covid-19. On Saturday morning, Johns Hopkins University in Maryland put the total US coronavirus caseload at 9,731,198, with 235,925 deaths. States recording record daily highs on Friday included Illinois, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Minnesota and Utah. News of Meadows\u2019 test came days after he appeared with Donald Trump at a White House event at which numerous people did not wear masks. The president himself was previously treated for Covid-19, spending three days in hospital, after attending a White House event at which Covid mitigation measures were not enforced. Members of Trump\u2019s family, senior aides and leading Republicans have all contracted the virus after attending events in Washington and on the campaign trail. On Friday, Bloomberg News said numerous Trump campaign aides had also tested positive. On Friday, across the US, states posted record numbers. In Illinois, faced with 20,000 new cases in two days, JB Pritzker, the governor, said a stay-at-home order was possible if the spread was not slowed \u2013 just before his office announced that he was self-isolating after being exposed to the virus for a third time. Read more of Martin Pengelly\u2019s report here: US confirms over 126,000 Covid cases on Friday, third daily record in a row You may recall that in 2016 there was a strand of opinion that voting for for Green party nominee Jill Stein in crucial states had effectively handed the keys to the White House to Donald Trump. Green party supporters were hounded over the fact that in Michigan, Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by about 10,000 votes while Stein got in the 50,000s. And in Wisconsin, Trump\u2019s margin over Clinton was in the order of 22,000, while Stein garnered 31,000 odd votes. There\u2019s a chance that the reverse has happened this year, report Newsweek, highlighting that the Libertarian party presidential candidate, Jo Jorgensen, may have scuppered Trump\u2019s chances. Meghan Roos writes: As election officials continued counting ballots cast during the 2020 presidential election, some Republican strategists are questioning whether votes for third-party candidates could have closed the gap between President Donald Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in key battleground states. \u201cLibertarian voters could have swung the electoral college by at least 22 votes by supporting Trump in battleground states Wisconsin, Michigan and Nevada,\u201d political strategist Ryan Cassin told Fox News. \u201cBy throwing away their votes, they\u2019ve likely become spoilers for the Trump reelection effort.\u201d Votes cast for Jorgensen in Georgia and Pennsylvania also exceeded the margins between Biden and Trump on Friday night, and her vote tally in Arizona was also within striking distance. Read more here: Newsweek \u2013 Libertarian party could play a big role in Trump\u2019s impending defeat, but party chair says they\u2019re not to blame There\u2019s little doubt now that Joe Biden will win the popular vote, and ultimately should win enough votes in the Electoral College to propel him into the White House in January. It\u2019s just taking a while to get there. Keven Freking at the Associated Press is one of those who is taking the slowness of the US count as being \u2018mostly a good thing\u2019. He writes that while it is fueling a lot of criticism, it is a reflection of two laudable things: greater voter enthusiasm, and the steps that states took to protect their residents from Covid. On turnout, he says: Even though the count is not yet complete, President Donald Trump has easily surpassed the number of votes he got four years ago. Joe Biden has gained some 73.9 million votes, versus the 65.9 that Hillary Clinton got. All in all, some 15 million more voters participated in this year\u2019s presidential election than in 2016. On the way pandemic preparation has affected that turn-out, he notes: Minnesota, North Carolina and Nevada extended the deadlines for when ballots could be received. Nebraska and Iowa joined the ranks of states that send an absentee ballot application to every registered voter. New Jersey and California mailed ballots to every registered voter, whether they requested it or not. Millions of voters took states up on the offer and chose to vote by mail rather than in person on election day. And then there\u2019s this common refrain. The slowness of the count in some states is not through incompetence on the part of the people running the election, or counting the ballots, but because of deliberate decisions made in advance of the election. In Florida, clerks can start counting ballots 22 days before an election. In North Carolina, beginning five weeks before the election, county boards insert approved ballots into a voting machine, allowing for a prompt tabulation on Election Day. But other states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, all with Republican-led legislatures and all of them swing states, were made to wait so there would be no counting of mail-in ballots prior to Election Day. Michigan did eventually allow election officials to process some ballots one day earlier, but the counting of the ballot still had to wait until 3 November A little more on Trump\u2019s Twitter tirade here from the Washington Post\u2019s Aaron Blake, that not only is the president wrong, but he\u2019s also misunderstood the numbers. The Post reported on Thursday that Pennsylvania\u2019s count does not yet include any ballots that arrived after election day. \u201cTo the extent this is Trump\u2019s fixation, he\u2019s wasting his time.\u201d Blake observed on Twitter. A reminder that Joe Biden has a slim lead in Georgia, which is heading for a recount. However his lead of 7,248 is probably too big for Republicans to hope to overturn with that process. SoS in that tweet is Georgia\u2019s secretary of state \u2013 Republican Brad Raffensperger. The state of Nevada has probably caused more people to post GIFs of sloths to social media in the last week than anything else in history. Here\u2019s an update on the count there, which is worth 6 electoral college votes, from NBC\u2019s Jo Ling Kent. She told the network: There are 124,000 votes left to count statewide. Here in Clark County, the majority of the count is right here, it\u2019s 54,000 ballots that are left. The registrar tells me that he hopes to finish that count by Sunday. Then after that, they\u2019re going to do 60,000 provisional ballot counting, and that\u2019s going to include same day registration. As for the speed of the count, I know a lot of people have been criticising Nevada. I\u2019ve been pressing the registrar here in Clark County about that and he said there\u2019s no way to speed this process up. They have to be able to use their machines to scan, and then also they have the element of human review. They say they\u2019re going to release two more tranches of votes today. She suggested a final official result might not be signed off until 16 November, although that wouldn\u2019t prevent the state being called for Biden or Trump before then if they have amassed a lead that can\u2019t be surpassed. Joe Biden currently leads by 22,657 votes. The president of the United States has just now again baselessly asserted on Twitter that \u201cTens of thousands of votes were illegally received after 8 P.M. on Tuesday, Election Day, totally and easily changing the results in Pennsylvania and certain other razor thin states.\u201d It is boring writing it, you may be bored reading it, but I cannot stress enough that this is simply not true. Mail-in and absentee votes that arrive after the end of polling on election day have been valid, legal and counted in various states for decades. They include ballots arriving from military posted overseas. That is an entirely normal part of the American democratic process. In fact, to be clear, all of these states, some of which are Republican, allow mail-in ballots which are postmarked on 3 November or before to arrive after 8pm on election day and be counted. These are their deadlines. Texas (4 November) Virginia (Noon on 6 November) Kansas (6 November) Kentucky (6 November) Massachusetts (6 November) Pennsylvania (6 November - subject to legal challenge) Iowa (9 November) North Dakota (9 November) West Virginia (9 November) Minnesota (10 November - subject to legal challenge) Mississippi (10 November) Nevada (10 November) New Jersey (10 November) New York (10 November) North Carolina (12 November) Alaska (by 13 November) District of Columbia (13 November) Maryland (13 November) Ohio (13 November, result not announced til 28 November) Illinois (17 November) Utah (17 November) California (20 November) Washington (23 November) David Daley, the author of Unrigged: How Americans Are Battling Back to Save Democracy, writes for us today about the democratic deficit that seems inherent in the US election system: The good news is that Donald Trump appears to be on the cusp of being voted out of the White House. The bad news is that Trump was not a unique, aberrant threat to American democracy; it was already broken so deeply and in so many ways that no single election can possibly repair the damage. Even with a Biden administration, the worsening structural inequities embedded in the nation for centuries \u2013 and cynically exploited by Republicans to govern with narrow minority support \u2013 will still be with us. They are embodied in institutions such as the electoral college, which elected Trump in 2016 despite his losing the popular vote by almost 3 million votes. In fact, including Biden, the Democratic candidate for president has won the popular vote in seven of the last eight elections. But in part because of the electoral college\u2019s rural bias (a vote cast for president in Wyoming counts nearly four times as much as a vote cast in California), and in part because the college heightens the importance of a handful of largely white, midwestern battleground states, Republicans have won the White House with fewer votes twice since 2000. Representational fairness is even more dire in the US Senate, which gives disproportionate power to older, whiter, more rural and more conservative interests. Right now, states representing just 17% of the nation\u2019s population could elect a majority of senators. By 2040, the 15 most populous states will be home to 67% of Americans yet represented by just 30% of the Senate. Add up the actual votes received in the winning election of every sitting US senator, and Republicans haven\u2019t won a senate majority since the mid-1990s. Yet they\u2019ve controlled the Senate for 10 of the last 20 years, and used that advantage to shape the ideological balance on the federal courts. Read more here: David Daley \u2013 Getting rid of Trump won\u2019t be enough to fix America\u2019s broken democracy Kyle Cheney has a (slight) update on Politico about foreign interference in mail-in ballots during the election \u2013 and it\u2019s a continued \u201cnothing to see here\u201d from the US intel community, despite Trump campaign claims. Donald Trump\u2019s all-caps warning in June \u2013 that foreign countries would surely print \u201cmillions of mail-in ballots\u201d to upend the US election \u2013 appears to have amounted to nothing. Trump made the claim all summer and fall, but he hasn\u2019t raised the matter in recent days, even as he fights for his political life. And intelligence officials, who for months described no evidence that such a plot was afoot, reaffirmed Friday that their earlier judgment stands. \u201cOur assessments have not changed,\u201d said Dean Boyd, a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. \u201cWe have nothing new to add to our previous statements,\u201d FBI spokesperson Carol Cratty said. Trump has bristled publicly at intelligence leaders, including FBI director Christopher Wray, for emphasizing the extreme unlikelihood that coordinated voter fraud would play a role in the 2020 presidential election. Nevertheless, Trump has made sweeping, unsubstantiated allegations of fraud as he tries to keep his presidential bid alive. Read it here: Politico \u2013 Intel agencies still see no evidence of foreign attack on mail ballots I mentioned earlier that Fiji\u2019s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, looks to have become the first world leader to congratulate on Joe Biden on a victory that remains unconfirmed. A former prime minister, in the shape of Denmark\u2019s Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, had some advice for Biden\u2019s opponent overnight. I\u2019m sure it will go down well in the White House. Richard Luscombe reports for us today on the early signs of what happens next in the Republican party on the assumption that Donald Trump is going to be a one-term president. For four years he commanded their unflinching loyalty. They protected him from impeachment, tacitly approved as children at the border were prised from their parents and placed in cages, and looked the other way as peacefully protesting Americans were gassed for a photo opportunity. Now, in the death throes of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, Republicans who once stood shoulder to shoulder with the man who reshaped their political party to his will are scrambling to distance themselves from his unfounded claims that the election is being stolen from him. \u201cOutrageous, uncalled for and a terrible mistake,\u201d the Maryland governor, Larry Hogan, said of Trump\u2019s erratic pursuit of his false allegations; \u201cvery disturbing,\u201d according to the Pennsylvania senator Pat Toomey; and \u201creckless\u201d in the words of the former presidential candidate Mitt Romney. This breaking of ranks by growing numbers of senators, congressmen, governors and other elected officials \u2013 coming only after Trump\u2019s cause appeared lost \u2013 heralds a looming battle for the future direction of the Republican party with its figurehead gone from the stage. Those now openly critical after years of silence must weigh up the consequences of speaking out while there remain loyalists inside the party determined to carry the banner of Trumpism into the 2024 election and beyond. That faction includes Republican senators such as Ted Cruz and Tom Cotton, and the Florida governor, Ron DeSantis, a staunch Trump ally who has urged the president to \u201cfight on, exhaust all options\u201d in his futile effort to prove widespread election fraud. \u201cTrumpism will remain because he is such a wildly popular figure among their base. But, you know, it\u2019s always been pragmatic for many Republicans,\u201d said Jason Stanley, professor of philosophy at Yale University and author of the bestseller How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them. \u201cThere\u2019s some portion of the Republican party supporting him mainly because he\u2019s Trump, and he\u2019s owning the libs and saying racist things. And then another group is supporting him because he\u2019s pushing through the hardest-right policies.\u201d Read more of Richard Luscombe\u2019s report here: After Trump \u2013 first shots fired in battle for Republican party\u2019s future We should not lose focus on the fact that the election is taking place against the backdrop of a worsening pandemic in the US. According to Johns Hopkins University figures, yesterday the US recorded another new daily record for coronavirus cases \u2013 126,480. There were 1,146 deaths. The US has had four straight days of more than 1,000 coronavirus deaths this week. The last time there was such a streak was in August. The New York Times reports that at least 17 states reported single-day records for new cases on Friday. And four states reported record deaths: Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota and Utah. In 27 states, there have been more cases announced in the past week than in any other seven-day stretch since the pandemic began. Jaline Gerardin, an epidemiologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago told the Washington Post: \u201cIt is community spread everywhere.\u201d The main problem, she said, was allowing the virus to simmer at fairly high levels throughout the summer, particularly among young people who congregated in bars and restaurants against expert advice. \u201cI think it ended up busting out of their own age group,\u201d she said. \u201cIt spread out from there, and what we\u2019re seeing now is it\u2019s in every age group ... It\u2019s just everywhere.\u201d Astead W Herndon and Annie Karni have written the New York Times\u2019s On Politics newsletter today, and this bit caught my eye: There was one subset of the political world that felt vindicated by the nail-biter presidential race: Democrats who worked for Hillary Clinton. The closeness of the Biden-Trump race suggests that the 2016 election outcome may have been less about Clinton\u2019s political weaknesses than it was about Trump\u2019s political strengths. In some of the states that Biden managed to flip, like Wisconsin, his victory was by a slim margin of about 20,000 votes. Four years ago, Clinton lost the state by about 22,000. A potential victory with more than 300 electoral votes would look like a blowout for Biden, but it would also mask the fact that in some of the most critical states, the race was still only won by a hair. Here\u2019s another question that is being asked a lot. Why are the media reporting different US election results? We\u2019ve got 264-214 up the top of the blog, but you may be seeing 253-214 on the New York Times, CNN, BBC and elsewhere. The answer is basically: Arizona. The president is elected by winning at least 270 electoral college votes, not the outcome of the popular vote. Because there is no centralised federal election system, it has become tradition in the US that \u201cdecision desks\u201d at media organisations make a call that states have been won by one candidate or the other when enough votes have been counted. States that are too close to call remain in the balance until a network \u201ccalls\u201d them. The Guardian uses the data collected and analysed by the Associated Press (AP) news agency as the source for when we will call election results. There are a number of other highly reputable election decision desks in US media, including NBC, Fox News and others. They may call races earlier or later than AP. US networks obviously use the decisions from their own desks \u2013 other channels may chose to follow one, or wait for two desks to call a state before they count it. This year, Arizona has brought this into sharp relief. Our current total of 264 electoral votes for Joe Biden includes the fact that AP has called Arizona for the Democratic nominee. So has Fox News \u2013 attracting the ire of the Trump campaign. Not all decision desks have yet, leaving Biden without its 11 electoral votes and on 253 on some websites and news networks. By the way, the prospect of recounts might be worrying you that they could drastically alter the result. The answer is probably not. Stef W Kight had this analysis at Axios yesterday: The Trump campaign says it will seek recounts in several key states, but that\u2019s highly unlikely to change the outcome. Statewide recounts have historically only changed electoral margins by an average 430 votes, according to the nonpartisan election reform group FairVote. Joe Biden\u2019s lead in several states is thin, but it\u2019s not that thin. There have only been 31 recounts in the past 20 years, the research found. That was out of more than 5,700 statewide general elections. Three of those recounts overturned results, but they only shifted the final margin by 239-440 votes. Here are the criteria for recounts in each state according to Axios: The Pennsylvania race is currently within the 0.5% margin that would trigger an automatic recount. The Trump campaign has said it will ask for a recount in Michigan and Wisconsin, where the president is down by tens of thousands of votes. The only way to get a recount in Arizona is if the margin is within 0.1%. Georgia has already said it will recount. Read the full analysis here: Axios \u2013 Trump\u2019s odds of winning through a recount are nearly impossible Ok, here\u2019s a round up of where we are \u2026 We still don\u2019t have a winner, but Joe Biden said last night that he and Kamala Harris were \u201con track\u201d to win the election. Counts are progressing slowly, but Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Nevada are all still \u201ctoo close to call\u201d. Georgia will go to a recount \u2013 once the first count is over. Biden\u2019s lead over Donald Trump in Pennsylvania and Nevada has been growing. In Arizona, it has been shrinking as more votes are counted, but Trump has so far not been winning a large enough share of the mail-in votes to overtake his Democratic challenger. Biden has urged calm while the US awaits election results. \u201cI know watching these vote tallies can be very slow,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be numbing\u201d to watch. But those numbers represent voters, he added, and their voice should be heard. There\u2019s been no comment from Trump so far this morning, but his children have continued to use social media to spread baseless claims that there has been widespread voter fraud. There is absolutely no credible evidence for this. In a coordinated message, Rupert Murdoch-owned conservative media outlets in the United States, including Fox News, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, began saying \u201cif and when\u201d a Trump loss becomes clear he should preserve his \u201clegacy\u201d by showing grace in defeat. The White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows, has tested positive for Covid-19. As many as four other staff have also tested positive, per reports. Meadows attended indoor events on election day and did not use a face mask to protect himself and others from contracting the virus. Trump backers were tricked into joining a \u201cGay Communists for Socialism\u201d group on Facebook. Twitter, meanwhile, has said Trump\u2019s own account would lose its special protected status once he is no longer president. The US once again broke its record for the highest number of new Covid-19 infections in a single day. More than 121,000 new cases were recorded on Friday. You never know, but it seems like we are unlikely to get much progress on a final result today \u2013 but keep it tuned anyway because there\u2019s plenty going on. And you can always drop me a line at martin.belam@theguardian.com with your tips, links, quips and queries. If you are one of those people who subscribe to the theory that Murdoch newspapers always want to be seen to be backing the winning side, then here\u2019s today\u2019s New York Post. It is not perhaps a road to Damascus-style conversion, but let\u2019s bear in mind that back in September they were running with front pages like this, with the strapline \u201cAnother day of hidin\u2019, help us find Biden\u201d. I\u2019m sure a lot of people are coming to this live blog just wanting to know when we\u2019ll get a final result, and what is holding it all up. Here\u2019s what the Associated Press (AP) said yesterday about the reasons remaining for not \u201ccalling\u201d the final few swing states for one candidate or another. They all essentially boil down to \u201cthere\u2019s still enough uncounted votes to swing it either way, and there will likely have to be a recount in any case\u201d. GEORGIA: Outstanding ballots left to be counted and a razor-thin margin. The AP does not declare a winner of an election that will be \u2013 or is likely to become \u2013 subject to a mandatory recount In instances where a recount isn\u2019t required by law but a candidate requests one, AP will not call a race if the margin between the top two candidates is 0.5 percentage points or less. NEVADA: A tight vote margin and large number of ballots that have yet to be counted made the Nevada race too early to call. Clark County officials said Thursday that they would be releasing the results of 51,000 ballots on Friday. But they later clarified that they had overestimated the size of the batch and released results from about 30,000 ballots instead. Separately, state officials said on Thursday that there were about 190,000 votes left to count statewide, a total that included mail ballots and provisional ballots from voters who registered or updated their registration at the polls. But it was unclear if that figure took into account the overestimated number of ballots by Clark County election officials. In a tight race, that could delay the AP declaring a winner. NORTH CAROLINA: Race too early to call. Ballots left to count. Trump holds nearly a 77,000-vote lead, but there were up to 116,000 mail ballots left to count on Friday, as well as about 41,000 provisional ballots statewide. As long as ballots are postmarked by 3 November, state election officials have until 12 November to count them. And when it comes to mail ballots, Biden was outperforming Trump. That means the ballots yet to be counted could give Biden a lead. PENNSYLVANIA: A close margin and a large number of outstanding votes are making the Pennsylvania contest too early to call. Biden held a lead over Trump of 0.29% on Friday. State law dictates that a recount must be held if the margin between the two candidates is less than 0.5%. Additionally, there are potentially tens of thousands of provisional ballots that remain to be tabulated, though an exact number remained unclear. Those ballots will be counted after officials verify their eligibility to be included. The president\u2019s children continue, without any evidence of widespread voter fraud, to suggest that there is widespread voter fraud. If you\u2019ve been watching the US election unfold for days now \u2013 especially if you don\u2019t live there \u2013 you may have thought on more than one occasion: \u201cBut why do they even have the electoral college?\u201d The answer, as is often the case with the US constitution, is because of trying to strike a workable compromise between the northern states and the slave-holding southern states in the early days of the US. If you want to read up on it, there\u2019s a great essay from last year here by assistant professor at Brooklyn Law School, Wilfred Codrington III called \u201cThe Electoral College\u2019s racist origins\u201d. He writes: The populations in the North and South were approximately equal, but roughly one-third of those living in the South were held in bondage. Because of its considerable, nonvoting slave population, that region would have less clout under a popular-vote system. The ultimate solution was an indirect method of choosing the president, one that could leverage the three-fifths compromise, the Faustian bargain they\u2019d already made to determine how congressional seats would be apportioned. The \u2018three-fifths compromise\u2019 mentioned there was the 1787 decision that enslaved people would equal \u2018three-fifths\u2019 of a person for the purposes of counting the population of states and thus determining their level of representation in Congress. As we wait some 200+ years later for count numbers to slowly update, I recommend it as a fascinating read in the meanwhile: The Atlantic \u2013 The Electoral College\u2019s racist origins Some analysis from S&amp;P Global has landed, which clearly indicates that the two campaigns had differing priorities for their ad spend. The Biden campaign outspent Trump on traditional broadcast TV ads by $249.9m to $174.6m. But the Republicans put more money behind digital. In that market, Trump spent $201.46m. Biden spent $166.12m. And where did the most money go? Well, as you\u2019d expect, the states pivotal to the outcome. S&amp;P Global found that: Phoenix, Arizona was the top market. Three of the top five markets were in Florida. Four of the top 15 markets were in Pennsylvania Michigan and Wisconsin each had two of the top 15 markets. \u201cTomorrow is the beginning of a new day,\u201d Joe Biden said in his final campaign rally in Pittsburgh on the eve of the US election. \u201cThere\u2019s one more day to show who we are as a country: looking out for each other, the thousand acts of kindness, the decency that people used to show one another \u2013 and still do.\u201d Three days later, Donald Trump appeared in the press briefing room of the White House and let the world know what he thinks of kindness and decency. With votes still being counted, he laid out a paranoid fantasy of a vast leftwing conspiracy stealing the election from him, one fraudulent ballot at a time. For the media networks who cut away from Trump\u2019s speech after just a few minutes, it was all too easy to dismiss his lie-infested rant as the death rattle of a man whose political lifeblood was being drained from him in real time. Except for three inconvenient truths: Trump will continue to be head of state of the most powerful nation on Earth until at least 20 January; 70 million Americans voted for him, of whom a portion is likely to be susceptible to his falsehoods; some 17m guns have been bought so far this year \u2013 the largest number in US history. Nor did this outpouring of baseless histrionics end with the president. The rightwing talkshow host Mark Levin called on Republican state lawmakers to bypass the vote entirely and declare Trump the winner no matter what the final count. Steve Bannon, Trump\u2019s former chief strategist in the White House now facing charges for running a fraudulent scheme to build the Mexican border wall, told Fox News: \u201cDonald Trump won an overwhelming victory on Tuesday night.\u201d A few hours later Facebook permanently suspended one of Bannon\u2019s accounts after he suggested senior members of the Trump administration should be beheaded. Facebook also banned a group, \u201cStop the Steal\u201d, that popped up on its platform attracting within the first 24 hours some 350,000 members, a number of whom made \u201cworrying calls for violence\u201d. Joe Biden, assuming he is declared the next occupant of the Oval Office, is going to have to climb a steep and stony path before he can drag America back to anything resembling decency. Read more of Ed Pilkington\u2019s report here: Joe Biden poised to inherit Disunited States of America A couple of news websites like Vox and Business Insider have already called the whole election for Joe Biden \u2013 and it seems like some young Trump supporters on TikTok have already accepted that result. Kelsey Vlamis reports for Business Insider on a trend that has swept the social media site since Friday \u2013 young Trump supporters posting clips of themselves folding up their Trump 2020 flags and congratulating Biden. The trend started Friday. The first video was posted by a user with an audio clip of the song \u201cLatch\u201d by Disclosure. He folds up his Trump 2020 flag and has text over the video that says, \u201cGood luck, Biden.\u201d \u201cI wish nothing but good health and love for him,\u201d it reads. \u201cTrump, I\u2019ll miss you, sir. Stay united, America.\u201d Hundreds of similar videos have since been created with the same audio clip, many showing young supporters of the president taking down flags or removing Trump hats. Read more here: Business Insider \u2013 Young Trump supporters on TikTok are posting videos of them folding up their Trump 2020 flags and congratulating Biden Sean Sullivan for the Washington Post has a good look here at why the Democrats are having some mixed feelings about Tuesday\u2019s vote: Democrats charged into the election as a unified party, setting aside deeply felt divisions to maximize Joe Biden\u2019s chances of defeating President Trump. But as Biden closes in on the presidency, old fissures have resurfaced and new ones are erupting, driven by unexpected losses among Democrats running for the House and Senate and areas where Trump was surprisingly strong. That\u2019s creating an anxiety and strain unusual for a party that stands on the cusp of accomplishing its biggest goal. Moderates blame liberals for promoting socialism and proposals to \u201cdefund the police\u201d. Liberals are warning Biden not to cozy up to Senate Republicans, who might retain their majority. Latino leaders are raising alarms about Biden\u2019s poor performance in some of their communities. While Democrats were upbeat about Biden\u2019s lead in the presidential race, they were also engaging in soul-searching. Because both Biden and the GOP can claim successes, the outcome defies simple theories about the electorate and potentially leaves Biden without full control of Congress or a unified direction for his party. Read more here: Washington Post \u2013 Democrats, nearing a moment of triumph, still feel anxious and divided Slovenia\u2019s rightwing prime minister, Janez Jan\u0161a, went out on a limb earlier in the week by seemingly being the first foreign leader to congratulate Donald Trump on his \u201cvictory\u201d. It looks like Fiji\u2019s prime minister, Frank Bainimarama, has decided to make his mark in the opposite direction \u2013 he seems to be the first leader to congratulate Joe Biden. Other politicians have sent Biden their best wishes already. Vox report that congratulations came from \u201cseveral European politicians and officials desperate to work with him on climate change\u201d. Messages came in from two members of the European parliament from Germany\u2019s Green party. \u201cCongrats Mr. President,\u201d tweeted Rasmus Andersen while Jutta Paulus referred to Biden as \u201cMr. President-elect\u201d and referenced the state of Pennsylvania, which Biden had just won, clinching the race. Belgium\u2019s recently appointed climate minister, Zakia Khattabi, also celebrated Biden\u2019s win, though without directly naming him, tweeting: \u201cWelcome back #America! See you at the next #Cop,\u201d referring to the next UN Climate Change Conference to be held in Glasgow, Scotland, in November 2021. A reminder, not that you probably need it, but nobody has yet won the 2020 US election, and we don\u2019t know for sure who will be the next president of the United States. We might not have a final result yet, but we can already see areas where candidates did better, or worse, than expected. Alexandra Villarreal has this for us, on how Biden failed with Latino voters along the Texas border. While Democrats aggressively pushed to turn Texas blue this election cycle, they were banking on help from people like Barbara Oca\u00f1as, a highly educated, 37-year-old Latina voter from the Rio Grande valley. But, after Donald Trump faced backlash for using the word \u201ccoyote\u201d to describe human smugglers, Oca\u00f1as was turned off by liberals focused more on semantics than the actual realities of the migrant crisis affecting her home. As the daughter of a Mexican \u00e9migr\u00e9, she believes that undocumented immigrants are \u201cjust people, like you and me\u201d. However, when it comes to earning US citizenship, \u201cthere is a right way and a wrong way to do it\u201d, she said. She also fears what Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden\u2019s administration could mean for people she knows who rely on jobs in refineries or hauling crude oil. So, faced with a ballot and a choice, Oca\u00f1as decided she preferred four more years with Donald Trump in the White House. \u201cNot all of us take it to heart when we\u2019re called rapists and bad hombres,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have tough skin.\u201d Read more of Alexandra Villarreal\u2019s report here: Why Democrats lost Latino voters along Texas border: \u2018They relied on loyalty\u2019 If you missed it, here\u2019s how Joe Biden addressed the nation. He said \u201cwe\u2019re going to win this race\u201d as crucial states trend in his favour. Biden, who stands on the cusp of victory, said late on Friday he was on track to claim 300 electoral votes. The former vice-president has already urged unity during the count after Donald Trump continued to sow doubt about the election process without presenting any evidence. \u201cWe may be opponents, but we\u2019re not enemies,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe\u2019re Americans.\u201d It\u2019s 4am on the US east coast, and here\u2019s a run-down on those current Biden leads \u2013 they are all narrow, but he doesn\u2019t need to win all of them to get to the magic figure of 270. Here the Guardian\u2019s Luke Harding narrates how a turbulent election night gave way to a desperate position for Trump \u2013 and a seemingly futile strategy to stay in power: Trump reportedly spent the next few hours ringing Republican governors. At 2.30am he gave a presidential briefing. It was everything his adversaries had feared: an angry and unfounded riff in which he accused the Democrats of fraud. Trump claimed \u2013 wrongly \u2013 that he had won the election. He suggested the supreme court would intervene. \u201cThis is an embarrassment to our country,\u201d he said, to cheers from his family and friends. The grim scenario, which Trump had been carefully preparing for months, was now being played out on the nation\u2019s TV screens. The president\u2019s argument \u2013 that mailed-in votes for Biden amounted to cheating \u2013 was untrue. But like previous presidential lies, it was to have ugly real-world consequences. A dark myth was taking shape: that the Democrats had stabbed Trump in the back. Meanwhile, Biden expressed optimism and urged voters to be patient. Later on Wednesday, results looked increasingly good for him. Trump\u2019s 2016 path to the White House went through Michigan, a traditionally Democratic northern state, and Wisconsin. Now both had swung back and were called for Biden. In a speech that afternoon, he said: \u201cWhen the count is finished, we believe we will be the winners.\u201d Slowly but surely, the race was going the wrong way for Trump. The president\u2019s aggressive fightback took a familiar shape: a wave of lawsuits. In Wisconsin the Trump campaign demanded a recount, in Michigan a stop to counting, in Pennsylvania a challenge to the legality of extending ballot deadlines. And so on. The apparent goal: to prevent Trump from sliding, as each ballot was counted, to ignominious defeat. \u201cI have never been more grateful for President Trump\u2019s incompetence,\u201d writes the conservative columnist Max Boot in the Washington Post. \u201cHe can\u2019t even organize a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat properly.\u201d From the piece: Many of us have spent the past few years decrying the tendency of Trump supporters to live in a world of alternative facts. But ultimately reality bites. The fact that Trump and his cultists cannot point to a single actual case of fraud \u2014 much less enough fraud to overturn an election that he is on track to lose by a significant margin \u2014 makes it impossible for them to effectively challenge the results. Their theory \u2014 that Democrats perpetrated a massive fraud in the presidential race but neglected to fix the results of House or Senate races \u2014 is laughably absurd. Read further here. Without the electoral college, of course, Biden would long ago have left Trump in the dust, and we would not all be staring at county clerk web sites and cable TV tallies. Illustrating Trump\u2019s inconsistent nature by digging through his endless Twitter stream might be too easy, but still. \u201cSuspended animation\u201d \u2013 that\u2019s the new phrase the Associated Press has selected to describe the state of the US presidential race. Here\u2019s the top of their latest news take (which is walled off from the AP elections decision desk): Four days after the election, the US presidential race hovered in suspended animation Saturday as the long, exacting work of counting votes brought Democrat Joe Biden ever closer to a victory over President Donald Trump. The verdict delay can be attributed to high turnout, a massive number of mail-in ballots and slim margins between the two candidates. But Biden held leads in Pennsylvania, Nevada and Georgia, putting him in an ever-stronger position to capture the 270 Electoral College votes needed to take the White House. There was intense focus on Pennsylvania, where Biden led Trump by more than 27,000 votes, and Nevada, where the Democrat led by about 22,000. The prolonged wait added to the anxiety of a nation facing historic challenges, including the surging pandemic and deep political polarization. Read more here. New results out of Georgia and \u2013 they just basically say the same thing, Biden has a small but significant lead. The state is in any case heading for a recount (in the future! The results referenced below are still part of the first count). But in the interest of total information awareness, and in case you are keeping a separate tally at home: If you are waking up in Europe, here\u2019s a summary of the latest US elections news: Joe Biden said he and Kamala Harris were \u201con track\u201d to win the election, delivering remarks in Wilmington, Delaware. Indeed, Biden\u2019s lead over Donald Trump in Pennsylvania and Nevada has been growing. In Arizona, Biden\u2019s lead has been shrinking as more votes are counted, but Trump has so far not been winning a large enough share of the mail-in votes to overtake his Democratic challenger. Biden urged calm while the US awaits election results. \u201cI know watching these vote tallies can be very slow,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be numbing\u201d to watch. But those numbers represent voters, he added, and their voice should be heard. In a coordinated message, Rupert Murdoch-owned conservative media outlets in the United States, including Fox News, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, began saying \u201cif and when\u201d a Trump loss becomes clear he should preserve his \u201clegacy\u201d by showing grace in defeat. The White House chief of staff Mark Meadows has tested positive for Covid-19. As many as four other staff have also tested positive, per reports. Meadows attended indoor events on election day and did not use a face mask to protect himself and others from contracting the virus. Georgia is planning to hold a recount to settle the virtual tie between Biden and Trump. Biden is leading by a slim margin. The state will also hold two runoffs to decide who will fill the state\u2019s two Senate seats. Incumbent Republican Senator David Perdue will face off against Democrat Jon Ossoff and incumbent Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler will face off against Democrat Raphael Warnock on 5 January. The United States once again broke its record for the highest number of new Covid-19 infections in a single day. More than 121,000 new cases were recorded Friday. It has been a few hours since we\u2019ve had any new results in the states still counting the US presidential vote. It\u2019s about 3am in Pennsylvania and coming up on midnight in Nevada. That does not mean the decision desk gears are not grinding offstage. The Associated Press and others still might decide at any moment that they have quote-unquote seen enough. But on the other hand if you are weighing sleep, or a break for coffee, or a morning jog, depending on your time zone \u2013 you might be safe to do that without fear of missing The Big Moment. Might. A texting company run by one of President Donald Trump\u2019s top campaign officials sent out thousands of targeted, anonymous text messages urging supporters to rally where votes were being counted in Philadelphia on Thursday, falsely claiming Democrats were trying to steal the presidential election, the Associated Press reports: The messages directed Trump fans to converge at a downtown intersection where hundreds of protesters from the opposing candidates\u2019 camps faced off Thursday afternoon. Pennsylvania is a crucial battleground state where former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s jumped ahead Friday and in a televised address later predicted a victory that would give him the presidency. \u201cThis kind of message is playing with fire, and we are very lucky that it does not seem to have driven more conflict,\u201d said John Scott-Railton, senior researcher at the University of Toronto\u2019s online watchdog Citizen Lab. Scott-Railton helped track down the source. The texts were sent using phone numbers leased to the text-messaging platform Opn Sesame, said two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition they not be further identified. The company\u2019s CEO is Gary Coby, the Trump campaign\u2019s digital director. It provides text-messaging services to GOP clients including the Republican National Committee. \u201cALERT: Radical Liberals &amp; Dems are trying to steal this election from Trump! We need YOU!\u201d the text said, directing recipients to \u201cshow your support\u201d on a street corner near the Philadelphia Convention Center where votes were being counted and tensions were running high. Read the full piece here. Is it possible that national politics \u2013 as distinct from policy \u2013 could begin to demand a smaller share of the national attention? For the dead-enders, there are still those two runoff senate elections in Georgia to grapple over, and after (if and when) Biden is installed in the White House, depending on what happens in those runoffs he could then face a protracted struggle with Mitch McConnell and the conservative courts. The presidential race has not yet been called. It\u2019s not over. But we are well into a blending period between not-over and over. It seems. Like. Multiple Rupert Murdoch-owned conservative media outlets have shifted their messaging to warn readers and viewers that Donald Trump just might have lost the presidential election. The messaging appears to be closely coordinated right down to an appeal to Trump about preserving his legacy by showing grace in defeat. It\u2019s being carried on Fox News and in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Post. If and when the writing is on the wall for Trump, the Murdoch media-sphere is likely where he\u2019ll encounter the truth. Unless Don Jr tells him? Fox News host Laura Ingraham, an intimate of the president ever since she spoke at the 2016 Republican national convention, made an astounding statement that seemed directed at Trump himself, advising him to accept defeat \u201cif and when that does happen\u201d with \u201cgrace and composure\u201d and appealing to his sense of his own legacy. Ingraham said in part: If and when it\u2019s time to accept an unfavorable outcome in this election, and we hope it never comes, but if and when that does happen, president Trump needs to do it with the same grace and composure he demonstrated at that town hall with Savannah Guthrie. So many people remarked about his tone and presence. Exactly what he needs. Now losing, especially when you believe the process wasn\u2019t fair, it\u2019s a gut punch. And I\u2019m not conceding anything tonight by the way. But losing, if that\u2019s what happens \u2013 it\u2019s awful. But president Trump\u2019s legacy will only become more significant if he focuses on moving the country forward. The Wall Street Journal has published an opinion piece with almost the exact same message. It is titled \u201cThe Presidential Endgame\u201d and subtitled \u201cTrump has the right to fight in court, but he needs evidence to prove voter fraud.\u201d \u201cMr Trump\u2019s legacy will be diminished greatly if his final act is a bitter refusal to accept a legitimate defeat,\u201d the piece warns. Here\u2019s the top: Perhaps it was inevitable that Donald Trump\u2019s re-election campaign would end as his Presidency began: with the President claiming victory and his frenzied antagonists denouncing him as a would-be fascist. The reality is that the U.S. can and probably will have a normal election outcome regardless of the shouting between now and then. Mr Biden is leading in enough states to win the presidency, and if those votes survive recounts and legal challenges, he will be the next president. Top editors at the New York Post \u2013 which before the election was the launch vehicle for wild and desperate attacks on Joe Biden\u2019s son Hunter \u2013 have \u201ctold some staff members this week to be tougher in their coverage\u201d of Trump, the New York Times reported, citing two anonymous employees of the paper. From the piece: On Thursday, in a sudden about-face, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s scrappy tabloid published two articles with a wildly different tone. One accused the president of making an \u201cunfounded claim that political foes were trying to steal the election.\u201d The headline on the other described Donald Trump Jr. as the \u201cpanic-stricken\u201d author of a \u201cclueless tweet.\u201d News coverage at Fox News has similarly shown little patience with the lies about voter fraud Trump is advancing in hopes of reversing the election. Asked about the Trump campaign\u2019s assertion that Republican observers had not been allowed to observe vote-counting, the Fox correspondent states flatly, \u201cThat\u2019s not true. It\u2019s not true. It\u2019s just not true\u201d: Joe Biden said he and Kamala Harris were \u201con track\u201d to win the election, delivering remarks in Wilmington, Delaware. Indeed, Biden\u2019s lead over Donald Trump in Pennsylvania and Nevada has been growing. In Arizona, Biden\u2019s lead has been shrinking as more votes are counted, but Trump has so far not been winning a large enough share of the mail-in votes to overtake his Democratic challenger. Biden urged calm while the US awaits election results. \u201cI know watching these vote tallies can be very slow,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be numbing\u201d to watch. But those numbers represent voters, he added, and their voice should be heard. Georgia is planning to hold a recount to settle the virtual tie between Biden and Trump. Biden is leading by a slim margin. The state will also hold two runoffs to decide who will fill the state\u2019s two Senate seats. Incumbent Republican Senator David Perdue will face off against Democrat Jon Ossoff and incumbent Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler will face off against Democrat Raphael Warnock on 5 January. The White House chief of staff Mark Meadows has tested positive for Covid-19. As many as four other staff have also tested positive, per reports. Meadows attended indoor events on election day and did not use a face mask to protect himself and others from contracting the virus. The United States once again broke its record for the highest number of new Covid-19 infections in a single day. More than 121,000 new cases were recorded Friday. I\u2019m signing off \u2013 my colleague Tom McCarthy will be bringing you more live updates. We\u2019re haven\u2019t seen any big vote tally updates coming in over the past couple of hours. Philadelphia isn\u2019t expected to release any data tonight, and vote counters in Pittsburgh have wrapped up for the night as well. We\u2019re unlikely to see a winner projected in Pennsylvania until those population centers process ballots. More results from Nevada are expected tomorrow morning PT. As elections workers continue tabulating ballots, many have put themselves at risk of contracting Covid-19, as CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar pointed out. Officials have taken precautions, including requiring face masks and mandating social distancing at election centers. But there\u2019s an inherent risk to spending hours indoors with other people, and election workers have accepted that risk as they speedily count Americans\u2019 votes. As the US election slowly draws to its conclusion, one of the areas of confusion is that different media outlets are showing different results for the electoral votes. The president is elected by winning at least 270 electoral college votes, not the outcome of the popular vote. Because there is no centralized federal election system, it has become tradition in the US that \u201cdecision desks\u201d at media organizations make a call that states have been won by one candidate or the other when enough votes have been counted. States that are too close to call \u2013 such as Nevada and Georgia at the moment \u2013 remain in the balance until a network \u201ccalls\u201d them. The Guardian uses the data collected and analyzed by the Associated Press (AP) news agency as the source for when we will call election results. There are a number of other highly reputable election decision desks in US media, including NBC, Fox News and others. They may call races earlier or later than AP. US networks obviously use the decisions from their own desks \u2013 other channels may choose to follow one, or wait for two desks to call a state before they count it. This year, Arizona has brought this into sharp relief. Our current total of 264 electoral votes for Joe Biden includes the fact that AP has called Arizona for the Democratic nominee. So have Fox News \u2013 attracting the ire of the Trump campaign. Not all decision desks have yet. AP has issued this guide to all of the states it has called. Read more: Bloomberg\u2019s Jennifer Jacobs is reporting that Covid-19 has spread among White House to Meadows and at least four others : Here\u2019s a video from election day, which shows Donald Trump and Mark Meadows at a campaign headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. Neither was wearing a mask to protect themselves and others from contracting Covid-19. In the leadup to election day, Trump complained that the media was focused too much on the coronavirus crisis, which has killed more than a quarter-million Americans. He has consistently insisted that the US is \u201crounding the turn\u201d and overcoming the pandemic, even as tallies of cases and deaths mounted. Even after he and at least two dozen others in his circle tested positive for Covid-19, Trump has refused to encourage his supporters to wear face masks. Here\u2019s Meadows on election night: Gabrielle Canon reports: Marches continued in New York City for the 4th night, in support of vote counters and the expected end to Trump\u2019s presidency. Hundreds are still gathering in the streets tonight, and even after clashes with police and documented abuses committed by officers through the week, people are dancing, celebrating, and calling for all the votes to be counted. Here are some scenes from NYC: A campaign aide has also tested positive, Bloomberg reports. CNN and NBC have also confirmed Meadows has contracted Covid-19. The White House did not immediately respond to a query from the Guardian. As CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins noted, Meadows was at a White House election night party. In the lead-up to the election, Donald Trump held multiple rallies a day, attended by hundreds of supporters, most of whom were not wearing masks to slow the spread of disease. The United States broke its record for the highest number of new Covid-19 infections in a single day, with more than 121,000 new cases recorded Friday. Mark Meadows has tested positive for coronavirus, according to reporters from Bloomberg news. Donald Trump himself, and several other administrative staff and allies have contracted the disease so far. The Guardian has not yet confirmed Bloomberg\u2019s reporting. Daniel Strauss reports from Wilmington, Delaware: Former vice-president Joe Biden didn\u2019t declare victory during a speech on Friday night, but he did say he has the upper hand as the remaining votes are counted. \u201cWe\u2019re on track to over 300 electoral college votes,\u201d Biden said. \u201cAnd look at the national numbers. We\u2019re on track with a clear majority behind us.\u201d \u201cOur vote total is still growing. We\u2019re beating Donald Trump by over 4 million votes,\u201d he added. \u201cWhile we\u2019re waiting for the final results I want people to know we\u2019re not waiting to get the work done,\u201d Biden said, adding that on Thursday, he and his running mate California senator Kamala Harris met with experts on the economy and the coronavirus. Biden\u2019s comments come as votes are counted in a handful of remaining states. Neither he nor Donald Trump have reached the 270 electoral votes needed to win the race, but over the past few days Biden has retained a lead in both votes in those states and the electoral count. \u201cWe may be opponents, but we\u2019re not enemies,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe\u2019re Americans.\u201d Echoing the message of calm and unity that he has been repeating in days since the election, Biden also emphasized the he plans to make the coronavirus crisis a top priority if he takes office. The Democratic candidate\u2019s transition team is already at work to tackle the pandemic and other issues, he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t save any of the lives that have been lost but we can save a lot of lives in the months ahead,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019m especially proud of is how well we\u2019ve done across America,\u201d Biden continued, citing his lead in red states Arizona and Georgia. He urged patience. \u201cI know watching these vote tallies can be very slow,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be numbing\u201d to watch. But those numbers represent voters, he said, and their voice should be heard. We don\u2019t have clear results yet, but \u201cwe\u2019re going to win this race,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe\u2019re on track to over 300 electoral votes.\u201d The incumbent Republican senator David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff will rematch in a 5 January runoff election, after neither candidate met the 50% threshold for an outright victory. Georgia\u2019s other Senate seat will also be decided in a runoff, between Democrat Raphael Warnock and Republican senator Kelly Loeffler. With Republicans poised to win Senate races in North Carolina and Alaska, Democrats are seeking a split 50-50 senate \u2013 which they can achieve if both Democratic candidates win Georgia runoffs. The deciding vote in a split senate would be the vice-president. In Detroit, anti-racist protesters were worried that pro-Trump demonstrators would return to the city on Friday after dark for another protest, after an estimated 200 people, some armed, rallied for Trump outside of Detroit\u2019s vote counting location this morning. Instead, nothing happened, except for some shouting between the protesters and some women wearing Trump hats who had come to Detroit to support the president. The women complained to reporters about how they had been treated after the protesters screamed insults at them and told them to go home, but would not say where they had come from, or give their names. Another Trump supporter spat at the Detroit protesters before driving away from a downtown hotel. With no rightwing demonstration in sight, the local activists left, too. The Proud Boys, a violent far-right street fighting group, and pro-Trump provocateurs have advertised a \u201cStop the Steal\u201d protest at Michigan\u2019s Capitol at noon on Saturday. Biden supporters have gathered outside the Chase Center in Wilmington, Delaware, where the Democratic candidate will speak soon. A few Trump supporters are also there. A few Trump supporters are also there, in protest. Many are growing impatient awaiting a presidential election result, including, it seems, the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer. Here\u2019s more on why it\u2019s taking so long: An update: we are expecting remarks from Joe Biden in Delaware at 10:30pm east coast time. We\u2019ll bring you live coverage. Pennsylvania\u2019s attorney general, Josh Shapiro, said Trump and his campaign\u2019s attempts halt the vote count with litigation will amount to nothing. \u201cThey either lose, or the suit is dismissed,\u201d he told MSNBC. \u201cThere has been a lot of noise, but there has been literally zero impact on the counting of ballots.\u201d He also noted that his children have been asking him \u2013 as many people in the US and around the world have been wondering \u2013 when we\u2019ll have a result. \u201cMy kids keep asking me, when is this going to be over,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take as long as it takes to make sure every legal vote is counted.\u201d It is still unclear what we can expect from Joe Biden tonight. Reporters were directed to the Chase Center in Wilmington, Delaware \u2013 which had been staged for a speech from the Democratic candidate. Chris Coons, a Democratic senator of Delaware, joined reporters in Wilmington. \u201cBob Casey [a Democratic senator of Pennsylvania] just texted me,\u201d he said, according to the pool report. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get a call out of Pennsylvania until tomorrow.\u201d \u201cI have not spoken directly to the vice-president,\u201d he told reporters, according to Nikki Schwab of the Daily Mail. \u201cI think the folks around him are staying calm and being appropriate respecting voters and respecting the process.\u201d Biden\u2019s lead in Pennsylvania, meanwhile, continues to grow. He\u2019s now up by 21,705 votes - leaving the candidates one-third of a point apart. Here\u2019s the scene in Philadelphia, captured by Amber Jamieson of Buzzfeed: After Maricopa county, Arizona, released a new batch of data from processed ballots, Biden\u2019s lead has narrowed to 29,861. The two candidates are now 1 point apart. The race is very tight - but again, Trump did not win the 57.5% of these votes needed to stay on pace to overtake Biden. Kari Paul reports from Oakland: Thousands of Donald Trump supporters have unwittingly found themselves in a Facebook group called \u201cGay Communists for Socialism\u201d, after being tricked by its creators into joining what they thought was a pro-Trump election group. On Thursday, a Facebook group called \u201cStop the Steal\u201d, a reference to the president\u2019s false claims that Joe Biden is \u201cstealing\u201d the US election, was disabled by the social network for misinformation after gaining more than 350,000 members. Other groups emerged in its place, including a second \u201cStop the Steal\u201d group that attracted more than 40,000 castaways from the original group. But less than 24 hours later, an administrator for the group changed its name to \u201cGay Communists for Socialism\u201d without explanation, confounding the new members. Dozens of posts from angry and confused Trump supporters asked, \u201cWhat happened to stop the steal?\u201d and, \u201cWhy is this group called gay communists for socialism?\u201d, while others demanded, \u201cGet me off this page !!!!!!\u201d Using Facebook-owned data analytics tool CrowdTangle, the Guardian confirmed the group was created on 5 November as \u201cStop the Steal\u201d before being renamed. One administrator, whose real identity could not be verified, told the Guardian the group was a planned operation to troll conservatives with a fake \u201cStop the Steal\u201d group. \u201cWe had no idea it would take off like this or suck in as many clueless people as it did when we made the switch,\u201d the administrator said. He said the group, which now has 60,000 members, has an additional 20,000 member requests. Another group administrator further trolled its members by telling them the name change had been done to keep Facebook from cracking down on it, and later said the group may have been hacked by Facebook itself. \u201cWe\u2019ve been on the phone and messaging with Facebook trying to get to the bottom of this\u201d \u2013 a clear joke, as Facebook does not have a public customer service phone number. Read more: A state of emergency has been declared in Miami-Dade county, as Tropical Depression Eta heads toward Florida. \u201cI will be meeting with my senior staff and emergency managers this evening to ensure that all necessary emergency operations are underway,\u201d Mayor Carlos Gim\u00e9nez said in a statement released Friday night. \u201cFor now, I urge residents to stay informed as to the storm\u2019s track and potential impact. We are looking at experiencing heavy rainfall through Monday and possible tropical storm force winds beginning Sunday.\u201d The storm, which is expected to strengthen as it approaches Florida, has already devastated Central America, leaving landslides and flooding in its wake. More than 100 fatalities have already been reported and thousands remain under evacuation across the region. In Arizona, a longtime Republican stronghold where Joe Biden has maintained a shrinking lead as officials tabulate votes, Cindy McCain says she\u2019s confident that Biden will ultimately win. McCain, the widow of the late Arizona senator and 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain, endorsed Biden and helped him campaign in her home state. She is one of several high-profile Republicans who have backed Biden over Trump. Arizona has voted for the Republican presidential nominee in every election but one since 1952. We\u2019re waiting for more results from the presidential race there tonight. Read more about why Arizona is so competitive this year: We\u2019ve been anticipating an address from Joe Biden tonight, but it remains unclear when that will be. Bloomberg News\u2019 Jennifer Epstein reports that Biden is planning to speak even if the election results do not become clear tonight: Gabrielle Canon in San Francisco reports: While the nation anxiously awaits confirmation of who will be the next president, moves are being made inside the White House that could inhibit a smooth transition to Joe Biden, who is close to clinching a win. Bonnie Glick, the deputy administrator of the US Agency for International Development was ousted from her position on Friday, after being asked to resign in a letter signed by the director of the White House presidential personnel office, John McEntee. USAid has been on the frontlines in the battle against Covid-19, playing a critical role in the global response to the pandemic. \u201cShould there be a transition, she will be missed and it will be a loss for USAid,\u201d a senior figure told CNN, adding that \u201cpeople in the community have the highest respect for her\u201d and that she \u201cbrought real thought leadership to the agency\u201d. Some are now expressing concerns that the president could begin purging officials he believes to have not been loyal to him, before the end of his term, should he lose the election as currently expected. Trump also demoted Neil Chatterjee, who heads the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission this week. Glick, a well-liked Republican appointee who was confirmed in her role by the Senate in the beginning of 2019, is believed to have been fired to open her position to John Barsa, whose role as acting administrator for the agency expired today. Barsa was never confirmed, and regulations allow only 210 days for \u201cacting\u201d positions, but with Glick\u2019s departure, he will continue heading the agency from the deputy position. Barsa isn\u2019t as popular internally and has come under criticism for appointing inflammatory and inexperienced officials in the agency, for political and ideological reasons. Sam Levine reports: A federal judge dismissed another lawsuit from Republicans alleging vote irregularities, this time in Nevada. Nevada Republicans had sought to block the use of a signature verification machine and wanted more observation access to ballot counting in Clark county, home of Nevada. The loss is the latest in a string of suits experts consider to be long shots. An anxious electorate has been waiting for results from Nevada, where a decisive Biden win would give him the six electoral votes needed to declare victory. But officials have said they\u2019re taking a slow and steady approach. \u201cWe told everyone early on that results would take at least 10 days,\u201d the secretary of state spokeswoman Jennifer A Russell told the Associated Press. Ahead of the election, the state sent all registered voters mail-in ballots and committed to counting all ballots postmarked by election day, so long as they arrive by next Tuesday. About 87% of votes have been tabulated, with more than 1.2m ballots remaining to be processed. Just under 50,000 ballots had errors that voters are been given the opportunity to resolve (some require ID verification, others have signature-matching issues). Joe Biden is leading Donald Trump by more than 22,600 votes so far. Officials have until 12 November to finish counting, though they are expecting most to be tabulated by this weekend. Sam Levine, the Guardian\u2019s voting rights reporter: Samuel Alito\u2019s order requiring all counties in Pennsylvania to segregate ballots that arrived after 8pm on election day is the first time the supreme court has weighed in on a matter affecting the presidential race since Tuesday. But Alito\u2019s order is not that significant because it tells Pennsylvania officials to do what the state had already asked local officials to do. After Pennsylvania Republicans asked the supreme court to halt the counting of mail-in ballots received post-election day, justice Samuel Alito has directed elections officials follow procedure and segregate and tally late-arriving ballots separately. The Pennsylvania secretary of state, Kathy Boockvar, has already directed officials to segregate the late-arriving ballots, and told CNN she didn\u2019t think those ballots would affect the outcome of the elections \u201cunless it\u2019s super close\u201d. Republicans are ultimately seeking to have ballots that were postmarked by election day but arrived late thrown out. The Pennsylvania supreme court had ordered that the normal deadline to return ballots \u2013 8pm election day \u2013 could be extended to today at 5pm local time. As more and more votes in Pennsylvania are tabulated, Joe Biden\u2019s lead in the state has been growing \u2013 so it\u2019s unclear that Republican litigation will have any impact. Read more: Lauren Aratani reports from New York: The United States has broken its record for the highest number of new Covid-19 infections in a single day yet again, with more than 121,000 new cases recorded on Thursday. As the country\u2019s attention has been trained on the presidential election, the US has continued to break daily records for new Covid-19 cases. On Wednesday, the day after the election, the country saw more than 107,000 cases, the first time the US surpassed 100,000 new cases in a single day. Before that, the record was set on 30 October with just over 99,000 new cases. Along with new cases rising, hospitalizations and deaths have slowly begun to increase. About 53,000 people were hospitalized with Covid-19 on Thursday. The number of Covid fatalities across the country was over 1,000 for the third day in a row, with 1,210 deaths on Thursday. Altogether, the US has had more than 9.6m cases of Covid-19 and 234,000 deaths since the start of the pandemic \u2013 the most of any country. Unlike previous surges of the virus in the US, this increase is not concentrated in a single region. Initial increases were seen in the American heartland, particularly in the Dakotas and Wisconsin. In recent weeks, there have been surges in Iowa, Nebraska, Colorado and Minnesota. Increases have also been seen on the east coast, in Maine, Connecticut and Rhode Island. Only two states \u2013 Tennessee and Alabama \u2013 have had drops in cases, according to Johns Hopkins University. Public health experts have sounded the alarm for weeks over a potential surge in cases as the weather starts to cool in many parts of the country. Now, it is clear that their warnings were prescient. While Donald Trump was saying that the country is \u201cabsolutely rounding the corner\u201d with the virus, the White House\u2019s coronavirus taskforce was striking a completely different note in its reports. \u201cThere is a continued increase in cases, hospitalizations and fatalities nationally, spreading southward from the coldest climates as the population moves indoors and cases increase exponentially,\u201d according to a report dated 1 November and obtained by CNN. Read more: In Phoenix, Arizona, pro-Trump protestors have reconvened outside the Maricopa county tabulations and elections center, where officials are still counting ballots. Caitlin O\u2019Hara, who worked with the Guardian on our series on Maricopa county\u2019s changing political landscape, is reporting the scene. Signs posted near a fence designed to keep demonstrators from getting too close direct people to watch a live feed of the vote count, she reports. Counter protestors are also on scene, with people on both sides carrying arms. The scene is calm, local reporters say. Joe Biden has maintained a narrowing lead in Maricopa, with more vote counts expected from the county at 6pm local time tonight. Michigan\u2019s secretary of state Jocelyn Benson issued a statement addressing \u201cfalse claims from Ronna McDaniel\u201d, the Republican National Committee chair, saying that they \u201chave no merit\u201d. In a bullet-pointed list, Benson disputed unsubstantiated claims from McDaniel alleging inaccuracies in the vote count. McDaniel, when pressed today by Fox News anchors for evidence of \u201cirregularities\u201d in the vote count, couldn\u2019t come up with any. She responded, \u201cWe\u2019re working on that. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m saying, give us time.\u201d \u201cMichigan\u2019s elections were conducted fairly, effectively and transparently and are an accurate reflection of the will of Michigan voters,\u201d Benson said. She also noted \u2013 as reporters have also pointed out \u2013 that one instance of \u201cerroneous reporting of unofficial results\u201d was due to a software error and did not affect vote totals. Read her statement here. Jon Henley, Helen Sullivan and Tom McCarthy report: Donald Trump\u2019s repeated claims to have won the US presidential election while votes remain to be counted have focused the spotlight once more on one of the big uncertainties of the 2020 race: when will we know the final result? It could take days, weeks or even months, depending on what happens. What usually happens? US presidential elections are not won by the national popular vote. The winner in each state collects its electoral college votes \u2013 and needs a total of 270 to take the White House. In most elections the result is clear \u2013 although not officially confirmed \u2013 by the end of the night. Major American media outlets \u201ccall\u201d each state for one of the candidates. While not based on the final vote count, that projection is almost invariably accurate. This means an accurate tally of electoral college votes can be made and a winner declared. In 2016, that happened at 2:30am in Washington when Trump reached the required 270. Why is that not happening this time? Mainly because of the Covid-19 pandemic, large numbers of voters \u2013 about 68% of the total, compared with 34% in 2016 \u2013 cast their ballots early, including by post. Counting postal votes is slower because voter and witness signatures and addresses must be checked, and ballots smoothed out before being fed into counting machines. Some states start that verification process long before election day, meaning the count itself can get under way as soon as polls close. There was no early processing in multiple key battleground states this year, however, because Republican-led state legislatures refused urgent requests from local elections officials to pass new laws to allow extra time for ballot processing. Such a refusal in Pennsylvania produced enormous backlogs in cities such as Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, which has gone from counting about 6,000 mail-in ballots in 2016 to more than 350,000 this year. Read more: As more votes are counted, Donald Trump\u2019s hopes for a victory appear to be dimming \u2013 a reality he seems to be processing in his most recent tweets. \u201cI had such a big lead in all of these states late into election night, only to see the leads miraculously disappear as the days went by,\u201d he wrote, quite accurately describing what happened when more ballots were tabulated. \u201cPerhaps these leads will return as our legal proceedings move forward!\u201d he added. However, his baseless and ineffectual legal challenges are, perhaps, unlikely to have that effect. Earlier, CNN reported that Trump has not prepared a concession speech, according to those familiar with the matter. The president\u2019s path to winning the election is narrowing. In Pennsylvania, a latest update found Biden up by more than 16,000 votes. Here\u2019s an update as more presidential elections results trickle in: In Arizona, Joe Biden\u2019s lead is continuing to narrow. Trump is trailing by 39,070 votes, but isn\u2019t quite hitting the thresholds needed to overtake his Democratic opponent. In Nevada, Biden has gained about 2,000 votes and is leading by 22,657. Again, Trump\u2019s chances of catching up are dimming. In Pennsylvania, Biden is leading by 14,923 votes. And in Georgia, Biden\u2019s lead is wavering by a few votes up and down as officials process more ballots. Right now, he\u2019s ahead by 4,175. The Guardian\u2019s Nina Lakhani is reporting from Easton, the county seat of Northampton county in eastern Pennsylvania, which Biden has won by 0.5 percentage points: Northampton county is one of three counties in Pennsylvania that flipped over to Trump after voting twice for Obama. It\u2019s a leafy university city where half the people (that\u2019s not a statistically reliable estimate) seem to be from New Jersey or Brooklyn, in a county that has voted for the presidential winner almost every election since 1920, apart from three times. Biden currently leads Trump by just over 14,500 votes and it looks almost certain that he will take Pennsylvania\u2019s 20 college electoral votes and therefore the White House. Nancy Amacker, 52, an activity coordinator at an elementary school, is hopeful but not taking a Biden victory for granted. \u201cFour years ago I went to bed thinking Hillary had won. This time I\u2019m waiting until it\u2019s final.\u201d Amacker said the community has become far more divided over the past four years, with people growing less respectful and tolerant of opposing political views. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely more polarized than before, and it\u2019s not just about candidates, it\u2019s about demonizing anyone who doesn\u2019t agree with you.\u201d Amacker\u2019s husband voted Republican, which she said has been \u201creally hard\u201d. It\u2019s not just American voters who are anxious about the results, according to Sidharth Vijay, 21, originally from Kerala, India, who is studying chemical engineering and math-econ at Lafayette College. \u201cI can\u2019t vote but this is a high stake election for the world because America dictates global policy. Four years ago I can understand that some people gave Trump the benefit of the doubt, but this time, we know that another Trump victory will lead to more polarization and misinformation, not consolidation. He\u2019s shown his true colors in the pandemic, so that more people have voted for him this time \u2026 that\u2019s really troubling.\u201d We\u2019re expecting a batch of results from Philadelphia and Allegheny county within the hour, inshallah it will then be over. Earlier this morning, as Trump and Republican officials continued to make baseless allegations about election fraud, a right-wing protest drew an estimated 200 people to downtown Detroit, outside the building where ballots were counted earlier this week. By late afternoon, though, the pro-Trump protest had dwindled to fewer than a dozen people, who traded insults at a distance with pro-Biden protesters and representatives of Detroit Will Breathe, with at least three dozen police officers standing between them. At one point, police vehicles blasted their sirens nonstop for several minutes, a move some counter protesters claimed was an attempt to get them to disperse. Following protests over police violence this summer, the Detroit Police Department is currently under a temporary restraining order imposed by a federal judge, barring them from using certain violent tactics on protesters. Two young Detroit residents who said they had voted for Biden had showed up to the protest, and said they were frustrated at the false claims that the election was being stolen, but hopeful that Biden would be a good president. International election observers from Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, the Dominican Republic and Panama said they found the presidential campaign was \u201ccompetitive and quite aggressive, with one campaign, in particular, launching repeated attacks on its major rival as well as the integrity of the country\u2019s electoral system\u201d in a damning new report. \u201cThese attacks served to further divide an already highly polarized electorate and electoral process,\u201d said the report from the Organization of American States, a Washington-based group that has also provided analysis of often chaotic Latin American elections. The report also noted that Trump-allied \u201cstop the count\u201d demonstrators \u201cwere clear examples of intimidation of electoral officials\u201d. Read the report here. Denver Riggleman, a Republican congressman of Virginia, has said the far-right QAnon conspiracy movement \u201cmust be condemned by all political figures\u201d. Riggleman, who lost a Republican primary this year, will be leaving office. His primary opponent Bob Good, who identifies as a \u201cbiblical conservative\u201d and closely aligns with Donald Trump, has won the election to take Riggleman\u2019s seat in congress. One of Good\u2019s new colleagues will be Marjorie Taylor Greene, a supporter of the QAnon conspiracy theory. The White House has called a \u201clid\u201d - meaning that we\u2019re not expecting Donald Trump to deliver remarks tonight ... unless he changes his mind. We are expecting to hear from Joe Biden tonight, at 8pm ET, according to Axios. The Democratic candidate is poised at the brink of victory. Multiple news organizations have projected him the winner, though the Associated Press, which the Guardian relies on to declare election results, has yet to do so. Biden is expected to speak from Wilmington, Delaware, and Kamala Harris will introduce him, Axios reports. Ja\u2019Ron Smith, a top administration aide and the highest-ranking Black official at the White House, has left his post. This was a \u201cplanned departure from the White House\u201d, he said in a statement. But his move comes amid reports that several top aides are considering an exit as Donald Trump\u2019s chances of winning re-election dim. Smith served as deputy assistant to Trump and worked closely with the president\u2019s son-in-law Jared Kushner, including on a recent executive order aimed at reforming policing. Smith spoke at the Republican national convention earlier this year, saying he had seen Trump\u2019s \u201ctrue conscience\u201d. \u201cI can tell you \u2013 he really cares,\u201d Smith said at the time. \u201cBut, more importantly, he takes action.\u201d Smith said his decision comes as he\u2019s expecting twins and was made with the blessing of White House colleagues \u201clong before the election\u201d. First up, an update on Lindsey Graham \u2013 the Republican South Carolina senator who has become one of Donald Trump\u2019s most loyal allies. During a Zoom call with reporters, Graham said if Biden wins the presidency, he \u201cdeserves\u201d a cabinet. \u201cI\u2019ll give him my input about who I could vote for as secretary of state, attorney general,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThere may be some people that I just can\u2019t vote for because I think they\u2019re unqualified or too extreme.\u201d The senator, who won an expensive re-election race in South Carolina, is already positioning himself as a thorn in the Democrats\u2019 side. He told reporters he\u2019d oppose the Green New Deal \u2013 an ambitious climate action plan touted by progressive Democrats \u2013 and other progressive policies. Graham, who has worked with and known Biden for many years, said their personal relationship was \u201cgood\u201d. But he has remained committed to Trump. \u201cI\u2019m going to stand with president Trump,\u201d he said. Echoing the president\u2019s baseless claims of \u201celection irregularities\u201d, Graham said Trump and his campaign should be allowed to \u201cmake their case\u201d. So far, Trump and his lawyers have failed to substantiate allegations of irregularities in a series of legal actions seeking to halt vote counts. Hi there, it\u2019s Maanvi Singh \u2013 blogging from the west coast. I\u2019ll be bringing you elections updates, including the latest electoral math, throughout the evening. You can also find me on Twitter @maanvissingh. We\u2019re watching the vote count in Georgia closely. The latest batch of processed ballots in Gwinnett county has boosted Joe Biden up by 4,200 votes statewide. More ballots \u2013 including those from the military \u2013 are yet to be processed. And the Democratic candidate\u2019s lead is still close enough to trigger a recount. Stay tuned for more results. That\u2019s it from me today. I\u2019m handing the blog over to my Guardian colleague, Maanvi Singh, for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Joe Biden appears to be on the cusp of winning the presidency, as his leads over Donald Trump in Pennsylvania and Nevada have grown. But the AP has not yet declared a winner in the presidential race. Biden took the lead in Pennsylvania this morning, and it now stands at 14,541 votes. There are still about 200,000 outstanding ballots, but election analysts expect the Democratic nominee\u2019s lead in the state to continue to grow. Biden is expected to deliver an address to the nation this evening. However, it\u2019s unclear if the speech will be pushed back because the race has not yet been called. Georgia will hold a recount to settle the virtual tie between Biden and Trump in the state. As of now, Biden leads Trump by just 1,544 votes in the state, where about 5 million ballots were cast in the presidential race. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. As Donald Trump\u2019s reelection campaign tries to raise money for their lawsuits in battleground states, their persuasion tactics have turned from pleading to bullying, as this fundraising email demonstrates. It\u2019s also worth noting it appears that half of the money raised for the lawsuits will actually go toward paying down the Trump campaign\u2019s debt: Let\u2019s check in with Steve Bannon, Donald Trump\u2019s former adviser who is now facing fraud charges over allegations he misused money that was meant to help build a wall along the US-Mexican border. Bannon has now lost his lawyer in the fraud case after suggesting Dr Anthony Fauci, the government\u2019s top infectious disease expert, and FBI Director Christopher Wray should be beheaded. The Guardian\u2019s Peter Beaumont reports: Speaking on his podcast, the War Room, which was distributed in video form on a number of social media outlets, the far-right provocateur appeared to endorse violence against Wray and the US\u2019s most senior infectious diseases expert. \u2018Second term kicks off with firing Wray, firing Fauci \u2026 no I actually want to go a step farther but the president is a kind-hearted man and a good man,\u2019 Bannon said. \u2018I\u2019d actually like to go back to the old times of Tudor England. I\u2019d put their heads on pikes, right, I\u2019d put them at the two corners of the White House as a warning to federal bureaucrats, you either get with the programme or you\u2019re gone.\u2019 Twitter banned Bannon\u2019s War Room account permanently, saying it had suspended the podcast account for violating its policy on the glorification of violence. The same video was on Facebook for about 10 hours before it was also removed. Later on Friday, William Burck, an attorney for Bannon in a fraud case in New York City, told a federal judge he was withdrawing. Bannon is accused of misappropriating money from a group which raised $2m from thousands of donors to build a wall on the border with Mexico, and has pleaded not guilty. Burck did not give a reason for his withdrawal. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports from Philadelphia: The corner of 12th and Arch Street has become the epicenter of the political universe over the last few days as demonstrators have gathered to face off. The larger group has urged officials to \u201ccount every vote,\u201d while a smaller pro-Trump group has cheered to \u201cstop the steam.\u201d At times, it\u2019s felt a little tense as protesters have confronted one another and the anti-Trump crowd has drowned out pro-Trump surrogates like Pam Bondi and Corey Lewandowski. But on Friday the intersection had a notably different tone - the \u201ccount every vote\u201d group essentially transformed into a large dance party. The celebration came as Joe Biden took a lead in the count for ballots in this key swing state. \u201cIt feels great to finally celebrate something,\u201d said Ann Dixon, who said she hasn\u2019t been following the incremental changes in vote totals because she wants \u201cevery vote to be counted and it\u2019s not over til its over.\u201d She said she was concerned, however, that Trump would try and drag out the vote count, which would divide the country more and more. Protesters young and old danced to a mix of music, which included Beyonc\u00e9, the Backstreet Boys, and Shakira. \u201cI sort of debated whether or not I should come out and then I decided I should. It\u2019s important to sort of celebrate despite having a bunch of work to still do moving forward,\u201d said Rachel MacDonald. \u201cI\u2019m not really motivated by anger in the same way and so I decided I should come out and dance with everybody as well and not just yell,\u201d She was there with her friend Hannah Chervitz, who was attending her first protest. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to come out and channel all of this energy into something positive,\u201d Chervitz said. MSNBC\u2019s Steve Kornacki explained why his network, like the AP, has not yet called Pennsylvania for Joe Biden. Kornacki explained that there are about 200,000 ballots left to be counted in the state. About half of them are mail-in ballots, and half of them are provisional ballots. Mail-in ballots in Pennsylvania have been very favorable for Biden, as it appears most of Donald Trump\u2019s supporters chose to vote in person. But some of those ballots may still be challenged. Historically, provisional ballots are also very favorable for Democrats, but so far, they have been a bit better for Trump. One explanation for this is that some of the president\u2019s supporters received mail-in ballots but then chose to vote in person instead, so they received provisional ballots to allow election officials to confirm the vote was valid. But election analyst Nate Silver said he was skeptical of that analysis: A Republican congressman is engaging in a Twitter battle with one of his new colleagues, Marjorie Taylor Greene, who is a supporter of the far-right QAnon conspiracy theory. It all started when congressman Dan Crenshaw, a Republican of Texas, sent a tweet this afternoon, saying, \u201cIf Trump loses, he loses. It was never an impossible outcome and we must accept the final results when it is over. \u201cBut the unfortunate reality is that there is very little trust in the process, where irregularities have been flagrant and transparency lacking.\u201d That second sentence looks past the fact that Donald Trump has worked diligently to sow distrust in the election results, and the president\u2019s advisers have been allowed to view the vote count in multiple battleground states. But we\u2019ll set that aside for a second. After Crenshaw sent that tweet, Greene, who is now a congresswoman-elect after winning her congressional race on Tuesday, replied, \u201cThe time to STAND UP for @realDonaldTrump is RIGHT NOW! Republicans can\u2019t back down. This loser mindset is how the Democrats win.\u201d Crenshaw responded by chastising Greene and urging her to live up to the office she has been elected to. \u201cI literally said investigate every irregularity and use the courts,\u201d Crenshaw said. \u201cYou\u2019re a member of Congress now, Marjorie. Start acting like one.\u201d That dust-up could preview some of the contentious conversations to come in the House Republican caucus once Greene is seated in January. The Guardian\u2019s Tom Phillips reports from Rio de Janeiro: It is a US-born slur that was inspired by Honduras and has haunted Latin America for decades \u2013 a deprecatory way to describe politically volatile and economically puny backwaters ruled by erratic and venal autocrats. But on Friday, after Donald Trump\u2019s alarming press conference at the White House yesterday, voices across the region, from Mexico to Uruguay, delighted in lobbing the insult back at their neighbours to the north. \u201cWho\u2019s the banana republic now?\u201d wondered the frontpage headline of Colombia\u2019s Publimetro, one of many Latin American newspapers whose editors thought the term perfectly captured the electoral turmoil playing out in the US. Over the border in Venezuela, a columnist from the El Nacional agreed calling Trump\u2019s behaviour \u201cintemperate and foolish\u201d and telling readers the US election seemed to be taking place \u201cin a country at war, or a rep\u00fablica bananera\u201d. Merval Pereira, one of Brazil\u2019s most prominent political commentators, called his daily column \u201cBananas americanas\u201d and wrote: \u201cThis is a singular event in US democratic history which puts the country in the list of banana republics, an expression created by the Americans themselves.\u201d The Latin American Twittersphere went bananas too, with the Uruguayan human rights defender Javier Palummo asking followers: \u201cHow do you say banana republic in American English?\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Tom Phillips reports from Rio de Janeiro: One of Donald Trump\u2019s most devoted international disciples, the Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro, now seems to be decoupling from his political idol. Bolsonaro has been one of Trump\u2019s loudest cheerleaders and revels in being portrayed as South America\u2019s \u201ctropical Trump\u201d. Last year Brazil\u2019s far-right leader was reported to have told his fellow populist: \u201cI love you\u201d. But on Friday morning, with a Trump defeat looking increasingly likely, Bolsonaro appeared to jump ship. \u201cI\u2019m not the most important person in Brazil just as Trump isn\u2019t the most important person in the world, as he\u2019s said himself,\u201d he told an event in southern Brazil. \u201cThe most important person is God.\u201d To hammer his point home Bolsonaro later posted a video of those comments to his Twitter feed, where he has 6.6 million followers. Despite Bolsonaro\u2019s admiration for Trump, the US president is reportedly not one of them. Brad Raffensperger, Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, held another press conference as the margin in the race for his state\u2019s 16 electoral votes remains razor-thin. \u201cWe will get it right, and we will defend the integrity of our elections,\u201d Raffensperger said, promising an \u201copen and transparent\u201d vote-counting process. Raffensperger once again acknowledged that, with a margin this small, a recount was all but certain in the state. The Republican official defended the integrity of the vote-count, saying he was committed to ensuring trust in the process. As of now, Joe Biden leads Donald Trump by 1,603 votes in Georgia, out of nearly 5 million ballots cast in the state. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levin reports from Los Angeles: Jackie Lacey, the Los Angeles district attorney, was ousted by her progressive challenger, in one of the most closely watched criminal justice races in the US this year. George Gasc\u00f3n, the former police chief and district attorney of San Francisco, won the race to lead the Los Angeles prosecutors\u2019 office with more than 53% of the vote. Black Lives Matter LA and other activist groups played a major role in the heated contest, having protested Lacey\u2019s policies for years. An emotional Lacey conceded the race Friday, thanking her family and her supporters. Lacey was the first woman and first African American to serve as the Los Angeles DA. In her second term, Lacey faced intensifying scrutiny over her refusal to prosecute police officers who kill, her close ties with law enforcement unions and her continued use of the death penalty. Gasc\u00f3n, who was endorsed by political heavyweights such as Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders, is part of a wave of liberal, reform-minded DA candidates across the US who have pledged to undo some of the harms and racial inequities of policing and prisons. BLM and other activist groups have increasingly put pressure on elected district attorneys, who are some of the most influential and least accountable players in the US criminal justice system. Joe Gloria, the Clark county registrar of voters, has said the Nevada county will post the results of another batch of ballots in about four hours. Joe Biden currently leads in Nevada by 20,137 votes, but the AP has not yet called the race because of the outstanding mail-in and provisional ballots. Gloria previously said there are about 63,000 mail-in ballots and 60,000 provisional ballots left to be processed. Given Biden\u2019s advantage in Clark county, the additional updates will likely help him build upon his lead in Nevada. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports from Philadelphia: A day after Donald Trump leveled baseless claims about the election from a White House lectern, it was clear that his supporters standing outside the Pennsylvania convention center, where workers are counting ballots, heard him clearly. Chanting \u201clet us see the vote,\u201d many in the group repeatedly said that Republicans were not being allowed inside the convention center, an untrue claim Trump made Thursday. \u201cWe\u2019re here for the millions of Americans who stood in line for hours to cast non absent votes for the president and who are being disenfranchised right now behind me by people who will not let us legally watch, who are keeping the poll watchers and the candidates 20 feet away. You cannot see anything,\u201d said Joanne Young, a protester. Observers from both parties have been allowed in. The Trump campaign secured a court order on Thursday requiring local election officials to allow observers to get up to six feet closer to observe the process. A Trump campaign attorney conceded in federal court that the party had observers inside the hall. A woman who would only give her first name, Kathy, said that it was obvious Democrats were cheating because vote totals were consistently being added to Joe Biden\u2019s vote totals. The reason that\u2019s happening is because Democrats overwhelmingly voted by mail-in ballot, which take longer to count, while Trump supporters voted in person. Kathy also said that Trump had watermarked all of the ballots and all the fake ones would come out this week. Such a watermark would be impossible - elections in the United States are run by the states at the local level. The president has no access to ballots or role in administering elections. Valerie Fiorinno said she had observed the mail-in process and believed there were many ways to cheat. Election officials and voters closely track and verify ballots. \u201cI will never see him as legitimately elected,\u201d she said of Joe Biden. House Democrats have picked up their first major win of this election cycle, a rather remarkable statement given Democrats expected to build upon their majority in the chamber by at least a dozen seats or so. The AP has just declared Democratic candidate Carolyn Bourdeaux to be the winner in Georgia\u2019s 7th congressional district, which is currently represented by retiring Republican Rob Woodall. Bourdeaux\u2019s win represents the third seat Democrats have flipped, but the two others were largely thanks to redistricting in North Carolina. Meanwhile, Republicans have defeated several freshman House Democrats in vulnerable districts and are looking at a net gain of about five seats in the chamber. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports from Philadelphia: The area outside the Pennsylvania convention center has essentially become a massive dance party, with protesters holding \u201ccount every vote\u201d signs and getting down to blasting tracks Beyonc\u00e9 and others. There\u2019s a moderately sized pro-Trump crowd across the street, waving Trump 2020 flags and cheering \u201cshow us the vote.\u201d The Trump campaign has said they\u2019re not being allowed meaningful access to vote-counting inside, even though the campaign does have observers in the hall where votes are being counted and there is a 24 hour live stream. It\u2019s the second day crowds have gathered here as workers continue to count ballots inside. But the mood is noticeably different - it\u2019s much more jubilant today than it was on Wednesday or Thursday when protesters were more confrontational. Joe Biden overtook Trump\u2019s lead in this key swing state earlier today. The Guardian\u2019s Nina Lakhani reports from Pennsylvania: Joe Biden currently has a 19-point lead in Allegheny county, the state\u2019s second-most populous county that\u2019s home to Pittsburgh. Donald Trump has so far picked up about 10,000 more votes than in 2016, whereas Biden has more than 34,000 more than Hillary Clinton managed four years ago. Much to everyone\u2019s frustration, especially mine, the county suspended counting yesterday due to a pending lawsuit. They hope to get through their outstanding 37,000 ballots by the end of today, inshallah. On CNN, county executive Rich Fitzgerald has just reminded us that the only reason we are still waiting for Pennsylvania to finish counting is because the Republican-controlled legislature refused to allow mail-in ballots to be opened until 7am on election day. Biden currently leads by 13,220 votes in Pennsylvania, and that lead is expected to grow as more ballots are processed. Joe Biden appears to be on the brink of victory in the US presidential election, as the Democratic nominee grows his leads in Pennsylvania and Nevada. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: Biden now leads Donald Trump by 13,220 votes in Pennsylvania, but the AP has not yet declared a winner in the state. Biden is clearly intending to declare victory, with plans to deliver a primetime address tonight. Georgia will hold a recount to settle the virtual tie between Biden and Trump in the state. As of now, Biden leads Trump by just 1,558 votes in the state, where about 5 million ballots were cast in the presidential race. Biden\u2019s lead in Nevada grew to 20,137 votes, following an update from Clark county, where Las Vegas is located. But the AP has not yet called that state either, and a Clark county official said today that counting would continue through the weekend."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
