But desk work and low staffing keep me off it'", "bodyText": "[This article was excerpted in the Guardian of November 5 2002] A particular aspect of the BBC's recent series on crime and jurisprudence chimed with my experience working the streets as a police officer: that was the belief by members of the public that they know policing better than we do ourselves. On countless occasions I've been dealing with an incident, or with an offender, to be told: \"Why don't you go and do some real work?\" Often this is followed by a suggestion and I and my colleagues depart en masse to tackle the criminal stories featuring on the news. The problem with open debate about policing is that everyone has different priorities, concerns and desires for the time of the police. Reactions I've encountered to changes Surrey's policing methods illustrate this. In January this year the chief constable, Dennis O'Connor, radically reformed our system. What had been a very wide remit to respond to every sort of event was scaled back, with the aim of improving the results on targeted police priorities. Many core policing practices changed under the new system, initiated for two reasons: to make more of our work intelligence-driven, and to reduce wasteful demands on police time. One of the methods chosen to reduce the overall demands was to be more selective about what officers attend and, if they are to attend, to be educated in determining priorities. People did not understand, however, that not attending abandoned cars freed up time for us to deal with real crime. Time is what ails all of us, and quite a bit of this I put down to government policies affecting grassroots policing. The old sweats in the police station all recall the days when there were real numbers of police officers. The government states that police staff numbers are at their highest and that paperwork will be cut. Unfortunately we, the uniformed police officers, do not see any of this. On paper the shifts are running at eight to 10 PCs, yet in one week recently there were just two of us - and that wasn't a one-off: shifts running on minimum staffing are an everyday reality. If sickness, leave, courses, probationers away at training school and officers seconded to work on major incidents are taken out of the equation, there are not many PCs to go around. Given the small numbers, I am lucky if I can leave the office, other than to take statements. The public want more officers on the beat, which I fully support and would love to be one of them. I also think think Surrey as a small force does really well and I love policing here. But I am bound to my paperwork - like the ankle tag that our local car thief wears. I know the names and faces of all the local criminals and I would love to be out on patrol looking for them, making them check over their shoulders. But they know, as well as I do, that I won't be there because it just takes one teenage shoplifter to plead innocence to glue me to the station for a whole shift. Am I, your readers might ask, a slow writer? No, not particularly. I am hindered by the financial incentive that the law gives to legal firms to promote their clients' innocence in the face of irrefutable evidence. When a suspect is given the opportunity to give their side of the story in interview (after their arrest for an alleged offence), they are often instructed by their \"free\" (not to the taxpayer) legal representative to respond, \"no comment\". This means effectively that they denying being the person involved in the crime. We are then obliged to offer them an identity parade, which starts with a police inspector attending custody to explain the ID procedure and ask their consent. If they agree, they will be bailed for a date, suitable with one of Surrey's two ID suites, and return once it has all been organised. The ID procedure involves taking two officers from shift to escort the witnesses to the suite (so they do not bump into the suspect). There is an ID inspector and his police officer assistant who run the parade, and there is the officer in charge of the case, who will normally wait to deal with the suspect, pending the outcome of the parade. The actors who fill the line all have to be paid for their time. In all, an easy ID (where similar actors are easily found) will cost about \u00a3500; a complicated one can rise to \u00a3900 - and the police are not reimbursed even if the suspect is later found guilty. You can have a case where a shoplifter is caught on CCTV committing the crime but is advised to state \"no comment\" by a solicitor on the free duty scheme. The lawyer or his firm will be paid throughout the identity procedure, the charging procedure and the court proceedings. Another reason the suspect will have done his best to avoid pleading guilty, even in the face of the film evidence, is that this will entail a higher penalty. And while client and lawyer are milking the system, yet another police officer is kept away from patrolling: that is, the officer who prepares the more detailed file required when someone is taken to court on a not-guilty plea. As to other current issues affecting the police service, here are my views. Civilianisation is a good thing if the training is right. The majority of posts in our communication network are staffed by civilians and they have real problems predicting the desires of the police officers on the ground. This could easily be corrected with a couple of shifts spent on patrol with us. When we go to a serious incident we are forced to ask for dog units or the helicopter, causing delays and diverting our attention. On the other hand, there are jobs we currently do that could be completed by civilians. The files we complete to take someone to court are logical and systematical and could easily be written out by a civilian, allowing officers to be on patrol. As for plans for priority payments for certain posts - they are a different way of recruiting police staff to less desirable positions, but I think police officers question whether it is not just a cop-out for paying all police officers the money we require to live. Someone should be asking why those positions are not being filled, is it really about money? Is it any wonder that the armed response teams are always seeking staff, when you could be strung up for murder by the force that trained you? Driving is another risky area. The response driving instructors teach that you can go through red traffic lights as long as you have reduced your speed, selected first gear and proceeded with caution. This does not protect you or your driving licence in the event of an accident. There is precious little support from the service and the management. If you make an error the police service takes pride in drawing as much blood out of you as possible, all in the public interest of course. - Stuart Duguid has been with Surrey Police at Guildford for three years.
