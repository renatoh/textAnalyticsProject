Undone by Wayne Rooney\u2019s first-half goal, Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s suddenly unsteady side were heading for a seventh defeat in eight games. This latest reverse featured some improved performances but Newcastle have now taken only one point from a possible 24 and Ben\u00edtez clearly did not relish the smile which adorned Sam Allardyce\u2019s face at the final whistle. By way of exacerbating the Spaniard\u2019s problems, the recalled Jonjo Shelvey once again failed to merit his manager\u2019s trust. Shelvey\u2019s enduring lack of judgment seemed highlighted when he was sent off for a bad tackle on Idrissa Gueye in the 94th minute which resulted in his second yellow card of the night. Ben\u00edtez was suitably disappointed. \u201cWe had the game under control but we made a mistake and then the way Everton were wasting time at the end made things really difficult,\u201d he said. \u201cWe worked so hard and it\u2019s upsetting but we all, including me, have to take responsibility.\u201d In contrast Allardyce presided over Everton\u2019s first away win in the league since January. \u201cA defensive performance which kept Newcastle pretty quiet pleases me very much,\u201d said Ronald Koeman\u2019s successor, whose presence seems to have instantly improved fortunes at Goodison Park. \u201cWe move onwards and upwards.\u201d Ironically, Newcastle\u2019s day had begun on a rare high. The pre-match news that Mike Ashley and Amanda Staveley are close to agreeing a price for the sale of the club ahead of a potential takeover being completed at some point in January or February certainly created an air of buoyancy in the stands. Flattering to deceive, Ben\u00edtez\u2019s players began in similarly upbeat mode. As Everton struggled to assume possession, let alone string a few passes together, and Newcastle parked their tanks in Allardyce\u2019s penalty area, home fears of a looming relegation battle temporarily appeared overblown. Given his long-standing personal rivalry with Ben\u00edtez \u2013 not to mention the small matter of an unhappy eight months in charge here during 2007 and 2008 \u2013 this was one fixture Everton\u2019s manager was particularly keen to win, though. If Allardyce\u2019s increasingly intense technical area gum chewing suggested a degree of early concern, he was not about to panic. For all Newcastle\u2019s huffing and puffing, the excellent Jordan Pickford was rarely troubled and, almost imperceptibly, Everton began both seeing more of the ball and using it fairly sensibly. They weathered an odd scare \u2013 most notably when a counterattacking, thoroughly rejuvenated Matt Ritchie hit a post with a blistering left-foot shot \u2013 but took the lead after Rooney capitalised on Karl Darlow\u2019s goalkeeping error. Minutes earlier an unmarked Dominic Calvert-Lewin had been unable to quite connect with Gylfi Sigurdsson\u2019s inviting cross but the striker redeemed himself by crossing for Aaron Lennon to test Darlow\u2019s reflexes with a header. The goalkeeper touched the ball and should have held it but instead saw it slip tantalisingly from his grasp, permitting Rooney to slide in, stretch out his right foot and stab home from point-blank range. It was Rooney\u2019s 15th Premier League goal against his favourite opponents. Newcastle should have equalised when Mikel Merino unleashed a fabulous left-foot shot which rebounded off the inside of a post but, generally, Everton\u2019s off-ball positioning restricted Ben\u00edtez\u2019s side to half chances. The Tynesiders were playing considerably better than in recent weeks but although Mason Holgate was forced to scoop Merino\u2019s goal-bound shot to safety they could not sustain a ferocious early second half tempo. After reverting to a single striker system at kick off, Ben\u00edtez replaced Mo Diame with Joselu but Everton subsequently came closer to scoring when Darlow did well to turn Ashley Williams\u2019s header round a post following Sigurdsson\u2019s fine delivery. With Everton\u2019s impressive left-back Cuco Martina largely nullifying Christian Atsu\u2019s pacy right-sided threat and the substitute Nikola Vlasic proving highly effective at knitting visiting counterattacks together, Newcastle started to run out of ideas as their guests increasingly killed time. Then Shelvey got his marching orders. \u201cI\u2019m pretty pleased,\u201d said Allardyce. \u201cWe\u2019re rolling forward.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
