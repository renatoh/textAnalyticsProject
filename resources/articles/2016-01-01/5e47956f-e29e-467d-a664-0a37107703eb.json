It seeped into the very fabric of our community. Almost two weeks on, people are still ashen faced and speaking in half sentences, because the flood is at the forefront of everyone\u2019s minds, whether our homes or businesses were hit or not. Of course, we can\u2019t ignore the wreckage that greets us at the beginning of each day and seems just a little bit better each night. Homes are slowly being cleared, utilities fixed and the traffic, once seemingly at a permanent standstill for safety reasons, has started moving again. I cheer internally each time I find out that another business has reopened, which takes the sting off the general bad news, but only just. We have a barber again (but no hairdressers; some have temporarily merged and one was forced to move away) and a cafe (but a whole row of businesses is still closed). The schools and nurseries that were affected have made alternative arrangements, but the community centre, once a hive of activity, was completely gutted, down to its very last sodden floorboard. Every day, too, we hear more horror stories. People are finally being allowed to return to their stinking, flooded properties that their holidaying insurers insisted on seeing for themselves. They\u2019re desperate for help, but many of the hordes of volunteer helpers, including me, have had to go back to work and can only watch in dismay until the weekend. Some of my friends simply can\u2019t bear to leave their houses; one of them dubbing her new aversion to the outdoors \u201cflooduenza\u201d. Joking aside, it\u2019s certainly hard to stomach. The silt-covered contents of people\u2019s homes, Christmas trees included, have gone from the pavements now, but we\u2019re still faced with a ragged gap where the travel agent once was, like a missing tooth in a rotten row. Personally, I can\u2019t bear to return the borrowed library book that I unwittingly kept safe and dry."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
