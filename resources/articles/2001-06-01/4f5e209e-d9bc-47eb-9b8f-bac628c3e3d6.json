All the sites here offer online booking; those that don't, including NatWest and Barclays, were excluded from the survey. Obviously, the level of cover varies between companies, but I was looking for a quote for two weeks' insurance in the US in July for a 30-year-old with no pre-existing medical conditions. Screentrade \u00a323.80 Screentrade harvests quotes from a number of insurers, some of them relatively obscure, and promises to match the price of any identical deal that you find more cheaply elsewhere. You'll have to supply your name, address and e-mail before receiving a quote, which is unnecessary and intrusive - even though you can lie. If any insurer can tell me how your home address affects your travel insurance risk, I'd be interested to hear from them. Columbus Direct \u00a329.40 A rapid and efficient service although if you've taken any prescribed medicines (apart from the Pill) in the past year, you won't be able to book online. Columbus offers a range of different quotes, depending on how comprehensive you want the cover to be; this was the lowest. Eagle Star \u00a353.95 Provides exceptionally rapid quotes for under-65s. Trailfinders \u00a357 Easy-to-follow, logical quotations and booking processes. Endsleigh \u00a337.50 Endsleigh specialises in student insurance, but offers travel cover to anyone, and scores highly for the simplicity of its explanations. Two levels of cover are available. The site asks for your address and occupation, but it gave identical quotes for both a secretary and a journalist. STA \u00a335 STA - which also offers backpackers' policies - will usually cover medical treatment for unforeseen attacks of asthma or diabetes. GoSure \u00a326.90 A cheerful operation under written by Norwich Union. You can lower the cost of cover to \u00a313.45 if you only want medical or repatriation cover, or raise it to \u00a331.71 for an excess waiver. Special golf policies (in case you lose your clubs or the green is closed) are available. American Express In the mistaken belief that I had kept a page open for longer than 15 minutes, American Express repeatedly deleted all my details and told me to start again. Lloyds TSB InsureDirect More annoying technical difficulties: the site told me to enter numeric values when I was already doing so, then replaced them with its own choice of dates. Halifax \u00a355.55 Halifax operates a discount scheme with various package holiday companies, and specialises in wedding cover. OTC \u00a339.95 The Online Travel Company offers the best deal of all: year-round, worldwide travel insurance for trips of less than a month at \u00a339.95. It doesn't cover delays or missed departures, but does include third-party liability, baggage and medical expenses."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
