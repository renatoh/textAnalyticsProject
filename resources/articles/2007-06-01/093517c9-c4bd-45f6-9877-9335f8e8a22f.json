The former Widnes, Warrington, Wigan and Great Britain scrum-half will take his first training session today ahead of a home game against Barrow at Fylde rugby union club on Sunday, when the Panthers aim to end a run of 25 matches without a win that goes back to last July. \"Andy's going to bring a bit more hope and optimism, which we desperately need,\" the Blackpool chairman, John Chadwick, said. \"Quite frankly we were beginning to fear that we could go through the season without winning a fixture. Obviously our playing strength is not the greatest, but Andy is already looking to bring in new blood, and he'll be a breath of fresh air for everyone at the club.\" Gregory moved into coaching with Salford in 1995 and helped to establish them in the Super League within two years. But he and the club parted ways in 1999 and Gregory wrote candidly of his battle to control a drinking problem in his 2000 autobiography, Pint Size. \"I know he's been out of the game for a long time, but he's still one of the most recognisable characters,\" Chadwick said. In Australia, Wendell Sailor is also heading back to rugby league after a lengthy absence. Sailor, who is more than halfway through a two-year ban which ended his rugby union career after he tested positive for cocaine, has reportedly agreed terms for next season with St George Illawarra Dragons who plan to play the former Brisbane Broncos wing in the second row. Sailor's team-mates will include Jason Ryles, an international prop who signed a new three-year contract yesterday after being dissuaded from a move to Wigan by Andrew Farrar, the former Warriors centre and assistant coach. However, Hull hope to sign the Dragons scrum-half Mathew Head for the rest of this season to provide the direction they have lacked since Paul Cooke's move to Hull Kingston Rovers. Hull's coach, Peter Sharp, is also hoping that Shaun Berrigan, another Australian who will join the club on a four-year contract next season, can persuade his Brisbane team-mate Petero Civoniceva to follow him. Civoniceva, who has made 18 State of Origin appearances for Queensland and played in 29 Tests, has had his latest contract offer from the Broncos withdrawn, suggesting that they expect the 31-year-old prop to come to England."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
