This was where the brash real estate mogul had ruled a roost of sorts, as the chippy property scion from the outer borough of Queens who inherited, borrowed and bullied his way to fame and fortune \u2013 with a reputation for stiffing contractors, courting the media like a celebrity, and swaggering around like a mob boss. Trump Tower was also where he had descended, riding his ostentatious golden escalator, to announce his 2016 bid to become president. And it was also where he boasted during that campaign that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and he wouldn\u2019t lose any votes \u2013 but his luck had run out on Saturday as news broke he would be a one-term president. Uptown in the majority Black neighborhood of Harlem, the cries were even less polite than in midtown. \u201cFuck you, Donald Trump,\u201d a crowd chanted, over and over, at a pop-up demonstration that closed a short stretch of Broadway, while the police looked on without making attempts to stop the outpouring of emotion. The crowd danced, cheered, sprayed champagne, honked horns and, of course, took selfies and video clips. As soon as the news had broken mid-morning, the neighborhood erupted in cheering and the kind of banging of pots and pans that echoes for blocks, and was most recently heard every evening to honor healthcare workers in the pandemic. Alan Mingo, a Broadway and film actor who has lived in the Sugar Hill part of Harlem for 17 years, had tears in his eyes as he strode along frantically texting with friends. \u201cSeeing this euphoria, this jubilation, it\u2019s incredible,\u201d he said. He said he was shaken out of half-sleep by the eruption on the streets and passed people exclaiming how their vote had mattered. Mingo said his own identity as a gay, Black man added to his celebrations. He said that Donald Trump inflicted pain \u201con Black and brown people, not just with his rhetoric, but when he started separating children [from their parents as they migrated across the US-Mexico border] that had echoes of so many bad things from our history\u201d. He added that he was very proud that Kamala Harris would become the first female vice-president. Moments later, Chase Rivera came pedaling up the street on a Citi Bike at top speed, dinging its bell and whooping loudly to no one and everyone. He skidded to a halt when the Guardian flagged him down and, sweating in the late fall sunshine into his Black Lives Matter T-shirt, the 25-year-old said: \u201cWe were on our way to a dictatorship [with Trump].\u201d He added: \u201cThis is the happiest I\u2019ve seen people in 2020.\u201d A native New Yorker, Rivera said he was a laboratory scientist and looked forward to a president who once again respected science. \u201cLet\u2019s hear it for science,\u201d he said. \u201cBiden and Harris have already spoken on the coronavirus and we need to get to grips with it. Then I\u2019m very excited for the Green New Deal, and that we will be part of the Paris climate accord again and take action on the climate crisis.\u201d New York City had voted overwhelmingly for Joe Biden, with the exception of the more conservative, working-class borough of Staten Island, just beyond the Statue of Liberty, which stuck with Trump. Back downtown in Manhattan, near Trump Tower, among those cheering Biden\u2019s win was a man holding what appeared to be a hastily prepared \u201cYou\u2019re fired\u201d sign, and another man in a rainbow outfit and shaggy blond wig danced to the Wizard of Oz song Ding-Dong! The Witch Is Dead. Always busy with traffic \u2013 except at the height of the pandemic lockdown in the city in March and April \u2013 Fifth Avenue had erupted with hollering and drivers honking their horns and flashing their headlights, some with Stars and Stripes flags sticking out of the window. Colette Poncet, a New York University student and one of the many who poured on to the street near Trump Tower, had been sleeping late and woke to news that Biden had won. \u201cI screamed and I woke my roommate up,\u201d said Poncet, who voted for the first time in this election. Poncet described the news as a \u201cbig relief\u201d and was \u201calso very excited. Hope is restored.\u201d Poncet was also excited about Harris\u2019s win as vice-president-elect. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing, as a woman, Hillary Clinton was the closest you ever came, and she didn\u2019t win,\u201d she said. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s not the full progress, but it\u2019s very empowering.\u201d The New York City native also said: \u2018\u201cI\u2019ve never seen it this alive, and I\u2019ve lived here my entire life.\u201d The headline in the Queens Daily Eagle in Trump\u2019s childhood borough, where his early childhood was spent in a modest, mock-Tudor home in the suburban Jamaica neighborhood was \u201cQueens man evicted\u201d. With a wry tone, the news outlet reported: \u201cA 74-year-old Jamaica Estates developer has less than three months left at his current address after Americans overwhelmingly voted him out of the White House.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
