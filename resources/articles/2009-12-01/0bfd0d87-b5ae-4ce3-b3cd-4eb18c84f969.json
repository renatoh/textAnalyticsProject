But he may have lost a few of his harder-core fans at the weekend, when he adopted a distinctly softer tone, lauded the positive progress of the talks and even cracked a few jokes. \"I am trying to be humorous and nice to improve the ambience in this press room,\" he told reporters. More surprising still, he said the huge public protest might be considered \"constructive, as it shows the interest of the general public in climate change.\" Just as the audience started to ponder how this approval of demonstrations might apply in Beijing, Su reverted to the party line: \"But you can also say they disrupt the negotiations and the freedom of other people.\" Cynics may claim that negotiators have failed to make sufficient progress at Copenhagen, but insiders respond with a one-word rebuttal: \"Brackets.\" Speckled prominently throughout the draft texts like an itchy rash, the brackets contain different proposals for dates, emissions and sums of money. Essentially, they are niggle marks. But the good news is the size and frequency that they appear has been reduced. More important still, they have changed shape since the earliest days of discussions. \"We are now using square brackets, which signify something solid, instead of squiggley brackets, which were far less substantial,\" explained one insider. That's all right then. The world may be going to pot, but at least we have some chunky punctuation marks to signify our divisions. If there is one man in Copenhagen who has a good excuse to welcome global warming it is Jorgen Manniche. The 69-year-old has spent most of the last decade in a peace protest outside the Danish parliament, despite wind, rain and temperatures that plunge below minus 15C. Stirred to action by the war in Iraq, he has now broadened his focus to include the security threat posed by climate change. His displays include images of Copenhagen's Little Mermaid and New York's Statue of Liberty about to be engulfed by a tsunami. But, as bitter winds cut across the central square, he admits to a selfish wish for a personal change of climate. \"This is a tough life for me, especially in heavy rain or snow,\" he says. \"A little more warmth would be nice.\" But then, ever the idealist, he adds: \"But I only wish for local warming. I know that in the world, people are dying from heat.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
