The report by the Commons public accounts committee says the agency, set up in 2001 to encourage the reporting of mistakes by healthcare staff, has so far has been unimpressive. In one year, NHS staff reported nearly a million incidents in which patients were harmed or where there was a near-miss. Yet trusts estimate that around 22% of errors - mainly involving people being given the wrong drug or wrong dose or incidents that have led to serious harm - go unreported. The committee chairman, Edward Leigh, said: \"The NHS simply has no idea how many people die each year from patient safety incidents.\" The agency said it had acted on a number of issues in the report, but added: \"We agree that more needs to be achieved to secure even safer healthcare in the NHS.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
