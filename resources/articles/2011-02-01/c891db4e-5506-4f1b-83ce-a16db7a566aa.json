Time Out: S\u00e3o Paulo reported on the 38-year-old's ongoing attempt to reach 100 career goals \u2013 quite a feat for a goalkeeper. A penalty and free-kick specialist, Ceni scored his 98th goal last Sunday in a 3-2 win against Portuguesa, and has long since overtaken the most famous goalscoring keeper, the Paraguay international Jos\u00e9 Luis Chilavert, who retired on 62 goals. Ceni's best season was in 2005, when he scored an impressive 21. He hit eight last season and has struck three this year. He's only got egg on his face once, in a 4-3 win against Fluminense in 2002. While he was celebrating scoring a penalty, Fluminense took a quick restart and lobbed him from the halfway line. Arsenal were linked with Ceni in 2001 but nothing came of it, so Ceni remained at S\u00e3o Paulo, earning 17 Brazil caps and playing more games than anyone else in the history of the Brasileir\u00e3o (Brazil's top league) \u2013 with 950 appearances to his name.

Sweden: Handball director sacked after Eurovision race slur \"To think that I am a racist is sick, it is just some journalist who is looking for a story,\" complained the marketing director of the Swedish handball club H43, Ulf Mohlin Fagerstrom, after Swedish media highlighted some of his comments on Facebook. Judge for yourself. Here's what Mohlin Fagerstrom wrote about the black Swedish-American entrant to the Swedish Eurovision Song Contest: \"Time to emigrate.
