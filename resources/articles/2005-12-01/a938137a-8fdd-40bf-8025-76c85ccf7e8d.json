She is vegan and keen to interact with local people, and might be travelling alone. She is also keen on train journeys and visiting forested areas. Are there any reasonably priced tours you could recommend? Jim Millman, by email South India is a large and diverse region and your mother should think about picking one area. Kerala offers a wonderful mix of beaches at Varkala and Kovalam, temples and a relaxed atmosphere. Periyar Wildlife Sanctuary and the forested hills of Udhagamandalam (aka Ooty) are within reach of Kerala's southern bases. TransIndus (020 8566 2729; www.transindus.co.uk) runs nine-day tours of Kerala costing from \u00a31,189 including flights. Alternatively, with Mumbai as a base, the coast can be explored as far as Goa, or inland to Bangalore via spectacular caves and historic towns such as Bijapur and Hampi. It's easy to combine the two and travel round by train, which is a great way to meet locals. Cox and Kings (020 7873 5000; www.coxandkings.co.uk) can arrange itineraries. My partner and I are hoping to travel to Livingstone, Zambia, for a few days. Having sought Foreign Office travel advice, it is clear that going to areas of Zambia bordering the Democratic Republic of Congo or Angola isn't a good idea, but we cannot find any information on how safe we would be in Livingstone. If we decide to go to Livingstone, how long would you suggest we spend there and is there anywhere in the surrounding area we should be sure not to miss? Emily Bird, London While you're right to give the Angolan and Congolese border areas of Zambia a wide berth, you should encounter no problems in Livingstone, the gateway town for the Victoria Falls. While the Falls are the obvious attraction and can be seen close-up at the Mosi-oa-Tunya National Park there is plenty more to do here. Bungee-jumping, abseiling, helicopter flights and river running are all popular things to do here. I would recommend taking three days - one at the falls, one on a wildlife drive and one scaring yourself senseless. I'm travelling to Nepal, north India and Sri Lanka. I want to be able to phone my son who will be my travelling companion on and off. At present Orange is my provider. Should I change my provider here before I go or will it be reasonably cheap to buy a sim card of some sort when I get there? Christy Cruft, by email As you can see from Orange's website (www.orange.co.uk) you can use your UK phone in India and Sri Lanka, with good coverage. You'll be able to use your phone in most places. Make sure your mobile account is enabled to roam. Roaming on a UK mobile is expensive, but worthwhile if you're only going to text or make infrequent, short calls. This will mean no need to buy sim cards. If you will be speaking more often then get a sim card - these are easy to pick up in major towns. I am leading a group of eight over-fifties to Estonia next August. We come from England and Ireland. We would like to make a trip to St Petersburg and plan to stay in a youth hostel there. Do we need to book in advance? How do we get a Russian visa? Are there any tours we can book when we are in St Petersburg? And how can we spice up our holiday? Barbara O'Driscoll It's always a good idea to book accommodation in advance. The HI St Petersburg Hostel (www.ryh.ru) is comfortable and can also help with visa support letters. A smaller hostel you might try is the quiet Sleep Cheap (www.sleepcheap.spb.ru) in a courtyard in the Smolny area. Readers recommend Peter's Walking Tours (www.peterswalk.com). And it is worth booking tickets for the Hermitage at www.hermitagemuseum.org. There is a little paperwork involved in arranging visas and you should set aside a month to do it. Use the Russian Embassies in London (0906 550 8960; www.rusemblon.org) or Dublin (00 353 1 492 3492). For an unforgettably Russian adventure visit a banya - a sauna-cum-bathhouse that is an essential part of most locals' weekly routine. Some are mixed-sex, some are separate, but it's all good fun and very cleansing. \u00b7 We welcome letters. Tom Hall from Lonely Planet addresses as many as possible here. Email escape@lonelyplanet.co.uk or write to Lonely Planet, 72-82 Rosebery Avenue, London EC1R 4RW. The writer of the week's star letter wins a Lonely Planet guide of their choice, so please include a daytime telephone number and postal address.
