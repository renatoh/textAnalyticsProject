Triesman, the serving minister for intellectual property, is among the candidates to become the independent chair of the Football Association. If successful he would be the inaugural holder of the first post to be introduced as part of the Burns reforms. Triesman's is one of the surviving names on a shortlist that has been whittled down from six candidates to two or three, with interviews believed to be imminent. Spurs fan Triesman is a leading anti-racist campaigner and acts as an ambassador for the Tottenham Hotspur Foundation, the recently incorporated charitable trust that used to be the club's football-in-the-community department. But another of the posts from Triesman's political past was as Labour's general secretary, having been Peter Watts's predecessor in the position. Watts resigned from the post last week over the illegal donations affair. Triesman's name was dragged into that maelstrom at the weekend when reports suggested he had also been aware of the donations, though he forcefully denied the claims. \"The allegation that I knew of or signed off an arrangement is a lie,\" said Triesman on Sunday. \"Had I known about that kind of thing I would have reported it immediately to the Electoral Commission and would probably have phoned the police.\" Triesman was unavailable for further comment yesterday. Thomas tipped for Five Bob Shennan's move to become Channel Four's director of radio from his post as controller of Five Live could spark an exodus from the BBC's flagship sports radio channel. Shennan's decision reflects his unwillingness to relocate his family to Salford, which will become the base for BBC Sport from 2011, preferring a switch to London's Horseferry Road. It is a view shared by several of his former colleagues. The smart money for Shennan's successor lies with the editor of the Today programme, Ceri Thomas, who would be following a path previously trodden by Roger Mosey, now the BBC's director of sport. How Shennan's departure affects the position of the commentator Alan Green is unclear. Shennan was Green's biggest champion at the BBC but it is unlikely the Liverpool fan would want to follow his former boss to London; Salford is closer to Green's footballer-belt Cheshire home. Purnell's sporting chance Football, cricket, tennis and both rugby codes have inevitably united to express in writing their thanks - which borders on an outpouring of relief - to James Purnell for his new strategic vision for Sport England. Purnell, the culture, media and sport secretary, ripped up the plans Sport England's chairman Derek Mapp had for his own organisation last week, prompting Mapp's resignation. Mapp's vision had been to increase general participation in activity rather than sport, something one leading sports administrator dismissed as a \"walking-in-the-woods\" blueprint. It included a \u00a325m cut in funding for the sports governing bodies over three years. Since the money has been restored to the direct-funding pot for sports and a narrower focus of the organisation's strategy towards more professional coaching programmes has been put in place, it is small wonder that the five sports were so appreciative. Home nations KO'd Hope Hope Powell and her England women's football team are indeed the victims of blazer wars in missing out on the 2008 Olympic Games, as the former sports minister Richard Caborn said this week. But instead of the usual concerns over Fifa voting rights, the refusal of the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish FAs to authorise the participation of England, playing as Great Britain, at the Olympics is tied to the failure to revive a home nations tournament for the men next summer. Caborn had secured the support of Fifa and the British Olympic Association for the Beijing team but, according to a source involved in the failed negotiations, the decision was tied up with England's refusal to reinstate the round-robin home nations men's tournament. The home unions have not played in that competition since 1984 but a biennial Four Nations Tournament involving Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, beginning in 2009, was announced last week. The FA is not convinced of its merits but a one-off match against Scotland is likely to be scheduled, probably in the empty Euro 2008 dates. matt.scott@ theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
