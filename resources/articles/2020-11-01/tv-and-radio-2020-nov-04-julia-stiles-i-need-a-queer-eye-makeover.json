It is very timely and relevant, but you forget that because it is just entertaining. The best performance you\u2019ve seen on TV Andrew Rannells as Blair in Black Monday. He went from charming to villainous seamlessly \u2013 and always while making you love him, even at his worst. There was one scene in particular that made me cry. His character was confiding to Regina Hall about what it was like to be afraid to come out. Heartbreakingly honest and so subtle. Not preaching, just giving you a glimpse. He kept talking and smiling with tears in his eyes \u2013 you could feel his pain without seeing an actor trying to show that. Your TV turn-offs Gore and violence. Victimisation. I stopped watching Narcos after the umpteenth prostitute was tortured. Your TV guilty pleasure The reality series Below Deck: Mediterranean. I got a glimpse of that world while making my own show, Riviera, so it is nostalgic for me. I was always curious about the people working behind the scenes of those luxury yachts. The show you wish you could guest star on Black Monday or Fleabag. Or Queer Eye! Please, Fab Five, give me a pandemic makeover. They are the sweetest. The show that should never have been cancelled \u2026 Smilf. It was so authentic, well written, quirky, funny and honest. I root for that. Any storyteller that has a true voice and doesn\u2019t compromise. I went to college with Frankie Shaw and, back then, the idea of us young actresses being able to direct or even create a show was unheard of. \u2026 And the show that should be cancelled I think any of these impossibly fake aspirational shows. Or the ones that make you talk in a whiny baby voice. You know which reality shows I mean. Your favourite TV show when you were 10 Pee-wee\u2019s Playhouse. I still watch it; thank you, Netflix. Cyndi Lauper did the opening theme song \u2013 also amazing! The best TV villain of all time Archie Bunker in All in the Family and Al Bundy in Married With Children. Those shows are funny to watch, but the regressive old white dude is something we\u2019re all sick of. It\u2019s too close to home these days \u2013 not my home, thankfully, but when you look at current events and social media. It\u2019s toxicity masked as being a clown. Riviera airs at 9pm on Thursdays on Sky Atlantic"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
