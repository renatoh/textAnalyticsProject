The \u201che\u201d the user was describing was Jay, the prosecution\u2019s main witness in the 1999 murder of Hae Min Lee. That\u2019s the Baltimore case which Serial, the viral podcast from the producers of This American Life, has been reinvestigating for the last two months. It has garnered the rapt attention of over 5 million downloaders. And it will all end next week. A second season will deal with a different case. Jay has not participated in the podcast. This has succeeded only in making him a more interesting target to wannabe detectives. Exhibit A: this user had written on the Reddit that he had driven by Jay\u2019s house and seen him. Perhaps the Redditor was lying, I thought to myself, but I had to ask: Did he have any qualms about doing that, as a relative stranger to the case? \u201cNo, not really,\u201d he replied. \u201cI had no plans of making contact or sitting outside and waiting.\u201d He simply wanted to see the house, and Jay. Creepy, right? Yet a couple of weeks after trading these messages, I listened to an episode where Sarah Koenig, the show\u2019s host, told a similar story. Needing some answers, she drove straight up to Jay\u2019s house with no warning. This, she admitted, was a \u201cdick move\u201d. Koenig actually knocked on the door. Inside, she and a producer spoke to Jay without recording the conversation. And when they got back to the car they proceeded to narrate the encounter back to us, without quite saying if Jay approved. We only know that he subsequently declined an interview. In other words, there are moments where the line between the journalist and the Redditor is not as clear as we would like. Since I last wrote about it for the Guardian, the plot in Serial, as described by Koenig, has certainly thickened. But then, so has everything else: the audience, the criticism and the backlash to the criticism. Most of all, the online discussion by amateur detectives has blossomed further. The subreddit devoted to the podcast now draws more than 700,000 unique views a month. The general outlines of the crime, however, haven\u2019t changed much since the first episode. On 13 January 1999, someone strangled Lee. Her body was only found much later, buried in a park. Jay told the police that Adnan Syed, Lee\u2019s ex-boyfriend, was the killer. Two trials, a fairly thin evidentiary record, one plea deal for Jay, and an uneven defense lawyer followed. Ultimately, Syed was convicted. He maintains his innocence. He\u2019s been in prison since his conviction. Enter Serial, and Koenig. Her exploration of the case has proven addictive. But the serialised approach has invited people, in a way it has never been clear Serial\u2019s producers anticipated, to Monday-morning-quarterback the investigation. The resulting online discussions have been fractious and occasionally taken, in the way of the internet, a turn for the insane. The show has ignored those discussions, even where it seems like they might be relevant. Today\u2019s episode, for example, was titled Rumours. And it addressed some stories that had been floating around Reddit for weeks, without ever mentioning Reddit itself. (I contacted Serial\u2019s producers for comment on Reddit\u2019s relationship to their reporting, but they declined.) It\u2019s easy to dismiss all this as \u201cjust Reddit,\u201d because so much of what\u2019s gone on there has really been about the obsessive armchair-detective types. And yet something else has happened too: the people who are actually involved in the case have used the internet to push back. The starkest example of that came when Lee\u2019s brother, whom Serial producers had evidently not been able to reach, wrote a post on the subreddit on 18 November. He titled it, \u201cI am Hae\u2019s brother - Do not AMA [Ask Me Anything]\u201d. In it he told the redditors that they were \u201cdisgusting,\u201d that \u201cTO ME ITS REAL LIFE.\u201d He seemed less bothered by the podcast than the online discussions themselves. The redditors, generally, seemed chastened. \u201cI am very sorry for your loss,\u201d begins the top comment. (A Reddit moderator, Jacob White, told me then that they are not 100% certain that this poster was actually Hae\u2019s brother. But, he added, \u201cFor our subreddit\u2019s uses however, I have confidence enough for the users to carry on conversation. If that makes sense.\u201d) Another person who surfaced on Reddit about two weeks ago is Tanveer Syed, 38. He\u2019s Adnan\u2019s older brother, and I spoke with him by phone. His first subreddit intervention came because several of the redditors had seized on a \u201cfact\u201d about Tanveer himself. Someone in the defense lawyer\u2019s office had written a note in the file saying Tanveer had called Adnan a \u201cmasterful liar.\u201d Tanveer denies this. He says the law clerk misconstrued his stories about Adnan, that he\u2019d only said Adnan told ordinary teenager\u2019s lies about where he was going out to at night. Specifically, Tanveer says, he\u2019d never have used the phrase \u201cmasterful liar,\u201d because to him it\u2019s \u201cawkward language.\u201d But that phrase kept surfacing on the Reddit, he and his wife noticed. And after several weeks of this, they\u2019d had enough. One night, he was \u201cputting my 10-month-old to sleep, and my wife came in and was like: \u2018They\u2019re talking about the masterful liar thing again!\u2019\u201d And so he went online to correct them. Since then Tanveer has intervened several times on the subreddit. I asked him about the emotional toll I assumed this must take on him, but Tanveer was sanguine. It didn\u2019t bother him as much as it bothered his younger brother Yusuf, he said. (Yusuf recently told the Guardian\u2019s Jon Ronson that he\u2019d found Reddit \u201ctoxic,\u201d though he also had trouble looking away from it.) \u201cI had 21 years of my life before it got ruined by Adnan getting arrested,\u201d Tanveer said. But his youngest brother had been in second grade. Tanveer attended the trial; he was used to people attacking his brother\u2019s credibility. Yusuf, meanwhile, who\u2019d been so young, was \u201cseeing all this stuff, like most people, for the first time\u201d. Recently Tanveer actually found himself on the phone with Adnan, trying to explain the online furor over Serial. Adnan has no experience of social media, he says, so Tanveer had to find another metaphor to explain things. \u201cReddit is like road rage,\u201d he says he told Adnan. People were very reactive and emotional. And under cover of anonymity, lots felt free to say things they would never say to Adnan\u2019s face. \u201cFor Adnan, it was hard to fathom because Adnan\u2019s been in jail,\u201d Tanveer said. \u201cAdnan said: \u2018In my world, if you\u2019re not ready to say something to someone\u2019s face, you don\u2019t say it.\u2019\u201d Tanveer and Adnan are not alone in seizing on the frustrating anonymity of these people on the internet. In the last week, I also spoke to Rabia Chaudry, the family friend who alerted Koenig to the case, about her involvement with Reddit. Early on, she was an active user. But a few weeks ago, she publicly declared she\u2019d deleted her Reddit account. At the time, as a regular lurker on the subreddit, I could completely see why. After the first few weeks, other users had begun to describe Rabia in terms more appropriate to a cartoon villainess. People resented her unqualified advocacy of Adnan\u2019s innocence, and their resentment inflated her into a character for them to bat around in their discussions. Family and friends still send her screenshots, sometimes. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard, sometimes there are these really, deeply personal attacks,\u201d she said. \u201cMe and Adnan\u2019s family, you know, his loved ones, might take things personally\u2026 But why are strangers taking things so personally? I don\u2019t get it. It\u2019s so toxic.\u201d Both Tanveer and Rabia did have some theories as to why some users were so invested. They suggested that some anonymous users may be close to the case, though they\u2019re not admitting it. They couldn\u2019t prove anyone\u2019s identity, though. In fact, it\u2019s hard to definitively prove that anyone is on Reddit unless they voluntarily submit to verification. We only know, for example, that the person claiming to be Hae\u2019s brother who posted on Reddit was that person through the confirmation the moderators sought. The rumour that Jay himself was on the reddit, reported last week by Ronson \u2013 well, the moderators deny it. And even Tanveer told me he thought that was a misunderstanding. As for myself, after weeks of these meta-conversations, I don\u2019t know that any of the online obsessiveness about Serial has a clear explanation. The phrase I keep coming back to, instead, is the one with which this article opens: \u201cI was just curious like everybody else.\u201d I\u2019d never have driven up to Jay\u2019s house unannounced, not even as a reporter with several months of work under my belt like Koenig. But I can understand the pull. Investigative reporting, like storytelling, or like listening to stories, can become its own kind of hypnosis. Because I can\u2019t discuss these issues with Koenig herself, I emailed Pamela Colloff for some insight. Colloff is an award-winning reporter for the Texas Monthly, where she has written long investigative crime pieces for years. I asked her whether she\u2019d ever consider opening up her reporting to a serialised format the way Koenig has. She replied that though she\u2019d been enjoying listening to Serial, she wouldn\u2019t present a story this way herself. \u201cDoing so would create an ethical minefield, at least for me,\u201d Colloff wrote. \u201cGood crime writing requires suspense, but stretching that out over a protracted period of time can be problematic. Is it OK for us to wonder for two or three months what the deal is with Jay, to borrow a phrase from the podcast? Or should we be presented with all relevant information about Jay at one time?\u201d In part that\u2019s because there is an additional ethical burden associated with crime reporting: \u201cThe evidence you uncover, and the way you frame the story, can have tremendous influence on the case itself.\u201d The participants in this case do feel that influence, by the way. When I spoke to Rabia this past weekend, she was very concerned that the latest Serial episode, about Adnan\u2019s defense lawyer, might affect his future appeals. They\u2019re based in a theory known as \u201cineffective assistance of counsel.\u201d Koenig had presented Adnan as having had more or less total faith in his defence attorney at the time of the trial. But Rabia had spoken to Adnan since and she said he was upset. Adnan, Rabia says, had told Koenig that his confidence in the attorney had since been undermined by what he\u2019d learned after the trail. But Koenig hadn\u2019t aired that part of the interview. \u201cHe was hurt by it,\u201d Rabia said. \u201cThe fact that he told Sarah the whole thing, and it wasn\u2019t reported like that, bothered him. And it bothered me.\u201d She says she spoke to Koenig about it. Rabia also says she does not think Koenig intended to harm Adnan\u2019s defense in any way. At the end of today\u2019s episode, Koenig seemed to me to be addressing this. She talked about a letter from Adnan, dated \u201ca few weeks ago,\u201d in which he tried to explain some things about his relationship to her. \u201cAdnan is obviously aware of this podcast, that it\u2019s out in the world and I could tell that my story had messed with his equilibrium,\u201d she said. She added that she knew she had \u201cyank[ed] this door open again to the outside world and to all its doubts about Adnan\u2019s integrity.\u201d And as she said this all I could think was about how yes, this is exactly the problem with doing journalism at all. The \u201cethics\u201d are situational, and not always as clear as anyone would like. You might think you are doing a simple crime podcast, simply presenting the facts. And then you become a sensation, as Serial has, and the story falls to the mercy of the thousands, even millions, of bored and curious people on the internet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
