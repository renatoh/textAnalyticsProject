Heads, parents, businessmen or charity figures would combine to form a 'not-for-profit' enterprise, ploughing back any money they make into their own classrooms to boost education standards. The plans for a range of new non-profit-making companies across public services have been drawn up by Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt with three other Cabinet Ministers. The idea, however, threatens a serious clash with the Treasury, whose iron grip on government purse strings would be threatened by new ways of raising money for public services. It will also raise fears over a two-tier service leaving some users with second-class treatment. Hewitt is drawing up a blueprint for a new breed of not-for-profit public interest companies which could eventually run 'superschools', new nursing homes for the elderly to ease the beds crisis, and build housing - along similar lines to Health Secretary Alan Milburn's plans for foundation hospitals, which will get more freedom and more money in return for delivering faster treatment. Insiders say it could be the Blairite 'big idea' of Labour's second and third terms in power. 'This will be a vehicle for what Milburn's doing, but also it would be a further option for other colleagues who are considering elements of public service reform,' said a source close to Hewitt. Hewitt is working with Milburn, Education Secretary Estelle Morris and Home Secretary David Blunkett on a consultation paper to be drawn up this summer. Insiders are pointing out that the 'not-for-profit' model could not only have provided a solution for bailing out Railtrack, but would have been a less controversial answer to improving the Tube than the part-privatisation plan that has triggered a court battle between the Government and London Mayor Ken Livingstone. It is seen in Downing Street as a 'third way' between part-privatisations that have infuriated trade unionists, and the old model of a public sector too closely run by Whitehall."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
