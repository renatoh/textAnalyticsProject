It's a kind of sabbatical, I suppose, after 12.5 years in the Foreign Office and 4.5 at the UK mission to the United Nations, working on Iraq, in particular. I'd been in Afghanistan, too, reporting on what was going on there for the British embassy in Kabul. Now, I'm studying as a fellow at the New School University and at Columbia University, researching political philosophy, still living in New York. I'd worked very intensely on a very demanding issue for many years, and I felt I needed to do something else for a while before resuming my Foreign Office career. Because like many civil service careers, it can be for life, and I wasn't sure that I wanted to do just that for all my working life. The only major problem is that nobody offered to pay me for my research, funnily enough, so I had to remortgage my home in London. Basically, I do the odd bit of teaching for the universities, and they give me library privileges. I have to speak on panels occasionally, particularly on Iraq at the moment, of course I do miss the excitement of being involved in it, I really do. And I do miss the cocktail parties, dramatic sessions of the security council, and meeting Kofi Annan and Tariq Aziz or Yasser Arafat. Now I spend most of my days in a very ugly library, in my jeans and sneakers. On the other hand, I felt the need to step away from the forest and see the wood for the trees for a while. I don't feel disillusioned with the Foreign Office, but it's like Isaiah Berlin said - he was once a diplomat too, not that I'm comparing myself to him, but when he left diplomacy he said it was \"only a very small piece of the carpet\". That had been on my mind, I think. I felt unsure that I wanted to continue with diplomacy for the whole of the rest of my life, though I'd enjoyed it up to that point, and there were particular intellectual fields I wanted to explore. It's quite an established thing now in the Foreign Office that they let people go off on unpaid leave - usually people having children or caring for elderly relations or studying. It's quite a sensible scheme for a job that requires a great deal of one's commitment, especially on where you live and things like that, that they let you romp around in the pastures beyond for a while. My heart is very strongly here, in New York. I got married here last October, to a New Yorker, and being offered an academic position in New York was obviously better than being offered one in Milton Keynes or something. It's a very seductive city, even though it's going slightly mad at the moment. Public voices: March 21 2002 First secretary, UN, New York Salary: \u00a335,000 September 11 changed a great deal. The most immediate thing was that we passed a resolution in the Security Council the day after, condemning the attacks. You could sense the shock among everybody in the council chamber. It was very striking, though striking doesn't capture what it was like to be in New York at the time. One of the moving things about being in New York after the attack, it wasn't the flag-waving that one noticed, it was the compassion and a lot of my colleagues, particularly of course those in the consulate, doing so much to help people. In professional terms, it changed the focus for the mission, which obviously turned more towards counter-terrorism and Afghanistan, which I became responsible for. This involved the fall of the Taliban and, post-Taliban, looking towards reconstruction of the country and establishing a political process towards a more stable future. We've been ferociously busy. I'm shortly going to Kabul to help out at the embassy there for a few weeks. A lot of people, friends of mine in New York, who had taken absolutely no interest in my work before, were peppering me with questions about the Middle East. Obviously, to have it happen so close to home was deeply troubling and caused many of us to reflect on what we were doing. The world of terrorism and violence had been brought to our doorsteps in the most horrifying way. I've never had a problem with motivation. I always thought that this job was worthwhile and work that needed to be done. One of the great things about the Foreign Office is that nearly everbody feels like that. Rarely do you have to push people; they are quite willing to stay until 2am for a Security Council vote. I didn't feel unvalued a year ago, but I suspect that one of the results of all this will be that more people will want to go into public service. The United States foreign service has had a surge of applications and I wouldn't be surprised if that was the same with us. I'm think I'm paid about the same as I was last year (\u00a335,000). I don't really know, I never look at my pay. But then I'm single and many others are paid a great deal less. I think the ones who feel most hard up are the ones with a family. It's extremely difficult for spouses and partners to maintain a solid career when they are going to be going to a different place every few years and it's hard here because they can't necessarily get a work visa. Michael Ellison The Common Good: March 21 2001 First secretary, UN, New York Salary: \u00a335,000 I deal with Middle East issues, primarily on the security council, help brief the ambassador and negotiate resolutions on the Middle East. I think it's extremely interesting, challenging, at times gruelling, but generally an unforgettable experience. You see deals being struck between exhausted and angry diplomats in the middle of the night and you begin to understand how things work. In the back of your mind is definitely the motivation that you're serving something more than just your individual betterment. But I don't believe in altruism: you do it because you want to. I love being involved in diplomacy and if you can do things a little better, you're pleased. I think it's still recognised as a worthwhile thing to do. People who know diplomats know it's not cocktail parties and lounging by the pool. It involves a certain amount of personal sacrifice, the obligation to move around the world to difficult places. It's tough leaving people behind, breaking up personal relationships. You can only do that if you really like the job. Whether it's valued in the way it was, I don't know. Mrs Thatcher questioned everything about it and made public servants feel inadequate for having chosen that course. I don't think that view is shared by people in Britain. I make pounds 35,000. The more junior ranks get paid considerably less, so little that they are finding it hard to live in London these days. The trouble with diplomacy is that there's no comparable job, except maybe journalism. In New York you meet management consultants who say, \"We'd love people like you - you've done real negotiations.\" They talk about starting salaries of about $150,000. When you hit my age, suddenly all those accountants and solicitors, who were earning twice what you made, are making 10 times as much."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
