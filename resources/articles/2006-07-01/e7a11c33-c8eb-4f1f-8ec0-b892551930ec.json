Contestants in the Microsoft-sponsored Imagine Cup gathered at the company's campus in Redmond, Washington, last week for a showcase of health-related inventions they hope can change the world. It is the fourth year of the cup, which aims to encourage technological innovation, with finals in India and prizes of $25,000 (\u00a313,600) for the winners. This year's umbrella subject was something close to the heart of the Microsoft chairman, on hand to offer his thoughts. \"It's wonderful that technology is getting to the point where it can have more impact on healthcare. When we talk about empowerment, healthcare should be right up there with education, communication and creativity,\" he said. The projects took a wide brief: one mapped a complex 3D image on to a pair of specially created glasses. \"I was very impressed ... young people with new ideas about software can help - they have fresh minds that see things I wouldn't see.\" Gates was particularly taken by two methods for assisting blind people. One involved a pair of vibrating GPS-enabled wristbands that fed the wearer directional information - buzzing left to indicate they should turn left, and so on. The Indian competitors, meanwhile, had created an echo-location system to build accurate maps of spaces and allow those with visual impairments to use software. Gates enthused about using cameras and other detection to enhance the \"real-world experience\" of people with impaired sight. While the man who recently announced he was stepping down from day to day software work admitted that many technologies were \"not perfect\", he hoped users would take much of the brunt in helping evolve them in a more useful way. \"In speech recognition, there are people who can't use keyboards and those are the people who help it get better. At some point it's going to be good enough that everyone wants to use it ... computer vision can aid you even when it's not good enough to drive your car automatically.\" The event's British contingent of Andy Sterland, Tom Randell and James Lissiak, students from Hull University, had built a bedside system for intensive care patients. The concept included an easily managable way to keep in contact with friends, as well as helpful on-screen rehabilitation aids. Health and technology is a big story in Britain, of course, with the government ploughing ahead with its multibillion pound programme to modernise the NHS - now slated at around \u00a320bn, making it by far the planet's biggest public sector IT project. But Gates said such investment was necessary. \"The general idea of investing in the health service is not us - but given that you're going to put those dollars in ... now we're in the thick of things,\" he said. Another popular project, from Germany, involved community-created maps that helped people with disabilities find useful directions, parking spaces and other information. This was something that would benefit from our Free Our Data campaign - and could be the sort of thing coming to a Microsoft product near you. \"Virtual Earth, we're doing some neat things with that ... [but] I hadn't thought about these overlays for handicapped people showing routes and special parking places. That was an insight,\" said Gates. \u00b7 Bobbie Johnson travelled to Seattle as a guest of Microsoft \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
