When Haley, a governor of South Carolina, used the Republican response to Barack Obama\u2019s address to appeal for tolerance toward immigrants, supporters of real estate mogul Donald Trump swiftly rallied against the nation\u2019s second Indian American governor. \u201cTrump should deport Nikki Haley,\u201d tweeted Ann Coulter, the far-right conservative commentator known to make provocative statements. Laura Ingraham, a prominent talk radio host in conservative circles, lamented that Haley missed an opportunity \u201cto stand with working people who want borders enforced\u201d. \u201cThe country is lit up w/ a populist fever &amp; the GOP responds by digging in, criticizing the GOP candidates dominating polls?! NOT SMART,\u201d she tweeted. Haley acknowledged that she had Trump, the Republican presidential frontrunner, in mind while issuing an emphatic defense of America\u2019s openness to immigrants as one of its \u201cnoblest legacies\u201d. \u201cMr Trump has definitely contributed to what I think is just irresponsible talk,\u201d Haley said on the Today show Wednesday morning. She later stood by her comments when asked about the backlash, telling reporters was simply expressing what she believed. \u201cI think that this country is better when we work together and acknowledge the fact that the fabric of America is based on legal immigrants of all professions, of all races, of all religions,\u201d Haley said. During her response to President Obama\u2019s final State of the Union, Haley spoke of American identity in terms that were strikingly similar to the president. After sharing her tale as the daughter of immigrants, the nation\u2019s second Indian American governor drew upon the example of unity following last year\u2019s racially motivated mass shooting at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. \u201cWe didn\u2019t turn against each other\u2019s race or religion. We turned toward God, and to the values that have long made our country the freest and greatest in the world,\u201d Haley said. Earlier in her speech, she acknowledged the threats that were the source of widespread fear before offering a clear rebuttal of the overheated rhetoric on the campaign trail. \u201cDuring anxious times, it can be tempting to follow the siren call of the angriest voices. We must resist that temptation,\u201d Haley said. \u201cNo one who is willing to work hard, abide by our laws, and love our traditions should ever feel unwelcome in this country.\u201d Trump responded by accusing Haley of being \u201cweak on illegal immigration\u201d. While Haley reflected a sympathetic attitude toward immigrants on Tuesday, she has by no means been a lightweight on the issue. Haley was among the dozens of Republican governors in November who requested the Obama administration not resettle Syrian refugees in their states, citing concerns over the vetting process in the wake of the terrorist attacks in Paris. She also emphasized to reporters on Wednesday the need to be open to legal immigration, but seemed to draw a line at how to deal with immigrants who were in the country illegally. While listing her policy differences with Republican presidential candidates, Haley noted that \u201cMarco Rubio supports amnesty, which I don\u2019t\u201d. The soundbite garnered immediate attention, given Rubio\u2019s support for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants remains a key vulnerability for the Florida senator. Over the past year, Haley has nonetheless emerged as a voice of reason in a fractured Republican party. Her response to the Emanuel AME church massacre, in which a white gunman shot and killed nine African American churchgoers, was especially praised by members of both parties. Following the shooting, Haley promptly pushed for removing the Confederate flag from the South Carolina state house grounds. Her return to national prominence has kicked off fresh speculation that Haley could be a top vice-presidential pick for the Republican ticket in 2016. Her name was similarly floated as a running mate to Mitt Romney in 2012, although she took herself out of contention at the time. South Carolina holds outsize influence over the Republican primary as the third early voting state, and at least one candidate praised Haley\u2019s State of the Union response. At a rally in South Carolina on Wednesday ahead of the next presidential debate, Rubio told voters their governor did \u201ca great job\u201d. In a separate interview with Fox News the night before, he commended Haley\u2019s \u201ctone and her demeanor\u201d. Haley has yet to make any endorsements in the race, but her support could prove influential. The governor\u2019s approval rating, according to recent polling, was just shy of 60%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
