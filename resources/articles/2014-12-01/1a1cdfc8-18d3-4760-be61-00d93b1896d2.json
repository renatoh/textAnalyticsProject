They walked past shouts of \u201cGo home!\u201d and the N-word. They walked past grain elevators and $2.37 gas. They walked past a confederate flag with the singer Hank Williams Jr\u2019s head on it. They kept walking. On Friday afternoon, dozens of civil-rights marchers who set out last Saturday from Ferguson, Missouri, arrived in Jefferson City to be joined by hundreds of supporters and deliver a message to the governor: \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot!\u201d The march, organized by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and called the \u201cJourney for Justice\u201d, took a 134-mile route to culminate in a rally inside the rotunda of the fog-shrouded state capitol. Marchers hoisted umbrellas in the home stretch and carried signs in solidarity with protesters who this week have memorialized Eric Garner, the Staten Island man who died in July after being placed in a chokehold by a police officer. The goal of the march, organizers said, was to call for \u201creforms of police practice and culture\u201d in Missouri, starting with the replacement of Ferguson police chief Thomas Jackson. The event was planned after the announcement last month that a St Louis county grand jury had decided not to indict Ferguson police officer Darren Wilson in the August killing of an unarmed teen, Michael Brown. While they encountered some ugly scenes, captured by Missourinet journalist Kyle Loethen in a video, the marchers said the experience had been overwhelmingly positive. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve seen is an extraordinary array of citizens of Missouri who brought us coffee, hot chocolate, sandwiches, refreshments, all along the way without being asked,\u201d NAACP president Cornell William Brooks, who participated in the march, told Loethen. \u201cPeople who have come and shed tears, who have prayed for us, we\u2019ve seen that. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve seen a few people who have used the N-word. Who\u2019ve asserted their first-amendment rights with obscenities. And that\u2019s a part of our country, and your rights under the constitution. \u201cAll we say to them is, don\u2019t be afraid.\u201d Brooks met Missouri governor Jay Nixon this week. \u201cI was honored to meet with the leadership of our nation\u2019s oldest and largest civil rights organization during the march from Ferguson to the capital this week,\u201d Nixon said in a statement released on Friday. \u201cThrough honest dialogue and mutual respect, I\u2019m confident that together we can make meaningful change to address the challenges underlying the events in Ferguson, and build a future of greater peace, opportunity and fairness for all.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
