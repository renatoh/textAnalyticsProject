It is an expression that equally fits Mexico City, Mumbai, Sao Paulo, Johannesburg, Los Angeles and Tokyo - cities rapidly evolving in unpredictable, dangerous but exciting ways. Growth is inevitable. Even stately London, demographically, culturally and gastronomically, is not the place it was in 1970, while every two years, Shanghai adds a city the size it was in 1949 to its vast footprint. The great thing about cities is not how awful they are, but how wonderfully well they work, considering that putting more than 20 million humans in close proximity to engage in serial acts of competitive individualism could not be considered a reasonable idea. If you put rats into claustrophobic circumstances, they become cannibalistic in no time at all. But humans find ingenious solutions: Maglev trains, underground car parks, Korean supermarkets, pizza delivery, cycle lanes, very tall buildings. A century ago, only about 10 per cent of the world's population lived in cities. By 2050 that figure is expected to rise to at least 75 per cent. In 1995, in his Reith lecture, the architect Richard Rogers asked if you could design an entire city. The answer would seem to be no. Global cities are governed by a scary dynamic which has a teeming, desperate underclass anxious for material progress and a rich hyperclass above them, anxious to maintain its privileged access to goods and services. The forces involved are way beyond the influence of architecture. As a result, the planet's celebrity architects get carried away with fantastical remedial proposals of dubious practicality: unworldly, techno-organic inventions, urban piazzas or ever higher risers. Still, the design of the ideal city has a history that goes back to Plato. He described the legendary Atlantis as a palace in a circle surrounded by a plain divided into 60,000 square living plots. The Roman architect Vitruvius organised his ideal city in response to the eight winds of classical mythology. Meanwhile, the British took refuge from the industrial hell that they had created by dreaming of bringing the country into the city. John Nash's Regent's Park remains the ultimate expression of rus in urbe, but the idea was also nicely democratised by Ebenezer Howard, who coined the term 'garden city' in his book Tomorrow: A Peaceful Path to Real Reform (1898). Yet you look at Mexico City or Mumbai today and one struggles to think how an architect's windy piazza or a planner's arboriculture might help. The fast-evolving global cities are not going to be inspired by Thomas More's Utopia. Their source would seem to be JG Ballard's dystopia, with technology and sociology running out of control. In her great book The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961) Jane Jacobs told us: 'But look at what we have built.' We have built some magnificent catastrophes. The Global Cities exhibition is in the Turbine Hall, Tate Modern, London SE1 (020 7887 8888; www.tate.org.uk) from 20 June to 27 August"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
