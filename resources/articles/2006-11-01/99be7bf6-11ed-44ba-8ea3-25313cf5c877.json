That was my first thought when I saw that photograph of the 20 year old actress' left wrist, marked badly with a series of wounds, on the Sun's website this week. Taken last week, when she was in London, attending a party after the world music awards and run in conjunction with a story which speculates that Lohan has \"fallen victim to self-harm\", the wounds are sensationalistically blown up and highlighted on the website, as if crucial evidence in a crime scene. To further this ghoulish tabloid witch-hunt, which seems hellbent on outing Lohan as a cutter, the Sun brought in self-harm expert Jan Sutton (author of a classic book on the subject Healing, The Hurt Within), who assessed the photographs as follows: \"The photographs have all the tell-tale signs. The arms are the most common place for self injury. Some of the scars are fresh and just above those there are a number of injuries which look older. They are called keloid scars and are just beginning to disappear. It would be difficult to argue this is an accident as there are just too many scars.\" Sutton is alluding here to comments by Lohan's US publicist who responded to the allegations by saying that the marks on Lohan's wrist were scrapes resulting from a recent fall in some bushes. It's none of our business if Lindsay Lohan is self-harming because she's going through a rough time or not. Nor if she's fallen in some bushes and injured her wrist as a result. If though, let's say, she was indeed self-harming, the last thing she should be subjected to is a forensic style deconstruction of every scratch and mark on her arms. Almost 10 years after I stopped self-harming (I went through it from 18 to 22), a new GP, seeing my medical records, asked me to roll up my shirt sleeves at a routine check-up. When I asked why, he muttered something about \"a history of self-harm\" and \"just checking\" and proceeded to scrutinise my arms in a way that left me feeling indescribably humiliated. The thought of a photograph of my arm, back when I was self-harming, in a national newspaper. Unthinkable. The kind of scrutiny assigned to Lindsay Lohan's wrist does nothing but reduce public perceptions of self-harm, which, despite a run of positive, informative, brave coverage in recent years, still holds its place at the top of the mental health taboo chart, to images of injury, when what we're talking about is a complicated physical way of expressing and dealing with emotional and mental distress. Things feel too much inside, so you express that externally, physically, and as if by magic, you feel briefly ok again. The reality is that the body responds to the shock of the injury, as it would respond to any injury and releases endorphins (neurotransmitters in the brain which bring relief to pain sometimes as potently as morphine), which in turn give the self harmer a sense of euphoria. And when you recognise that many acts of self-harm are symptoms of a depressive illness, that euphoria can arrive as a tremendously seductive pick-me up. At a time when statistics show that as many as one in 10 teenage girls aged 14-19 are self harming regularly and one in 15 young people have self-harmed at least once, the answer isn't to blow up photographs of a young celebrity's wounded wrist and draw speculative conclusions. Young people going through self-harm don't need a poster girl. They need information, understanding, help, alternatives, to be listened to. It's time to stop underlining a dusty old taboo and learn about the illness. A positive example of doing just this was unveiled recently by Somerset City Council's Youth Service who have set about mass distributing throughout the county a self-harm awareness publication called The Little Book Of Self Harm (produced by young people belonging to the Self Harm Action Group in Dorset). By making this informative, approachable text available to young people, the council are respecting that this is a solitary habit and a secretive one. Most self-harmers daren't ask for help, for fear they'll end up locked up. And as with other addictions, the self-harmer will ask for help when she or he is ready. Help cannot be forced on a self-harmer. You have to remember self-harm offers relief to the self-harmer as reliably and precisely as alcohol to the alcoholic. For this reason, too many initiatives launched to help tackle the seemingly growing problem of self-harm, fall short because they focus too exclusively on point of care. Yes, it's progress to train doctors and nurses to deal better with the estimated 142,000 young people who arrive at A&amp;E wards across the UK each year seeking treatment for an act of self-harm. Just as it's progress that ever-more local authorities are setting up helplines for self-harmers (which, though sometimes successful, too generally assume that practitioners of such a secretive, voiceless act will be prepared to discuss what they're doing with anyone but their peers). But really, the problem starts the first time a person self-harms and that's where the work is needed - these young people need to know, before they're stuck in a vicious cycle of self-harming, that there are healthier ways of dealing with their problems. The initiative by Somerset City Council, which seeks to give young people information and resources at the earliest possible time (i.e before they have to seek medical help) should be adapted across the UK and a uniform self-harm publication distributed to all GP's and A&amp;E staff. That way everyone would have a better understanding of what is essentially a fairly commonplace coping mechanism and the market for ghoulish, despicable photographs of the sadly injured wrists of American actresses would hopefully be the only thing getting cut."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
