England can't afford more of that sort of nonsense next summer. The Kiwis will be disappointed. How would that game have played out if it had had five days instead of four? Thanks for all of your emails and tweets, this has been a much more intriguing final day than I expected when I got the late call-up. Mike Selvey's report will be online soon. Liz True emails with a final message: \"The [Netherland, the book] cricket team very much exists. The Staten Island cricket club is one of If not the oldest cricket clubs in the US. I believe the Don has played there. Anyway I saw a chum's team play there on tour and Joseph oneill author of Netherland meandered around the outfield. The match was rained off by a horrible storm that stopped the ferry for hours with the frightening prospect of being stuck on Staten Island.\" The drinks come out but then McCullum wanders over and offers the draw. Handshakes all round... The final hour will come at the end of this over - will they take drinks and then play on? Or will they say thank you and goodnight? Prior takes a single off the first ball, leaving Bell to face the rest. A nasty bouncer with the last delivery disconcerts Bell a little. Alex McCarthy exhibits the form that he talked about much earlier: \"To Josh Robinson: I think Finn's a bit bigger than 6'6\" and Ian Ronald is surely no bigger than 3'7\". I know Finn is bigger than that cos I'm 6,6\" and Finn looks a similar size to Curtley who scared the crap out of me when I asked for his autograph when I was 10. Therefore Curtley is bigger than I am 20 years later and so is Finn. I'm quite drunk so sober people may not understand this.\" Martin back into the attack. Prior takes no risks and nicks the strike with a single off the last ball. Paul Frame writes: \"Re: Clare Davies (over 163) Forchabre sounds lovely, but objectively there's only 1 outground that wins. It's the club cricket ground with an 11,000 capacity and a sea view. Lunchtime entertainment features a miniature naval and aerial battle in the nearby park. To top it all off the ground has top notch comfort facilities for spectators, one of them dedicated to a former correspondent of this parish. Can you tell what it is yet?\" Love that place, Paul. \"Not out,\" says the third umpire. Plenty of fresh air between bat and ball. Prior takes a single off the last ball of the over. Wagner is back into the attack so the Kiwis haven't quite given up. This is Wagner's 42nd over. Just four days until that next test, Brendon. But then Prior swipes at a wide one and there's a loud appeal. Over to the third umpire... Paul O'Neill doesn't think that anyone should go to bed during a crucial test match: \"More fool them for missing out on the straight shoot-out between Root and Finn for the final Ashes batting slot.\" Bell plays out another Southee maiden. We are very close to the end of this game. Unless we have four wickets in the next three overs, the teams are likely to call this one off at 4.30pm local time, when 15 overs would be remaining. Or something like that. Andy Baird is still fretting a little: \"Logic would suggest that T20 better equips teams to chase down 4th innings targets that would have been unthinkable a few years ago. But to be honest I haven't really seen this happening too often. Am I missing something?\" I think T20 has completely changed the way that batsmen think about quick totals. But I also think that captains are aware of this and less likely to offer such an opening. Prior clips a legside delivery from Boult to fine leg for four. There's a brief burst of trumpeting in the background. The rest of the over is quiet, apart from Prior's loud \"No!\" as Bell suggests a single and Prior remembers what happened to Root not that long ago. Dan MacDonald writes: \"Have you checked to see whether the NY cricket team in \"Netherland\" exists, or is it, like the book, just a forgettable work of fiction?\" A forgettable work of fiction? That's harsh. One of the great cricket books, I would say. There are little patches of cricketers around New York, some of whom have very kindly emailed tonight and suggested I look them up. Bell and Prior get back-to-back singles, positively positive. And then Bell plays out the rest of Southee's over. If New Zealand don't take a couple of wickets very, very soon, they might want to think about resting their main bowlers. They've had a long couple of days and the next test is only four days away. Harry Tuttle makes a good point: \"You don't have to be an obscure genius (ho ho) to think that a streetwise tweaker like Daniel Vettori could have made this hairier for England.\" He wouldn't have found much joy in this wicket, but, yes, he was a smart bowler, a true heir of that Kiwi tradition of making the very most of your talents and creating a team that is so much more than the sum of its parts. Prior plays out another Boult maiden. Meanwhile Clare Davies returns to the outgrounds theme I briefly promised earlier: \"Dear Steve, I would take a bit of issue with Paul Frame and suggest that a far better ground than Colchester would be Fochabers. Really pretty cricket ground on the banks of the river Spey \u2013 hit a big six and it\u2019ll be in the river! And for food, rather than some fast food joint, just wander up the road to the award-winning butcher for pies or haggis! That\u2019s proper food!\" Personally, I loved Bradford Park Avenue and Harrogate and still mourn their loss. Southee bowling a little wide and allowing Bell to shoulder arms and avoid danger. Unless Southee is aiming for the sucker punch with one that comes back unexpectedly. But not in this over. Still, it's yet another maiden. But another over closer to safety for England. Andy Baird asks: \"Shifting uncomfortably, how many more overs before we think it's a definite draw. Flat batting track, push McCullum up the order, Finn knackered from his marathon innings...\" All relevant, but England are almost there. Almost. The magnificently stingy Boult (32 overs for 43 runs) shares the new ball. Prior is about to play out yet another maiden when he pushes into midwicket for two. Boult now 33 overs for 45 runs. Profligate. Josh Robinson (a while ago it is true, but his point still makes sense) writes: \"Really quite late at night Busfield, really quite late at night everybody. England are going to lose this. You heard it here 551st. But if anything's to be learned from Adelaide in order to save this game, it's the importance of run-scoring in this situation. Score at 2 an over while staying in for another 25 and New Zealand would need about 125 off 15: not easy, but doable. And at this rate, New Zealand would have a chasable target even off ten or twelve overs. England need runs as much as anything else.\" Southee - still looking for his first wicket, although it was he who ran out Root - has the new ball and he gets it to swing a little. There's a lot of encouraging noises from the fielders but not much real danger. Ryan emails on our baseball/cricket theme, although not on a theme one would expect: \"Hi Steve, Did you see that brawl between Canada and Mexico in the baseball? Madness. Who would have your last \u00a35 between these two teams, should war erupt in the gentile pastures of Dunedin?\" Have you seen Kiwis playing rugby, Ryan? Hard bastards. Prior drives uppishly and alarmingly close to the man especially positioned for that shot at short cover/wide silly mid-off. Prior gets three but there's a lot of oohing and aahing. Prior then bashes a four through cover. Paul O'Neill emails: \"At this point in proceedings, I'll often find friends - fellow cricket-followers - family/wife/children/whatever stifling a yawn, stretching arms and mumbling something along the lines of 'Well, that's me - I've got to go up - no-one's going to win this, anyway'. But I stay up because, well, that's not the point, is it? This is normal, right?\" I'm the wrong man to ask, Paul. Or maybe exactly the right person. Here comes the new ball. As Bob Willis says \"it's always a pleasure taking the third new ball.\" Martin zipping through another over with just a Bell single to show for it. These quick overs are a bugger for the OBOer. (Which is how I seem to remember my OBO debut unfolding all those years ago - a lot of quick overs from Vettori). Prior pulls nicely to the square leg boundary. But that sort of shot will keep the Kiwis interested. Prior drives the next ball for two more into midwicket. And that's the 400 up, but the lead still isn't enough to survive a collapse. James Dale emails: \"Evening Steve, Fan of your work on the NFL blogs this year, full marks to the Graun for keeping us fan of antisocially scheduled sports entertained and informed through the long and lonesome nights. Currently enjoying a very pleasant 18 year old Glendronach, imagining a parallel universe where Steve Finn is a mild-mannered and universally loved wide receiver a la Larry Fitzgerald, Kevin Pietersen does that Cam Newton thing of being brilliant at sports but massively annoying on a human level, and Jonathan Trott is an obdurate left guard, forever doing everything that's asked of him but not having much of a highlight reel. Give it 20 minutes, see if there's a wicket and then off to bed is it?\" As that email actually arrived two hours ago, James may well now be in bed, assuming that this game is over. It's not yet. Dont'cha just love cricket. Martin bowls another maiden as NZ nip through the overs towards the new ball and one big last push. Wagner back into the attack as McCullum rolls the dice which England have so obligingly handed him. (Maybe they could tell that the OBO reader back in England was feeling a little drowsy). Prior tries an ambitious drive and mistimes just enough to get the Kiwis excited. William Bowers lists his priorities (124th over): \"The influence of Italian poetry on English culture after the battle of Waterloo. Silence. I think the order must go: Riders on the Storm (New England's premier Doors cover band), this test, my thesis. O well.\" Still 31 overs to go. At least. Bell cuts for four through the covers and England's lead is into three figures. Well, I had been looking forward to a little cameo from the Tyke tyro and now I'm feeling a little robbed. And now we do have a game on our hands. Root and Bell go for a crazy run - Bell's call, Root setting off late - and the direct hit beats the batsman. Root and Bell go for a quick single and the throw hits the stumps....the video umpire is in the hot seat... In comes Yorkshire's Joe Root. Finn goes to sweep but the ball hits his back leg and the finger is up. Well played, Finn. Time for a little late drama yet? Well played the nightwatchman. That role may well be his for a while now. Unless England think he's now an all-rounder. Bell starts the session by leaning forward and punching Kane Williamson to the long on boundary. Dominic Strogen emails: \"Loving Finn's little innings here...although he's batted two full sessions now, so not so little. More importantly, we've successfully completed the Otago Daily Times cryptic crossword.\" Matthew writes: \"Finn's glorious 50. Sitting here in the U.S. with my beloved rescue Doberman Finnegan by my side. Needless to say we are cheering on his namesake to make a century.\" And here come the teams for the final session of the first test. Little and Large, aka Bell and Finn, stroll out. Simon Lacey asks: \"How many nightwatchmen (English and in total) have gone on to make 50 or 100?\" Good question. Answers please to steve.busfield@guardian.co.uk or via Twitter to @Busfield. I can think of a certain member of the Yorkshire staff who did. Email from Mark Carrington to clarify the position of his friend in the Dunedin sunshine: \"Last minute decision by Keith. Mrs C &amp; I intended to follow up on 2008 tour. Then work commitments intervened. I believe it's de rigeur to now state 'just as satisfying to follow the series via The Guardian OBO?'\" Paul Cockburn goes one better: \"So, I'm at the University Oval following a game in front of me by a US-based journalist on an English website. Surreal enough. Biggest cheer here was for NZ beating Venezuela in World Softball Championships. Rob Smyth would have wanted details.\" Josh Robinson: \"Wee small hours Busfield, wee small hours everybody. Did John Starbuck miss Pietersen's (6'4\") stand with James Taylor (5'6\") at Headingley last summer? That's a difference of ten inches, the same as that between Greig (6'6\") and Knott (5'8\"). Finn is also 6'6\", but Bell a respectable 5'10\". What we really need is for Taylor to return to the side and bat with Chris Tremlett.\" Bell seems much smaller somehow. So here it is: So, England not quite safe yet, but it would take a very dramatic half-hour after tea to change that situation. England still only 89 to the good. Maybe Finn will actually give it a go after tea - he may never have an opportunity for a test ton. And before I'm accused of jinxing the nightwatchman, here's an email from Paul Frame: \"With KP &amp; Trott gone, I think it's time the OBO started getting warmed up with some pre-ashes reverse-jinxing. We all need to be on top form this summer, I've got The Fear that we could be sleep-walking into a 1989 nightmare if we don't take the Kiwis and &amp; Aussies seriously. Bell's looking like he'll get out very soon, Finn's been rendered stroke-less, this another Adelaide isn't it? Only a matter of time for the Kiwis now.\" Finn has gone ballistic - he pushes the first ball of Martin's over for two. Two! Oh, no, that was just a brief moment of action and Finn goes back to blocking. Josh Robinson asks: \"So, is admitting that you like things on the M1 tantamount to admitting that you secretly like returning to London after a weekend watching cricket at Headingley?\" I like the journey north much better, Josh. And that will be Tea. And Finn finally gets a run, a straight push and an ironic cheer. Bell blocks when it's his turn to face Boult. One (maybe two) overs coming up before tea. Clare Davies writes: \"After all these years of sitting up at night for the cricks, I was given a laptop on Thurs which would mean I could take you lot to bed. But could not accept the gift. Bringing dog and luggage home to Scotland on train could not add laptop in to equation. Will collect it next month when I travel without dog. All this means, that I am still at desk but fading fast!!\" Dig in Clare, dig in. Just like Finny. Bell clips one from Martin through midwicket for two. There's a bit of pressure on but only two men around the bat for the spinner. A couple more would certainly make Belly a little uncomfortable. More than an hour since Finn last scored a run. Harry Tuttle emails with a subject line \"Finn's 50 predicted by obscure genius\" - \"Hello Comrade Busfield, Not that I'm one to blow my own trumpet, but who else will do it for me? http://discussion.guardian.co.uk/comment-permalink/20338719\" Bell gets a single early in the Boult over. Finn blocks. But his blocking is getting more professional-looking by the delivery. If it came to it, I'm sure McCullum would open. Bell gets a single off Wagner which brings Finn back onto strike and he pushes at a nice little away-swinger with his un-sponsored bat but fails to make contact. The Kiwis know that Finn's is the key wicket and are duly disappointed. Josh Robinson admonishes me for breaking OBO protocol: \"Busfield, dear Busfield. It's a convention of the OBO that 'reader' is only ever used in the singular. If you really want to go out on a limb, you can just about get away with 'reader s'. You could probably get away with referring to 'both of them' at a particularly busy time.\" Phil Murray asks: \"So what is the runs/overs equation?\" About 40 overs left. England need to bat for most of them, certainly 25 more. Martin to Finn. Guess what? Maiden. Owen Powell emails: \"I assume you've read Joseph O'Neill's 'Netherland'? One of the great post-9/11 novels and with a plot driven by an expat's search for a cricket team in New York. Wonderful stuff.\" It is indeed a great read. For anyone who hasn't read it - and is reading this, and thus a cricket fan (Arturo excluded) - you really should. Get yourself down to the local bookshop and buy a copy. You can also get it from Amazon, but they're only cheaper until all the bookshops have been driven out of business. Bell chops a wide Wagner delivery for four wide of gully. Still a way to go before this game can be called \"safe\" for England. James Walsh again: \"Made up Ian Bell fact: he muttered 'it's Bell time' to himself when Pietersen got out. Paul Frame (over 129): I could murder a Wimpy right now. Gone was the time when central London Wimpys were open 24 hours and, consequently, noted gay pick-up spots. According to my 1974 London guide book, at any rate.\" I like a Wimpy myself. Plenty of them on the M1. Finn has now gone 50 minutes without a run. Still, given that Trott and KP have got out during that time, we shouldn't quibble. A pair of leg byes do advance the score a little though. John Starbuck emails: \"Steve, Just catching up after the footy: you don't say Trype in Nottingham, you say The Trip (over 105).\" Not me, Guv, that would've been my colleague Tom. As a former Nottingham resident, I've spent some time in that establishment. Bell gets off the mark with a little guide wide of gully but spends the rest of the over being tested by a good line and length. Mark Carrington writes: \"Just had a 'phone call from my mate, Keith who's at the the Dunedin Oval. He just doesn't seem appreciate the 'hard yards' I'm putting in at home following the match.\" Did Keith travel down there for this tour or does he live there? Either way, he's still got a game to watch. Arturo Armitage emails: \"It's morning here in smoggy China and for reasons unbeknown to me I have decided to have a look at the cricket updates for the first time in my life. Cricket has always been my least favourite sport (along with curling) probably ever since my dad broke my nose with a bouncer behind my Grandma's flat back in Sheffield many a year ago. Do England still collapse? and why is cricket so incredibly dull??!!\" That backyard incident was supposed to give you character, Arturo, not turn you away from the beautiful game. Either way I bet your Dad will forever regret that moment. 43 overs left in the day. Minus two for change of innings. There's still some cricket to be played. Finn sees out a maiden from Martin. Phillip Bennett-Richards emails: \"The more surprising was Harmy picking holes in Compton batting stance and giving advice on his head position.\" Jonny Hodgetts writes: \"Thought I'd catch up with the OBO in between matches in the Tennant Creek 7-a-side comp we're having this w/e. I'm fielding well (2 catches &amp; 2 run-outs) which is what I say rather than describe my bowling being carted all over the park and my playing all round a straight one this morning. I'm like Steve Smith in his baggy green. Still, we're one victory away from making the finals and one defeat away from being the sorry, abject bunch we really are. My money's on the latter.\" Thanks for sharing, Jonny. Bell is in to create that Little and Large combo that some of you were craving. Maybe those criticizing Finn's obduracy should appreciate the fact that he's still there and that England are still only 74 ahead. Left-armer Wagner going wide in the crease around the wicket to KP and that is a very strange angle to deal with. Finding no joy that way he goes to back over the wicket and immediately does find joy as one cuts back and takes an inside edge. Is there still time for NZ? Martin to Finn. You know what comes next right? Maiden. A fine man, Mr McCourt, and a very fine footy mbm-er. Wagner gets back to his best line and length to KP. Maiden. Simon McMahon emails about the honourable Mr Smyth's wellbeing, but I sense a certain selfish interest at play: \"Any update on Smyth's condition? I do hope he's well enough to be following the OBO. Will he be fit for the second Test? And has he produced a note from his mum?\" Rob is in bed, and, having spoken to him earlier, I can vouch for his ill health. Hopefully he will be back for the next test. David Naylor again: \"Me again, of lunchtime tweeting fame. Being American by birth, I've only ever seen cricket played live once, in a parking lot in Wichita, KS. A life dream is to make it to a Test at Lord's, but that's far away at present. An Aussie friend of mine taught me how to bowl a bit of pace a couple of summers ago, but that bit of knowledge hasn't gotten me far. Therefore, if any of your esteemed readers know of any people around St. Louis, MO that could deal with a complete newcomer to the sport, I'd love to actually play sometime. Cheers, and here's hoping Cook holds the declaration until Finn gets to his century. On the nightwatchman!\" How about getting down to the Caribbean for some cricket, David. A great place to watch the most beautiful of games. Southee off and Martin back. Left arm spin to Kevin Pietersen. Perhaps just a surprise that it's taken this long, with KP already into double figures. KP squeezes a single out of the over. Alex McCarthy emails (for publication I presume): \"Can you ask Mark Newman to only mention the OBO to me by email at work? I'm a contractor and need to cultivate an air of competency, if anyone realises I'm the sort of weirdo who emails into the OBO after staggering back from the pub I'm screwed.\" A sumptuous drive through the covers for four by KP off a wider delivery than Wagner has been delivering of late. Followed by a single which really doesn't go where KP was intending it - once again Pietersen was aiming towards leg but the slightly shorter delivery instead pinged to off. Sara Torvalds emails: \"Good morning Steve - or Good night Steve - or possibly Good grief Steve! Except there's no grief here - Finns for Finn are celebrating Finny's maiden Test half-century in style. Or not so much in style, more like hollow-eyed amazement. But still, we are jubilant. And, considering it's 3 a.m. in Finland, we are not even thinking about a century. Or are we? What time is it in New Zealand? What is the scoring rate? What am I doing?\" So many questions, so little time. I presume you're just hoping that Finn will just keep on going. KP looking a little rusty, wanting to push through the on-side when a straight full delivery wasn't really there for it, although he does get a couple of runs off the leading edge. Southee keeping the ball up and, when a single changes the strike, Finn studiously ignores as much as he can. Louis Leblique writes: \"Similarly to James Walsh's baffled canadian friend, I am currently confronted by something I cannot understand. I currently find myself at a party populated exclusively by spanish people, speaking spanish. Some girl is thrusting her council tax bill into the air shouting loudly. Ignominious defeat looms.\" But what has this got to do with cricket, Louis? Drinks break (or smoking break for some) But no such worries for KP as his first delivery strays towards his pads and is tucked away for a couple of runs. Wagner bounces Pietersen with the next delivery but the tall 'un ducks comfortably underneath. When a single gets Finn down to that end he's beaten by a delivery that takes lovely shape away, although, to be fair to the nightwatchmen, he partially evades it. Partially. Mostly just missed it though. Matt Croft writes: \"My goodness, the Sky team are irritating. Firstly Atherton poking fun at Trott and Finn's scoring rate - oh the irony. Then during the lunch break, Harmison criticised the decision to use a nightwatchman and Collingwood had to explain that any batsman can get out in his first few balls, thus it was better to send out Finn. How long has Harmison played cricket not to understand this basic principle? Now we have Botham referring to 'she who must be obeyed' (does anyone do that any more?) then saying he is travelling 650km tomorrow, 'whatever that is in real money'. Hilarious and so original.\" Yeah, I thought Harmy's thoughts about the nightwatchman were a bit rich. And so in comes KP and he gets to spend the over watching Finn face Southee. That'll be another maiden. Giving KP plenty of time to fret about a possible king pair. John Starbuck emails (a few moments ago): \"Not that I wish Mr Trott any ill-will, but I've been anticipating the combination of Finn and Bell, a big 'un and a little 'un, the likes of which we probably haven't seen for England since Greig and Knott. They do upset the bowlers' length so much.\" Well, Trott is gone, John, I hope you're happy. Except it's KP first. He's just another big 'un. Wagner gets one to bounce a little and it lifts off Trott's bat and loops high and is well caught by a leaping Wagner. Fifty to Finn. With a four. Guided down to third man off Neil Wagner who is back in the attack and already has a ton of his own (1-109). That 50 has taken 203 balls and 142 minutes. And, while some may be debating the pace at which the nightwatchman is batting, he has almost caught Trott up again... Trott gets a single off Martin but you know what that does, don't you. It gives the strike back to Mr Finn and his long, long journey. Another single gets Trott back on strike and a bit of a swipe at one going down the legside almost causes him to overbalance, but he gets back to avoid the stumping. Actually, Paul, with Root and Bairstow already on regular England duty, I'll be happy for young Lyth to rediscover his form with Yorkshire. Boult to Finn. You know what comes next. Maiden. Boult did find Finn's edge with one, but it was never going to reach those slips. Neil Kimberley writes: \"There is lots of it, you just have to seek it out. Mostly in large cities and college towns. Biggest challenges are the lack of facilities, but there is a lot of enthusiasm from expats and the occasional American. It's easy to get over the internet from willow.tv. Biggest issue is that no one has picket up nz vs eng. See my team at www.maddogscricket.com. We have been playing in ny for over 22 years, have around 100 members from 15 countries. And play around 60 games each summer.\" When I'm not liveblogging, Neil, I'll look you up. Finn comes close to reaching that half-century but a smart bit of fielding restricts it to two and will make him wait a little longer. Claire Davies emails: \"Hello Mr Busfield. What a surprise! I thought you did football, but nice to see you here anyway. Look, here\u2019s the thing. Finn shouldn\u2019t still be in, Jimmy wouldn\u2019t be lasting this long! But Finn is proving a bit of a breakthrough as a nightwatchman. After a dire first innings, I think we\u2019re saving this. Would be nice to see Bell and Prior in for a bit though.\" Well, in the pragmatic sense of the proper batsmen getting some form, you're right. But I do like watching a tailender/nightwatchmen go where he's never gone before. And Finn deserves a 50 here. Another maiden from Boult who has the impressively miserly bowling figures of 29-10-41-1. Trott failed to nick a single at the end of that one, so Finn will get a chance to catch up with Trott again. Bet he's nervous, having never scored more than 35 before in any form of senior cricket. Paul Frame emails: \"Good evening Comrade Busfield, Hope the evening finds you well. With regards to outgrounds I think my favourite has to be Castle Park in Colchester, the history of the town is tremendous. Another thing in Castle Park's favour is that there's a Wimpy five minutes walk from the ground, so your colleague (and County Cricket Live!'s Chief Ian Bell officer) James Walsh will agree with me that this is a huge plus point in Castle Park's favour. Isn't Finn looking like he could get out every minute? I firmly expect the Kiwis to get him out and run through England in this session.\" Ah yes, outgrounds, I was going to talk about those before I re-discovered just how time consuming OBO-ing is. And before I was buried under an avalanche of emails (bless you all). I will return to the outgrounds conversation, Paul, I will. Fifty for Trott with a delightful drive into wide mid-on. Duncan Smith (not the former Tory grandee I presume) emails: \"I have a really poor memory for these things, but was it against India in a recent series when we got utterly battered for most of the first test then put on an epic long second innings to save the test with a lot to spare then having taken the wind out of the opposition sails, we then dominated the series? Is this a tactical first innings collapse maybe? It's the hope that gets you.\" Trott gets a single, Finn blocks and England are 47 ahead. I heard some talk of pushing on and declaring at lunchtime - no chance of that. Firstly there's the fear of losing wickets and opening the door, which has mostly been closed by this second innings application. Plus NZ have Brendon Barrie McCullum and have you ever seen him bat in a limited over game? Trott overtakes Finn during Southee's over with a four whipped through square leg and a single to nab the strike. My colleague James Walsh emails: \"Evening Steve, Ah, cricket and New York. One of my favourite memories of the city was watching bits of the Adelaide 2006-7 test in the basement of an Aussie bar in Manhattan with my Yorkshire mate and a reasonably baffled Canadian. We were the only non-Australians in the room, and thoroughly enjoyed watching Pietersen and Collingwood's epic stand. Mercifully we weren't there on the fifth day. I assume that's where you're doing this OBO from.\" No beer, Aussies, Canadians or Collingwood here, just me in a basement in Brooklyn. And you dear readers. Boult is back into the attack and bowls a maiden. Finn looking to fill his boots here. Although he will have to play the occasional stroke to manage that. Simon McMahon writes (and I swear Simon really is on a mission to feature in every single Guardian liveblog of 2013): \"Hi Steve. Midnight here in the UK now. Glad you're here to guide us through to the end. And maybe an unexpected England victory? OK, a draw then. What I'm really looking forward to is hearing from some American cricket fans. How is the king of sports over there?\" Well, hard to find on TV would be the main point on cricket in the US. But I have heard tell of some occasional action down in Florida. And there's a bunch of kids who play cricket in our local park every Sunday in the summer. A single to Finn and a four to Trott. And a lot of scratching at the crease by Trott, but you knew that already, whether you can see the pictures or not. William Bowers emails: \"I'm about an hour and a half north of you trying to get a phd thesis written in a Cafe in New Haven, Connecticut. There's a Doors cover band at Toad's Place next door, which has forced me to ask if this Test might light up a dreary evening?\" Hmmm. Not sure which is the most interesting option out of a Doors cover band, a phd thesis and this test match fifth day. What's your thesis about, William? William is also not the only US-based reader to be asking me how come I can see the cricket. Sadly, were I to share that information in a public forum, some sad rights-holder would immediately close it down. The teams amble back onto the field for the afternoon session. Can the Kiwis take some wickets to rattle England? Can Steven Finn crack on to a big score? We will soon find out... It's not been easy gaining access to a TV feed from New Zealand. Josh Robinson writes: Evening Busfield, evening everybody. Wow, I don't think I've typed that before, either. And as far as I can tell, this is your first OBO. How does it feel? I can't imagine I'd feel anything other than inadequacy, set against the backdrop of Smyth and Bull's standards. It's almost a wonder that anyone else dares step up to the keyboard, given what you have to live up to. Not that I'd want to put you under any pressure or anything. Welcome on board. Thanks Josh. No pressure there then. And you are quite right, Smith and Bull are peerless. But I think Tom's done a pretty good job this morning. And I do rather enjoy reading Rob Bagchi's OBO-ing - although that's at least partially because Rob and I enjoy many of the same obsessions, not least Yorkshire CCC and The Jam. But, no, this isn't my first OBO. That pleasure was way back in 2008, also England v New Zealand. And what I lack in cricket OBO experience I make up for in a lifelong obsession with the sport (first game: Australia v Pakistan in the 1975 World Cup) and a wide variety of liveblogging adventures (baseball, American football, basketball added to my list over the last couple of years). Plus, of course, somebody has to step up to the crease in the absence of Messrs Smyth and Bull. Or else how else would you get your OBO fix? You don't want to be reading an inferior alternative on another website. Good afternoon, evening, morning, depending upon where you are in the world. As it happens, I'm in New York, where the sun has just gone down and the damn clocks go forward tonight, meaning an hour's less kip. But that's my worry, for later. As Tom says, I'm merely a stand-in for the great Rob Smyth. Get well soon, Rob. Feel free to send in your best wishes to Mr Smyth, or your cricket related thoughts, or, indeed, anything you happen to want to chat about via email to steve.busfield@guardian.co.uk or Twitter to @Busfield. In the absence of emails/tweets, you can expect me to riff about pointless days of cricket, or cricket's outgrounds (I like the look of Dunedin), counties and their one-day names, House of Cards (which I've just watched on Netflix), the similarities/differences between cricket and baseball (with the World Baseball Classic in full swing, that's been occupying many of my thoughts recently), and maybe even New Zealand v England. So that's that for a satisfactory session for England, if scarcely an enthralling one on a moribund, not to say frankly wretched, pitch that offers nothing. You'd think the game is safe now, with the impressive nightwatchman Finn looking as well set as Trott. Compton's dismissal didn't jolt England out of their stride - well pigeon-steps - at all, and they'd have to bat twice as badly as they did in the first innings to throw this one away now. Perhaps the batsmen might throw a bit more caution to the wind once the lead is properly unassailable, to at least keep the game watchable, so make sure you join Steve Busfield across the pond after the lunch break. And you never quite know with England. Anyway, I'm off out to jostle with drunks on the Tube, and will leave you in Steve's capable hands. Thanks for all your emails. Goodnight. The final over of the morning: Finn pushes Williamson hard towards point for one, breaking a brief run log-jam. Trott livens us all up briefly, by punishing an appetising half-volley with four sumptuous runs through the covers, which is the last scoring stroke of the session. \"Queue for coffee at the University Oval down to a mere 45 minutes this morning,\" says our man in the crowd, Dominic Strogen. \"Crowd pretty subdued too.\" I could make out quite a stroppy toddler in the background on the commentary, mind. Oh, and Southee sends down some OK deliveries on a decent length, and Trott mostly sends them back again. Another maiden. Williamson bowls the ball, Finn blocks the ball. There's not much material to work with here. Maiden. Finn takes a single off a rare one from Southee that pops up a little, then Trott deftly flicks off his pads for four to square leg. And then there's a CHANCE! Southee finds Trott's edge but it barely reaches McCullum and an opportunity goes begging. \"Soul-destroying for the bowlers,\" says Bumble. And it is. Finn squirts one from Williamson through the slips, which almost carried to the fielder but ends up tricking away to third man for three more. \"I don't smuggle drinks into test matches,\" begins Peter Newman with ominous pomposity. \"I'm fairly certain that paying way over the odds for watered down London Pride and then moaning is one of the things which made the empire. Of course, I only go to Lords' tests these days...\" Have any of the History Boffins got any thoughts on the relationship between booze-starved negativity and rapacious colonialism? On cue, here's Keith Flett: \"Finn does not deserve the enormous condecension of posterity (EP Thompson 1963) He has done better than nearly all England's first innings\" Southee returns, to little effect, and the 50 partnership is brought up, and a very good one it has been in the circumstances, though this infernal pitch is making it easier than it might be for them. Finn is, as Beefy correctly observes, finding batting rather more fun than bowling on this track. More from Williamson, with Trott taking one from an unthreatening over. Bumble and Botham are mumbling on about worrying sheep, or something, and bacon. I think it's Banter. \"I've been to a test with Josh Robinson,\" in-jokes Phil Sawyer. \"I think I can confidently say that his plan of pointing over a steward's shoulder and shouting 'look over there!' before legging it towards the stand isn't quite the Moriarty level of planning genius he may think. He may have developed more studious methods since then.\" A beautiful drive through the off-side from Trott off Wagner brings another boundary. My OBO stints seem to bring out the best in the sometimes-maligned No3. Last time I was on, he was England's most assertive player in the otherwise suffocatingly dour finale to the Nagpur Test in December. He owes me a pint. \"England should declare once Finn gets his hundred,\" demands Simon McMahon. \"Hope that doesn't jinx him. Or England.\" A change of bowling. Some-time off-spinner Kane Williamson is on for Martin. His second ball is a howler, absurdly short and bouncing way down legside. But there's no run from it, or any other delivery. It's a maiden. Trying to gauge New Zealand's mood here: the pre-match discussion focused a lot on their off-field malaise. Will spirits be lifted by the way they started here, or how they seem to be tailing off now? New Zealand's attack is looking knackered at the moment, a factor behind Wagner conceding a wide with a wayward away swinger, and Trott just watching a spate of similar deliveries sail past him. If this carries on, will/should England go for a cheeky declaration and a bit of bowling practice when the game's safe or just grind New Zealand down? Or will everyone be as asleep as the worse-for-wear Barmy Army type the cameras just zoomed in on? Martin continues. Trott pushes him through midwicket for another agreeable three. This pair look poised and confident, he says, flirting with the jinx-ometer. It's certainly been an excellent response to Compton's dismissal. A quarter-chance from Wagner, offered by Finn to gully, flies through at catchable height for four. McCullum moves point into a catching position in response. But Finn leaves the next two balls, innocuous away-swingers each. \"My dear chap,\" responds Chris Bourne, pouring himself another brandy no doubt. \"I am nothing like Rowley Birkin. Birkin is a QC, for a start.\" Trott and Finn's aggression has already pushed New Zealand's close fielders back from Martin's bowling. Finn gets one more with a square sweep and Trott adds another couple to bring up the 300. Pitch discussions in the commentary box centre on whether this one is \"too good\". It's not good at all though is it, and Michael Atherton concurs. You need more help for the bowlers, and a bit of old-school fifth-day deterioration England have the lead! Finn flicks Wagner away on the leg-side for two to give England a well-earned lead, and then he has a pleasing old lash at the next ball in the air through extra cover for three more. There's been a pleasing number of threes in an otherwise slow-scoring morning today. Just as Finn's batting is being bigged up in commentary box and OBO hovel alike, he plays an ugly hoik across the line at Martin, prompting Trott to trot down the pitch for a word. Finn's next attempt at a shot works rather better, a clanking sweep for two. Josh Robinson emails with some tips about smuggling drink into a certain Test ground, which I cannot condone, obviously, and would surely be blowing his scam by revealing here. I'm doing you a favour here Josh. Also not to be condoned is some students in fancy dress, whom the cameras have just picked out in Dunedin. Wagner comes over the wicket at Trott, whose swivelling nicely off the back foot, and gets one more through midwicket. Wagner switches back round the wicket at Finn and digs two in short, but Finn gets out of the way with no alarm. It prompts Wagner to overpitch, to which Finn responds with a lovely drive through extra cover. This is batting, as Sir Geoffrey might say. And Trott responds with another four through mid-on himself. Good stuff from both batsmen here. Trott takes one from a low full toss. Martin already looks a bit weary, while Finn's facial expression now has an almost cocky air. If I'm not jinxing him now. Chris Bourne, meanwhile, has a Gower anecdote: \"I can't tell you why they called Gower \"Lubo\" in his playing days, but when he was at school he was known as \"Slag Gower\". We were contemporaries at King's Canterbury, where the golden-haired one was prone to escaping over the precinct wall of a night to predate upon local temptresses. I wished I could say I had bowled him out, or something, but that was nigh on impossible. I suppose the only time I truly dented his confidence was when I roped him in to play various parts in a recreation of a Goon Show script - the Dreaded Batter Pudding Hurler of Bexhill-on-Sea, if memory serves. His vocal technique as Eccles was superb, but his timing was slightly adrift. He wafted the lines, you might say...\" I'm imagining all that being said in a Rowley Birkin from the Fast Show style. Trott glides Wagner down to deep square leg for a single, leaving Finn on strike for most of the over, but he looks well set now and he's playing some decent shots, such as a confident crack through extra cover for two here. A beautifully timed on-drive brings Trott a first boundary as he continues his assertive start. McCullum's also being admirably assertive with his field placings - there's three round the bat for Martin now - as he seeks to induce the same error from Trott as he played in the first innings. No sign of it yet though. And that's drinks. Fittingly, here's Phil Sawyer - again: \"Food rituals? When watching a test at Trent Bridge, always buy a box of bhajis and samosas from the wonderful Indian food stall behind the West Wing at lunchtime. Keeps me munching and sticky fingered with chilli sauce and raita all the way through the afternoon, that does.\" Good recommendation. That certainly sets you up for a swifty in the Vart and Fiddle or Old Trype to Jerusalem afterwards, God I love Trent Bridge. Trott gets off the mark straight away, turning the ball away two through the leg side. And repeats the trick next ball. A confident start from the allegedly-dour one. But this has now got a tad nervy, so I can't imagine how Phil Sawyer's feeling. More on mother's day, from a mother: \"I have told my family what to do,\" explains Jessica MacDonald let me lie in past six o'clock, cook me a full English, then we're going for a walk. After which I will pay for lunch at a place of my choosing. If I can also manage to go to the loo without an audience, they can believe they have given me the best present ever. English cricket fan definition: low expectations, certain to be dashed.\" Textbook. Wagner slides one into Compton's pads, he and Finn ponder an appeal, but the nightwatchman tells him it's a fair cop and he's a goner. The end of a composed, timely innings, for player and team there. So do we have a game again? We have spin, and Martin, and Compton deals with it competently, chopping square on the offside for one. \"Nothing quite like sitting in the sun at a beautiful ground, listening to Aggers describe a pork pie in minute detail on the radio. Hello from Dunedin!\" boasts Dominic Strogen. Personally, when I go to the cricket, I don't tuck into lunch until after midday, or after 50 runs have been scored. Same goes for drink. Any other food/booze consumption rituals? Both Compton and Finn are looking comfortable on the front foot, with Wagner pitching it up more, and this is now Finn's longest innings for England. A commendable effort. Compton takes three with a crisp drive through the covers. And Finn follows up with another edged four down to the vacant third man boundary. \"Lubo?\" wonders Gary Naylor of Gower's nickname. \"Lubi Lou from Andy Pandy.\" Compton pushes a neat cover drive past mid-off for one, in a rare piece of strike-rotation this morning. It looks nice and sunny indeed in Dunedin now, though one gets the sense that away supporters outnumber home ones, which is testimony to England's excellent support but is a bit depressing in some respects. Finn handles another over from Wagner well. It's a maiden, as per, but that won't bother England. \"As we're apparently doing name checks for spouses,\" says Dan Lucas (actually I'm not sure we were, but no matter), \"can I get one for my other half Liz Evans? Last night we were both kept awake from 2am onwards thanks to next door's fire alarm, only for me to leave her alone tonight as I head down to my parents' before mothers day... and discover they've gone away and I forgot my keys. Still, we're off to see My Bloody Valentine tomorrow, which should be a lot of fun.\" And loads noisier than the fire alarm, I should think. Boult still can't get Finn, who adds another run to his total with an effortless flick to fine leg. He's had a really good match with the bat, Finn. Josh Robinson can't stay away from his computer, as Modern Internet Types generally can't, and is now wondering why David Gower was nicknamed 'Lubo' in his playing days, as alluded to in Vic Marks' lovely piece on Nick Compton. Anyone? The tigerishly keen Wagner comes into the attack in place of Southee. But Compton sees out another maiden. \"Evening Davies, evening everybody,\" chirps Josh Robinson. \"I'm not sure I've typed that particular combination of works before. And am I right in thinking that we're about to witness Steve Busfield's OBO d\u00e9but? I certainly don't remember seeing him do one before. Is he coming into Guardian Towers for the night, or joining us from the US, without having to stay awake through the night. And what's happened to Smyth?\" Rob Smyth is unwell. Seriously, he is. Stomach-virus-nack. Steve B over in the States has manipulated the Internet to find a US feed of the match so he'll be keeping the insomniacs and the drunks company in sessions two and three, while I toddle off for cocoa and a biscuit. Boult's still trying to get at Finn with some bounce but it's not perturbing the nightwatchman, who's also playing some stout, correct, upright defensive shots. Boult does find the right line and length with one away swinger, though, which Finn stretches at and is beaten all ends up by in a \"that were too good for thee, lad\" style. Another maiden. \"Speaking of getting brownie points for mother's day,\" adds Ben Jones. \"I just packed my partner off to bed for a nice bit of kip whilst I look after our newborn daughter. I neglected to tell her the cricket was on. Nothing better than test matches on the other side of the world when you have a baba that doesn't know night from day yet.\" This has definitely never occurred to any other parent of a young baby, ever. Compton clips the ball through the legside for two and breaks his bat in the process - excitement! And then puts away an awful ball from Southee through midwicket for four. Which makes Tim Lezard's email momentarily untopical: \"Is it too early in the day, even as a Gloucestershire fan, to berate Nick Compton for slow scoring? Nick Compton? Nick Snoreton, more like!\" Bad puns. Unnecessary negativity and moaning. That's what Gloucestershire fans do regardless isn't it? We could almost be huddling on deckchairs at Cheltenham on a gloomy Sunday. Appropriately, Botham's now berating teetotalers. Boult finds a bit of bounce at Finn, but it's not accurate enough to trouble him. There's still movement, but a receding threat (note to Phil Sawyer: that's that jinxing thing again, I guess). It's another maiden. \"You wouldn't get a result here in two weeks,\" reckons Botham. Well England had a good stab at it on days two and three. \"Oh for the days when pitches deteriorated rather than eased. When did this happen?\"sighs Gary Naylor. I share your sighs Gary. Day five should be about five men round the bat for suddenly dominant full-time and part-time spinners alike. Southee swings six scoreless balls innocuously at Compton, who largely leaves well alone. Dig in folks. It's gonna be that sort of evening. This pitch is still mercilessly sluggish. New Zealand's bowlers aren't doing much wrong, and they're finding easy movement, but it's a hard slog for them. Finn sees off a maiden without too much discomfort. \"Mothers' Day tomorrow, Tom,\" grovels Simon McMahon, \"so maybe we could give OBO mentions to those special people without whom none of us would be here. That's right, thank you internet service providers. HONK! Actually, a mention for Mrs McMahon would gain me some valuable brownie points. Have a great day tomorrow, Lisa. You deserve it!\" Hmm. This is not a get-out-of-the-family-doghouse-free service. You've got work to do still I think Simon. Any OBO-ers' mums want to offer their own thoughts? Compton gets off the mark for the day with a delicious textbook-perfect cover drive from an overpitched one from Southee. He's finding swing but no real pace and he's keeping his shorter stuff, such as it is, back for Finn. But Compton looks to be middling it well again Finn balloons another boundary square and in the air on the offside off Boult. Dare I say it, but this looks like valuable crease occupation from the Middlesex man. No I daren't say it. He's well beaten by the final delivery of the over which cuts back on him. \"What exactly happens when someone gets a name check?\" asks Phil Sawyer. \"Are hoards of Guardian staffers now feverishly checking Ms Sticklands' birth and marriage certificates? 'Yup, that's her.' I could probably do with one myself. I've been called Phil Swayer so often on these OBO pages in the past I'm beginning to wonder whether it's my real name.\" Something like that Phil yeah. Data journalism, or something, I think it's called. Big shout for lbw. Finn is beaten by an inswinger after two away-swingers but Rauf correctly says no. Good decision, but fine bowling too. Finn's hanging his bat out a bit here, which works on some occasions but not others. He adds four through backward point off the first ball of Southee's over but is also beaten dangling it out for the subsequent one. The tail-ender tucks one away at the end of the over to keep the strike, confidently enough. Further replays show that Finn's edge to slip in Southee's over did carry, but not an easy chance. The left-armer Trent Boult nips one across Compton and digs another sharply into his pads in a decent over. Good start from New Zealand. \"Can I just get my wife - Katy Stickland - a name check,\" asks John Stickland. \"We are in Tobago and about to go off to the bar for some cricket and karaoke! She would appreciate it as she gets nervous at the prospect of the England batting line up and at having to sing!\" Consider it checked Southee starts with a short but unthreatening one at Finn, but there's some (gentle) swing there.The nightwatchman creams a rather pleasant shot through the covers to get off the mark, and Southee then induces an edge that falls just short of second slip. The Barmy Army belt out Jerusalem - but the crowd is sufficiently small in number on this occasion that you can individually pick out the people who are singing off key. \"The most interesting thing for me on the first session, before sleep overcomes me,\" says Chris Weston, \"is whether Finn can pull off the kind of nightwatchman's innings that the late Neil Williams managed in the final test of the 1990 summer. Odds against it I guess...\" Half an hour tops, to be honest, I reckon Chris. Anyway, here they come. They're playing Bruce Hornsby and the Range's MOR mid-80s hit The Way It Is over the PA system in Dunedin, which seems unusually un-bombastic these days. Interestingly, The Way It Is was in the charts round about the time New Zealand won in England in 1986. Don't ask me why I remember this. And Phil Sawyer kicks us off with a stern reprimand: \"Evening Tom. You won't win many friends round here with that kind of jinxing talk. I think you'll find England supporters of a certain vintage will be confidently predicting a collapse of epic proportions in this first session and NZ to have knocked off the 50-odd token runs they need to win by mid afternoon. Relaxed? I'm more on edge than a bag of cats at England having to bat at least two more sessions to make this test safe.\" That's possibly the first time I've been called an optimist in any sporting context - let's just say I'm trialling a new act. I feel your anxiety, Phil, but not - yet - quite your foreboding. I'll submit myself to your People's Justice should I be proven wrong. It looks a bit sunnier in Dunedin now and, as Steve Harmison has just informed us from his vantage point in the Sky studio in London, \"it's warming up.\" Not that that changes the calculations much at this stage. England still just have to bat and bat. And welcome, at the start of what should be a more relaxed, not to say soporific, final day in Dunedin, after England's resolute fourth-day fightback. After the previous two days had us summoning up memories of such past New Zealand debacles as this, or even, going back a bit further, this, we're now tentatively edging more towards Brisbane 2010-11 territory, and the sort of serene, record-busting batting rescue that feels a little like a victory. Nick Compton's focused century means no England batsman can reasonably be said to be under any great pressure, which should - should - enable them to see the job through and save a Test they looked like tossing away after a recklessly poor first innings. But the tourists still trail, New Zealand have impressed in this match, and there's a job to be done yet. Which, with the weather cloudy and on the chilly side, at a tree-lined ground with grass banks all around, and a day's dogged, slow-scoring time-accumulation in prospect, couldn't scream Proper Cricket more forcefully than if the words 'Proper Cricket' were painted onto the outfield, which, of course, would be a most un-Proper Cricket thing to happen. From England's point of view, Compton and next man in Jonathan Trott look like the men for this occasion, on a pretty lifeless surface, but you never know."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
