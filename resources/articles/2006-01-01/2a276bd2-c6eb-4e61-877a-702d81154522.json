He might miss England's next friendly in early March. Owen's part in the entertainment at White Hart Lane yesterday ended in the minute added on at the end of the first half. Alan Shearer had put him through in the penalty area, Paul Robinson dived at his feet and the striker rolled away in pain. An X-ray at the ground revealed that Owen had broken his fifth metatarsal in his right foot: \"The same as David Beckham, I believe,\" Graeme Souness said later. It is not the best news for Sven Goran-Eriksson as he puts together his World Cup strategy with the first of three pre-tournament friendlies on 1 March, against opposition yet to be named. \"This is a dark day for us, given what has happened to Michael,\" Souness said after his team's 2-0 defeat. \"He could be out for several months.\" Asked to clarify the length of time out, he said: \"At least a month or so.\" History suggests this sort of injury to the delicate metatarsal bones on the forefoot can take anywhere between six weeks and four months to heal. Beckham sustained his injury against Deportivo La Coruna in a Champions League game in April 2002, and did not play for the rest of the domestic season. There were still questions about his fitness at the World Cup, where he infamously skipped out of a tackle against Brazil, a mistake that led to Rivaldo's goal at the end of the first half in the quarter-final. Wayne Rooney broke a metatarsal against Portugal in the quarter-final of the European Championships in June 2004 and took the summer to recover. Steven Gerrard was out for two months last season, Gary Neville for four, and Scott Parker missed five months. Martin Jol, relieved to get through what was a generally awful game of football and keep Tottenham's push to the upper reaches of the Premiership on course, was full of sympathy for Souness and Owen. \"When Michael Owen is playing with [Alan] Shearer, they always seem to win matches, even away from home,\" he said. He was especially wary of Newcastle yesterday, given they had their midweek match against Charlton called off. Owen and Shearer had been anonymous for much of a sub-standard first half, the ball rarely working free of an untidy midfield. A minute after the scheduled 45, Shearer brought down a long pass, turned and slid a perfectly weighted ball just into the area. Owen, alive to the chance, slipped his marker but found Robinson bearing down fast on him. The keeper threw himself at Owen's feet and the striker fell awkwardly, his foot obviously mashed in the tackle. He received attention at the ground and left for further treatment. It has been a star-crossed return to England for the national team's number one striker. Since he signed for Newcastle from Real Madrid, where he never seemed to be fully appreciated, he has struggled with groin and hamstring problems. Souness said he had carried niggles into yesterday's game and was never wholly comfortable. Now he will have to hope that whatever damage he has done to his precious right foot heels quickly. Souness could hardly contain his disappointment. \"Even when we are not playing particularly well, with Michael Owen in the team you can win things. It's an absolute disaster for Michael Owen, and an absolute disaster for us.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
