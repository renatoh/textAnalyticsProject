Thanks for following all the tennis coverage throughout the year. After an exhausting, endless eleven month season, it all begins again in five weeks. Here is Kevin Mitchell\u2019s final report after a very eventful first Davis Cup Finals in Madrid. It was dramatic and entertaining, among many other things. There is plenty to think about going into 2020. Spanish Davis Cup captain Sergi Bruguera: Can you imagine? Yesterday, Roberto was in the funeral of his father and now he\u2019s giving everything... I have no idea how to describe this with words.. He also noted that the Spanish team didn\u2019t go to sleep before 3am. What an exhausting week. Rafael Nadal after Spain\u2019s sixth Davis Cup title: Have been an amazing week. A lot of things we went through: [the] father of Roberto passed away. Marcel [Granollers] stayed stiff with the lower back and he couldn\u2019t move. Pablo got injured in the singles. We went through a lot. I could not be happier. Have been unforgettable moments in this amazing stadium. The crowd was just a joke. We can\u2019t thank them enough. Our team spirit prevailed, we fighted hard. Nadal ends the 2019 season as the oldest ever ATP year end number one at 33 and with titles at Roland Garros, the US Open, Rome, Montreal and the Davis Cup. He has had many incredible seasons, but given his age, this one easily ranks as one of the best. Nobody, including the man himself, expected him to be competing at this level after so long considering how physical his brand of tennis is. It\u2019s a reflection of his perseverance but also of how efficient he has become over the years. He is no longer the blindingly fast claycourter playing from 10 feet behind the baseline. He drove Spain to the title by serving exceptionally, being consistently aggressive, moving forward to the net whenever he could and showing that he is also a phenomenal doubles player. All credit to Roberto Bautista Agut who lost his father three days ago, left the team to be with his family and then returned to help his team win. No doubt he found solace in the most familiar place in the world for him - the tennis court. All credit to Denis Shapovalov for playing about as well as he can throughout that second set and then finding an incredible second wind with the championship on the line. However, Nadal has been incredible throughout this week in both singles and doubles and you just knew that he would find a way to win the important points and secure the win. The Spaniard is well known for his intensity but it\u2019s hard to remember him as intense and pumped up from the first point onwards, as he has been throughout the week. This tournament has been another reminder that although the 33 year old is one of the greatest individual athletes in history, he is also a great team player. Just impressive.

A good question from Ian that I have no answer to: Why do the players always take the head gear off immediately the match ends? It\u2019s like a ritual before they can shake hands at the net.

Nadal slams down an unreturned serve to depart from his first service game with an easy love hold. Nadal still hasn\u2019t lost his serve all week in singles or doubles. Shapovalov got his first glimpse of how tough that will be. The players are out on court. Shapovalov will almost certainly enter the stadium believing that he can win. After all, the Canadian\u2019s big breakthrough match was his 3-6 6-4 7-6(4) win over Nadal to reach the semi-finals at home in Montreal two years ago. He is probably in the best, most consistent form of his career so far after winning his first title in Stockholm and then reaching the Paris Masters final last month. Shapovalov has arguably the biggest game of all the youngsters and it seems clear that he is simply going to have to play at his very highest level just to have a chance against a Nadal competing at such a high level. He will need to serve extremely well, limit his double faults, keep points short, take his huge forehand to Nadal and use these fast conditions to his favour. It is all easier said than done. Emotional scenes inside the stadium as Bautista Agut addressed the crowd in Spanish. Needless to say, that win for Bautista Agut was likely a huge tipping point in the tie. For much of this week, Nadal has had to dig Spain out from 0-1 deficits before dragging his team over the line in doubles and he has played some incredible tennis throughout. In order to keep Canada in the tie, 20 year old Shapovalov has to defeat the best player in the world at his very best. It doesn\u2019t get much tougher than that. Roberto Bautista Agut after the match: It was very special, very special feeling on the court today. I could just go out on the court and give my best. I\u2019m very happy that I could win the first point for Spain. The only stat that matters: 18 unforced errors for Roberto Bautista Agut, 45 unforced errors for Felix Auger Aliassime. Roberto Bautista Agut seals off one of the biggest wins of his career with a love hold. What a moment and what fortitude from the Spaniard after such a testing week. Chants of \u201cRoberto!\u201d rang across the crowd as he jumped into the arms of his teammates. Second set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-7(3) 3-5* Roberto Bautista Agut. Auger Aliassine finds a hold and forces the Spaniard to serve it all out, but even that was so tough. The Canadian sped to a 40-15 lead and looked well en route to a confident hold, but then he double faulted badly and sprayed backhand down the line well wide. Bautista offered him another bite at a hold with a rare forehand error of his own at deuce, but the Canadian shanked another forehand on game point well wide. For all his struggles today, Auger Aliassime has battled for every single point. At deuce, he swept into the net behind an inside out forehand and he found a good serve to hold. Let\u2019s see if Bautista Agut can hold his nerve at the end. Second set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-7(3) *2-5 Roberto Bautista Agut. Auger Aliassime continues to fight and he dragged Bautista Agut to 30-30 on his serve with a great combination of forehands in a long return game.

Second set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-7(3) 2-4* Roberto Bautista Agut. Bautista breaks again! That did not last very long. Bautista Agut restored the break with his best return game of the match. In particular, a brilliant crosscourt forehand passing shot from the Spaniard moved him up 0-30 and excellent returning throughout. The Canadian blasted a forehand well long on the first break point to relinquish the break. Second set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-7(3) *2-3 Roberto Bautista Agut. Auger Aliassime breaks back! The Spaniard may have been up a break but he never really played like a player on the front foot and he gifted too many uncharacteristic errors to the Canadian. A forehand error and a double fault from the Spaniard brought up break point. He saved the first with a neat forehand dropshot, but on the second point the Canadian blasted a forehand down the line winner. The linesperson called the ball out, but hawkeye overruled. We\u2019re back on serve. Second set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-7(3) 1-3* Roberto Bautista Agut. The Canadian secures a crucial hold, but he is living so dangerously right now. From 30-15, he sprayed another forehand well long before double faulting under pressure at 30-30. But he responded really well, saving the break point with a big first serve and then striking a violent inside out forehand winner at deuce. He held with a big unreturned serve and a booming \u2018c\u2019mon\u2019. His second serve may be edgy and his forehand may be leaking but there\u2019s no doubt that this 19 year old is going to fight. Great hold. Since the tiebreak, things have been quite ugly on that forehand wing. Second set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-7(3) *0-3 Roberto Bautista Agut. Just as it looked like Bautista Agut was beginning to separate himself from Auger Aliassime at 40-15, he suddenly found himself facing a break point. From double game point up, the Spaniard framed a forehand out and then watched as Auger Aliassime crushed a forehand down the line after a fortunate net cord. At deuce then Bautista Agut sent a bad drive volley flying out. A huge, unexpected opportunity for the youngster to get back on track and it seems like the pressure just got to him. From break point up, Auger Aliassime hit three quite horrendous forehand errors in succession. The opportunity disappeared in the blink of an eye. Second set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-7(3) 0-2* Roberto Bautista Agut. Bautista Agut breaks! Sadly for the Canadian, his game is beginning to come apart at the seams. After being dragged to deuce, he double faulted on two consecutive deuce points to offer up break points. He saved the first break point with a big overhead and the second by forcing an error with a wicked crosscourt forehand, but the nerves were written across his face. On the third break point Canadian sent a short forehand well long. He will continue to fight but it\u2019s a long road back from here. Second set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-7(3) *0-1 Roberto Bautista Agut: Bautista Agut continues to apply the pressure, holding to 15 with ease. Quite an astonishing point at 30-15, with the Spaniard retrieving an overhead from Auger Aliassime and throwing up a defensive lob. The Canadian seemed to think the lob was floating out and he could only respond to the lob with a limp forehand before eventually shanking the ball out. He finished the game with a small shake of his head. Across the net, Bautista Agut looks ready for anything. Roberto Bautista Agut hit only two groundstroke winners in that entire set in fast conditions, but that\u2019s just what he does. He ground the youngster down and he was rock solid when it really mattered in the tiebreak. The crowd finished the set chanting \u201cole, ole, ole\u201d for the world to hear. Let\u2019s see if Auger Aliassime can respond in this set. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-7(3) Roberto Bautista Agut! Bautista Agut takes the first set! After the break, he just tore away from the Canadian. He took the first mini-break with a huge crosscourt backhand return, forcing a backhand error from the youngster. Auger Aliassime responded with a wild inside out forehand wide. The Canadian panicked on his final forehand, sending it wide to relinquish the set. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-6 (3-3*) Roberto Bautista Agut: There is absolutely nothing separating the two at the break. A gorgeous forehand dropshot from Bautista Agut to lead 2-1, to which Auger Aliassime responded with a pair of vicious forehands, moving the Spaniard from side to side until he forced a backhand error. Auger Aliassime moved up 3-2 with a curling wide ace. The Spaniard levelled the tiebreak with huge inside-out forehand behind a big serve. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-6 Roberto Bautista Agut: Aside from the one tight game on Bautista Agut\u2019s serve at 4-4, this set has been a server\u2019s dream. Just ten points lost between them on serve. As Auger Aliassime dumps a backhand into the net, we are off to a tiebreak. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime 6-5* Roberto Bautista Agut: Auger Aliassime has served really well and executed his first forehand behind the serve so well, burying most short balls with conviction. He strings together another love hold, closing it off with a big unreturned serve out wide. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime *5-5 Roberto Bautista Agut: A much-needed quick hold for Bautista Agut after wrestling with break point in his previous service game. Some great serving from the Spaniard and he finished with a big crosscourt forehand behind a big serve. We\u2019re not too far from a tiebreak now. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime 5-4* Roberto Bautista Agut: The youngster has really found his way on serve. He slammed down his third ace to reach triple game point and eventually held to 15 by forcing a Bautista Agut backhand error after a frantic rally. The youngster continues to win plenty of these long exchanges against one of the most consistent players around and he should take a lot of heart from that. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime *4-4 Roberto Bautista Agut: Auger Aliassime hadn\u2019t won a single return point after three return games, but in the fourth game he did so with aplomb, picking off a great overhead for a 15-30 lead. The Spaniard responded with an unreturned serve, but at 30-30 Auger-Aliassime came up with a brilliant forehand down the line passing shot to bring up break point. How did Bautista Agut respond?

It took Bautista Agut a couple of game points, but on the third deuce he connected with an incredible crosscourt forehand off a low slice. He finally scuppered the danger on his third game point by grinding Auger Aliassime down with some brutal, flat hitting, until the Canadian dumped a backhand into the net. The crowd roared, Feliciano Lopez thumped his chest. A brilliant hold. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime 4-3* Roberto Bautista Agut: Auger Aliassime has found a nice rhythm on his serve and he puts together a second consecutive love hold, sealed with a big unreturned serve down the T. Conditions are so fast at Madrid\u2019s altitude which means that dominant serving is to be expected. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime *3-3 Roberto Bautista Agut: For all his great work in his service games, Auger Aliassime is spraying a few too many errors on return. Bautista Agut picks up a third love hold to level the match after a series of forehand errors from Auger Aliassime. The Spaniard still hasn\u2019t dropped a point on his serve and the pressure returns to the youngster. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime 3-2* Roberto Bautista Agut: The most impressive aspect of Auger Aliassime\u2019s breakthrough year has been his performances on clay and slower surfaces this year. He is putting those lessons into action against the defence of Bautista Agut in these long rallies today. He won another long rally at 15-0, ending the point with a wicked crosscourt forehand. From 30-0, he finished with a great backhand down the line winner followed by a big ace down the T. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime *2-2 Roberto Bautista Agut: The Spaniard levels the set with another great love hold, sealed with a big unreturned serve. Before that, Auger Aliassime offered up three consecutive backhand errors to bring up 40-0. Too many gifts from the youngster. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime 2-1* Roberto Bautista Agut: A pumped up Auger Aliassime digs out a brilliant hold from 0-30 down, his confidence building. The Spaniard opened with a brilliant crosscourt forehand return, forcing an error from the Canadian. A missed forehand from Auger-Aliassime brought up 0-30 and a loud \u201cvamos!\u201d The youngster responded well, winning a long physical rally with an inside out forehand winner to level the game at 30-30. Then at 30-30, Auger-Aliassime came up with the rally of the match, grinding out a forehand error after the longest point of all. He held with a big unreturned serve. These rallies are already long and they should suit the Spaniard. He will not be happy about that missed opportunity. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime *1-1 Roberto Bautista Agut: The Spaniard responds with a solid hold of his own. The rallies are already longer on Bautista\u2019s serve and he is already showing his consistency, grinding a few forehand errors out of the Canadian. At 40-0, he slammed down an ace out wide to hold to love. Both players are off to a good start. First set: Felix Auger Aliassime 1-0* Roberto Bautista Agut: Auger-Aliassime opened with a huge forehand down the line winner, then a he swept into the net and picked off a sweeet volley. After reaching 40-0, he double faulted and then shanked a forehand well long. But at 40-0, he slammed down an ace down the T. Plenty of conviction from the Canadian, but also some nerves. A good start. So, who will win this first rubber? Auger-Aliassime and Bautista Agut have never faced each other. The Spaniard is enjoying the best season of his career and he currently sits at his best ranking of 9. Bautista is such a unique player with extremely flat groundstrokes that almost never miss. His forehand is one of the best around and he backs it up with great movement and return. However, the Spaniard\u2019s Davis Cup record isn\u2019t the best. His Davis Cup record is just 7-6 and he has lost a few significant matches over the years, including earlier in the week against Andrey Rublev. This has been an incredible breakout year for Auger-Aliassime, who reached the top 20 earlier this year and reached his first Masters 1000 semi-final in March. The tennis season is so gruelling and he seemed to run out of gas in the final weeks. The Canadian will have to serve extremely well and control the match with his forehand, or else the Spaniard will break him down. This match comes with many more intangibles than a regular event. Auger-Aliassime has never competed under this amount of pressure before and he comes in undercooked. He hasn\u2019t played since early October after injuring his ankle and this is just his third Davis Cup match (his record is 1-1). For Bautista, this has clearly been a devastating week after his father passed away. He will be seeking solace at home on the tennis court. Roberto Bautista-Agut before the final: \u201cIt\u2019s gonna be amazing to play the final with our crowd. Happy with the situation of the team, happy about the effort of my teammates and hope to enjoy the final. If we can, we will take the win.\u201d The players are coming out. Felix Auger-Aliassime in his pre-match interview: \u201cIt\u2019s unbelievable. It\u2019s historic for my part. My ankle has been great for the past week. I\u2019ve been on the sideline and ready to go all week.\u201d The new edition of the Davis Cup is partly run by Gerard Pique, so it should come as no surprise that Shakira is currently performing in the closing ceremony before the final. Play will begin shortly. Great Britain\u2019s Davis Cup captain speaks. The nominations are and we have a big shock. 19 year-old Felix Auger-Aliassime has been drafted in for his very first match of the week, replacing Vasek Pospisil. Pospisil has been incredible for Canada this week, winning his first three singles matches and leading the doubles team, but he did look quite exhausted in his 6-4 6-4 loss to Andrey Rublev yesterday. He also hurt his shin after colliding with the net post in doubles. Auger-Aliassime will face Roberto Bautista Agut who, as expected, will compete for the first time since his father passed away this week. If needed, Pospisil will likely to return to the court for the doubles. Hello! Welcome to our coverage of the title match of the Davis Cup Finals in Madrid. After all the arguments and discussion about the new era of this historic competition, this has been some week. There have been organisational issues, matches finishing past 4am, half-empty stadiums and plenty of valid criticisms of this abbreviated format, but the biggest takeaway is that tennis is tennis regardless of where it is played. As long as the core scoring system remains intact and the players care enough to produce their best, this sport is always going to be exciting and desperately tense. Few days of tennis this year have been as tense as yesterday\u2019s semi-finals, where Canada recovered from 0-1 down to vanquish Russia. First Denis Shapovalov edged out a three set win over Karen Khachanov, then Shapovalov and Vasek Pospisil defeated Khachanov and Andrey Rublev in an excruciating third set tiebreak. Last night\u2019s tie between Great Britain and Spain produced three straight sets matches but somehow the stakes felt even higher, even more desperate, with Nadal almost single-handedly dragging Spain into the final. After Kyle Edmund\u2019s solid win over Feliciano Lopez, Nadal blitzed Dan Evans and then carried a struggling Lopez into the final with an incredible win over Neal Skupski and Jamie Murray 7-6(3) 7-6(8). In a year that Nadal won two Grand slams and finished as the oldest ever ATP year end number one, few moments have impressed as much as the way he saved Great Britain\u2019s set points in the second set tiebreak. So, here we are. The Spanish team was decimated yesterday after Lopez was forced to step in following the tragic death of Roberto Bautista Agut\u2019s father and injuries ruled out Pablo Carreno Busta and Marcel Granollers. We still await the official nominations but there are rumours that No 9 Bautista Agut, who returned to support his teammates yesterday from the bench, could return to the court today. The clear priority is his mental health, but if he does feel okay to play, it will clearly tip the scales heavily in Spain\u2019s favour. Across the net, Canada have played with only two players this week, Denis Shapovalov and Vasek Pospisil, and they have been spectacular. They will almost certainly rely on their two heroes again as they contest their first ever Davis Cup final. What a breakthrough year this has been for Canadian tennis, from their first ever Grand Slam champion in Bianca Andreescu to their rising stars on the ATP. A victory would be the perfect way to end it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
