He answered: 'I've never worked a day in my life, so how can I retire?' He is now 82 and still not working and still not retiring. Indolence, he explains, is the curse of the Cavendishes - they do very little but they do it well. He once wrote a Spectator diary which started: 'January is the month when I re-arrange the books in the guest bedrooms here at Chatsworth.' One waited agog to discover what else he did in January but, apart from musing on crocuses, that was it. Admittedly, the Duke has several dozen more guest bedrooms than you or I. Nevertheless, as a month's occupation it seemed rather thin. However, one must not take the Duke's self-disparagement too seriously. He is relentlessly, almost tediously, modest, insisting that he has done nothing in life, has no achievements to his name. But actually he has done what dukes are meant to do - survived death duties, hung on to the family silver, provided an heir - while also doing an awful lot for charity. He has supported the London Library for years; he has been president of the RNIB, the National Association for Deaf Children, Mencap, endless Derbyshire charities. He also backed the SDP when it started, but left when David Owen did - he thought Owen was 'the best of them'. Before that, he served as a minister in Macmillan's government and was awarded the Military Cross in the war. So he has not been quite as useless as he likes to proclaim. And I already know that he is a kind man. Years ago, I wrote to him saying that I understood he had some Lucian Freuds in the private rooms at Chatsworth and I would love to see them. I didn't pretend to be an art scholar, I just said I was a Freud fan. He wrote by return, saying, 'Come to lunch' and we had a very pleasant lunch \u00e0 deux, served by his butler, with champagne for me though none for him, and he let me look at the Freuds as long as I wanted. Then he said he was going to London that afternoon and we could travel on the same train. His chauffeur drove us in the Bentley to Chesterfield station, where the Duke insisted on buying me a first-class ticket so that I could sit with him. I concluded that he must be terribly lonely, to seem to value my company so much. But now I realise it was just another example of his famously good manners. This time when I go to Chatsworth, there are no Freuds to be seen because they are all down in London at the Tate. Instead, he takes me to his private library and shows me some of his recent purchases - a topnotch Lowry, a William Nicholson of flowers, an Elizabeth Blackadder. It is strange that he still buys pictures when he is virtually blind, but it has become a habit. He also buys books, though he can't read them, and he takes me along the bookshelves pointing out his treasures: the complete works of Winston Churchill in first editions, a full run of Horizon. Everywhere he goes, he dislodges great stacks of books which are heaped all over the floor. At one point, a big pile starts a sort of tsunami across the room, dislodging other piles in its progress, and I notice a very fine bronze nude surfing along the top and catch it as it flies past - a Rodin? a Degas? - but there is no time to admire it because other piles are slithering and toppling all around. The Duke stands in the middle unperturbed as books and paintings crash around him, and I am reminded of the judge's description of him in his notorious 1985 court case as 'a short-sighted old man with odd habits'. The Duke once said that he could easily give up his title, but he would be reluctant to give up his possessions. And who could blame him? Apart from Chatsworth - with its gilded window frames, its Rembrandts, its Canovas, its Van Dycks, its Freuds, its priceless books and furniture, its statuary, its beautiful gardens and park and villages - he owns: Lismore Castle in Ireland; Bolton Abbey, a shooting estate with ruined abbey in Yorkshire; large chunks of Eastbourne; two hotels; a house in Mayfair; a bookshop, Heyward Hill; and a club, Pratt's, in London. (Once asked if he belonged to Pratt's, the Duke answered accurately, 'In fact, it belongs to me.') Most of this loot he inherited, but he bought the bookshop himself, and he has considerably added to Chatsworth's treasures - the Freuds alone must be worth millions. He has also amassed the finest collection of illustrated botanical books in private hands. This is rare: most dukes hang on grimly to what they've got without dreaming of adding to it. Even at 82, the Duke is a dandy - tall, slim, elegant and still wearing his trademark pale yellow socks that match his racing colours. He thinks his passion for clothes is a reaction to his father, the 10th Duke, who was 'the worst-dressed man in the world. He wore paper collars!' (He was a countryman whose favourite activity was making salmon lures from ladies' hat feathers, then lying underwater in the bath flicking the lures on the surface to see which, as a salmon, he would prefer.) The 11th Duke would die rather than wear a paper collar: 'Sartorial things I care very much about. I had a terrible day two years ago when the Duke of Marlborough's grapes beat mine at the fruit show, and I got back to my club to read in the Evening Standard that the Duke of Beaufort was the best-dressed duke. That was a bad day!' 'We are freaks, aren't we?' says the Duke, meaning dukes, and I cannot demur, though perhaps it would be more polite to call them an endangered species - their numbers are diminishing and never likely to revive. The Duke thinks there are only '22 or 23' left - he is not exactly sure because the Duke of St Albans seems to have disappeared. But Devonshire is safe for a while, because he has a son and grandson and endless collaterals. I ask if it says 'Duke' on his passport, and he opens the top drawer of his desk and starts hurling its contents on the floor: letters, engagement diaries, chequebooks, cascade over the carpet. 'Now I can't find my damn passport,' he says crossly, and I start trying to pick everything up, but he won't let me. 'Go on talking!' he urges. He loves being asked questions, but he delivers his answers as quickly as if playing Trivial Pursuit. The only one that slows him down is when I ask whom he considers the most eccentric duke. 'Oh! Give me a moment to think... No. I don't think there are any. No, none.' He was never meant to be a duke. He had an elder brother, William, Marquess of Hartington, and he remembers his father explaining to him when he was 16 or 17 that it was very unfair that he would never have the same wealth and status as William, but that primogeniture was the only way of keeping estates intact. 'And I accepted that he was perfectly right.' In any case, he planned to be a publisher, and believed that 'Uncle Harold' (Macmillan) would give him a job in the family publishing firm. 'I would have been proud to be employed at Macmillan's. I really love books.' So he scampered through Eton and Cambridge, doing no work - 'I just disgraced myself' - but concentrating on his great passion, horse racing, until the war started and he joined the Coldstream Guards. 'And then this marvellous thing happened. I was sent to Caterham where the discipline was very, very strict - it wouldn't be tolerated now. And I was a horrible boy, lazy, dirty, no discipline, so those weeks at Caterham, then at Sandhurst, absolutely saved me. If I've achieved anything, it is thanks to the Army.' He went on to fight in Italy and win the MC. He, of course, denies any bravery and says the whole war in Italy was a breeze: 'It was an easy campaign. The Germans were always retreating, the camaraderie was marvellous and we were in this lovely, lovely country. We had two very snobbish officers who knew the Italian aristocracy and always wanted to capture their castles so they could tell them about it. I never killed anybody. I shot at someone. There was a battle going on, quite a big battle, and he - very courageous, really - was sitting under a tree eating sandwiches. So I thought, \"This is my moment!\" and fired my revolver, which is not an easy gun, and I'm a famously bad shot, but he didn't even stop eating his sandwiches. So I furiously threw my revolver at him - and the day I left the army I had to pay \u00a336 for losing it!' But surely he didn't win the MC for throwing his revolver at a man? 'No. I think it was for being cheerful. In the citation it said I went without food or water for 36 hours in great heat. But when I stood for Parliament in Chesterfield in 1945, directly after the war, they thought it would help my campaign to quote this. But they got it wrong! They said I went without food or water for six hours!' But then, disaster. In September 1944, his brother William was killed in action and Andrew became the heir to the dukedom. He was still fighting in Italy so he didn't have time to brood. In any case, his brother had recently married Kathleen Kennedy (JFK's sister) and 'for all I knew, she might have started a baby - I just had no idea. One was so far away and so preoccupied with one's own soldiers and, to a certain extent, the battles. But of course I was, and have remained, uncomfortable about it. I mean, I'm sitting here in all this comfort and I shouldn't be, because my brother was killed in action, with gallantry, and therefore I'm here by proxy and I never let myself forget that. He was a much better man than me, a much gooder man in every way. He was a very, very good man.' Then, another disaster. His father died of a heart attack in 1950, four months short of the deadline for avoiding death duties. Thus Andrew, as the new Duke, was immediately lumbered with a bill for \u00a37m, a staggering sum in those days. He thought at first he could not possibly save Chatsworth and discussed giving it to the V&amp;A, or to Manchester University. But with the help of some very good financial advisers - Currey &amp; Co, whom he still thanks daily - he gradually worked out a settlement. He sold 12,000 acres of Dumfriesshire and 42,000 acres of Derbyshire; he sold property and woodlands in Sussex, and his Mayfair house. He let his Eastbourne house, Compton Place, to a language school, and gave Hardwick Hall to the National Trust. The remainder had to be made up by selling heirlooms, and the Duke made the bold decision to sell a few of the most valuable works, rather than many lesser ones. He sold a Rembrandt, a Holbein, a Memling triptych, a Rubens, Claude's Liber Veritas, a Greek bronze of Apollo, a Van Dyke sketchbook, various illuminated manuscripts and tapestries. He says the worst blow was selling the Holbein (of Henry VIII) and the Memling triptych: 'Those were the two worst. There were some tapestries which I minded less and a most famous and wonderful manuscript [The Benedictional of St Aethelwold], but I'm not altogether sorry it's not here because it was almost too valuable for private hands.' He also sold a Rembrandt (The Philosopher), which turned out later not to be by Rembrandt, and he chuckles heartily when reminded of it: 'Yes, wasn't that lucky! It was a bit of luck.' I wondered if, while paying off the death duties, he had to make any personal economies. 'Yes, I did,' he nods sombrely. 'I stopped buying pictures and cut down on my racehorses and that kind of thing.' But nothing too swingeing, like buying his clothes at Marks &amp; Spencer? The Duke is too polite to snort, but emits a sort of strangled whinny, 'No-oo.' He finally cleared all the death duties in 1974. Then, by selling a Poussin (The Holy Family) and 69 Old Master drawings, which fetched \u00a321m, he set up a charitable trust to pay for Chatsworth's upkeep. Nowadays, income from visitors pays about a third of Chatworth's running costs and the trust fund makes up the rest. But the fact that the trust fund is for the benefit of Chatsworth means that the family could never decamp, or if they did, they would go empty-handed. 'My feeling is my son will bless me, but perhaps not my grandson, if for one reason or another he didn't want to live here.' But probably the best thing the Duke ever did for Chatsworth was to marry Deborah Mitford, the youngest of the Mitford sisters, in 1941 and stay married to her all these years. The Duke occasionally moans about 'the Mitford industry' and grumbles that marrying a Mitford 'inevitably imposes a certain Denis Thatcher element on to my life'. But he agrees that she has been the making of Chatsworth. She brought little money to the marriage, but an incredibly good business brain and what she calls a 'passion for commerce'. She runs all the visitor side of Chatsworth and has created not only the predictable shop, tearoom and restaurant but all sorts of extra money-making wheezes - backstairs tours, a cookery school and furniture workshop. She is as energetic as he is languid, or, as he puts it, 'She is on the bossy side, of course, but I've always liked that in a woman.' They have three children, eight grandchildren (including the model Stella Tennant) and an ever-increasing tribe of great-grandchildren. But the pragmatic nature of their marriage was harshly exposed in 1985 in what the tabloids dubbed the 'What the Butler Saw' case. Three blank cheques were stolen from the Duke's Mayfair house. Two were cashed for \u00a361,000, but the bank queried the third, for \u00a389,000, and called the police. It was the butler's son wot done it and both son and butler gave evidence about the Duke's spendthrift ways and his habit of dishing out cheques to the stream of girlfriends who came to the house (including one who popped out of a door naked). The Duke testified that he did indeed give money to 'people who are not as fortunate as I am', including ladies who needed help in furnishing their flats, but the judge asked rather sharply: 'What sort of age were they - young ladies, middle- aged ladies or elderly ladies?' and the Duke conceded that they tended to be young. He also admitted that he was on holiday with one of these young ladies when the theft occurred. But apparently these revelations came as no great surprise to the Duchess. He ascribes their marriage's longevity to Debo's tolerance and the fact that they have no secrets from each other. A more serious problem at one stage was his drinking, which really did upset the Duchess. Woodrow Wyatt in his diary recalls a weekend houseparty at Chatsworth when the Duke became so drunk and maudlin that Debo asked all the guests to leave to give him a shock. But Wyatt typically refused to leave, though the other guests did, and that night after dinner, his wife found the Duke sitting in the dark in the drawing-room, crying. She sat with him and comforted him and: 'The next morning he gave her a beautiful silver box and told her that she had saved his life. He had been at that moment totally suicidal.' But the Wyatts were never asked to Chatsworth again. Nowadays, the Duke doesn't drink, doesn't smoke and doesn't gamble: 'The days of fast women and slow horses are behind me,' he concedes. He still owns racehorses but he can barely see them; his eyesight is so bad he can no longer read (and doesn't like being read to), though he enjoys owning Heyward Hill bookshop and presenting the Heyward Hill prize with his new friend JK Rowling. But increasing blindness and lameness mean that nowadays he rarely leaves Chatsworth. He used to love going to Lismore, his castle in Ireland, where you could fish out of the drawing-room window: 'I used to love it like a man loves a woman. But, sadly, the woman remained young and I got old.' Nor can he go to Eastbourne as he used to do for his summer holiday, because it involves too much walking. What on earth did he ever find to do in Eastbourne? 'I'll tell you!' he says excitedly. 'I would get up, have breakfast reasonably early, do a very snobbish morning walk from the statue of the 7th Duke to the statue of the 8th Duke and back, by which time it was the morning session of the band. And I loved listening to the band. And then I would walk down Terminus Road to the Terminus Hotel, which used to be run by a most charming lady called Sylvia, and have my lunch there, then I would walk to the station and get a taxi to Compton Place, my family's house there, and sit in the garden, and then back in time for the afternoon session of the band. Then tea and an evening walk along the front to the pier. And sometimes marvellous boat trips to the Seven Sisters and the lighthouse, really lovely, and a very good, really excellent, miniature railway - those were great treats!' The Duke has just finished writing his auto-biography but has no idea when, or whether, it will be published. 'It's fearfully dull. I don't think it will appeal to anyone. But it amuses me to do it.' His only previous literary effort was Park Top: A Romance of the Turf, published in 1976, an account of a racehorse he owned. 'I'll give you a copy!' he exclaims, charging off through the litter of letters all over the floor, setting off new tidal waves of books in all directions, feeling with his hands till he locates a cardboard box full of copies of Park Top. 'She meant everything to me,' he says fervently. 'She not only had great charms but she was also unlucky and that is what you want - you want to have disappointments. That is why gardening is such a good hobby to have because it's full of disappointments.' Reading Park Top on the train home (it is surprisingly gripping), I ponder the vast gulf between the ducal mindset and my own. Why on earth should anyone want to have disappointments? But I suppose if you are burdened with good fortune, as the Duke feels himself to be, if you are up to your neck in unearned luxury and privilege, you might welcome that sharp slap of reality, or as much sharp reality as you can get from owning racehorses. And I remember what he said when I asked if he ever suffered from depression. 'I do, of course, but who doesn't? It isn't easy - no, that's too strong - it isn't altogether easy to live knowing that one's got infinitely more than one's fair share of good fortune. I'm Duke of Devonshire owing to a marksman killing my brother, so I'm here by proxy and I remind myself every morning when I wake up and again when I go to bed, that I am one of the luckiest men alive. And it does make me uneasy. I mean, It's not right!'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
