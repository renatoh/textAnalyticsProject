The one walking was Ian Poulter. But his hair was, well, normal. For him. Poulter usually dyes his hair in some couleur du jour but not this time. Word was that he had received a letter from the chairman Hootie Johnson wondering if he would not mind leaving his crayons at home and thus not play the emerald jewel in black-and-gold punker spikes. Poulter denied getting such a letter but apparently he got a hint from someone for he is at the moment something of a blond. The hint clearly didn't say anything about combing his hair as he still looks like an overachieving hedgehog. The hint apparently didn't mention wardrobe either. \"You shoulda seen him yesterday,\" said Becky Hahn, gallery marshal at the 11th fairway. Poulter turned out for the first round in dashing pink. The azaleas blushed. But it did not help his golf. In a span of 10 holes from the 5th through the 14th he had five bogeys. A closing rush of three birdies and a bogey left him with a 75. Oddly enough, Poulter was sotto voce for yesterday's second round - a pale yellow shirt, dark slacks bearing a faint gold plaid and amber sunglasses under a black visor. His outfit was still the brightest spot of his Masters experience. He shot a second-round 73 to reach the halfway at 148, four over par and in danger of missing the cut. Paul Casey, another first-timer from Britain, matched Poulter's first-round 75. He wasted no time in joining that long line of golfers who have discovered that Augusta's par-three 12th often plays a few shots harder. It is 155 yards, the last stretch over a pond to a shallow green that slants away, and that snuggled between a large bunker in front and the two behind, and backed by shrubbery and tall evergreens. In other words hit the green or else. Casey made six. But he made amends in the second round. Birdies at the 8th and 9th gave him an outward one-under 35 and a rousing back nine of four birdies got him to one under through the 16th. He bogeyed the 18th to finish with 69 for an even-par total of 144. Augusta hint or not, Poulter has missed his chance to rejoice in public. His beloved Arsenal came from behind to beat Liverpool 4-2. Poulter has used his coif to salute his idols in the past and now more than ever was his chance to take up the red and white and strut Augusta's gorgeous acres showing that he is a dyed-in-the-hair Arsenal fan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
