The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA), which will create the venues and the infrastructure for the Games, is advertising for board members to oversee the mammoth building programme. Jack Lemley, the American engineering expert appointed last month to chair the authority, said: \"I am looking for the brightest and the best people to join me on this exciting journey to establish the ODA and then deliver the facilities for 2012. I want to get the very best mix of the public and private sectors.\" He said he wanted the organisation to be driven by ethics, quality and safety. The 10 people who will join the board will be paid \u00a3500 a day and be expected to work two days a month for up to four years. Lemley, the 70-year-old responsible for building the Channel Tunnel, will work beside the chief executive David Higgins, who ran the group that built the main facilities at the 2000 Sydney Olympics and who most recently ran English Partnerships, the national regeneration agency. Tessa Jowell, culture secretary and Olympics minister, wants the board of the ODA to be drawn from across the UK. \"If you think you have got the skills we need, then why not give it a go and apply. London 2012 needs you,\" she said. Interim teams are in place at the London Development Agency and Transport for London dealing with early tasks before the ODA comes into existence as the London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Bill passes into law early next year. Its early tasks have included land acquisition and compulsory purchase orders, plus the \"undergrounding\" of overhead electricity cables and pylons."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
