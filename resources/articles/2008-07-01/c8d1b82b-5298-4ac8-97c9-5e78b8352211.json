Well, that didn't last long. Yesterday's newspapers carried the first, trend-torpedoing pictures of Wayne Rooney's post-honeymoon addition to his body art, a dramatic flesh wound on his right forearm housing the words \"Just Enough Education to Perform\". On the face of it, this might look like a fresh nadir even in the chequered world of footballing tattoos - mainly due to Rooney's decision to associate himself, in perpetuity, with the title of an album by mid-ranking bloke-rock band, the Stereophonics. But then this is football, where the monstrous tatt has become a staple. Eric Cantona probably kicked it all off with the frowning Indian chief's head above his left nipple. Marco Materazzi, a front-runner for the title of world's most tattooed sportsman, also has a native American head, plus a huge range of generic mystical/oriental torso doodles. Chelsea's new signing, Deco, has a geisha across his back. Liverpool striker Fernando Torres has \"Fernando\" etched on his arm in Tolkien-nerd Elvish. Diego Maradona has portraits of both Che Guevara and Fidel Castro, while at the other end of the ideological spectrum, Robbie Savage has an Armani logo on his upper arm. In spite of these grisly precedents, there is still a chance Rooney's new ink might have an interesting sub-text. Last year it was reported that the England striker had hired a tutor to help him study for GCSE exams in English and maths this summer, something he was encouraged to do by his now wife, Coleen, who left school with 10 GCSEs. Could it be that the Stereophonics tribute is actually a private joke? If so, we should find out fairly soon if it's a case of educational hubris or pride in revision well done. The results are out on August 21."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
