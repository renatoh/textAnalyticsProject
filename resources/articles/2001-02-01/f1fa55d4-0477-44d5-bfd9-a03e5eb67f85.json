Following months of speculation, the Sportsmasters Network has unveiled dates for its rival circuit next season, culminating in a world championship in Birmingham in April 2002. In many cases, especially for flagship events, the dates clash with the BBC's coverage of the official tour organised by the World Professional Billiards and Snooker Association. It means the 2001 Embassy World Championship at the Crucible Theatre in Sheffield from April 21 will almost certainly be the last time all the sport's top stars will compete for one world crown. The BBC last week reiterated it would \"continue to fulfil its obligations\" under its snooker contract. But it is not yet clear what the corporation's position would be if the WPBSA could not fulfil its own contractual obligations in delivering top players. The sports body is understood to be required to deliver 13 of the top 16 snooker stars for tournaments covered by the BBC. Currently, TSN is claiming the support of 11 members of the top 16 snooker players and 23 of the top 32. If the BBC chose to remain with the established governing body, it would be gambling that its viewing figures would not be seriously affected by the absence of star names such as Mark Williams, Stephen Hendry, Ronnie O'Sullivan and Jimmy White. TSN has also been in talks with BBC for several months but, in the event of ultimate rejection, would seek to do deals with another broadcaster. The year-old internet company is backed by Warburg Pincus, the City venture capital firm that purchased a 20% stake for \u00a310million. TSN diversified into sports management last month by acquiring Cuemasters, whose driving force, Ian Doyle, is TSN's chairman with a 55% holding. Initially, TSN sought to become the WPBSA's internet partner, bearing all expenses and giving the governing body 45% of the profits."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
