A draw leaves Newcastle\u2019s manager contemplating a draining replay at Ewood Park, where Tony Mowbray\u2019s Blackburn will be anxious to finish off a tie they very nearly won here. It took a late Matt Ritchie penalty to rescue Newcastle, who have not progressed beyond the fourth round since 2006, after the excellent Bradley Dack had given the Championship side a deserved lead. \u201cThe dressing room\u2019s very quiet and disappointed,\u201d said Mowbray, painfully aware his side had contributed the more intelligent football. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t see them scoring.\u201d Ben\u00edtez appeared to have mixed feelings about Ritchie\u2019s leveller. \u201cI\u2019m not happy with another game,\u201d he said after making eight changes from the side that lost to Manchester United last Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed we face a replay. It\u2019s more minutes, more risk. We were trying but Blackburn were pushing hard for every single ball - and we didn\u2019t play at the level I was expecting.\u201d Indeed with Dack\u2019s sharp movement between Newcastle\u2019s midfield and defence frequently discomfiting Sean Longstaff and Isaac Hayden, and Craig Conway fazing Javier Manquillo down the visitors\u2019 left, Mowbray\u2019s players regularly forced Newcastle to retreat deep into their own half. Although they struggled to conjure final balls inventive enough to test the reflexes of young Freddie Woodman \u2013 making a rare, and not entirely convincing, appearance in the home goal \u2013 Blackburn did win a series of dangerous set pieces. To Ben\u00edtez\u2019s evident disappointment, his team looked distinctly leggy, often lingering too long in possession. Where Newcastle did occasionally menace was in exploiting the space created by Blackburn\u2019s high pressing and breaking fast on the counterattack. The best of those forays saw Fabian Sch\u00e4r direct a long ball forward for Ritchie to control before stretching David Raya with a low shot. Joselu\u2019s close-range follow-up was deflected to safety by Elliott Bennett. From the subsequent corner Florian Lejeune \u2013 making a very decent central defensive comeback following a speedy recovery from a ruptured cruciate ligament \u2013 headed wide. Yet it was Mowbray\u2019s players who might easily have been celebrating when, on the stroke of half-time, Charlie Mulgrew\u2019s inswinging corner deceived Ben\u00edtez\u2019s defence. When Dack could not quite make the necessary contact to squeeze it past Woodman it represented a reprieve for the Tynesiders, who needed to be mindful of Mulgrew\u2019s impressive dead-ball deliveries. It was his short free-kick to Bennett that prefaced Dack\u2019s 13th goal of the season. Given that Dack was the most creative player on view it seemed thoroughly appropriate that the former Gillingham attacking midfielder headed Blackburn into the lead after dodging Jamie Sterry on his way to meeting Bennett\u2019s superb cross. With several potentially influential individuals struggling, most notably the Chelsea loanee Kenedy and the \u00a312m winger Jacob Murphy, Newcastle were up against it and needed Manquillo to somehow clear Mulgrew\u2019s acrobatic shot off the line. Meanwhile Woodman did well to palm a capriciously swerving Mulgrew free-kick round a post. It was easy to see how a Newcastle team increasingly devoid of self-belief have won only twice at home all season and Shelvey \u2013 one player not lacking confidence \u2013 was required to step off the bench belatedly to raise the tone. \u201cThey brought quality on,\u201d said Mowbray. \u201cShelvey\u2019s passing made a difference.\u201d Sure enough Mulgrew, increasingly involved at both ends, was soon to be found scooping a shot off the line at the conclusion of a desperate goalmouth scramble but Newcastle still looked set for their seventh third-round exit in the 11 years since Mike Ashley bought the club. That fate was avoided \u2013 or at least postponed \u2013 when Corry Evans brought Ayoze P\u00e9rez down in the box and Ritchie converted the penalty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
