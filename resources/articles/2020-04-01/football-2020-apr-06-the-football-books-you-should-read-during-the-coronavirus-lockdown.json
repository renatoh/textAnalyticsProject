Produced with the excellent Dutch football writer David Winner, the former Arsenal striker\u2019s memoir is all the richer for allowing Bergkamp to share his footballing philosophy instead of being a chronological journey through his life. But thanks to Winner\u2019s conversations with Bergkamp and the Dutchman\u2019s former teammates and managers, it also contains plenty of great stories. A top insight into the mind of a true artist. Jacob Steinberg The Great Derbies 1962-1988: Everton v Liverpool, by Brian Barwick and Gerald Sinstadt This is an old-fashioned football book, full of evocative photographs, interviews and anecdotes rather than philosophical musing or tactical theory, but as its subject matter neatly encompasses my formative years and childhood passions I turn to it regularly and with pleasure. Everything that matters is in here, from Gordon West\u2019s handbag to Stan Boardman\u2019s frustration as a Liverpool A-teamer to Gary Lineker\u2019s lucky boots, with special mention of Clive Thomas of Treorchy. The underlying theme is Liverpool\u2019s gradual rise to supremacy, of course, but I can even forgive that. These were happy days. Paul Wilson The Club, by Joshua Robinson and Jonathan Clegg Written with the US audience in mind, this might be more of a recap for the peeled-eyeball obsessive. But it is an excellent recap, with wonderful access and forensic detail on the Premier League\u2019s rise to global alpha status. At a time when there is a chance to reset and possibly even \u2013 no, really \u2013 do things differently, it\u2019s useful to remember how finely poised many of the choices that got us here were. All told with an arch sense of humour. Barney Ronay The Miracle of Castel di Sangro, by Joe McGinniss In 1996 Castel di Sangro, a team from an impoverished town of 5,000 inhabitants, sealed their spectacular rise from the amateur leagues to Serie B courtesy of a penalty save from a veteran substitute goalkeeper making his first appearance of the season. McGinniss, having become obsessed with the sport thanks to Roberto Baggio and the 1994 World Cup, immerses himself in the club and town for what comes next. Tragedy and scandal expose the late author to the cynical side of Italian football, but miracles ensure his love for the game and the country survive. A gripping tale, brilliantly told. Andy Hunter Extra Time, by Kevin Sampson A Liverpool supporter\u2019s account of following the team during the 1997-98 season feels like something that should appeal only to, well, a Liverpool supporter, but this is a book that transcends tribalism. Partly because Sampson\u2019s stories, involving the likes of Jegsy Dodd and the Urban Dub Poet, are those of all match-going fans and partly because, as is the case with the author\u2019s work in general, they are told with great wit and warmth. Sachin Nakrani All Played Out, by Pete Davies The best books transport you to another place and time, making it, and its inhabitants, seem real. All Played Out does precisely that, taking readers back to Italia 90 with access all areas. It tells the inside story of that watershed tournament thanks to the sometimes startling, and always very human, insights accumulated during the nine months of unparalleled access Davies was granted by Bobby Robson and his England players. Spiced by three-dimensional portrayals of journalists, fans and hooligans, it could not be written today. Louise Taylor Fifty-Six: The Story of the Bradford Fire, by Martin Fletcher In 1985, on the final day of the season, a 12-year-old Martin Fletcher went to watch Bradford City with his father, brother, grandfather and uncle but he would be the only one to leave alive as a fire engulfed the wooden main stand, killing 56 people. This is a stunningly brutal account of that horrific day and aftermath by a man still scarred and searching for answers. Suzanne Wrack The Boy on the Shed, by Paul Ferris A book which begins as a stark social history of Northern Ireland during its most troubled sectarian times develops into a superb memoir. Ferris was a childhood superstar who left his native Lisburn and everything he knew to sign for Newcastle United. Ferris\u2019s experiences, in football and an incredible life beyond, are blissfully easy to relate to. Triumph, tragedy and everything in between are beautifully encapsulated here. Ewan Murray The Title, by Scott Murray What better way to pass the time during the suspension of the Premier League than by catching up on all the top-flight title races that took place before English football got its glitzy makeover? There\u2019s very many a yarn to be celebrated, and Scott Murray \u2013 also of this parish \u2013 proves the perfect guide, breezing through more than a 100 years of heritage with customary style, deep knowledge and an infectious appreciation for the characters who shaped the \u201cepic saga\u201d of English football pre-1992. Paul Doyle The Ball is Round, by David Goldblatt There are other histories of football but none that tackle it so well from a socio-economic perspective, and few that have the same global vision. This is a remarkable work of synthesis. Goldblatt\u2019s triumph is to take a wealth of theory and information from an extraordinary array of sources from across the world and construct from it a narrative that is both convincing and readable.
