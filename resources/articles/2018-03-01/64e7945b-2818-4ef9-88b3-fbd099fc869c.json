But no, here\u2019s another: send a bunch of them on a gruelling 800km hike across the mountains and plains of France and Spain. Yes, I think that works. Because they will also be exploring their spiritual sides as well as contemplating the existence of God as they trudge. No problem for Kate Bottley, the Gogglebox priest, though sometimes her godliness deserts her. \u201cAre we going up that bastard?\u201d she asks Badly Behaving Man Neil Morrissey, pointing at a hill ahead. Turns out they\u2019re not going up that bastard, a beautiful bastard, created by God. Lovely scenery by the way. Comedian Ed Byrne doesn\u2019t believe. \u201cThe moment of realisation was when I saw them installing a lightning conductor on my local church,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re not showing any faith, why should I?\u201d Heather Small, once of M People, says: \u201cAll my life I\u2019ve searched for\u2026\u201d THE HERO INSIDE YOURSELF, shouts everyone who remembers the 90s. Wrong, the correct answer is \u201ca place to be a spiritual home\u201d. Still she should bellow out Search for a Hero, to keep them all going, and thinking positive. Moving On Up maybe on ascent of bastards. Investigative journalist Raphael Rowe doesn\u2019t like the single bunks and the slatted windows in the lodges along the way; it gives him flashbacks to the 12 years he spent in prison. Debbie McGee agrees. \u201cCell Block H comes to mind,\u201d she says. Debbie has a meaningful encounter with a man who\u2019s finding it even tougher getting over the death of his father than she is getting over the death of Paul Daniels. The fact that they\u2019re seeking answers to a few of life\u2019s big questions as they go lifts Pilgrimage a little above other celebrity humiliation shows. It\u2019s still reality/survival television, but a slightly classier, BBC2 variety of it. Quite good fun and you needn\u2019t feel embarrassed watching it. \u201cThey have only 15 days to cover nearly 800 kilometres,\u201d says narrator Lee Ingleby. \u201cSo they\u2019ll walk some of the route in sections.\u201d Er, hang on, I think he means they\u2019re cheating, doesn\u2019t he? Well then, never mind Santiago de Compostela, they\u2019re all going to hell."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
