Is she really Donald Trump\u2019s prisoner? Or is she, as the book asks, \u201ca woman who spent her childhood and formative years in a poor communist country, who speaks five languages, who privately spends her time visiting sick children \u2026 a fierce protector of her child?\u201d You might not have the time to read Free, Melania\u2019s 288 pages to find out \u2013 so we did it for you. Here\u2019s what we learned. 1. Melania spent five months on a d\u00e9cor project The author spends a lot of time lamenting Melania\u2019s lack of \u201cskills\u201d. According to Bennett, this has been a sticking point for Flotus: unlike her predecessors \u2013 Michelle Obama who was a Princeton grad and Hillary Clinton who was a lawyer \u2013 Melania often finds herself stuck without the tools to control the media narrative around her; to command the resources she needed in the White House for her initiatives. It might even explain why she had to steal one of Michelle Obama\u2019s speeches. But Melania has thrown herself into other projects instead. One was designing Christmas decorations for the White House last year. According to the book, she spent much of her time poring over mood boards. Some may remember the fruits of her hard work: after five months she arrived squarely at the conclusion that it would be a good idea to decorate the White House with blood-red trees. Of course, the internet mocked the dystopian trees, and asked whether Melania was OK. She perhaps had less time to pore over her response: \u201cWe are in the 21st century,\u201d Melania told reporters at the time. Which is, of course, the century in which we should become more tolerant of all trees, no matter what color they are. 2. Trump was his own real-life sock puppet People were bemused earlier this year upon learning that former presidential candidate Mitt Romney had a sock puppet account \u2013 an account used to big oneself up, under the pretence of being someone else. The book revisits the story of Trump\u2019s own sock puppet: himself. He used to call reporters at outlets such as People and Forbes pretending to be Trump\u2019s PR guy \u201cJohn Barron\u201d, and would overinflate his wealth and importance. Forbes reporter Jonathan Greenberg realized he\u2019d been duped by Trump in 1984 when he played back a call he\u2019d had with \u201cBarron\u201d on tape, and realized it was just Trump speaking in a different tone. 3. Maybe Melania is just private Looking at the evidence, an unforgiving audience might describe Melania as vapid. She created a grammatically incorrect public awareness program \u201cBe Best\u201d as her initiative, which took aim at online trolls, seemingly unaware of who she is married to. An explanation is yet to be given for why Melania once thought it was a good idea to create a caviar-based skincare line \u2013 probably because there are no words. But the book invites us to consider an alternative truth: perhaps Melania is simply a private person. She doesn\u2019t talk to the press, she barely talks to her security guards, and she even keeps her own quarters in the White House. \u201cImagine what those [polling] numbers could be if Melania actually said anything of major importance on a regular basis?\u201d Bennett opines, in reference to a poll that once put her as more popular than Michelle Obama. I wonder. 3. The jacket was about Ivanka, not children separated from their parents Remember that jacket? The one Melania wore during a visit to a migrant child detention centre, the one emblazoned with the words: \u201cI really don\u2019t care, Do U?\u201d The book speculates the jacket\u2019s slogan wasn\u2019t directed at the children \u2013 it was directed at Ivanka instead. Melania was reportedly fuming at the time that Ivanka had taken all the credit for Trump\u2019s softening stance on immigration when actually it was Melania who had got him to climb down. Bennett argues that Melania took aim at Ivanka in the best way she knew how: by wearing a jacket from the same store Ivanka favors (Melania wears more expensive designer clothes). 4. Melania is really down to earth If this book is anything to go by, then Melania is really just a normal person: she is nice to staff and she uses emojis. According to Bennett, Melania often sends Grisham emojis to \u201cconvey her happiness, disappointment or surprise\u201d. 5. Who will speak out for Tiffany? At Melania and Trump\u2019s wedding, everyone had a role. Trump\u2019s sons, Don Jr and Eric, were his best men. Ivanka did a Bible reading. There was even a role for reality TV show producer Mark Burnett\u2019s eldest son \u2013 who was a page boy. Tiffany, on the other hand, was tasked with handing out wedding programs. Bennet concludes: \u201cIt\u2019s unclear why Tiffany\u2019s role was so minimal, but as with most things Tiffany Trump, there\u2019s a sad footnote or afterthought.\u201d 6. Separate rooms And now for the grand finale: the book reveals that Trump and Melania sleep in separate rooms. Melania, according to the author, sleeps in a room on the third floor of the executive residence, where Michelle Obama\u2019s mother lived during the Obama presidency. Trump reportedly sleeps in the master bedroom on the first floor. Bennett gives a surprising explanation for their separate quarters: perhaps if Melania and Trump were forced to spend more time with each other, their marriage wouldn\u2019t last. \u201cTrump didn\u2019t have separate bedrooms with his two previous wives; it\u2019s worth noting that those relationships lasted nowhere near as long as his current one,\u201d says Bennett. Trump\u2019s first marriage actually lasted 14 years \u2013 the same as his marriage with Melania \u2013 so she still has some time left to disprove the theory. There is also a much more obvious explanation \u2013 that Melania\u2019s physical detachment from Trump has something to do with his multiple alleged infidelities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
