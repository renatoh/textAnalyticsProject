Divorced from Nisman for three years, Arroyo Salgado has handled major cases at her courtroom in the San Isidro suburb of Buenos Aires. Like her former husband, she is reputed to have extensive connections with police investigators and secret intelligence operatives. Her emergence could open up new leads; she is expected to demand a new postmortem examination and ballistic tests in the name of the two teenage daughters she had with Nisman. Arroyo Salgado\u2019s conviction that her former husband was murdered and her demand for new forensic tests could see her in open battle with the investigative prosecutor in the case, Viviana Fein, who on Saturday announced the official test results: \u201cThe shot was fired at a distance of no more than one centimetre, with the gun placed against the temple,\u201d Fein told television journalists. She said time of death was around noon on Sunday and there was \u201cno evidence of the participation of other persons\u201d. \u201cI can\u2019t think about anything else,\u201d said a waitress at a corner caf\u00e9 in the trendy Palermo Hollywood district, where patrons pored over magazines and newspapers, all with pictures of Nisman on their covers. Nisman\u2019s death, 24 hours before he was to present explosive evidence against Argentina\u2019s beleaguered president, Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner, at an emergency congressional hearing, has elevated the prosecutor to the status of political martyr. He is increasingly being seen as a victim of a virulent palace intrigue unfolding in the final months of the stormy rule of Argentina\u2019s president. With enough twists and turns to satisfy the most avid conspiracy theorist, the case throws up probable culprits ranging from the alleged Iranian terrorists whom he sought to bring to trial for the deaths of 85 victims at a Jewish community centre in Buenos Aires 20 years ago, to either Fern\u00e1ndez acolytes avenging his charges against the president or wrathful palace intriguers exacting revenge on the president by killing the man who dared to challenge her. Fern\u00e1ndez fingered spy chief \u201cJaime\u201d Stiuso (whose real name is apparently Antonio Horacio Stiuso) as her main suspect. The 61-year-old intelligence operative has become a household name after Fern\u00e1ndez alleged that Stiuso provided Nisman with hundreds of hours of intercepted calls on which the prosecutor built his case, accusing the president of attempting through secret negotiations to derail Nisman\u2019s attempts to extradite five Iranian officials to stand trial for the Amia Jewish community centre blast in 1994. In return for immunity, Fern\u00e1ndez asked Iran for oil to plug the widening energy gap that is endangering Argentina\u2019s economy, Nisman alleged. Fern\u00e1ndez has strongly denied the charge. \u201cEverything is false,\u201d the president said about Nisman\u2019s charges. Stiuso has never been seen in public and has been interviewed only once in his life, last month a few days before Fern\u00e1ndez fired him from his top post at the intelligence secretariat. \u201cStiuso was obsessed with the Amia case,\u201d says Rodis Recalt, the journalist from Noticias magazine who interviewed him. \u201cHe worked closely with Nisman to build the case against Iran.\u201d Accustomed to living under constant threat, Nisman changed his Whatsapp profile picture for a photo of himself captioned \u201cKeep Calm And We Don\u2019t Negotiate With Terrorism\u201d. At about the same time he asked one of his assistants for a gun, saying that he feared for his life. The following evening he was found dead on his bathroom floor. An adoring father of two teenage girls, Nisman lived alone in a small apartment on the 13th floor of one of the three 42-storey towers of Le Parc complex in the expensive Puerto Madero district. Although his bodyguards noticed he wasn\u2019t answering calls , it wasn\u2019t until 10pm that his 73-year-old mother, Sara Garfunkel, entered the apartment with the help of a locksmith. The media picked up on the story after a neighbour started posting pictures on his Twitter account of police arriving in large numbers at the entrance to Nisman\u2019s building. Nerves are increasingly frayed in Buenos Aires for anyone involved in the Nisman case. Damian Pachter of the Buenos Aires Herald, the first journalist to announce the news of the prosecutor\u2019s death \u2013 on his Twitter account a few minutes after midnight on Sunday \u2013 left Argentina hurriedly this morning. \u201cI\u2019m leaving because my life is in danger,\u201d Pachter told the newspaper Clar\u00edn. He believes he will not be able to return until a change of government in December. \u201cI ran like hell,\u201d he said, leaving his car in the newspaper\u2019s car park. The Fopea association of journalists called on the authorities for \u201cmaximum attention for the security of journalists\u201d. With presidential elections scheduled for October \u2013 in which she cannot compete, having already served two terms in office \u2013 Fern\u00e1ndez is skidding badly in her final months, beset by inflation, devaluation, corruption charges, power cuts, a foreign debt default, and now the mysterious death of a prosecutor who accused her of conspiring with Iran. Her dwindling cast of supporters point to Stiuso as Nisman\u2019s likely killer, in revenge for being ousted by his former master. Her opponents say it is the other way around: that Fern\u00e1ndez fired him in an attempt to stop Nisman from presenting the charges that are now exploding on a long fuse after his death. \u201cStiuso left Argentina, just in case,\u201d says Recalt. The larger question remains who blew up the Amia 20 years ago, still one of the most politically charged open wounds in Argentinian society. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if I know who blew up the Amia,\u201d Stiuso told Recalt before being dismissed by Fern\u00e1ndez. \u201cAll that matters is what I can prove.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
