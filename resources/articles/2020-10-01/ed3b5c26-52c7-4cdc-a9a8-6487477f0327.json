Thanks to everyone who wrote in with tips and suggestions for coverage. In the meantime, here\u2019s a quick summary of recent key developments: Several European countries have reported record daily increases in coronavirus cases, including Italy, Greece, Austria, Luxembourg and France. Algeria\u2019s president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, has entered self-isolation after several senior officials displayed coronavirus symptoms, the presidency has said in a statement. The Metropolitan police have said they made 18 arrests at today\u2019s anti-lockdown protest in central London. The number of coronavirus deaths in the Czech Republic has doubled to 2,047 in two weeks, data from the health ministry showed on Saturday. Angolan protesters defied coronavirus restrictions in the capital of Luanda on Saturday, taking to the streets to demonstrate against the government. Police fired tear gas and beat up demonstrators, some of whom had set up barricades and set fires. The Australian state of Victoria has recorded seven new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24-hours. The government is facing a legal battle with academics over its \u201cunlawful\u201d decision to reopen universities for face-to-face teaching last month. The UK\u2019s largest academic union is seeking a judicial review of the government\u2019s decision to ignore advice from its own Sage committee of experts to move all non-essential university and college teaching online in September. In a pre-action letter, sent to the education secretary Gavin Williamson and shared with the Observer, the University and College Union (UCU) argues the government\u2019s failure to direct universities to move to online teaching this term was unlawful, unfair, unjust and irrational. The proportion of younger adults in the UK who admit to flouting Covid-19 restrictions has increased in the past fortnight to more than one in six, according to a new poll. In a worrying sign for ministers, the latest Opinium poll for the Observer shows the proportion of 18- to 34-year-olds who admit breaking the rules has increased from 10% to 17% in the last fortnight. The proportion of 35- to 44-year-olds increased even more sharply \u2013 from 10% to 18% over the same period. Interesting Reuters update from Colombia amid global anticipation for a vaccine: As scientists around the world race to find a coronavirus inoculation, Colombia says it is ready to distribute any vaccine which proves effective. Its preparedness is thanks to decades of work on a free government immunisation programme which offers 21 vaccines to everyone in the South American nation - among the region\u2019s most generous for vaccine provision. \u201cWe have a really strong vaccination programme that serves as a model and which will incorporate the new formula that will arrive against Covid,\u201d Gerardo Burgos, secretary general of the health ministry, told Reuters. The programme covers not just Colombia\u2019s own population of about 50 million people but also more than 1.7 million Venezuelan migrants and includes everything from infant shots to human papillomavirus. The country distributes about 23 million doses per year. Colombia has already committed $213 million to the global COVAX initiative, guaranteeing COVID-19 vaccinations for about 10 million people. People over 60, those with pre-existing conditions and healthcare workers will be immunised first. In Australia, Victoria has recorded seven new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24-hours. This is a small figure on a global scale, but to residents of Melbourne it is worryingly high. Melbourne has been under stay-at-home orders for 109 days and the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, is scheduled to announce an easing of restrictions today. It comes as the 14-day rolling average of new cases in the city fell below the target of five cases per day, to 4.6. However, Andrews said on Saturday that the easing of restrictions could be in doubt because of a new outbreak in the city\u2019s northern suburbs. Labour is ramping up the pressure on the UK government to U-turn and extend free school meal provision over the holidays, warning it will bring the motion back to parliament if ministers do not reverse their position before Christmas. Shadow education secretary Kate Green called on the prime minister to meet with the taskforce set up by footballer Marcus Rashford \u201cas a matter of urgency\u201d to discuss its proposals for ending child poverty. \u201cThere is still time to change approach, but the Government must act quickly. If you change your policy now, we can ensure that no child goes to bed hungry on Christmas Day,\u201d Green wrote in a letter to education secretary Gavin Williamson. \u201cLabour will not give up on the fight to ensure that no child goes to bed hungry, and if you do not change course we will bring this issue back to the House of Commons before Christmas.\u201d Australians have become accustomed to the daily announcements of new Covid-19 cases. Although the majority of those cases \u2013 bar Victoria \u2013 have come through returning travellers from overseas, little has been known about Covid-positive cases that have passed through hotel quarantine, and how governments are tracking the origins of these cases. But data provided to Guardian Australia by three states \u2013 New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia \u2013 offers some important insights into Covid-positive returning travellers. The states each provided data from 29 March, when the travel restrictions were introduced, to 19 October, revealing that they were indeed monitoring countries-of-origin where returning travellers may have contracted the virus. Data from NSW Health shows the majority of 873 Covid-positive travellers who arrived in the state were returning Australian nationals. Melissa Davey with the full report here: Angolan protesters defied coronavirus restrictions in the capital of Luanda on Saturday, taking to the streets to demonstrate against the government. Police, some mounted on horseback, fired teargas and beat up the protesters, who had set up barricades along the roads using skips, boulders and burning tyres, while others set a national flag ablaze, according to an AFP photographer. A police source who asked not to be identified told AFP that the demonstration \u2013 demanding the holding of local government elections \u2013 \u201cresulted in barricades and acts of vandalism\u201d. Municipal elections, which had been scheduled for this year, have been postponed because of the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cThose were acts of rioting, in a flagrant violation of (new pandemic restrictions), which do not allow street gatherings of more than five people,\u201d he said. UK paediatricians have published an open letter calling on the government to extend provision of free school meals until at least Easter 2021 \u2013 you can read it here: The number of coronavirus deaths in the Czech Republic has doubled to 2,047 in two weeks, data from the health ministry showed on Saturday. It took the country of 10.7 million seven months to reach 1,000 deaths after the first reported case. The number of patients in a serious state grew to 772 as of Friday, up from 438 two weeks ago. Hospitals were treating 5,314 people with coronavirus in total. Here are the main developments from over the last few hours: Italy reported a new daily record of 19,644 new coronavirus infections on Saturday as the government considered further measures to limit the surge in cases. Algeria\u2019s president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, has entered self-isolation after several senior officials displayed coronavirus symptoms, the presidency has said in a statement. Austria has reported a record daily rise in coronavirus cases, with 3,614 infections in the last 24 hours. It is a significant increase from the 2,571 announced on Friday. Coronavirus cases have risen by the record figure of 862 in Luxembourg, while a further three deaths being reported. The Metropolitan police have said they made 18 arrests at today\u2019s anti-lockdown protest in central London. Greece announced a record 935 new infections on Saturday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 29,992. France reported 45,422 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, compared to 42,032 on Friday. The country has registered a total of 1,086,497 cases. An investigation is underway in the Chinese region of Xinjiang after an asymptomatic coronavirus case was identified in the city of Kashgar on Saturday, the health commission said. It is the first local case in the region since 15 August. Net approval of the UK government\u2019s handling of the coronavirus crisis has fallen to a record low of -21%, a poll by Opinium shows. Public health officials and contractors in England have barely used check-in data from millions of people who have visited cafes, pubs and restaurants, the Guardian has learned. As a legal condition introduced last month, venues are obliged to record customer details in an effort to contain the spread of Covid-19, but the government\u2019s hamstrung test-and-trace scheme has appeared unable to cope with the swiftly rising number of coronavirus cases. Mattha Busby reports here: France reported 45,422 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, compared with 42,032 on Friday. The country has registered a total of 1,086,497 cases. A further 138 people have died, taking the toll to 34,645. The Welsh first minister has said the government will be \u201creviewing how the weekend has gone with the supermarkets\u201d, amid anger over a ban on selling non-essential items during the firebreak lockdown. A petition to reverse the ban has gathered more than 30,000 signatures. Guidance published by the Welsh government says certain sections of supermarkets must be \u201ccordoned off or emptied, and closed to the public\u201d. Mark Drakeford has said the restriction is in place as a \u201cmatter of fairness\u201d to non-essential shops that have been ordered to close. The US is surging towards record numbers of new coronavirus infections above 100,000 a day, health experts have warned, just as a presidential campaign with the pandemic as its core issue enters its final week. In a further blow to Donald Trump\u2019s hopes of keeping the White House, the US death toll from Covid-19 will pass 225,000 by early this week, bringing extra scrutiny to the president\u2019s repeated but evidently false claims that the crisis is \u201crounding the turn\u201d. Richard Luscombe has the story here: Spain\u2019s cabinet will meet on Sunday morning to discuss announcing a national state of emergency, the government announced on Saturday. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez \u201chas called an extraordinary cabinet meeting at 10am to study the conditions for a new state of emergency,\u201d it said, saying such a proposal had been \u201cpositively welcomed by most of Spain\u2019s autonomous communities, who had requested it\u201d. The meeting comes just days after Spain registered more than one million virus cases, becoming the sixth country in the world to pass the grim milestone \u2013 and the first in the European Union. Greece announced a record 935 new infections on Saturday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 29,992. Five further deaths were also reported, taking the country\u2019s toll to 564. The previous highest increase in cases was on Thursday, when 882 cases were reported. New measures were announced on Thursday, including a 12.30am-5am curfew in areas with high numbers of infections which comes into force tonight. Face masks are now compulsory in outdoor spaces as well as indoors. The Metropolitan police have said they made 18 arrests at today\u2019s anti-lockdown protest in central London, for offences including breaching coronavirus regulations, assaulting an emergency service worker, violent disorder and for being already wanted. Three officers suffered minor injuries, the force said. Commander Ade Adelekan, the Met\u2019s gold commander for the protest, said: \u201cOrganisers did not take reasonable steps to keep protesters safe which then voided their risk assessment. At this point, officers then took action to disperse crowds in the interests of public safety. \u201cI am grateful that the vast majority of people listened to officers and quickly left the area. Frustratingly, a small minority became obstructive, deliberately ignoring officers\u2019 instructions and blocking Westminster Bridge.\u201d Coronavirus cases have risen by the record figure of 862 in Luxembourg, while a further three deaths being reported. The previous record daily increase in cases was on Thursday, when 595 infections were added to the tally. This brings the country\u2019s total number of cases to 13,713, while the death toll stands at 144. It follow Friday\u2019s announcement of new measures to tackle the virus\u2019s resurgence, including a curfew between 11 and 6pm. Austria has reported a record daily rise in coronavirus cases, with 3,614 infections in the last 24 hours. It is a significant increase from the 2,571 announced on Friday. Last Saturday, 1,747 cases were reported \u2013 which was also a record at the time. The total confirmed cases in Austria rose to 79,770 cases, There are currently 25,825 active cases in the country, according to Metropole. Algeria\u2019s president, Abdelmadjid Tebboune, entered self-isolation on Saturday after several senior officials displayed coronavirus symptoms, the presidency has said in a statement. Tebboune, who is 74, has been advised by medical staff to isolate for five days. Algeria has officially recorded 55,630 coronavirus cases and 1,897 deaths so far. Jason Rodrigues with the latest from the anti-lockdown protest at Westminster Bridge New coronavirus measures have been announced in Brussels. From 26 October, masks will be compulsory throughout the country, while cultural venues (museums, galleries) and sports facilities will be closed. Other measures include shops closing at 8pm, and takeaways operating until 10pm. Italy reported a new daily record of 19,644 new coronavirus infections on Saturday as the government considered further measures to limit the surge in cases. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte has said he wants to avoid a nationwide lockdown like the one during spring. Several regions have imposed overnight curfews. It follows clashes between protesters and police in Naples late on Friday night after a nighttime curfew was ordered in the Campania region. Arrests have been made on the anti lockdown demonstration in London after a group of protesters decided not to disperse and instead carried on a march from Trafalgar Square to Westminster Bridge. Police blocked the path of protesters at the north end of the bridge, leading to scuffles as some tried to carry on marching and calls went up from some to rush the police lines. The Guardian saw police making at least three arrests. One group of protesters tried to stage a sit down protest on the bridge. They were being forced south by a line of police. Damien Gayle with a video from London\u2019s anti-lockdown protest, which has been ordered to disperse: Jason Rodrigues also reports that there\u2019s been \u201cat least one arrest\u201d by Westminster Bridge: There have been a further 23,012 lab-confirmed coronavirus cases recorded in the UK, according to government data. This compares with 20,530 new cases registered on Friday. A total of 854,010 people have tested positive. A further 174 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were reported on Saturday, bringing the total to 44,571. There were 224 deaths on Friday. An investigation is underway in the Chinese region of Xinjiang after an asymptomatic coronavirus case was identified in the city of Kashgar on Saturday, the health commission said. It is mainland China\u2019s first local case since 14 October, when one was reported in Qingdao. No new cases have been found in Xinjiang since 15 August, when a cluster of infections were reported. The case was identified after the patient, a 17-year-old woman, was tested during a regular inspection. She has been transferred to a hospital in the city and all close contacts have been isolated. Police have called time on the anti-lockdown protest in London, where several thousand people remain in Trafalgar Square after a long march through the city. In a tweet posted on a Metropolitan police account, the force said: \u201cThe protest under the name of \u2018Stop The New Normal\u2019 have failed to comply with the terms of their risk assessment, government guidelines and they are not maintaining social distancing. \u201cThe officer in charge has now determined their protest is no longer exempt from the regulations and is an illegal gathering. \u201cWe are now telling those participating in this protest to leave. Officers will be engaging with crowds and informing them of this development. \u201cBy leaving now, you can keep yourself safe and avoid any enforcement action being taken by officers.\u201d The square was flooded with police asking people to leave soon after. The announcement came at the end of a long and noisy protest march through the city. Louise Creffield, founder of Save Our Rights UK, who organised the protest said: \u201cWe\u2019re really pleased, the turnout was phenomenal and we\u2019ve managed to get away with no one being injured or arrested. \u201cIt\u2019s really good to be able to have a voice, and this is the only way we get it.\u201d Among the protesters taking part was Chloe Toop, 32, a schoolteacher. \u201cI\u2019m doing it for the next generation, fighting for them,\u201d she said. She said she was anxious about young people \u201cnot having a life that I have growing up, not being able to go on holiday or to festivals\u201d. \u201cKids are now scared to go and meet each other, hug each other. Social interaction is so important,\u201d she said. Hello, Clea Skopeliti taking over the blog for the next few hours. My Twitter DMs are open for any suggestions for global coverage, or you can drop me an email. Thanks in advance! I will shortly be handing over the blog to my colleague. Below are the latest updates. Welsh government called on to reverse a ban on supermarkets selling non-essential items during the firebreak lockdown. The country\u2019s first minister, Mark Drakeford, said the restriction was a \u201cmatter of fairness\u201d as non-essential retail has to close during the two-week period, which began at 6 pm on Friday and will last until 9 November. Colombia is set to surpass a million Covid-19 infections on Saturday, becoming the eighth country to do so. As scientists around the world race to find an effective inoculation, Colombia says it is ready to distribute any vaccine that proves effective. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called on Saturday for strict punishments for violators of Covid-19 restrictions as the Middle East\u2019s hardest-hit country tried to tackle its third wave of infections. Poland\u2019s president, Andrzej Duda, has tested positive, adding another name to the list of leaders to have been diagnosed with the virus. Aside from the diagnosis, the 48-year-old Duda is believed to be in good general health. Thousands of people have signed a petition calling on the Welsh government to reverse a ban on supermarkets selling non-essential items during the firebreak lockdown in Wales. The country\u2019s first minister, Mark Drakeford, said the restriction was a \u201cmatter of fairness\u201d as non-essential retail has to close during the two-week period, which began at 6 pm on Friday and will last until 9 November. Guidance published by the Welsh government says certain sections of supermarkets must be \u201ccordoned off or emptied, and closed to the public\u201d. These include areas selling electrical goods, telephones, clothes, toys and games, garden products and dedicated sections for homewares. Supplies for the \u201cessential upkeep, maintenance and functioning of the household\u201d - such as batteries, lightbulbs and rubber gloves - can be sold during the lockdown. Colombia is set to surpass a million Covid-19 infections on Saturday, becoming the eighth country to do so. As scientists around the world race to find an effective inoculation, Colombia says it is ready to distribute any vaccine that proves effective. Its preparedness is thanks to decades of work on a free government immunisation programme that offers 21 vaccines to all Colombians, among the South America\u2019s most generous for vaccine provision. \u201cWe have a really strong vaccination programme that serves as a model and which will incorporate the new formula that will arrive against Covid,\u201d Gerardo Burgos, the secretary general of the health ministry, told Reuters.

The country delivers about 23 million vaccinations a year. Colombia has already committed $213m to the global Covax initiative, guaranteeing Covid-19 vaccinations for about 10 million people. People over 60, those with pre-existing conditions and healthcare workers will be immunised first. Colombia\u2019s cases have climbed steadily despite more than five months of a gradually loosened lockdown. The death toll is set to top 30,000 people over the weekend. Chile has identified more than 500,000 coronavirus cases since the outbreak began in March, the health ministry said on Saturday. The ministry said 500,542 Chileans were now confirmed to have suffered from the virus, including 1,631 cases added in the past day and 48 deaths, taking fatalities to a total of 13,892. Active cases are at a record low of 9,900, it added. Chile, which was among the worst-hit countries in July, ranking only behind Qatar globally for per capita cases , has gradually eased its lockdown over the past two months. Restaurants and bars have opened with limited capacity, office workers are returning and some schools have reopened. Chileans will vote on Sunday in a referendum on whether to replace the country\u2019s Pinochet-era constitution. The charter, drawn up by a key lieutenant of the military leader Augusto Pinochet in 1980, is blamed for segmenting pension, health and education provisions and entrenching inequality. The organiser of a party attended by more than 50 people has been handed a \u00a310,000 fine for \u201cblatant disregard\u201d of Covid-19 regulations. Police were called to a flat in Simpson Street, Angel Meadows, Manchester, shortly after 11.20 pm (BST) on Friday. Officers found DJ mixing decks, speakers, a buffet and about 50 people in attendance, Greater Manchester Police said. The force said the party was closed down and the organiser given a \u00a310,000 fixed penalty notice for breaching coronavirus legislation, one of the first issued since Greater Manchester entered tier 3 restrictions. A further 1,324 people have tested positive for coronavirus in Wales, bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 41,577. Public Health Wales said 16 people with Covid-19 had died, bringing the total number of deaths to 1,772. The government is set to deliver \u00a375m in grants to 35 of the country\u2019s top cultural organisations and venues, from the Old Vic to Shakespeare\u2019s Globe. It is the latest tranche of money to be distributed from the government\u2019s \u00a31.57bn culture recovery fund. These grants are the largest to have come from the package to date and will go to bodies which require between \u00a31m and \u00a33m. Money was allocated based on whether applicants provided jobs, supported the wider community and engaged with the public through innovative means during the pandemic. More than \u00a352m \u2013 70% of the total awarded in this round - will go to organisations outside London. The culture secretary, Oliver Dowden, said: \u201cAs part of our unprecedented \u00a31.57bn rescue fund, today we\u2019re saving British cultural icons with large grants of up to \u00a33m - from Shakespeare\u2019s Globe to the Sheffield Crucible. The fund has also distributed \u00a3188m to the devolved administrations - with \u00a397m for Scotland, \u00a359m for Wales and \u00a333m for Northern Ireland. Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, called on Saturday for strict punishments for violators of Covid-19 restrictions as the Middle East\u2019s hardest-hit nation battled the third wave. Latest officials figures showed coronavirus had killed 32,320 Iranians and infected 562,705, with 5,814 new cases and 335 fatalities in the previous 24 hours. Taking a swipe at arch-foe the United States, Khamenei said Iran must enforce curbs better and end disputes between institutions over the pandemic.

Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com Spanish regions are urging the central government to take measures that would give them legal backing to impose curfews as the country battles a resurgent coronavirus epidemic. As of Saturday, 10 of Spain\u2019s 17 regions, including Valencia, Asturias, Castilla-La Mancha and the Basque Country, had called on the government to decree a state of emergency, which would allow regions to limit people\u2019s movement. Regions expect the government to call an extraordinary council of ministers on Sunday to approve the measure, Spanish media including El Pa\u00eds reported. \u201cI would say with almost total certainty there will be one. But it has not officially been called yet,\u201d a source from the Spanish government told Reuters. While many regions favour some form of curfew, the powerful Madrid region opposes it, which has so far prevented a nationwide decision. Spain has recorded the highest number of Covid-19 infections in western Europe. Thousands of anti-lockdown protesters have begun a noisy march through central London. After gathering at Speakers\u2019 Corner in Hyde Park, crowds began to walk down Oxford Street in the direction of Oxford Circus. Before leaving, they heard from Piers Corbyn, the brother of the former Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who exhorted followers to \u201cstop new normal, save lives\u201d. Louise Creffield, the founder of Save Our Rights UK, one of the groups behind the protest, told the crowd: \u201cToday we are standing in our power and we are not abiding by their rules. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what they say, it doesn\u2019t matter what threats they bring, it doesn\u2019t matter if they try and intimidate us, we are not going to accept it, because we don\u2019t abide by their rules. We don\u2019t listen because we do not consent.\u201d As they marched down Oxford Street, protesters chanted for freedom and told passersby to take off their masks. Others played the drums, blew whistles and played music on portable sound systems. Here are the latest developments in the coronavirus crisis: More than 1.1 million dead The virus has claimed at least 1,145,847 lives worldwide since it first emerged in China late last year, according to an AFP tally based on official sources. At least 42,262,299 cases have been registered across the globe. The US is the worst-affected country with 223,998 deaths, followed by Brazil with 156,471, India with 117,956, Mexico with 88,312 and Britain with 44,571. WHO warning The WHO chief, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has said \u201ctoo many countries are seeing an exponential increase in Covid-19 cases and that is now leading to hospitals and intensive care units running close to or above capacity - and we\u2019re still only in October.\u201d The message was echoed by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), whose director, Andrea Ammon, spoke of a \u201chighly concerning epidemiological situation\u201d. Germany deaths top 10,000 The Robert Koch Institute, a federal government agency, has recorded a total of 10,003 coronavirus deaths in Germany, where 14,714 new cases have also been diagnosed in the last 24 hours, a record figure. Lothar Wieler, the president of the institute\u2019s disease control authority, said the country was facing a very serious situation. The chancellor, Angela Merkel, told citizens in a weekly video podcast that \u201cthe order of the day is to reduce contacts, to meet as few people as possible\u201d. New daily record cases in US Johns Hopkins University has reported 79,963 new US cases in 24 hours, a record, although the number of daily deaths has remained broadly stable since the beginning of autumn at between 700 and 800. Poland president tests positive Poland\u2019s president, Andrzej Duda, has tested positive, adding another name to the list of leaders to have been diagnosed with the virus. Aside from the diagnosis, the 48-year-old Duda is believed to be in good general health. Naples clashes Hundreds of protesters in Naples threw projectiles at police and set rubbish bins on fire late on Friday during a demonstration against restrictions in the southern Italian city. A mostly young crowd marched through the streets of the regional capital and chanted as a curfew in the Campania region started at 11:00 pm. Some protesterslit smoke bombs. Grants for UK arts institutions The British government has announced a \u00a375m rescue package to save 35 cultural institutions hit by the pandemic, including London\u2019s Globe Old Vic theatres. New coronavirus restrictions are to take effect in Madrid on Saturday as the Spanish government weighs declaring a national state of emergency to allow curfews to be imposed. Days after the country registered more than a million cases of Covid-19, the regions - which are responsible for managing public healthcare - have put pressure on the government to give them legal right to impose tighter restrictions. In practice, that would involve the prime minister, Pedro S\u00e1nchez declaring a national state of emergency that would enable the regions to impose curfews, a measure increasingly applied across Europe. Nine of Spain\u2019s 17 autonomous regions have formally requested such a move, and a decision is expected to be at an extraordinary meeting of ministers on Sunday. The government can impose an emergency for up to a fortnight, but it would need parliamentary approval to extend it. Spain used the powers in spring to enforce one of the world\u2019s tightest lockdowns, and a similar measure has been in force in Madrid for the past fortnight, although only to impose movement restrictions on the capital and various nearby towns. That measure ends at 4:47 pm (1447 GMT) on Saturday, when new restrictions drawn up by the regional authorities will come into force. Hello everyone. I am running the Guardian\u2019s global live feed, updating you on all the latest coronavirus news from around the world. Please do feel free to contact me while I work today, providing any news tips or comments. Thanks Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com The Sars-CoV-2 coronavirus has killed at least 1,145,847 people since the outbreak emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP. At least 42,262,290 cases have been registered, of which at least 28,754,900 are now considered recovered. The tallies, using data collected from national authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO), probably reflect only a fraction of the actual number of infections. Many countries are testing only symptomatic or the most serious cases. On Friday, 482,954 new cases and 6,366 new deaths and were recorded worldwide. Istanbul\u2019s mayor Ekrem Imamo\u011flu has been admitted to hospital after testing positive for coronavirus and suffering a fever. \u201cYesterday evening around 9pm I got a fever and with a temperature of 38 degrees. I came and spent the night in hospital,\u201d he said in a video. \u201cNow I am actually well. My fever is not bad. The process is continuing. There is nothing that can be viewed as negative in a medical sense.\u201d Istanbul\u2019s American hospital said in a statement that Imamo\u011flu, an opponent of the country\u2019s president Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, was admitted at 10pm (1900 GMT) after displaying symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. It said he tested positive for coronavirus and that his treatment was continuing. Imamo\u011flu, from the secular Republican People\u2019s party (CHP), was elected mayor in a re-run election in June 2019 in a blow to Erdo\u011fan and his ruling AK party. There have since been sporadic tensions between his municipality and the central government, including disputes over fundraising and measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic in its early stages. Spanish regions have urged the central government to take measures that would give them legal backing to impose curfews as coronavirus cases rise. As of Saturday, 10 of Spain\u2019s 17 regions, including Valencia, Asturias, Castilla-La Mancha and the Basque Country, had called on the government to decree a state of emergency, which would allow regions to limit people\u2019s movement, Reuters reported. Regions expect the government to call an extraordinary council of ministers on Sunday to approve the measure, Spanish media including El Pa\u00eds reported. Many regions favour some form of curfew, but the powerful Madrid region opposes it, which has so far prevented a nationwide decision. Spain has recorded the highest number of Covid-19 infections in western Europe. Total cases rose to 1,046,132 on Friday, and the death toll is nearing 38,000. Catalonia said on Friday night that it would impose a curfew across the region, which includes Barcelona, as soon as the central government acted. The deputy Catalan leader, Pere Aragones, told a press conference: We need a decentralised state of emergency in which the Catalan government maintains all management capacity. The evolution is very worrying. Either we increase our efforts or Covid-19 increases. Some regions are considering imposing curfews by alternative means, such as going through regional courts, if the central government does not act. \u201cWe cannot wait any longer and we have to take steps forward,\u201d Murcia\u2019s regional president, Fernando L\u00f3pez Miras, told the Spanish broadcaster TVE on Saturday. \u201cIf the central government does nothing, we will approve a curfew.\u201d Malaysia reported 1,228 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, a record daily jump since the start of the pandemic, bringing the total number of cases to 25,742. The health ministry also said seven new deaths had also been recorded. Recent data has highlighted the struggle authorities around the world face in bringing the coronavirus pandemic under control, as the US reported 80,000 infections in a single day, France extended a curfew to two-thirds of its citizens and Germany\u2019s death toll passed 10,000. The World Health Organization had earlier warned of an exponential rise in infections that threatened health systems\u2019 ability to cope. But populations weary of social isolation and economic hardship have pushed back against fresh restrictions to slow the resurgent virus\u2019 spread. There were clashes overnight in Naples between Italian police and hundreds of protesters. Covid-19 has become a central election issue in the US ahead of the presidential election on 3 November. Donald Trump promised attendees at a Florida rally on Friday that \u201cwe\u2019re going to quickly end this pandemic, this horrible plague\u201d. Joe Biden matched Trump\u2019s vow to make a vaccine available free to all who want it \u201cwhether or not you\u2019re insured\u201d and said the Republican incumbent has \u201cgiven up\u201d on controlling the outbreak. Johns Hopkins University had earlier reported 79,963 new US cases in 24 hours, a record, although the number of daily deaths has remained broadly stable since the beginning of autumn at between 700 and 800. Ministers may be forced to close schools in England to older children if coronavirus cases continue to increase at the current rate, a scientist has said. Prof Neil Ferguson, whose modelling led to the original lockdown in March, said the NHS would soon be unable to cope unless the spread of the disease was stemmed. He said there were 8,000 people in hospital with coronavirus - around a third of the peak earlier this year - and that numbers were continuing to rise. \u201cIt is a worrying situation,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cIf the rate of growth continues as it is, it means that in a month\u2019s time we will above that peak level in March and that is probably unsustainable. \u201cWe are in a critical time right now. The health system will not be able to cope with this rate of growth for much longer.\u201d His warning came as South Yorkshire became the latest region to enter the tightest Tier 3 restrictions in England following Liverpool city region, Greater Manchester and Lancashire. Ferguson said it would be another week or two before it became clear whether the stricter measures would have an impact on case numbers. He said the restrictions on households mixing should have a significant effect, but that further action may also be needed. Bulgaria\u2019s capital Sofia, home to about 2 million people, will close nightclubs and discos on Sunday for two weeks in an effort to contain a surge in coronavirus infections straining its health system. Speaking on national BTV television on Saturday, the city\u2019s mayor, Yordanka Fankakova, also urged Sofia universities to switch to online education and appealed to businesses to let as many employees as possible work from home. \u201cThe situation is Sofia is becoming increasingly alarming. We have a new increase in infections and of people who need hospital treatment. This is straining the hospitals,\u201d she said. Hello everyone and thanks for following the Guardian\u2019s live feed today. I am keeping you up to date with all the news on coronavirus from around the globe. Please do email or message me if you want to share thoughts, comments or news tips. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com In the UK, Prof Neil Ferguson has said a decision about whether restrictions on households mixing should be relaxed over Christmas will be a \u201cpolitical judgment\u201d . \u201cIt risks some transmission and there will be consequences of that. Some people will die because of getting infected on that day,\u201d he told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cBut if it is only one or two days the impact is likely to be limited. So that is really a political judgment about the cost versus the benefits.\u201d Indonesia reported 4,070 new coronavirus infections on Saturday, taking the total number of cases to 385,980, official data from the country\u2019s Covid-19 taskforce shows. It also reported 128 new deaths, taking the total to 13,205, and 4,119 people recovered from the virus on Saturday, bringing the total to 309,219. Wales\u2019 firebreak lockdown should bring the R value - the number of people each coronavirus case infects - below one, health minister Vaughan Gething has said. Gething told BBC Breakfast the 17-day period would be followed by a set of national measures to control the spread of Covid-19. Asked about economists warning that the lockdown could cost the Welsh economy more than \u00a3500m, Mr Gething said: \u201cIt\u2019s not just about the direct costs within the firebreak, when we know there will be a challenge and loss in economic activity. \u201cIt\u2019s about saving a much greater loss if we need to have longer, deeper, more sustained measures.\u201d The Polish president, Andrzej Duda, has tested positive for coronavirus and is subject to quarantine but is feeling good, presidential minister Blazej Spychalski announced on Saturday. \u201cThe president yesterday was tested for the presence of coronavirus. The result turned out to be positive. The president is fine. We are in constant contact with the relevant medical services,\u201d Spychalski said on Twitter. Duda\u2019s infection comes as the country imposed new restrictions on Saturday to curb the spread of the illness. Poland faces a surge in the COVID-19 epidemic, with new infections hitting a daily record of 13,632 on Friday. Duda, 48, holds a mainly ceremonial role but has the power to veto legislation. He is an ally of the ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party. Russia has reported 16,521 new coronavirus cases and 296 deaths in the past 24 hours, up from 17,340 new cases and 283 deaths the previous day. The Czech Republic reported 15,252 new cases for 23 October, the highest daily tally. Deaths rose by 126 to 1,971. In the UK, Sheffield city region mayor Dan Jarvis has said he will not hesitate to seek additional government support for South Yorkshire after the region entered the strictest Tier 3 coronavirus controls. Jarvis said a 41 million funding package had been secured after a \u201ctough\u201d process of negotiation and he had won an agreement from ministers to keep the situation under review. \u201cThe scale of the challenge is very significant,\u201d he told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme. \u201cWe are acutely aware of the pressures our NHS is under, not least because winter hasn\u2019t bitten yet, so we are looking very carefully at what we need to do. \u201cBut if there is a requirement for more resource - whether it is economic support or it is other measures of assistance from the Government - I won\u2019t hesitate to go back and ask for them.\u201d Morning all from London, where it is 8am (BST). I am taking over the coronavirus live feed, bringing you all the latest information on the virus from around the world. Please do keep in touch with me while I work, by sharing any comments or news tips. Twitter: @sloumarsh Instagram: sarah_marsh_journalist Email: sarah.marsh@theguardian.com That\u2019s where I will leave you for now, but never fear Sarah Marsh is here to take you through the rest of the day\u2019s news. The Czech Republic recorded 15,252 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, the country\u2019s highest ever daily increase. It also recorded 126 deaths overnight, bringing the death toll to 1,971. The Czech Republic managed to escape the first wave of Covid-19 relatively unscathed, with case numbers rarely rising above 200 a day prior to September, but has been hit extremely hard as Europe battles a resurgence in the virus. Poland\u2019s president, Andrzej Duda, has tested positive for coronavirus but is feeling good, the presidential minister Blazej Spychalski announced on Saturday. \u201cThe president yesterday was tested for the presence of coronavirus. The result turned out to be positive. The president is fine. We are in constant contact with the relevant medical services,\u201d Spychalski said on Twitter. Duda\u2019s infection comes as the country faces a surge in the Covid-19 epidemic, with new infections hitting a daily record of more than 13,600 on Friday. Duda, 48, holds a mainly ceremonial role, but has the power to veto legislation. He is an ally of the ruling nationalist Law and Justice (PiS) party. From Saturday, more restrictions to curb the spread of the virus are due to come into force in Poland, including a two-week shutdown of restaurants and bars. The health ministry reported 153 coronavirus deaths on Friday, taking the total toll to 4,172. The Conservative MP Ben Bradley has been accused of \u201cstigmatisation of working-class families\u201d over a tweet that labelled the free school meals programme as \u201c20 cash direct to a crack den and a brothel\u201d. Bradley replied to the post, which was by another user. The MP wrote: \u201cThat\u2019s what FSM vouchers in the summer effectively did ...\u201d The deputy leader of Labour, Angela Rayner, said: A Conservative MP has said that free school meals are effectively a direct payment to brothels and drug dealers. Notwithstanding the fact that the vouchers in summer could only be used to purchase food, this stigmatisation of working class families is disgraceful and disgusting. MPs rejected a campaign, started by the Manchester United player Marcus Rashford, to offer free school meals for local children during half-term. A vote on the measures was backed by Labour and made its way to parliament this week but it was defeated by 322 votes to 261. Bradley said the context of his tweet \u201cwasn\u2019t as clear as I\u2019d thought it was\u201d. Needless to say, I haven\u2019t said what I\u2019m being accused of, nor would I ever. I\u2019m sorry if others get dragged into the fire. If you want a proper debate you have to accept that sometimes you get it wrong. Proper debate is important. You learn from it, you move on. We\u2019re all human. More than a million people in South Yorkshire are now living under the strictest coronavirus rules in England after the region moved into the tier 3 controls as health officials battle to stem the spread of the disease. The region joined Liverpool city region, greater Manchester and Lancashire on the highest alert level for England with the new rules kicking in on Saturday at 12.01am. Meanwhile, talks were continuing between the government and local leaders in Nottinghamshire, with parts of the county expected to enter tier 3 on Wednesday. And the council in Warrington in Cheshire \u2013 where many residents commute to Manchester and Liverpool \u2013 has confirmed that it will be moving to tier 3 on Thursday. It means households will be banned from mixing except in parks and other open spaces while pubs and bars will have to close unless they serve meals. Three more areas \u2013 Coventry, Stoke and Slough \u2013 have now also moved into tier 2, the second highest alert level. It came as Wales began a two-week national \u201cfirebreak\u201d at 6pm on Friday evening with a return to the \u201cstay at home\u201d message of the initial lockdown in March. In Scotland, the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, has set out a five-tier series of controls that will come into force on 2 November if they are approved next week by the Holyrood parliament. In England, ministers have said they hope the latest measures will suppress the virus sufficiently to enable families to spend Christmas together. Thailand reported one more locally transmitted case of the coronavirus on Saturday, after confirming five domestic infections last week. The new patient is a 57-year-old French woman in the southern province of Surat Thani who tested positive for the virus a few days after she had completed a 14-day quarantine, the country\u2019s coronavirus taskforce said. The patient\u2019s husband and child tested negative, health officials said. Earlier in the week five people in the town of Mae Sot, on the border with Myanmar, tested positive, and in September a prison inmate in the Bangkok area tested positive. Before these six cases, Thailand reported its first confirmed local transmission in more than 100 days on 3 September. In total, Thailand has reported 3,731 cases of the virus and 59 deaths. Victoria\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services has put out its daily press release, which gives us a bit more clarity on exactly where those seven cases came from. Six of today\u2019s seven new cases are linked to known outbreaks and cases. One is a close contact already identified as part of the Hoppers Crossing community outbreak and was already in quarantine and one is a staff member from Estia Keilor. One is a student from East Preston Islamic College, one is a student from Croxton Special School, also linked to East Preston Islamic College through family and two are parents from East Preston Islamic College. The remaining case is a previously positive case that is currently under investigation. Of today\u2019s seven new cases, there are three cases in Darebin, and single cases in Banyule, Greater Dandenong, Maribyrnong and Wyndham. In his daily press conference, the premier, Daniel Andrews, suggested that one remaining case is being investigated as a possible reinfection, but is more likely to be someone who has recovered from Covid-19 but is still shedding the virus. The AFP has provided this wrap of the current Covid-19 situation in Europe: The European Union\u2019s disease control agency has joined frantic health workers to sound the alarm over a coronavirus surge across the continent, as the World Health Organization warned of an \u201cexponential\u201d rise in infections. Even countries that avoided severe outbreaks during Europe\u2019s first wave of contagion in the spring have watched their case numbers surge, with Germany\u2019s death toll passing 10,000 on Saturday. Governments have reintroduced containment measures to slow the renewed spread of the virus in nations that only weeks earlier believed they had triumphed over the crisis. But populations weary of social isolation and economic hardship have pushed back against fresh restrictions, including overnight clashes in Italy\u2019s hard-hit Naples between police and hundreds of protesters. After Spain became the first European country to officially record a million Covid-19 cases earlier in the week, the prime minister, Pedro Sanchez, said on Friday the real number of infections was likely more than triple that number. France followed Spain past the million-case milestone on Friday while Germany hit a fresh daily record of nearly 15,000 new cases, with health authorities urging the public to follow social distancing measures. Urgent new restrictions on daily life have come into effect in several nations, with France extending a curfew to cover 46 million people. Wales entered a full lockdown on Friday evening, a day after Ireland shut down, while Poland adopted a nationwide \u201cred zone\u201d lockdown mandating the partial closure of primary schools and restaurants. Only Sweden, which famously refused to lock down earlier this year, continued to stick to its guns despite a rise in cases. Belgium has seen one of Europe\u2019s deadliest per capita outbreaks and has found itself suffering some of the highest second-wave infection rates in Europe. \u201cWe\u2019re losing. We\u2019re overwhelmed. We\u2019re bitter,\u201d said Benoit Misset, the head of the intensive care unit at the University hospital in the city of Liege, where several of his staff are having to work despite being positive \u2013 if asymptomatic \u2013 themselves. Queensland health officials are working to determine the strain of Covid-19 infecting the crew of a cargo ship anchored off the Australian state\u2019s Sunshine Coast. The MV Sofrana Surville was blocked from docking in Brisbane after New Zealand warned it could be carrying a new strain of the virus. Initial testing found two of the Sofrana\u2019s 19 crew members were infected and they were transferred to a mainland hospital on Friday. The Queensland deputy premier, Steven Miles, said the New Zealand government had asked Queensland\u2019s health department to undertake genomic sequencing on the suspected new strain. \u201cGiven [the cases] have come off a ship that has been in other countries, it\u2019s highly likely to be a different strain ... [to] the current strains within Australia,\u201d he told reporters. You can read the full story here: Hello, Matilda Boseley with you now to take you through the next few hours of Covid-related news. No new cases of Covid-19 in South Australia for today. A man who allegedly refused to comply with self-quarantine rules in Western Australia has been taken into custody and refused bail following a struggle with police, AAP reports. The 32-year-old New Zealander, who resides in Queensland, had been granted approval to enter WA to work and was issued a FIFO self-quarantine direction on 13 October when he arrived in Perth. He was required to remain in quarantine for 14 days at an East Perth apartment but police say that on Friday a compliance check found he was not there but in front of the complex. Police said it was further found he had been socialising with a 30-year-old man from the same company who was also quarantining in the complex. Both men were told they would be fined $1,000 for failing to comply with directions. But on leaving the complex police officers again found the 32-year-old man at the front of the property, WA police said in a statement on Saturday. The man was told he would be moved to a secure self-quarantine hotel for the remainder of his quarantine but he became \u201caggressive and hostile towards the officers\u201d, refusing to comply with the direction, the statement said. \u201cThe man was arrested after a short struggle and was relocated to the Perth watch house.\u201d He was charged with four counts of failing to comply with a direction and was refused bail to appear in the Perth magistrates court on Saturday. South Korea has reported 77 new cases of Covid-19, AP reports, mostly from the greater capital area where officials are scrambling to stem transmissions at hospitals and nursing homes. More location notifications from Victoria. I appreciate that they\u2019re getting pretty speedy with getting these out now. Malaysia\u2019s King Al-Sultan Abdullah will consult with other rulers to discuss proposals by the prime minister, Muhyiddin Yassin, the palace said on Saturday, after sources told Reuters the PM had asked the king to declare a state of emergency. Muhyiddin met with the king on Friday to present the emergency proposal that includes a suspension of parliament, sources said \u2013 a move the opposition leader, Anwar Ibrahim, denounced as an attempt by the PM to cling to power amid a power struggle. The proposal comes as Malaysia sees a resurgence in coronavirus cases and as Muhyiddin faces a leadership challenge from Anwar, who last month said he had majority support in parliament to oust the PM. The palace did not identify the recommendations made by Muhyiddin, and said the king would soon hold the consultation with other Malay rulers. \u201cAl-Sultan Abdullah greatly understands the need for the country\u2019s administration to continue to tackle the threat of Covid-19,\u201d the palace said in a statement. The Council of Rulers, which groups the heads of Malaysia\u2019s nine royal houses, has the power to withhold consent from any law and deliberate on questions of national policy. A source familiar with the matter said the rulers would meet on Sunday. Muhyiddin\u2019s office has not commented on the emergency proposal. The government is scheduled to propose its 2021 budget on 6 November, and there have been questions over whether it can muster a majority in parliament for that. Defeat on the budget would count as a vote of no-confidence in Muhyiddin and could trigger an election. Emergency rule might mean the budget would not be put to a vote at that time. Western Australia has reported four new cases of Covid-19 overnight. The positive cases \u2013 all males aged between 30 and 57 \u2013 returned to Perth from overseas. They are all in hotel quarantine, and none are in hospital. This is probably a good time to summarise some of what we have learned so far today: The Australian state of Victoria has recorded seven new cases of Covid-19, and no new deaths. There are fewer than 100 active cases in the state for the first time since late June, as Victoria seeks to contain an outbreak in the northern suburbs of Melbourne before more restrictions ease. Mexico\u2019s health ministry reported on Friday 6,604 additional cases of the novel coronavirus and 418 more deaths in the country, bringing the official number of cases to 880,775 and the death toll to 88,312. The United States broke its daily record for new coronavirus infections on Friday as it reported at least 83,948 new cases due to outbreaks in virtually every part of the country. Germany has reached 10,000 deaths from Covid-19. The country has reported 14,714 new cases of Covid-19 overnight, and an additional 49 deaths.It takes the country\u2019s totals to 418,005 cases and 10,003 deaths. Authorities in Sri Lanka on Saturday closed at least two fishery harbours and many stalls after a surge of 609 cases linked to the country\u2019s main fish market, AP reports. The government also widened the curfew in parts of Colombo. At least 11 villages were isolated in the densely populated Western province, which includes the capital. Health authorities on Wednesday temporarily closed the fish market on Colombo\u2019s outskirts after 49 traders tested positive for the coronavirus. By Saturday, the number of cases went up to 609. Hundreds of traders and fishermen are being tested. Authorities say the outbreak is related to a cluster in a garment factory early this month, which has grown to 3,426 cases, almost half the country\u2019s total of 6,287. It broke a two-month lull in infections. Several thousand people have been asked to quarantine at home. Schools and key public offices are closed, gatherings banned and restrictions imposed on public transport. Sri Lanka has had 14 deaths since March. Hundreds of protesters in Naples threw projectiles at police and set rubbish bins on fire late Friday during a demonstration against coronavirus restrictions in the southern Italian city, AP reports. Calls were issued on social media to challenge a curfew that took effect in the Campania region ahead of the weekend, enacted in response to a spiralling second wave of infections that saw nearly 20,000 new cases detected in the last 24 hours. A mostly young crowd marched through the streets of the regional capital and chanted as the curfew started at 11 pm, with some lighting smoke bombs. One carried a makeshift sign that read: \u201cIf you close, you pay.\u201d Regional president Vincenzo de Luca had called for stricter confinement measures to contain the virus in Campania, which recorded 2,300 cases over the last day. \u201cWe are on the verge of tragedy, we need a national lockdown,\u201d he said. Prime minister Giuseppe Conte has so far avoided reimposing the kind of restrictions that saw the entire nation confined to home quarantine for two months earlier this year and precipitated the country\u2019s worst post-war recession. Italy was the first European country to be badly hit by the virus. It has now registered nearly 500,000 cases and 37,000 deaths, according to health ministry figures. Some new exposure site information for Victoria. AFP has more on the Germany numbers: 14,714 were diagnosed in the last 24 hours \u2013 a daily record. Robert Koch Institute president Lothar Wieler said Germany was facing a \u201cvery serious\u201d situation and asked the population to adhere to social distancing measures. Germany was spared during the first wave of coronavirus infections that hit Europe in spring but is now suffering a sharp increase in cases along with the rest of the continent. Authorities have tightened measures against the pandemic including the adoption of a public assembly ban. Chancellor Angela Merkel last weekend asked the country to reduce their social contact and stay home as much as possible. \u201cWhat winter will be, what our Christmas will be, will be decided in the days and weeks to come,\u201d she had warned. Queensland health officials are working to determine the mystery strain of Covid-19 infecting the crew of a cargo ship anchored off the Sunshine Coast, AAP reports. The MV Sofrana Surville was blocked from docking in Brisbane after New Zealand warned it could be carrying a new mutated strain of the virus. Initial testing found two of the Sofrana\u2019s 19 crew members were infected with Covid-19 and they were transferred to a mainland hospital on Friday. The deputy premier, Steven Miles, said the New Zealand government had asked Queensland Health to undertake genomic sequencing on the suspected new strain. \u201cGiven (the cases) have come off a ship that has been in other countries, it\u2019s highly likely to be a different strain ... (to) the current strains within Australia,\u201d he told reporters on Friday. He said the additional testing would take about a week. The Sofrana left New Zealand earlier in the month with fresh crew from the Philippines before stopping at Noumea in New Caledonia and then sailing for Brisbane. New Zealand requested Australian health officials perform the additional testing after an engineer who had previously worked on the ship tested positive in Auckland. Miles on Saturday said zero new cases of Covid-19 had been uncovered inside Queensland, meaning the state still had six active cases. It has been 44 days since the last locally acquired case in Queensland. Miles on Friday said it was likely an announcement would be made about Queensland\u2019s border reopening to NSW late next week. Asked when Victorians would be free to travel to Queensland, Miles said it would be after health restrictions in that state were eased and several incubation periods had been completed. Earlier this week I reported former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott has been allowed to leave Australia not once but twice as part of his new trade envoy role for the Boris Johnson government in the United Kingdom. The former PM was allowed to leave on what was termed an \u201cauto-exemption\u201d because it was government business. I\u2019d been trying to figure out how many people have been allowed to leave while Australia has had a travel ban in place during the pandemic. Australian Border Force refused to say how many auto-exemptions have been granted, but I just came across some data on how many exemptions in total. According to Border Force in documents tabled in the Senate, between April and September this year, a total of 73,848 Australians and permanent residents have been allowed to leave Australia. More are coming back, however. Border Force also reports 93,937 Australians and permanent residents have travelled to Australia in that time. It\u2019s not clear how many have left and come back, or how many, if any apart from Abbott, have made multiple trips. Senate estimates heard Abbott would be expected to go into hotel quarantine for a second time when he returns. Meanwhile, our current prime minister, Scott Morrison, has said he will seek to get 26,000 stranded Australians back home before Christmas. Some extra capacity will be made available, with around 6,290 places in hotel quarantine available each week. Germany has reported 14,714 new cases of Covid-19 overnight, and an additional 49 deaths. It takes the country\u2019s totals to 418,005 cases and 10,003 deaths The United States broke its daily record for new coronavirus infections on Friday as it reported at least 83,948 new cases due to outbreaks in virtually every part of the country, according to a Reuters tally. The spike in cases comes less than two weeks before the presidential election on 3 November and is hitting battleground states such as Ohio, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. On Thursday, the United States reported a near-record 76,195 new cases. The previous record was 77,299 new cases on 16 July. At the time, hospitalisations for Covid-19 patients hit 47,000 and two weeks later deaths rose to an average of 1,200 per day. Now, hospitalisations are over 41,000 and deaths average nearly 800 per day. Health experts have not pinpointed the reason for the rise but have long warned that colder temperatures driving people inside, fatigue with Covid-19 precautions and students returning to schools and colleges, could promote the spread of the virus. The United States has the most cases in the world at 8.5 million and the most fatalities with 224,000 lives lost. The United States has reported over the past week an average of 60,000 new cases per day, the highest seven-day average since early August. The Midwest has been the epicenter of the latest surge but infections are rising nationwide. The Northeast reported an 83% increase in cases in the past month. New cases have doubled in Connecticut, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and New Jersey in the past four weeks as compared to the prior four weeks, according to a Reuters analysis. Western states including Montana, New Mexico and Wyoming have reported a 200% increase in cases in the past four weeks when compared with the previous four weeks. Mexico\u2019s northern border state of Chihuahua returned to the highest level of alert and lockdown Friday after coronavirus cases jumped there and hospitals began to fill up. The Chihuahua state government declared the return to the \u201cred\u201d level of alert Friday, which closes down most non-essential services and encourages people to stay at home. The Health Department said the state\u2019s hospital beds were now 69% occupied, and that only about 23% of intensive care beds were open. The department said steps were being taken to expand hospital facilities. The department also said that three other northern states \u2014 Durango, Coahuila and Nuevo Leon \u2014 were at risk of returning to maximum alert unless infections were brought under control. Nationwide, 19 of Mexico\u2019s 32 states will be at high alert starting Monday, 11 will be at medium alert and one state was considered at moderate risk level. Mexico as a whole has seen 880,775 test-confirmed cases, up 6,604 from the previous day\u2019s count, and 88,312 confirmed deaths, up by 418. Here is a bit more info on the Covid-19 situation in NSW today: It\u2019s the second consecutive 24-hour period in which NSW recorded no new locally acquired virus cases, and comes as the state government from this weekend eases some restrictions. Up to 30 people are now allowed to gather outdoors, group bookings at hospitality venues have been extended from 10 to 30 people and up to 300 are allowed at places of worship. Protesters can also gather en masse, with up to 500 people allowed to convene outdoors. Staffing regulations at gyms across NSW have also been relaxed, with a safety marshal only required when more than 20 people are working out. Two drugmakers have announced the resumption of US testing of their Covid-19 vaccine candidates. Testing of AstraZeneca\u2019s vaccine candidate had been halted since early September, while Johnson &amp; Johnson\u2019s vaccine study was paused at the beginning of last week. Each company had a study volunteer develop a serious health issue, requiring a review of safety data. The two coronavirus vaccines are among several candidates in final-stage testing, the last step before seeking regulatory approval. The drugmakers said they got the go-ahead on Friday from the Food and Drug Administration to restart tests in the US. Such temporary halts of drug and vaccine testing are relatively common. In research involving thousands of participants, some are likely to fall ill. Pausing a study allows researchers to investigate whether an illness is a side effect or a coincidence. You can read the full story below: Sutton was asked when the press conference will be held tomorrow, and he said \u201cwhen it is called\u201d. And that\u2019s the end of that. Victorian chief health officer Prof Brett Sutton says he is \u201cvery confident\u201d Victoria will get control of the cases associated with the northern Melbourne outbreak, but reiterates there is a need to find the links between the cases, and that will inform the easing of instructions. Sutton declines to comment on why he instructed lawyers acting for the health department not to include evidence where it showed he was included on emails on 27 March that mentions the use of private security guards well before he previously said he was made aware. Sutton says he is providing an affidavit to the inquiry and it is appropriate to wait for that to be provided to the inquiry. Andrews won\u2019t cop criticism of the public health team who communicated with the family at the centre of the East Preston Islamic College outbreak. He said the family were advised what to do, but the message didn\u2019t get through because one child went to school while infectious. Andrews disagrees with the suggestion it would be a miracle to have low case numbers tomorrow given all the tests waiting to be processed. I wouldn\u2019t say that. We have done, haven\u2019t got a weekly total, but we have had a very, very strong week in terms of test, right back to the weekend. And we have turned up a relatively low number of cases this week and the vast majority have been linked to other known cases. Andrews says the 25km radius limit and the Melbourne metro/regional border are on the table to be eased tomorrow, if that happens, but suggests both could remain in place to prevent potential spread of Covid-19 to popular tourism locations like Mornington Peninsula. Daniel Andrews says the school, community and faith leaders are calling people in the northern Melbourne area to get tested. The two schools involved are organising for everyone who hasn\u2019t been tested to get tested. I had a conversation this morning, Jerome and I, with some of the school leadership. They have gone through and booked in family by family to come and be tested at the site that the testing station is on the school grounds. They will work through all those different appointments and that will give them a list of people who did not show and that is not a criticism, they may have gone somewhere else. Circumstances may have intervened. But then they will go back and do that for a second time, a third time. We are confident we will get all of those people to come and get tested and then we will get the results as fast as possible. Daniel Andrews says \u201cit\u2019ll be a very late night, and a very early morning\u201d when it comes to making decisions around restrictions easing tomorrow. Earlier in the press conference he said the easing of restrictions tomorrow could not be \u201cbanked on\u201d. We really do have to wait to see what those test results show us ... what we are hopeful of is connections and linkages to these cases and these cases do not speak to the virus being in the northern suburbs more than we had thought, so it is all about trying to find those linkages and that is why there is a very big team of people interviewing, re-interviewing, looking at things from every conceivable angle to try to find linkages. He says Victoria is still in a good position with low case numbers, and will proceed with easing of restrictions if possible. It\u2019s just about getting those test results. I\u2019m trying to be as frank as possible. A lot of people had banked tomorrow as the day where we would have absolute clarity about what the rest of October and November looks like. If we can do that, we will. But the appropriate thing to do if you have thousands of tests in the laboratory being processed, you have to wait for the results. Jeroen Weimar says the Victorian health department is focused on close and secondary contacts for the northern Melbourne outbreak, and says he doesn\u2019t think schools opened up again too soon. \u201cSome family members live in all sorts of housing, some in public housing, some in community housing, many in private accommodation. We are increasingly doing door-to-door testing for them so we are going to them to ensure that they get the care they need and support that they need but also to get tested,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I look at the response of the school leadership of the schools that we are leading with, dealing with in this particular outbreak, they have taken prompt and swift action. We are talking about cases that happened on Monday this week.\u201d The positive case at Croxton school is a student, they are part of a family of four, and all four of the family are positive, Jeroen Weimar said. One of the family\u2019s other children attends the East Preston Islamic College, but it is not clear whether the cases are connected. The two children attended school while infected on one day. A total of 9,405 tests have been conducted for staff, students or close contacts at the East Preston Islamic College, Victoria\u2019s head of contact tracing, Jeroen Weimar, says. There are 101 close contacts associated with the college isolating, and 307 secondary contacts isolating. There are 34 close contacts of the Croxton special school also isolating. The Victorian health department sent out 22,000 text messages and emails to taxi and Uber drivers in the northern Melbourne area, and Weimar has encouraged the drivers to come forward for testing. Daniel Andrews flags the long-awaited easing of restrictions announcement tomorrow should not be \u201cbanked on\u201d. He says the announcements will still come tomorrow, but the actual easing will depend on the thousands of tests results waiting to come back as a result of the testing blitz in Melbourne\u2019s northern suburbs. Now is not the time for us to start ignoring when we find significant virus ... whether it be in a given community or in a given geographical area ... We are still optimistic that we will be able to have positive things to say, but I\u2019m just ... It\u2019s a note of caution, with so much information yet to come to us, we need to be guided by that. That has always been the way. That is what has delivered these low numbers. On the northern Melbourne outbreak, Daniel Andrews says he met with the community leaders this morning. I had a meeting early this morning with a number of community and faith leaders from the inner northern suburbs and, indeed, the northern suburbs more broadly. I want to thank them for the very proactive and cooperative way \u2013 the partnership that we have with them. They\u2019re reaching out to literally hundreds and thousands of people in their own networks, whether they be faith-based or community-based networks, setting up telephone trees, calling upon people to come forward and get tested, making sure that they\u2019re reminding people that, if you\u2019ve been asked to stay in your home \u2013 either pending a test result or because you\u2019re a positive or a close contact \u2013 that that\u2019s critically important to do and that everybody, regardless of your background, everybody is in this together. This virus does not, in any way, discriminate between different members of the Victorian community and neither does the government and its agencies when it comes to providing the most appropriate public health response. He says there are thousands of test results from people in the area still waiting to come back, and hundreds if not thousands of more people are likely to be tested today. He says it is a 35% increase in the normal amount of testing you would expect to see in that community. Victorian premier Daniel Andrews says Victoria has under 100 active cases of Covid-19 for the first time since 19 June. Of today\u2019s seven cases, Andrews says six are linked to outbreaks or known cases, including East Preston Islamic College, Croxton special school Northcote, the Hoppers Crossing community outbreak, and Estia in Keilor. One of those seven cases is under investigation. There are three new cases in Darebin and single cases in Banule, greater Dandenong, Maribyrnong and Wyndham. There were 17,219 test results since yesterday, which Andrews says is \u201canother very, very strong number.\u201d Eight people are in hospital, and none in the ICU. There are seven active cases among healthcare workers. Mexico\u2019s health ministry reported on Friday 6,604 additional cases of the novel coronavirus and 418 more deaths in the country, bringing the official number of cases to 880,775 and the death toll to 88,312. Health officials have said the real number of infected people is likely significantly higher than the confirmed cases. I am in Melbourne, the city with one of the, if not the, longest lockdowns in the world. Now we only have around 100 actives cases left, we are on the verge of opening up. We all crave a return to \u201cCovid normal\u201d as the politicians like to say, but there\u2019s a fear it could return, and we might be forced to endure another lockdown. For the second day in a row, the Australian state of New South Wales has reported no new locally acquired Covid-19 cases. There were five cases reported in hotel quarantine. There were 12,890 tests reported to 8pm last night, compared with 13,686 in the previous 24 hours. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, will provide his daily update at 11.30am AEDT today. It\u2019s the last update before tomorrow\u2019s expected announcement of the further easing of restrictions in the state. Australia\u2019s ABC has reported the principal of the East Preston Islamic College in Melbourne has said the family of the child who attended school while infectious with Covid-19 is considering leaving the area after being devastated that it has led to the virus spreading. The family had been isolating, but was told by the Victorian health department that two of the family\u2019s children could return to school. English is not their first language, and it was interpreted that this meant all three children could go back to school, too. The child was meant to keep isolating, and tested positive on Wednesday. Now four new cases connected to the outbreak of 32 cases were reported on Saturday and around 800 people in the northern suburbs of Melbourne are currently isolating and being tested. A bright yellow helicopter rose into a blue sky on Friday carrying a Covid-19 patient from the Netherlands to a German intensive care unit, the first such international airlift since the pandemic first threatened to swamp Dutch hospitals in the spring, AP reports. The clatter of the helicopter\u2019s rotors as it lifted off from a parking lot behind a hospital 30km east of Amsterdam was a noisy reminder of how the coronavirus is again gripping Europe and straining health care systems that struggled for equipment and staff during the pandemic\u2019s first wave. Elsewhere on the continent, an absence of noise will underscore the virus\u2019 resurgence. More than two-thirds of the people living in France were to be subject to a nightly curfew starting at midnight Friday, hours after health authorities announced that the country had joined Spain in surpassing 1 million confirmed cases since the start of the pandemic. \u201cThe epidemic is very strongly accelerating,\u201d French President Emmanuel Macron said after visiting a hospital near Paris. France became the second country in Western Europe and the seventh world-wide to reach that number of known infections after reporting 42,032 new daily cases. Of the 445,000 confirmed cases the World Health Organization had recorded in the past 24 hours, nearly half were in Europe, Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO\u2019s technical lead on COVID-19, said. I\u2019m Josh Taylor and I will be seeing you through the rest of the morning and early afternoon of Saturday, Australian time. Here\u2019s what we know so far today: Victoria has reported no new deaths and seven new cases of Covid-19 overnight, including four new cases linked to an outbreak at the East Preston Islamic College. About 800 people who are either close contacts or secondary contacts of those associated with the school are currently isolating and awaiting test results. All staff and students from the nearby Croxton School have also been told to get tested and self-isolate, even if they aren\u2019t experiencing symptoms. AstraZeneca has resumed the US trial of its experimental Covid-19 vaccine after approval by US regulators, the company said. It was paused on 6 September after a report of a serious neurological illness, believed to be transverse myelitis, in a participant in the company\u2019s UK trial. Dr Anthony Fauci, the US infectious disease expert, said the White House coronavirus task force\u2019s meetings have become less frequent, even as infections rise in dozens of US states. The EU\u2019s disease control agency joined health workers across Europe in sounding the alarm about the surge in coronavirus infections as the World Health Organization warned of an \u201cexponential\u201d rise in cases. Several countries in Europe are reporting infection rates higher than during the first wave of the pandemic in March and April, with Spain saying it has now more than 3 million cases. France\u2019s second wave of coronavirus could be worse than the first, the boss of Paris public hospital group AP-HP said on Friday as the country registered a record number of daily cases. With pressure on hospitals rising fast, France has expanded a 9pm to 6am curfew to cover 46 million people, more than two-thirds of its population. Italy registered 19,143 new coronavirus infections, a jump of more than 3,000 within the last 24 hours. The northern Lombardy region, the worst hit region during the first wave of the pandemic, recorded almost 5,000 new cases while in Campania, in the south, there were 2,280. More than half a million people in the US could die from Covid-19 by the end of February next year, but about 130,000 of those lives could be saved if everybody were to wear masks, according to estimates from a modelling study."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
