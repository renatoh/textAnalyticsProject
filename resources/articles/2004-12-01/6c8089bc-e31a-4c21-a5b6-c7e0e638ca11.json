West Ham are prone to pratfalls just when they seem to be gathering momentum; they have yet to stack up more than three league games without defeat this season. \"You only have to look at the loss column for us,\" said the manager. \"The club can't afford that. People are putting in performances one week and not the next. That's not good enough for West Ham. \"Every time we seem to get within touching distance we trip ourselves up. We can't moan about the referee or the opposition. We can only put the finger of blame on ourselves.\" West Ham's squad list should intimidate most teams in this division. Pardew can afford to leave the strikers Bobby Zamora and the Ukrainian Sergei Rebrov on the bench but still a relatively limited side like Preston required little more than disciplined defending. Their goalkeeper Andy Lonergan had been out for two months and the ease of his comeback surprised him. \"It was quite quiet to be honest,\" he said. \"I was expecting a few eyeballs and people to test me out. That didn't come.\" That is an indictment of West Ham's leisurely approach although the game occasionally simmered in the second half as each side made a success of riling the other, particularly after Nigel Reo-Coker's goal gave the visitors a fighting chance. \"You always think at 2-0 the next goal more or less decides it,\" said Lonergan. \"But that was what we needed, to show that we can hold a one-goal lead.\" They would not have succeeded, if West Ham had not spurned what they created. Teddy Sheringham missed from inside the six-yard box when he swivelled and miscued and Marlon Harewood dragged their best chance across the face of goal. But West Ham lost the game at the back. Tomas Repka's header, straight into the path of Brian O'Neil, was embarrassing. It created Preston's second long-range goal after Eddie Lewis had opened in similar fashion. Repka's mistake came shortly after Darren Powell misplaced a header to Richard Cresswell but Stephen Bywater sprang from his goal to clear. West Ham were troubled by a Preston midfield that cramped Luke Chadwick out of the game; Pardew withdrew the former Manchester United winger at half-time and was instantly rewarded as Reo-Coker came on to score a poke-in. Preston felt there had been a foul on O'Neil in the build-up. \"I don't need to say anything,\" said their manager Billy Davies of the referee Alan Kaye and neither would Pardew discuss the official, preferring to pay him a visit after the game. Moaning about refs, as he admits, will help nothing. Man of the match: Eddie Lewis - The American made West Ham chase his shadow for long periods and kept Stephen Bywater alert with his long-range passing and shooting. Best moment: His confrontation with Tomas Repka that led to Repka's costly loss of concentration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
