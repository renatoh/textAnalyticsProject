But can Craig Ferguson turn himself into one of the reigning chieftains of US television? Groomed for the post by the long-serving Late Night host David Letterman, who last week announced his retirement next year, Ferguson, 52, who currently serves as host of The Late Late Show, which airs after Letterman, has repeatedly said he is not interested in the job. But a massive scramble for Letterman's role has been under way for several years. And Ferguson is said to be among the leaders. Four years ago, Ferguson, a thrice-married naturalised US citizen who grew up in a council house in the Glasgow suburb of Cumbernauld and dropped out of school at 16 to become an electronics apprentice, looked like a shoo-in for the job. But much has since changed. Television audiences have splintered, and social media is key to maintaining contact with audiences. Can a host such as Ferguson, who set out to deconstruct the talk-show format, now reconstruct it? He says the transition could be a \"world of pain\". And after the recent and much-celebrated collapse of Piers Morgan's career at CNN, US television bosses may not want to risk placing another British host in a key position of American entertainment culture. Still, Ferguson and John Oliver, the British comedian who worked on the The Daily Show with Jon Stewart and is about to start his own HBO talk show, are in consideration. If either were to get the job, they would be up against Jimmy Fallon, newly installed in Jay Leno's The Tonight Show chair at NBC. In the month since Fallon, 39, took over the show, he has beaten 66-year-old Letterman two-to-one in the ratings, has updated the role with intense use of social media, and is felt to have ushered in a changing of the guard. Fallon's inclusive, puppy-dog enthusiasm is widely felt to have made Letterman's detached approach to celebrity appear old-fashioned. In this game of musical chairs, the question will be whether Ferguson, whose show is produced by Letterman's company, represents the old guard or the new. Although Fallon has been successful, the shift from free-form post-midnight slot to the earlier, coveted slot is beset by disappointment. While Ferguson has many committed fans, his show is perceived as a niche programme rather than a variety show with wide appeal that could easily make the transition to the mainstream. Ferguson faces competition from a wide variety of contenders to fill the shoes of Letterman and his predecessor, Johnny Carson. They include several women, such as Chelsea Handler and Oscars host Ellen DeGeneres; shock jock Howard Stern; Jerry Seinfeld, who stood in for Letterman when he was undergoing heart surgery; the all-American Jimmy Kimmel; and Stephen Colbert, who performs his late-night comedy show, The Colbert Report, in the character of a loopy conservative commentator. \"There's no obvious choice,\" says one TV executive with close knowledge of the intense competition in the time slot. \"Everyone has flaws. Colbert is the most talented, but a lot of people worry that he can't perform outside character.\" At the same time, Ferguson's direct competition, the Saturday Night Live comedian Seth Meyers, is beating the Scot in the ratings war after being in the seat for only a month. Ferguson, the executive fears, may no longer be \"relevant to the late-night conversation\". Oliver, who might also be considered a long shot for Letterman's replacement, has a slot at HBO, where ratings don't matter because the network is subscriber-based and has complete creative freedom. In other words, he has no reason to want a broadcast TV slot that is no longer the dominant platform for entertainment. To a performer accustomed to the freedom of cable television, or even of late-night broadcasting, the conventions of the format \u2013 a monologue, two guests and a music slot \u2013 routinely appear tired. Nor is late-night television still considered key for launching a film or an album \u2013 breakfast television is now a more effective way to reach a mass audience. Still, few are better prepared than Ferguson: he even has a clause in his contract giving him the right to inherit Letterman's slot \u2013 although the studio can buy out that right. He comes with a natural comic timing and sense of taste in the disorder of cultural life. In 2007, he publicly refused to make jokes about Britney Spears, the singer who was at the time experiencing a highly publicised nervous collapse. As an alcoholic in long-term sobriety \u2013 on Christmas Day 1991, he was distracted from throwing himself off Tower Bridge by a friend offering him a glass of sherry, and soon entered recovery \u2013 Ferguson said he would not make jokes at the expense of the unwell. \"For me, comedy should have a certain amount of joy in it,\" Ferguson added. \"It should be about attacking the powerful \u2013 the politicians, the Trumps, the blowhards \u2013 going after them. We shouldn't be attacking the vulnerable.\" Before moving to the US in 1983, Ferguson played in a band, Dreamboys, with Peter \"Doctor Who\" Capaldi, whom he credits with inspiring him to try comedy. One of his first characters, Bing Hitler, he describes as a \"parody of all the \u00fcber-patriotic native folk singers who seemed to infect every public performance in Scotland\". Moving to America, he worked in construction in Harlem and later performed at after-hours club Save the Robots in Manhattan's Alphabet City. Living between the US and the UK, he appeared in several TV, film and fringe theatre productions before settling in Los Angeles in the mid-1990s. Ferguson's US breakthrough came in 1995 with The Drew Carey Show, which ran for eight years. In it, he played an Englishman with an exaggerated accent, taking revenge on English actors doing \"crap Scottish accents\". In 2005, he took over The Late Late Show. Historian Ben Alba, author of Inventing Late Night, has said that Ferguson \"has already made his mark, taking the TV monologue to new levels\". For a period in 2009, Late Late beat Fallon in the ratings. Now the question is: will Ferguson get the opportunity to go head-to-head with Fallon on the main stage of US late-night TV or will he be sidelined, a victim of Letterman's falling ratings? So far, Ferguson has refused to be drawn into the fray. \"What I want is to make you laugh. That's what I want to do. What time I make you laugh is your business. I don't care.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
