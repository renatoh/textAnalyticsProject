Although that's an ambitious 250 per cent rise from the current 400,000 annual visitors, the Qatar Tourism Authority is hopeful the drive will prove a success. QTA chairman Akbar Al Baker told the Fourth Global Travel and Tourism Summit in Doha: 'Qatar will offer the high end of the tourist market, with beach resorts, sun, expansive desert landscapes, a rich Arabic cultural her itage, prestigious hotels and major international sporting events.' Projects will include the the North Beach Development with 10 hotels, two golf courses and 300 square metres of shopping, and the construction of Pearl Island, with over 7,000 dwellings, three luxury hotels and room for 700 boats. A Museum of Islamic Arts, National Library, National Museum and photography museum are also planned. Eight new four- and five- star hotels were also due to open at the end of this year, a spokesman said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
