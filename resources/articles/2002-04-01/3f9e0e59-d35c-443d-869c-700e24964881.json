Are Arsene Wenger and Alex Ferguson really happy that Gerard Houllier and Phil Thompson won it for March?\" asks Pete Tomlin. They probably are, Pete, although not quite why you think. The myth surrounding this award is a false one, if this season's results are anything to go by. Sam Allardyce won the August award, and although his Bolton side did lose at home to Southampton and Sunderland soon after, they also gained credible draws away to Leeds and Arsenal. His mantle was taken over by John Gregory, then at Aston Villa, who then won four out of their next five games. Glenn Hoddle's Tottenham (October) won three out of four and drew with Arsenal; Bobby Robson's Newcastle (December) won four and drew two; and Gordon Strachan only saw his Southampton side defeated once the month after picking up the January award. So why will Arsene and Alex be happy to see the award go to Anfield at a crucial time in the title run-in? Because Liverpool are one of the two teams to fall to bits after their manager received this pot. When Phil Thompson picked up the award in December, his charges failed to, well, charge, limply surrendering to Chelsea and Arsenal and drawing with Fulham and West Ham. Newcastle also had a nightmare after Robson won his second gong in February, going down at home to Arsenal, losing heavily at Anfield and Highbury, and dropping points at home to relegation-bound Ipswich. In fact, if you want a jinxed managerial award, look no further than Portman Road: didn't George Burley win manager of the year last season? WORST SCORER IN HISTORY Has there ever been an outfield player who played over 200 club games but never scored a goal?\" asks Neil Denny. Rob Jones is remembered for many things: the unfortunate injury which ended his career, his even more unfortunate Phil Thomson-esque nose and those eight England caps, but several of you recall the true selling point of this former Liverpool full-back - his utter inability to hit the back of the net. In 243 games for Liverpool the flaxen-haired one failed to trouble the scoreboard operatives once. As Ravi Hiranand remembers. \"It was not for lack of trying, though, as he got forward frequently, hit the post/crossbar more times than is humanly possible and has been hacked down for penalties more than any other Liverpool defender in history.\" If only Ravi had witness Jones' two goals when he was a young tyro at Crewe. Jones is not alone however, and Richard Shaw has played in 233 games without scoring for Coventry, making it nearly 300 since he last scored for Crystal Palace in the 1993/94 season. Ian McKay presses Francis Benali's claims for membership of the no-goal club, having obviously missed his first career goal in Southampton's 2-1 win over Leicester in December 1997. None were to follow in the Benali's 343 total career matches. Meanwhile, Leicester defender Steve Whitworth played 399 times for Leicester between 1969 and 1979 and only scored once - in the 1971 Charity Shield 1-0 win against Liverpool. All of which puts Ade Akinbiyi's Leicester labours firmly in the shade. GOALKEEPER WITH PLASTIC KNUCKLE \"What was the name of the goalkeeper in the 1970s who had a plastic knuckle?\" asks Tom Alice. The man you're looking for is John Osborne of West Brom, according to Tony Mole and Neil Penny. The legendary Baggies keeper was part of a golden era in the club's history, during which West Brom won the FA Cup in 1968, the League Cup in 1966, and finished runners-up in 1967 and 1970. Osborne is considered by many to be best keeper in the club's history - and, until Russell Hoult surpassed it this season, shared the record for the highest number of clean sheets kept by a West Brom keeper in one season (22) with Tony Godden. He sadly passed away in 1999. THE KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE Why don't England have a star on their shirt for winning the World Cup?\" asks Robert Farrow. \"Most other countries seem to do so.\" According to FA spokesman David Barber, England's shirts are star free because the FA consider the three lions to be a \"historically recognisable emblem in iteslf\" and see no need to \"muck about with embellishments\". For a fuller answer see the the Knowledge Archive. Can you help? \"Can you tell me who was the first foreign player to play in the English football league,\" asks James Rafferty. \"A friend of mine thinks it was the Manchester City goalkeeper Bert Trautman - but were there any pre-war non British and Irish players in the league?\" \"I have a vague recollection that in the 1980s, a player call Ian McCall playing for Dunfermline against Rangers and Celtic and then for Rangers against Celtic, all in the space of one week,\" says Adrian Hogarth. \"Am I right?\" \"Why does the Premiership Reserve league feature such decidedly Nationwide sides as Nottingham Forest (relegated in 98/99) and Sheffield Wednesday, Watford and Wimbledon (relegated in 1999/2000)?\" asks Rick McEwen. \"Is this the kind of utopian closed shop which the Premiership itself wishes it had been allowed to become?\" \"My mates and I came up with an interesting poser last night but were a bit too drunk to follow it through,\" says Eoin O'Donnell. \"The question was: how many club sides worldwide have more than one international captain (either permanent or temporary) playing in their team at one time? Can anyone beat Manchester United (Keane, Beckham and possibly Veron?).\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
