By 6pm last night it had received more than 250,000 hits. As the world champions prepare to meet South Africa at Stade de France tonight, those who argue that the hype is less frenzied than in Sydney four years ago are starting to reconsider. Yesterday brought messages of support from Gordon Brown and James Bond (or at least the actor Daniel Craig). Previous interventions have come from the Queen and Kenny Rogers. England's head coach, Brian Ashton, is not by nature a dry martini type of guy and he will expect his players to be stirred, not shaken, when the final whistle goes tonight. Somewhere in all this madness, as in 2003, there is a classic game of rugby waiting to get out. South Africa, logically, should win this evening. They have been building towards this weekend for almost four years; their coach, Jake White, has painstakingly pored over every detail like an artist preparing a still-life portrait. England, by comparison, resemble Tracey Emin's unmade bed, thrown together at short notice by happy circumstance. To all intents and purposes they looked dead and buried in this same stadium just over five weeks ago, ripped apart by a Springbok side who might have run up 50 points. Little did anyone guess, particularly Australia and France, that the old devils would rise off the slab, like Frankenstein's monster, to haunt them again. Not since Greece won the European Championship in 2004 has sport known a less likely potential winner of a major international tournament but, as their captain Phil Vickery indicated yesterday, England are not finished yet. \"Four weeks ago we were staring down the barrel of a gun and on the way home. But, ultimately, we're not here by luck,\" said Vickery. \"We've earned the right to be in this final and we've achieved a lot of things to get here. We thoroughly deserve our chance but being here is not good enough. We want to go out, make it as difficult for South Africa as possible and retain our trophy.\" More than 50,000 English fans are expected in the French capital, many without tickets but all drawn like moths to the reignited flame of white-shirted optimism. When England sides get to World Cup finals, cricket apart, they generally rise to the occasion and the presence of so many experienced figures in Ashton's squad suggests the same will be true tonight. Win or lose, this will be Jason Robinson's last game for England. For the 36-year-old Mike Catt and half a dozen of his fellow \"grumpy old men\" it also looks like au revoir They are also way past caring about what is said about them in the southern hemisphere. \"We had it at the last World Cup - the grandads, Dad's Army etc - and we'll have it all again,\" sighed Vickery. As Ashton stressed for the umpteenth time, it doesn't matter how old you are if you have the ability to make the right decisions at the right times in a World Cup final watched by a TV audience measured in hundreds of millions. \"As the games get bigger and bigger you look to your experienced players on the field,\" stressed Ashton, admitting that the team had been \"complacent\" against the United States. \"You can't plan for specific moments in the game and that's when the senior players step forward. They know what to do because they've been there before.\" Those who have not had the privilege, such as England's replacement hooker George Chuter, are more prone to anxiety. \"Unless you've been to a World Cup final before you are nervous,\" he confirmed. \"Anyone who says otherwise is lying.\" South Africa's starting XV, admittedly, contains 668 caps to England's 609 but there have been moments, particularly in the third quarter of their last two games against Fiji and Argentina, when they have wobbled. At least four Springbok players - Victor Matfield, Juan Smith, Fourie du Preez and Bryan Habana - would make a world XV based on performances in this tournament, and Schalk Burger and John Smit further bolster their physical threat. But there remains inexperience in some areas and Ashton, in describing Du Preez as the \"fulcrum\" of this Bok side, made it pretty clear where England would concentrate their early efforts. If Vickery and co can get a lead, anything is possible. The referee, Alain Rolland, was also in charge when the Wallaby scrum was crushed in the quarter-final. Wilkinson, to Springbok eyes, is the menace of St Denis. He missed the 36-0 debacle and England have not looked back since he, Catt and Andy Gomarsall were reunited. Having tipped South Africa from the outset to win the tournament, I feel professionally obliged to stick with White's side to edge a taut contest. But Ashton's choice of the old \"Shock the world\" quote from Muhammad Ali - \"I thought if it was good enough for him it was good enough for me\" - has proved an inspirational slogan. If England can also follow Churchill's advice - \"Courage is the first of human qualities because it is the quality which guarantees all others\" - the Webb Ellis Cup may just be coming home again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
