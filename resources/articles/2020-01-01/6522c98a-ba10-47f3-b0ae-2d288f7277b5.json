Top stories Days of limbo are wearing down NSW and Victoria communities displaced by bushfires. After Saturday\u2019s atrocious conditions, the NSW south coast town of Eden became the latest locus of the rolling crisis that has torn through great swaths of the east coast. Desperate residents, holidaymakers and refugees from surrounding communities sought refuge on the town\u2019s wharf until authorities said even there was unsafe. \u201cIt has to change something, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d Shelley Caban told Guardian Australia on Sunday, unsure of whether her home outside Eden still stood. \u201cI really, really hope it does. The spiral can\u2019t keep going like this.\u201d Almost 1,500 properties are confirmed to have been destroyed in NSW alone in the past month. The worst-affected areas on Saturday included Batlow, a small village in the foothills of the Snowy Mountains, where a man died of a heart attack while attempting to protect a friend\u2019s property. In the southern highlands, south-west of Sydney, homes were destroyed in Kangaroo Valley and Wingello. In Victoria, where dozens of blazes continue to burn, 18 communities remain cut off, including Mallacoota, where residents had to be evacuated by the navy. Scott Morrison, under severe pressure over his handling of the crisis, has promised an aid package for badly affected areas, and said on Sunday he would consider a royal commission.

Recommended reads \u201cThere\u2019s a midden at Murramarang on the south coast that dates back to the Ice Age,\u201d writes Lorena Allam. \u201cIt holds the stories of 12,000 years of Yuin occupation, in layers of stone tools and spearpoints, fish bones and oyster shells. For thousands of years, Yuin ancestors would gather and feast, sending fire signals to other mobs up and down the coast. My dad used to say he\u2019d like to sit there one night by the fire, and see who might come from the shadows to join him. That\u2019s how strong their presence is in that quiet place. I want to hope the midden is intact, but unlike the prime minister I don\u2019t believe in miracles. The fires were too ferocious.\u201d You would be excused for thinking all influencers get paid for promoting products. Some do but many are actually paying businesses for the privilege.
