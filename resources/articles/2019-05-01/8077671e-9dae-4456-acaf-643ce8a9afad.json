Instead, given events of Sunday afternoon, the PGA of America president\u2019s lauding of New York galleries was horribly misplaced. It was laughable, in fact. Just because Brooks Koepka gleaned inspiration from fans chanting in support of Dustin Johnson and, even worse, cheering his own miscued irons the Bethpage scenario should not be shrugged off. Those spectators were not so much anti-Koepka/pro-Johnson as keen to witness a great sporting turnaround \u2013 as almost transpired \u2013 but the scene was ugly. Praise is due to Harold Varner III. Fresh from a disastrous 81 in his fourth round, when playing in Koepka\u2019s company, he spoke out against gallery behaviour. \u201cI thought it was pretty weird how they were telling Brooks to choke,\u201d Varner said. \u201cThat\u2019s not my cup of tea. I was pulling for him after that. I have a few choice words for that.\u201d What on earth this venue may be reduced to when the US take on Europe in the 2024 Ryder Cup is already in focus. Hazeltine, three years ago, saw a more frenzied Ryder Cup backdrop than is useful for anyone. If Bethpage turns into a febrile, tribal bear pit for an individual event, then heaven knows what will occur as the golfing golden boys of the United States combine. Which, in itself, is farcical; the players on either side of the Ryder Cup have actually never had more in common or been closer. \u201cWe actually talked about this a lot during the week,\u201d said Koepka. \u201cGood luck to Europe with the fans.\u201d Elsewhere fears are rising. Phil Kenyon, putting coach to several of Europe\u2019s top golfers, has said a Bethpage Ryder Cup could be \u201ca rather ugly affair\u201d. Paul Casey settled for \u201cintimidating\u201d when contemplating 2024. \u201cI think Europe will need to have the 12 most thick-skinned players,\u201d said Shane Lowry. \u201cIt will be brutal. I would leave the wives inside in that one.\u201d Lowry, it should be noted, is no shrinking violet. The Koepka US PGA affair was not an isolated one. Jordan Spieth was subjected to cat-calling during his Saturday round. Even during practice days the loud, occasionally obnoxious, routinely unfunny, screams bellow from behind the ropes. Publicly competitors smile, privately they roll their eyes. \u201cIt\u2019s as if they have to play up to this New York sporting stereotype,\u201d said a member of the world\u2019s top 10 on Tuesday. The racket is not the domain of solely adults, either. That kids shout and bawl in pursuit of autographs or memorabilia from golfers long since became unedifying rather than endearing. This is not a problem specific to Bethpage, even if the level of unpleasantness felt as if it was ramped up several notches here. The general conduct of the American golf attendee \u2013 noise level increasing with every can of lager \u2013 has been in obvious, recent decline. That players generally keep their counsel is understandable; why badmouth the PGA Tour golden goose which sets them up financially for life? One should not need to be a member of any puritanical society \u2013 take it from one who knows \u2013 to seek levels of respect from golf crowds. This is not to say all golf spectators should tip their caps and applaud quietly. There is, however, a major leap between tranquillity and what transpired at Bethpage. Celebrating an individual\u2019s demise \u2013 not least when the said individual has reached the peak of his sport, in sharp contrast to the fiftysomething in a NFL shirt \u2013 should not be tolerated. One of the game\u2019s great positives is the instilling of manners into those who participate in it. In these days where people can bawl from behind keyboards, golf should be a force for good. Instead, we have players at the summit of the game having to shut out boorish noise. Although not unique to the United States \u2013 posh lads\u2019 days out at the Open Championship are not particularly appealing \u2013 the problem is decidedly more acute on the American side of the Atlantic. Pete Willett handed his brother, Danny, a horribly timed curveball when lacerating American golf fans before Hazeltine. But on reflection, maybe the genesis of Willett\u2019s sentiment \u2013 \u201cbaying mob of imbeciles\u201d and all \u2013 was not that far wide of the mark. Tremendous? Whaley needs a new speechwriter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
