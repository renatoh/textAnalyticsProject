Who in your school is responsible for setting and publishing targets for key stage 2 and 3 national curriculum tests and public exams at the age of 15? Yes, you've guessed it, the governors are! Plus the governing body shares legal responsibility with the headteacher and the local authority to make sure that the national curriculum is taught and assessments are carried out. This has a huge relevance in the light of the government's announcement last week that it is to consult on the overhaul of school tests. Phrases such as \"individual learning\", \"test opportunities\" and \"personal progress\" have been bandied about as ministers seek ways to fulfil every child's potential. Children may have to take exams only when their teachers feel they are ready, while very high-achieving primary school pupils could be entered for tests that have been set for 14-year-olds. Now throw into this mix Christine Gilbert's 2020 Vision: Report of the Teaching and Learning in 2020 Review Group, which was published earlier this month. The Ofsted boss's team set out the prospect of personalised teaching, one-to-one sessions for strugglers and pupils working with teachers in curriculum teams to develop lessons. At present, governors work with heads, school improvement partners and teachers to analyse their school's results and performance and predict how it expects to do in the future. As strategists, not managers, governors are working towards long-term goals that move the whole school forward. The tool that used to help us with this was the Panda - performance and assessment data - which was recently incorporated into guidance called Raise online. This also includes information on individual pupil achievement that is going to be vital if each child must be challenged at different levels. However, dealing with individual pupil needs is not the role of governors. We are on a head's territory if we get down to the detail of managing personal achievement, and yet this is what the government is expecting schools to do. So what does this mean for governors' role in assessment and target-setting? Will we be squeezed out of this responsibility as the professionals, who have more detailed knowledge of the pupils, take over? Will heads resent governors digging deeper to understand learning processes and teaching methods? Do we have the time, or knowledge, to fulfil this inevitably more complicated role? Or has the government set aside a large pot of money to invest in governance training and help us to improve target-setting? (In our dreams ...) Remember that we are entering a consultation period. Don't miss the opportunity to tell the DfES what you think. 2020 Vision can be read at teachernet.gov.uk. The consultation on testing, Making Good Progress, is available from the consultation section of dfes.gov.uk until April 2. education.governor@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
