Thorman, who has made little impact in a struggling Parramatta Eels team since leaving London Broncos last season, has already received an offer from Huddersfield. In another development, Hull's chief executive David Plummer has confirmed that John Kear, who coached England in the 2000 World Cup, will become the club's head coach next season if Shaun McRae is appointed by the South Sydney Rabbitohs. Kear has been working alongside McRae for the past two years. Castleford are hoping that Brad Davis can save them from relegation for the second time in seven years. Davis, a 36-year-old Australian who has been player-coach of Villeneuve in France, joined the Tigers when they were bottom of the Super League table in 1997 and helped them avoid the drop. He made 96 appearances for the club before joining Wakefield. He had been due to join Halifax last week but the Tigers have agreed on a fee with the National League One strugglers in time for Davis to play in Sunday's crucial game at Salford, one of the two clubs who are four points above them in the table. Warrington's coach Paul Cullen has launched an investigation into an outbreak of food poisoning which has prevented the Wolves from training so far this week in preparation for Saturday's game against St Helens at Knowsley Road, their bogey ground. Danny McGuire, the Super League's leading try-scorer this season, is doubtful for Leeds Rhinos' game against Hull at Headingley tomorrow after injuring a knee in last Saturday's defeat at Wigan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
