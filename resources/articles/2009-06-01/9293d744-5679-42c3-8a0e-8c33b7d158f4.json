When I came to Columbia Records, music was sent to me of all the new bands on the label. And my favourite of all of them was the Gossip. Why did they stand out? They spoke to me. I went to see them play at the Troubadour in Los Angeles and it was one of the best shows I've ever seen. It was a complete party scene, and the lines between the band and the audience were blurred, and everyone was celebrating together. Fantastic. And I went out for lunch with them the next day \u2013 this was two years ago \u2013 and I said, if there was ever an opportunity to work together, I would love to. Let's talk about Music for Men. Usually with bands I've worked with, we go into the studio extremely well prepared, but in this case that didn't happen. It was just the nature of this band. We talked about going to the studio together for a long time and it seemed that the material was never coming. Then eventually I got a call saying, \"We're going to be there next week and we're ready to start recording\". Very unusual. Have you heard the album? Yes. Part of what I loved about it is that it still sounds like a Gossip album. People might not be expecting that \u2013 their older albums were recorded in days. While they're probably equally as sparse, we spent much more time on the sound, the performances and the songs, so they were in the studio far longer than before. It's energetic but I feel like it's more refined than their previous work, to the point where you want to listen to it over and over again. Beth has said that they were a band you'd want to see live more than listen to on record. But this will probably change that. I think that's right. That's how I hear it. I think this is an album that you can hear all the way through and have a great listening experience. You've said that you like to work with bands you consider revolutionary. Do you think the Gossip are revolutionary? I don't know. I'd have to think about it. [He thinks for about 30 seconds] I don't think I can answer that. OK. Well, thanks for talking to me, Rick. Stop. Tell me about the revolutionary question. Do you think of them as a revolutionary band? I think they're a political band, but they disguise their politics by writing songs that you can dance to. So in that respect, they are, I suppose. I guess so, and while I'm aware of their politics, when I think of most political bands, like Public Enemy or Rage Against the Machine, I think of them hitting you around the head with it, because they rarely talk about anything else. But for some reason, even though the message is there with the Gossip, I feel that there are bigger metaphors, so I don't feel that I'm being preached at. With Public Enemy, who I love, after hearing five albums of \"But it'll take a black one to move me\", the sixth album might not sound so fresh. And it's not to take anything away from what they're doing, but I feel like the Gossip don't have that constraint. It's celebratory at the same time, and that's often more effective. It's not as alienating, and again, I like alienating music, but for some reason when the word \"revolutionary\" comes up, I feel like it's \"against something\". And with the Gossip it feels like there's strong, deep content, but in the context of a party. Maybe it's a different kind of revolution."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
