What the National Farmers Union describes as \u201ctinderbox conditions\u201d have severely reduced grass growth and depleted yields for many crops, leading to concerns that there will be a shortage of feed for livestock and dairy farmers later in the year. Concerns about the fragility of the UK\u2019s food chain come at a sensitive time after the Brexit secretary, Dominic Raab, admitted last week that the government was taking steps to ensure that there were \u201cadequate\u201d supplies for Britain in the event of a no-deal departure from the European Union. The revelation led to speculation that the UK might be forced to start stockpiling food. But the heatwave has acted as a \u201ctimely reminder\u201d that the UK cannot take its food production for granted, according to NFU president Minette Batters, who warns of \u201cthe crippling impact of the dry, hot weather on farms across the country\u201d. Representatives from the union will meet officials from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the Environment Agency, Natural England, the Rural Payments Agency and several farming charities when the emergency summit convenes on Wednesday. They will hear reports of a shortage of forage for livestock and dairy farmers, which is forcing farmers to break into winter fodder supplies. There are also concerns about a shortage of water for irrigation and an increased risk of potentially ruinous crop fires. \u201cThe situation is hugely challenging across all sectors,\u201d Batters said. \u201cThere could be serious concerns for many farmers if this extended spell of warmer, drier weather continues as the long-range forecast suggests. It is vital that we come up with a plan and solutions to the issues that are now emerging across the industry.\u201d Batters added: \u201cThis unprecedented spell of weather really should be a wake-up call for us all. It\u2019s a timely reminder that we shouldn\u2019t take food production for granted. Farming is one of the most affected industries when it comes to managing volatility.\u201d The heatwave, which appeared to have come to a dramatic end on Friday with thunderstorms and torrential rain over much of the country, saw Britain roast in high temperatures for weeks throughout June and July. Data collected by the Environment Agency suggests that \u201ccumulative rainfall totals for July to date range from 4% of the July long-term average in east England to 26% in north-west England\u201d. It follows the driest June since 1925, according to the EA, which has warned that a \u201cdry end to the summer and dry autumn could see the risk of restrictions and further environmental impacts spread across the country\u201d. In an attempt to tackle the looming crisis, Defra has confirmed that the environment secretary, Michael Gove, is to summon the chief executives of the water companies that have failed to meet their leakage targets to explain how they intend to improve their performance. A spokeswoman said: \u201cDefra is working directly with the NFU and organisations across the industry to support farmers through the dry weather. We will continue working with all parties so farmers have the support they need through this difficult period.\u201d Nick von Westenholz, the NFU\u2019s director for Brexit, said he was not aware of any specific discussions between farmers and the government about the no-deal scenario alluded to by Raab. \u201cThere are eight months to go until, technically, we are going to leave the EU, and the idea that the EU and the UK might not come to some sort of agreement is really, really worrying for a host of reasons,\u201d he said. A particular concern is the potential shortage of agricultural labour. \u201cWe rely on a lot of EU workers to pick our fruit and vegetables,\u201d Westenholz said. \u201cIf there is a no-deal scenario and freedom of movement ends in March 2019 with no contingency plans in place, where is industry going to get those workers from?\u201d In the event of no deal, some predict that the UK could be forced to source more food from outside the EU. \u201cThe government might have to drop food safety controls to ensure stuff comes in smoothly,\u201d Westenholz said. \u201cYou\u2019d be concerned if that was the case. Those safety controls are there for a reason.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
