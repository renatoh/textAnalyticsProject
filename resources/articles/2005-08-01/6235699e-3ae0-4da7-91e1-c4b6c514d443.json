The firm, which attracts 100 million shoppers to its American stores each week, posted its smallest profit gain in four years during the second quarter. It also cautioned that results in the current third quarter would be below Wall Street expectations. Its shares fell by 3.3% in early trading, dampening the wider markets. The company said it remained upbeat about the US economy but described oil prices, which have topped $67 a barrel this month, as a potential hazard. The chief executive, Lee Scott, said: \"The only real concern I have is that oil prices will erase improvements in employment and real income for an important portion of our customer base.\" Petrol prices hit Wal-Mart's core customer base especially hard. The retailer, with its \"always low prices\" slogan, has traditionally served lower-income customers and the retailer is trying to attract wealthier shoppers by introducing more expensive goods. Higher oil prices also mean higher costs. The retailer estimated that it cost $30m (\u00a317m) more this quarter to move goods from warehouses to stores while energy costs were $100m higher. In the second quarter, Wal-Mart reported earnings of $2.8bn, a 5.8% gain on the same period a year earlier. Sales reached $76.8bn, an increase of 10.2%. The firm's international division, which includes Asda in Britain, reported operating income of $750m in the quarter, compared with $748m last year. The latest figure included a $36m charge related to the restructuring of its Asda operation, which announced plans last month to cut 1,400 managers in an effort to improve customer service. Asda has been cutting food prices and improving the quality and range of its private-label products as it struggles to arrest its decline in market share. It lifted its share to 16.6% in the 12 weeks to July 17, up from 16.4%. \u00b7 Home Depot, the world's largest DIY retailer, reported a 14% increase in second quarter profits to $1.8bn (\u00a31bn). Its sales rose 12% to $22.3bn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
