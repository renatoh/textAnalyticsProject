The series to be launched next month so far covers six cities: Rome, Venice, Paris, London, New York and Barcelona. Cities are broken down geographically, focusing on areas of interest - a double page that lists a selection of eateries, shops, bars, theatres and music venues in ascending price order, as well as visitor attractions. The entries are short, providing contact details and a brief account of what is on offer. The unique selling point is that every entry has a map reference and the double page unfolds to reveal a clear, detailed street map, allowing you to quickly pinpoint the venues. Each volume also includes a short introduction with useful information such as a calendar of events, websites and the address of the local tourist office. The guides close with a map of the transport network which opens to reveal a short hotel list and further transport information. CityMap Guides do not claim to be an exhaustive account of what a city has to offer, instead they concentrate on a core of \"unmissable\" sites and attractions. The exclusion of a section on phrases is a shame as those who do not speak the local language will need to carry a phrase book, too. A traditional guidebook remains necessary if you want to discover the background of the places you are visiting, but CityMap Guides are a useful field tool."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
