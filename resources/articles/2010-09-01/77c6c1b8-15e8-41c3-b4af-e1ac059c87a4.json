And one of the first things Tony Blair has been keen to clear up is the fact that he long ago decided to donate the proceeds from the sale of the book to the British Legion. This was no 11th-hour gesture. It should raise a cool \u00a34m, he says. Which makes it all the more commendable on the part of the ex-PM. Commendable too, that while benefiting from his largesse, the Legion exhibits a spiky sort of independence by featuring prominently in the latest edition of its magazine the controversial anti-war photomontage by Peter Kennard and Cat Picton Phillips. The construct, which angered No 10, shows a grinning, sinister Blair taking a picture of himself against a backdrop of a burning oilfield in Iraq. \u2022 He wrote the book himself, we learn. In longhand. But the writing style seems a little familiar. \"It's a great privilege and honour to do the job. And by the way, it really is,\" he writes on page 502. And recalling a terrorist threat in the skies above London after 9/11, he says: \"It had been a technical error. I needed to sit down and Thank God after that one.\" Just the style of the St Albion parody run throughout his reign by Private Eye. Was he scribbling that as well? \u2022 And with the Journey now fully under way the question must be asked: why is Prince of Darkness Peter Mandelson's own masterwork, The Third Man, on sale in the fiction section of WH Smith at Heathrow? What kind of message is that to send about the architect of New Labour? What are they trying to say? \u2022 Ex-political titans. They are everywhere. And there is another on display at Portcullis House, Westminster, where hangs a portrait of John Major, obscured at present by transparent film with a large label. \"Fragile artwork behind,\" it says. \"He was famously thin-skinned as a premier,\" our guide explains. Amazing to see that replicated in a painting. \u2022 Yes it's A Journey today. An arrival by the pope in a fortnight's time. What a life. Both requiring the most delicate preparations. Sad to say, then, that there is an unholy kerfuffle over the decision of organisers of Pope Benedict XVI's visit to stage a helpful briefing on Tuesday exclusively for the foreign press, excluding totally the British media. Not just a shut-out of our heathen mainstream titles. Conspicuously absent was the Catholic Herald. For all that, rumours of a papal visit without the pope remain unconfirmed. \u2022 And perhaps now is the time to ask exactly what information was sought by the Q magazine reader who inquired during that publication's communal questioning of Bob Geldof: \"Do you still have the pope's phone number?\" Geldof assumed, as did we on highlighting the exchange last week, that it was a matter of communication, hence his answer: \"He did call me once. I was watching Dynasty at the time.\" But Rod Davis of Cornwall gets in touch to put us right. \"You may just have missed the point of the original question, as indeed does Bob Geldof: the pope's telephone number = VAT69 whisky, as in, 'I'd like a glass of pope's telephone number, please'.\" As we now know, Tony Blair used to ring the pope almost every night. \u2022 In this time of austerity and cuts, it pays to focus on the few growth industries. The company Oil Spill Response seeks spill response specialists. Travel the world, react to disasters. Not just the Gulf of Mexico, or even the disaster waiting to happen in the Arctic. There is apparently more than enough calamity to keep the right recruits busy. An initial period bedding in but that, says the ad, is \"just the start of the adventure\". And the closing date. There isn't one. They need clean-up types in Southampton, Singapore and Bahrain all year round. \u2022 Finally we note that the Right Rev Richard Chartres, the Bishop of London, places his good name and reputation in the hands of PR guardians Luther Pendragon. And so does the Lap Dancing Association. Separate accounts, different world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
