The company, the world's largest drug manufacturer, said it had taken a $766m (\u00a3403m) charge related to the withdrawal of Bextra at the request of US regulators. The firm posted earnings of $301m, down from $2.3bn a year ago. Revenues rose 5% to $13.1bn. Bextra is one of the controversial Cox-2 inhibitor class of painkillers that have been linked to higher risks of strokes and heart attacks among users. Bextra was also said to increase the incidence of a serious skin condition. Rival Merck sparked the concerns when it pulled its arthritis drug Vioxx from the market last September. Sales of another Pfizer drug in the category that is still on the market, Celebrex, also plummeted during the first quarter by 47% to $411m. In addition, Pfizer said it had been charged $2.19bn over the repatriation of profits earned by overseas divisions, as well as a $622m charge related to its 2002 acquisition of Pharmacia. The repatriation is part of an American job creation scheme approved by Washington last year, allowing firms to bring cash back to the US at a vastly reduced tax rate. Wall Street had anticipated the charges, and the earnings narrowly beat estimates. The Bextra withdrawal will lower full-year profits by around 7%, down from forecasts made only two weeks ago. The company has also come under pressure from generic versions of a number of its big drugs. Shares in the firm were trading 25 cents lower at midday at $27.35. Revenue growth at the company was driven by a number of blockbuster drugs that continued to attract new users. Sales of Lipitor, the cholesterol-lowering drug, grew 23% to $3.1bn. The antibiotic Zithromax experienced a 71% sales growth to $797m. Impotence treatment Viagra has maintained its market leadership and delivered 5% sales growth to $438m. David Shedlarz, the vice-chairman, described 2005 as a \"transition year\" for the company. He said the firm expected to return to double-digit earnings growth next year. Johnson &amp; Johnson reported a 17% increase in first-quarter profits to $2.9bn on the back of robust sales of its medical devices. Revenues at the company grew 11% to $12.8bn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
