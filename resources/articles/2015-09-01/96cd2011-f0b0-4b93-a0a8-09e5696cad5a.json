When complete strangers cross the street to shake hands with passing Japanese tourists, as they were doing near Brighton station on Sunday, it is a sure sign something remarkable has just taken place. Regardless of whatever else happens at this Rugby World Cup, everyone is now in love with the Brave Blossoms. There were even sightings of South Africa fans waving Japanese flags following the biggest upset in the history of rugby union. And why not? Saturday\u2019s result did not just strike a timely blow on behalf of every tier two country. It represented a karate chop to the throat of the established order and a bullet train to a brave new world. It certainly felt like the most momentous day the sport has known since Nelson Mandela handed Francois Pienaar the 1995 World Cup trophy. How long ago that ultimate green and gold triumph now seems. No wonder the current head coach, Heyneke Meyer, looked shell-shocked as he apologised to his nation; the word \u201cBrighton\u201d will forever cast a shadow over South Africa\u2019s rugby psyche. Worst of all was the realisation this was no fluke; the two-times world champions were outplayed in almost every facet of the game by opponents boasting only one previous World Cup pool win in 24 attempts. For that there can be no praise high enough for Eddie Jones and his assistants, the former England captain Steve Borthwick and former France hooker Marc Dal Maso. Jones, happily recovered from the stroke he suffered two years ago, has long possessed one of rugby\u2019s sharpest brains but this heist exceeded anything he has achieved in a distinguished career, including his role in the Springboks\u2019 2007 World Cup win. Technically it was outstanding: the handling almost flawless, the set-piece accuracy spot on, the defensive commitment extraordinary. Dal Maso has clearly made a difference, encouraging the Japanese to scrummage lower, strike quickly and get the ball out and away. Borthwick, in turn, has brought the lineout expertise for which he was so renowned at Saracens and a work ethic second to none. \u201cThe history of the Japanese team in World Cups has been terrible \u2026 that was one of the main focuses when we started this journey in 2012, to put pride in the jersey,\u201d Borthwick said. \u201cTwo days ago Eddie addressed the team and talked about having a script for the game, how we want it to go, how we want it to start. We talked about staying with them, putting pressure on them and what might happen if we were in touch after 60 minutes. That was exactly what happened.\u201d Jones \u2013 who is of Japanese descent and has a Japanese wife \u2013 has even travelled to Munich to talk to Pep Guardiola about intricate preparation and tactical awareness in his quest to help a diminutive rugby nation outfox bigger rivals. \u201cRugby and soccer are very similar in that you always want to move the ball into space and Bayern Munich and Barcelona played the most fantastic passing game you have ever seen,\u201d he said. \u201cThe principles are exactly the same.\u201d It was all too much for South Africa; despite being ranked third in the world even their experienced players had no answer to the whirling dervishes in cherry and white. Almost all of them, not least the full-back Ayumu Goromaru who contributed 24 points, proved more than a match for their supposedly superior opponents. Mentally, too, Japan\u2019s key decision-makers remained calm under intense pressure. The best example came in the final moments when the hugely impressive Japan captain, Michael Leitch, turned down two potential shots at goal which could have yielded a draw, preferring to chase glory instead. When the New Zealand-born replacement wing Karne Hesketh rewarded that faith by diving beyond JP Pietersen into the left corner the impossible fairytale was complete. The outcome also suggested several other things: that one or two Bok veterans are past their best, that their captain Jean de Villiers is not fully match fit and that Pool B may well witness a few more shocks. If Japan had a week to recover for their next game against Scotland, as opposed to a measly four days, they would fancy their chances of a repeat. As it is, another superhuman effort by Japan\u2019s exalted ones will now be required at Kingsholm. With Jones at the helm, though, it would be foolish to rule anything out. He amused everyone afterwards by comparing most Test matches involving Japan to a Hitchcock-style horror film \u201cwhere the woman goes for a shower after midnight and you know what\u2019s going to happen next\u201d. This cliffhanger had a thrillingly different outcome and Jones sees no reason why his squad cannot now aspire to a quarter-final place and a brighter future. \u201cThe history for Japanese rugby has changed. The best athletes might now be more attracted to play rugby. That can have an amazing effect on the sport.\u201d Keep playing this well and the whole world \u2013 as long ago foretold by the Vapors \u2013 could be turning Japanese."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
