German bank Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein is believed to have been approached about providing backing for the deal and is considering whether to agree to the financing arrangement. The move by the ambitious Sydney-based group will increase speculation that it is serious about an offer for the London market, which has been in play since Deutsche B\u00f6rse tabled its now aborted offer in December. The fact that a German bank may be behind the financing suggests that Deutsche B\u00f6rse is unlikely to revive its offer. The timing of a bid is likely to be determined by the Competition Commission which is reviewing Deutsche B\u00f6rse's offer and one from Euronext, the French-Dutch combine. The commission has promised to make the outcome of its inquiry known by November 7 but has also said it will try to give its verdict before then. Sources believe the authorities are working flat out to reach a conclusion and believe a ruling could come by the end of this month. Macquarie's board is due to hold its first board meeting outside Australia in London in the next fortnight at which any bid for the LSE is expected to be discussed. Its interest in the LSE has surprised the City which had expected any offer for the London exchange to be tabled by a rival which would be able to extract cost synergies from a takeover. Deutsche B\u00f6rse has been forced to withdraw its offer in the face of opposition from hedge funds which wanted the \u00a31.3bn it would cost to make the bid to be returned to shareholders. There have also been reports that Euronext is also facing pressure from its investors not to bid because of the price that would need to paid to secure ownership of the London exchange. The LSE's share price has taken a plunge as a result, particularly since last week when Computershare, the share registry service, denied it planned to make a bid for the LSE in conjunction with Macquarie. That denial also helped to dent the credibility of Macquarie's ambitions. The LSE's shares price has lost 40p in the last few days and closed last night at 540p, down 12.5p. It had raced towards 600p last year on hopes that a bidding war would erupt after Deutsche B\u00f6rse tabled its 530p a share offer which valued the exchange at \u00a31.3bn. The LSE is believed to be holding out for as much as 600p a share - a total cost of \u00a31.8bn. As a financial bidder, Macquarie would be able to avoid resistance from its investors about the price it is prepared to pay for such a prized asset as the LSE. Macquarie has admitted it was considering forming a consortium for any bid but so far has not revealed any details about its potential partners. The group has grown rapidly since being formed by a management buyout of the Australian arm of the now defunct Hill Samuel Bank by Alan Moss, the chief executive, and David Clark, the chairman. Their success has led to the bank's being dubbed the \"millionaires' factory\" in Australia for the wealth that has been created for employees in recent years. Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein refused to comment, as did Macquarie."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
