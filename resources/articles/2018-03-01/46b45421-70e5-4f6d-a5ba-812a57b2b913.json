The octogenarian Republican was first elected to the Senate in 1978 but has long been plagued by ill health and has not played an active role on Capitol Hill in recent years. Cochran\u2019s decision to step down means that the state\u2019s Republican governor, Phil Bryant, will appoint a replacement who will serve until November. Then a special election will be held to fill the remaining two years of Cochran\u2019s term. The decision by Cochran to resign will shake up the ranks of Republican leadership. Cochran currently serves as chair of the powerful appropriations committee and was poised to succeed Orrin Hatch of Utah to be third in line for the presidency as president pro tempore if Republicans maintained control of the Senate in the 2018 midterm elections. Cochran\u2019s most recent race for re-election in 2014 was marked by a ferocious Republican primary, which was a harbinger of Donald Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign as a showdown between Republican elites and insurgents. The Tea Partier Chris McDaniel mounted a primary challenge to Cochran and outpolled the incumbent in the first round of voting but Cochran ended up winning a narrow majority in the runoff during a campaign marred by scandal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
