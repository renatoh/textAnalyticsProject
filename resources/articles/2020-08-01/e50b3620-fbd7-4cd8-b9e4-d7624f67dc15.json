S. Kelly prizes \u201cugly\u201d dance moves, avoiding elegant leg lifts and toe points. The co-artistic director of Karul Projects also smashes stereotypes of traditional Indigenous dance: he rarely wears ochre and never has a didgeridoo on his soundtracks. His Brisbane festival show Silence, with seven dancers, remains an overtly Indigenous work: the piece references the fact Aboriginal people never ceded sovereignty of this country, and that \u201ca conversation about Treaty will never be silenced\u201d, says Kelly, who maintains some of his people\u2019s performance traditions, such as dancing to drums. The latest Australia Council national arts participation survey, released last week, found that demand for First Nations performances in Australia is on the rise: 6.5 million or 32% of Australians aged 15 and over attended First Nations arts or festivals in 2019, up from 26% in 2016; and 40% of Australians were interested in First Nations arts, up from 35%. But while Kelly\u2019s company is a growing success story, many independent Indigenous dance and theatre artists are struggling for funding and autonomy, and fighting against stereotypical audience expectations and tokenistic programming decisions. The Bundjalung-Yugambeh, Wiradjuri, Ni-Vanutau performer finds people inevitably want to compare his dancing to the style of Bangarra Dance Theatre, the only Indigenous-led Australian performing arts group out of 29 companies which are afforded \u201cmajor\u201d status \u2013 and the multi-year funding that comes with it \u2013 under Australia Council rules. Yet the two companies present \u201ctwo very different styles of contemporary Indigenous dance\u201d, says Kelly. \u2018Indigenous culture isn\u2019t static. It\u2019s the 21st century\u2019 Australia\u2019s First Nations dance sector is the oldest in the world and boasts 150 independent choreographers and makers, and 100,000 cultural dance practitioners. And yet there are only two multi-year funded Indigenous dance companies: Bangarra and Marrugeku, a smaller, intercultural dance company that\u2019s partly Indigenous-led. And when it comes to understanding First Nations arts, Australians tend to place Indigenous performers in pigeonholes. In earlier Australia Council research, Building Audiences, keywords used by potential audiences were \u201cdots\u201d, \u201cdidgeridoo\u201d, \u201cceremonial\u201d and \u201cface painting\u201d. \u201cWhat\u2019s frustrating is some of those tropes are based on anthropological understandings of the Indigenous culture as being static, and it\u2019s the 21st century,\u201d says Merindah Donnelly, executive director of BlakDance, the peak body for Indigenous dance in Australia. \u201cWe\u2019re part of a cultural continuum. In First Nations dance, there\u2019s experimental, there are artists with Martha Graham technique or a more classical technique, there are artists with traditional form to tell contemporary stories. There\u2019s a total spectrum and intersection of expression, all within a cultural continuum.\u201d In late June, Donnelly told the Senate Select Committee on Covid-19 that there are professional Indigenous dance artists who are homeless. \u201cThey are at the top of their game, and to hear that they\u2019re now homeless and that there\u2019s not a funding stream that\u2019s specifically for independent artists is quite devastating,\u201d she said in her evidence. Declining to name homeless artists for confidentiality reasons, Donnelly tells Guardian Australia that many Indigenous artists have found it too difficult to access jobkeeper or even jobseeker, although a silver lining of the coronavirus pandemic is \u201cwe\u2019ve heard a lot of artists appreciate the ability to reflect and slow down\u201d. In August, Australia Council released research into First Nations dance and theatre, based on interviews with 45 dance and theatre makers. The report called for greater self-determination in Aboriginal arts and more Indigenous-led companies. It found Indigenous artists are often forced to self-fund development of their works to get them stage ready for the growing demand at festivals, but they still faced stereotypes to break down audience barriers. Programmers sometimes saw Indigenous works as too risky, and created competition through \u201ctokenism\u201d, such as limiting to \u201cone First Nations work per season\u201d. Sydney-based Wiradjuri choreographer and dancer Vicki van Hout\u2019s show plenty serious TALK TALK involves her satirising Welcome to Country ceremonies and playing a character who \u201cuses ochre as a crutch\u201d. It won two 2020 Green Room awards after being staged at Arts House Melbourne and Carriageworks in Sydney. Van Hout \u201cquestions art as a commodity\u201d in her work, without saying whether it is good or bad. \u201cI was looking at this whole thing about audiences not recognising it as an Aboriginal work unless I\u2019ve got the ochre on,\u201d she says. But Van Hout says one major festival director who saw the production told her afterwards people might not be ready for her show. \u201cHe said something about, people aren\u2019t ready to let go of narratives about displacement, and narratives of wounding.\u201d \u2018The money\u2019s handed out through a white filter\u2019 The August survey also pointed to concerns that, without a national Indigenous theatre company, public perception of First Nations performance are more skewed to dance. Melbourne-born Meriam/Gu-Gu Yimidir playwright and author John Harding is a life member of Melbourne\u2019s Ilbijerri theatre company, which turns 30 this year and is the longest established First Nations theatre company in the country. Aboriginal theatre gets much bigger audiences than it did 20 years ago, he says. \u201cIlbijerri is just as a big a performing arts company as Bangarra in terms of the cultural footprint, the effect, the impact,\u201d says Harding. \u201cSo why aren\u2019t we a major performing arts company? What criteria are you using here? They\u2019re [the Australia Council] using a white filter. That\u2019s what we\u2019re always up against, because the money\u2019s handed out through a white filter. If you asked every elder in Victoria, \u2018What\u2019s a major performing arts company?\u2019 They would say, \u2018Ilbijerri, of course\u2019.\u201d Brisbane-based Kamilaroi, Kooma, Jiman and Gurang Gurang artist Richard Bell will be recreating Canberra\u2019s famous Aboriginal tent embassy at Brisbane festival, having toured it around the country and presented it at the 2019 Venice Biennale. He plans to take it to the TATE Modern in London in 2022, hoping it will spark a Treaty conversation. In 2002, Bell wrote a much-quoted essay, a theorem that Aboriginal art is a \u201cwhite thing\u201d \u2013 meaning Indigenous art has been commodified by white people. He feels the same way nearly 20 years later: \u201cI haven\u2019t seen much evidence to the contrary,\u201d he tells Guardian Australia. Bell\u2019s original proposal for the Venice Biennale \u2013 to wrap the entire pavilion in chains \u2013 was rejected; instead, he chained up a replica, placed it on a barge and sailed it into the Venetian lagoon. The sight of the pavilion sailing away was satisfying, he says. Meanwhile, Bell warns people not to underestimate the dot art of the desert, nor dismiss it as stereotypical. \u201cThose paintings could be seen as assertions of Aboriginal sovereignty, a sort of political marker,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is definitely the biggest thing that\u2019s come out of Australian art, dot painting. It\u2019s massive.\u201d The works speak to the present, too: \u201cIt\u2019s acrylic on canvas. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything more contemporary than that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
