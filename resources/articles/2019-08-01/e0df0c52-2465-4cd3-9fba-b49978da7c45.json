From the launch of the AFLW, NRLW and Super W competitions, to highly engaged audiences consuming football, cricket and netball World Cups, and individual domination in tennis, golf and surfing. It is tempting to conclude that women\u2019s sport is finally having its moment. But what converts it from a moment to the new normal? From a couple of minutes off the bench to a starting spot on the field? These are the questions that women\u2019s sport administrators and advocates are asking now as they look for ways to build on the momentum created and avoid being consigned to history. Speaking at the Women in Sport Summit in Melbourne this week, Kate Jenkins, the sex discrimination commissioner for the Australian Human Rights Commission, outlined six key challenges to gender equality in sport over the coming years. Equal pay and support from media and sponsors are two areas that come as no great surprise. Fan engagement is higher than ever, but most female athletes are still working second jobs while they chase their sporting dreams. This has a huge impact on the high performance environment as players desperately balance work, training, travel, sleep and food preparation. There is also a need to find a workplace that will support an employee who requires a great deal of flexibility for a significant part of the year, while needing full-time employment during the off-season. Participation at grass roots level is a huge growth area and one that is highly important to building elite competitions. With the boom in women\u2019s sport has come an awakening in how this element of sport is addressed. While growth in participation was once seen as a way to put more people into the pathways with the aim of uncovering the next generation of gold medal and World Cup winners, the focus has shifted. Sporting organisations are now realising that they require a lot more fans, administrators, grass roots officials and participants than they do elite players. As Golf Australia\u2019s female engagement manager Chyloe Kurdas described, it is about facilitating the game in a way that is driven by the needs of women and girls, not the needs of the sport. This has translated into creating quality, positive experiences, putting in place multiple entry points to the sport and valuing all levels of participation equally. While talent pathways may create the next generation of stars, there is little point in those stars competing on the world stage if there is nobody watching because the remainder of that generation has been burnt by highly negative experiences in the sport. Facilities and access remain key challenges from grass roots through to elite level. Issues such as change rooms that have been designed for the needs of male athletes through to scheduling of women\u2019s games and training sessions at times that are not conducive to performance or attracting spectators. Governance is another area that is being considered as the boards of sporting organisations make decisions on behalf of their female members often without having significant female representation. Chair of the Suncorp Super Netball commission and former Wests Tigers chair Marina Go spoke about the significant structural issues that exist in governance in many sports. She highlighted that it is not simply enough to add a woman to an all-male sporting board. Go emphasised the courage it takes to speak up when everyone else around the table disagrees. Her belief is that unless diversity is embedded in the fabric of the sport and driven from the top down, addressing targets in governance will continue to be a quick fix and will not promote lasting gender equality. The final challenge Jenkins put forward was respect for women. This is a thread that runs through every sport at all levels. It is not a challenge unique to the sporting environment but it is one that is highly significant in this arena. While it manifests itself in many ways, a key issue that now arises is the perception that for women to gain respect from male fans and administrators, they must fit into the masculine narrative of sport. This is evident in the way women\u2019s sporting competitions are positioning themselves in the market. Just as men\u2019s sports are coming to terms with the dangers of concussion, many women\u2019s sports \u2013 including netball and AFLW \u2013 are so desperate to gain the respect of hypothetical male viewers that they encourage and glorify physicality, clashes and the bravery of athletes who play on after heavy facial wounds have been patched up. While all these challenges will shape the future of women\u2019s sport, it is this last one that will likely dictate whether this brave new world descends into a dystopia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
