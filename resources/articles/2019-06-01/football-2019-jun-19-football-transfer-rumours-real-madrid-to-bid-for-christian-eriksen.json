Instead they have been putting together a package for Tottenham\u2019s Christian Eriksen, with the Sun reporting that they are prepared to hand over \u00a345m in cold, hard cash plus the 22-year-old Spanish Under-21 midfielder Dani Ceballos. Spurs apparently want \u00a3100m, but with the player entering the final year of his contract and not minded to renew it they may decide to take what they can get at this stage, rather than nothing at all 12 months hence. So what, then, for Pogba? Juventus at least still appear to be interested, with this morning\u2019s Gazzetta dello Sport saying that Douglas Costa is the key to a deal to bring the Frenchman back to Turin, with the Brazilian to be offered in part-exchange (though not if PSG, who are allegedly interested, buy him first). Tuttosport say Juventus will also put the left-back Alex Sandro on the table in an effort to convince Manchester United to let their unsettled midfielder go. And in further Italian-clubs-offer-United-a-part-exchange news, the Telegraph reports that \u201cRomelu Lukaku\u2019s hopes of clinching a move to Internazionale rest on whether United can be persuaded to take Mauro Icardi as part of the deal\u201d. Without offloading Icardi, the club will apparently be unable to meet United\u2019s \u00a380m valuation of their lumbering Belgian. Inter could alternatively finance the deal by selling Ivan Perisic, Radja Nainggolan and/or Jo\u00e3o Mario. It\u2019s very much the season for part-exchange bingo at Old Trafford. News also emerges that West Ham are so determined to cling on to their giant 22-year-old defender Issa Diop, who has emerged as a target for United, that according to the Mirror \u201cit would take an offer in the region of the \u00a375m paid by Liverpool for Virgil van Dijk to convince the Hammers to sell\u201d (the Times however say West Ham \u201care believed to want \u00a360m\u201d). A suggestion that Anthony Martial might head to London in part-exchange might sound absolutely ludicrous, but apparently it was actually made and swiftly dismissed at Old Trafford, who counter-suggested that West Ham might like Phil Jones instead. \u201cThey immediately rejected the offer,\u201d reports the Sun, \u201cpartly because they had no intention of selling Diop and also because they have no interest in taking Jones.\u201d So there\u2019s that. In the meantime the Hammers are chasing the \u00a36m-rated Real Salt Lake winger Jefferson Savarino, and continue to court Celta Vigo\u2019s Uruguayan striker Maxi G\u00f3mez, who would cost about seven times that amount. Matthijs de Ligt has turned down a \u20ac75m move to Barcelona, according to the Spanish radio station Cadenar Ser, with his agent, Mino Raiola, apparently \u201cplaying a decisive role\u201d in the rejection. PSG, Bayern Munich and Juventus will be among the clubs excited by this news. Meanwhile Gareth Bale\u2019s agent, Jonathan Barnett, says the Welshman is unlikely to head to England on loan this summer. \u201cA loan move\u2019s not going to happen \u2013 there\u2019s more chance of me winning at Ascot,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he wants to go out on loan. He\u2019s got a lovely life in Spain. It would take something exceptional for him to leave and loans are not on the menu.\u201d Huddersfield will demand \u00a325m for the Dutch defender Terence Kongolo, wanted by Aston Villa and Watford. Graham Potter is closing in on his first signings as Brighton manager, with the \u00a34m-rated Portsmouth centre-back Matt Clarke and the \u00a318m-valued Genk winger Leandro Trossard the two jostling to be first through the door. Southampton hope to complete a \u00a314m deal for the Birmingham player of the season, Che Adams, after Blues sacked the manager, Garry Monk, who had been less than keen on losing him. Meanwhile Stoke and West Brom want Newcastle\u2019s Dwight Gayle, and Bristol City are at the head of the queue to snap up Aston Villa\u2019s Scott Hogan, who is available on a free transfer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
