But the crossbench peer says her greatest achievement is founding Beyond Words, a pioneering not-for-profit organisation that produces picture books to help people with communication issues. \u201cBeyond Words is what I feel most passionate about because it\u2019s about transforming people\u2019s lives,\u201d she says. Its origins lie in Hollins\u2019 use of pictures to interact with her son, Nigel, who has a learning disability. \u201cHe would roar with laughter at Laurel and Hardy [silent] films but didn\u2019t put a word together till he was eight.\u201d When Nigel was nervous about an adventure holiday, his parents drew pictures depicting activities like abseiling: \u201cWhen we put things into pictures, he felt more in control.\u201d Thirty years on, Beyond Words has distributed or sold 100,000 copies of its 57 titles, which cover everything from relationships to surviving abuse. Each title involves 100 learning disabled people as advisers or authors. There are 60 associated book clubs with 350-400 members. Nigel Hollins, now 47, is a Beyond Words adviser and runs one of the Surrey book clubs. He lives independently in a flat near his family with support from a personal assistant. His mother says: \u201cPeople see Nigel in the shops, cafe or train station. He has a life in the community.\u201d He is part of a theatre company for actors with learning disabilities and, interviewed with his mother, says he relaxes with \u201csomething to eat with my girlfriend and watching a film\u201d. His favourite film is The Rewrite, which, he explains, \u201c I was in with Hugh Grant\u201d. His friendship with Grant, who got him the film role, came after the actor contacted the Hollins family for a documentary about press intrusion (the family experienced unwanted press attention when Nigel\u2019s sister was paralysed in 2005 after a knife attack). Hollins championed disability awareness through an employment scheme as professor of the psychiatry of disability at St George\u2019s, University of London. She employed five learning disabled people over 25 years to teach medical students how to communicate better. (In the UK, just 5.8% of people with a learning disability are in paid work, compared with 74% of non-disabled people.) \u201cIn my department, the medical students weren\u2019t there to impress the professor, they had to talk in a way that people with learning disabilities could understand,\u201d she explains. Despite an National Audit Office report in March that criticised the government\u2019s lacklustre strategy to get a million more disabled people into work by 2027, Hollins, a former government adviser on learning disability and autism when New Labour\u2019s Alan Milburn was health secretary, accepted a grant from the Department for Work and Pensions to create four Beyond Words books about finding and keeping a job. \u201cThe project is helping Beyond Words and jobcentres to refine a support programme to encourage and steer more people with learning disabilities into employment \u2013 whether voluntary, part or full-time\u201d, she explains. What does she think of the state of support for people with learning disabilities and autism today? Hollins says returning people from inpatient units to communities \u201cwill never work until people understand it\u2019s not about a building and a staff team, or rotas and procedures, but about putting somebody like Nigel at the centre of the plans\u201d. Professionals should understand that what people need to live their life is to belong [in communities], she states. But she is all too aware that progress is slow The healthcare regulator, the Care Quality Commission, recently published a report on the long-term segregation of people with learning disabilities in mental health units, and BBC\u2019s Panorama exposed abuse at Whorlton Hall, an NHS-funded, privately run hospital for learning disabled and autistic people in County Durham. The latest scandal came eight years after a government promise to shut institutions such as Whorlton Hall and move people back to communities following similar abuse exposed by Panorama at Winterbourne View near Bristol. And the latest NHS-commissioned review of mortality rates, published last month, finds that people with learning disabilities are disproportionately likely to die in hospital. A lot more needs to be done to tackle the lack of parity in healthcare for learning disabled people, says Hollins. When her son was attacked by two men in London 20 years ago, doctors were reluctant to operate on his fractured cheekbone \u201cbecause [they said] it\u2019s only cosmetic\u201d, she recalls. \u201cIt was discrimination\u201d She argued for an operation. Since then, Hollins says attitudes have improved, not least because more people live in communities. But a big challenge is still the gulf between the health and care systems that learning disabled people rely on: \u201cWe need a continuum \u2013 social care is integral to health.\u201d What hopes does she have for her son, who inspired Beyond Words? \u201cI hope Nigel will be so embedded in his community that there will always be people who\u2019ll look out for him, love him and care for him after I\u2019m no longer here. That\u2019s what every parent wants,\u201d she replies. Curriculum vitae Age: 72. Lives: Surrey. Family: Married, four adult children.
