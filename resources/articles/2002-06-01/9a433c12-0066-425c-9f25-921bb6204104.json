Hewitt won 4-6, 6-1, 6-4, thereby equalling John McEnroe's run of three successive titles in 1979-81. Hewitt has now won four grass-court titles in his short career; Henman has won none. When asked why he thought this was, the 21-year-old Australian, who had already described Henman as one of the top grass-court players in the world, replied, a touch sheepishly: \"Nerves, maybe.\" Great players, and Hewitt is undoubtedly one, appear to be without nerves, or at least they have no difficulty in controlling them. This enables them to play the big points with a freedom beyond the capability of lesser players, as was so obvious yesterday. This was Hewitt's 19th final, of which he has won 15. In stark contrast it was Henman's 24th final, of which he has won nine. Sooner or later, and it may be this year, Hewitt seems certain to make a major impact on the Wimbledon grass, although in three attempts so far he has not progressed beyond the last 16. In this one respect Henman is wholly superior, having played in three semi-finals. It is generally accepted that this will be one of the most open All England singles for many years, and Henman's chances must be regarded as high, given that the number of players who can perform on grass is currently so small. The big question is whether Henman has the mental tenacity to take advantage and rise to the occasion. Yesterday's defeat offered little encouragement. His form coming into the final was not good. The re-vamped serve appeared no less vulnerable, while his volleying and touch at the net, normally his strongest suit by far, had frequently deserted him. Against Hewitt, the most ferocious of competitors, Henman needed to be at his sharpest and in the opening set the signs were positive. \"I've the right tactical game to beat him,\" Henman insisted afterwards, having now lost all five meetings with Hewitt, four of them in finals. Hewitt had thrashed Henman 6-1, 6-2 in March in the final of the Indian Wells tournament in California, and the British No1 was keen to implement the lessons he said he had learned on that occasion. He clearly did not want to present himself as a sitting duck at the net too often, although by playing from the baseline he risked falling victim to Hewitt's greater security in prolonged rallies. For that first set, Henman achieved a balance of attack and defence which placed the onus on Hewitt to force the pace. Henman had two break points against him as he served at 5-4, but held his game and his nerve sufficiently well. His joy at taking a set off the Australian, for only the second time, was immense; unfortunately his celebrations were premature. Virtually every service game had been a struggle, while Hewitt's own serve was gathering sinew. Had Henman been able to take advantage of a break point in the first game of the second set the story may have been different. But the Australian responded with a superb serve to Henman's backhand and the chance was gone. It was Henman's last. Thereafter Hewitt took almost total control, and Henman's game disintegrated dramatically, notably his forehand. \"As usual it all came down to a couple of points,\" Henman said, arguing that the reason why he lost was a tennis rather than a mental issue. But for him the two are one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
