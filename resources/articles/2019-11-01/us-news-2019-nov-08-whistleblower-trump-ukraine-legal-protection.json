But experts believe that the aggressive strategy is a highly risky one, both in terms of flirting with breaking laws around protecting whistleblowers but also in potentially doing lasting damage to a whistleblowing system set up to keep the powerful in check and provide a safe way of exposing the wrongdoing of America\u2019s politicians and government officials. Not that Trump and his allies have shown much concern over such fears. In addition to going after the credibility of this whistleblower \u2013 whose account has been repeatedly corroborated by witnesses in closed-door congressional hearings \u2013 Trump and his allies have pushed for the whistleblower to be identified. Indeed several of his most prominent supporters and inner circle have tweeted what they say is the whistleblower\u2019s name. The whistleblower\u2019s defenders, as well as experts in government accountability, contend that naming the person would flout legal protections, such as anonymity, for government employees who come forward about alleged wrongdoing. One law governing intelligence whistleblowers, the Inspector General Act of 1978, empowers federal agencies\u2019 respective watchdogs (called inspectors general), to investigate tips about potential wrongdoing and lays out protections, including confidentiality. It explicitly forbids the identification of a whistleblower by an inspector general, unless \u201c\u2026 the Inspector General determines such disclosure is unavoidable during the course of the investigation [of the whistleblower\u2019s allegations]\u201d. It also forbids other government employees \u2013 presumably including a president \u2013 from taking action that could be viewed as a \u201creprisal\u201d for their whistleblowing. Other laws exist too, especially for intelligence workers. The Intelligence Community Whistleblower Protection Act, passed in 1998, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 and subsequent presidential directives also contain specifics for persons who work with classified information, including protecting their identity. \u201cAnti-reprisal is sort of the core concept that\u2019s across many of these provisions,\u201d explained John Kostyack, the National Whistleblower Center\u2019s executive director, saying an underlying principle \u201cis the idea of anonymity or confidentiality\u201d. But the provisions that should protect intelligence whistleblowers \u201care general and subject to multiple interpretations\u201d, the center notes. The inspector general is mostly barred from releasing a whistleblower\u2019s name but other government officials are not explicitly prohibited from doing so. These federal laws also only govern federal employees\u2019 treatment of whistleblowers. The media and private persons are not barred from revealing whistleblowers\u2019 names, though news organizations overwhelmingly refrain from doing so. If revealing a whistleblower\u2019s identity is a form of retaliation, however, then there are \u201cserious legal problems\u201d for people who do name them. \u201cConsidering all of the threats that are being made against the whistleblower,\u201d Kostyack said, \u201cnaming the whistleblower is a form of reprisal.\u201d Experts agree the whistleblower in the Ukraine scandal has more reason than most to believe their anonymity is protected by the law: their account has been subsequently corroborated by multiple other witnesses closer to events. That means any naming of the whistleblower could more easily be framed as retaliation. \u201cWith this whistleblower right now, this person\u2019s testimony isn\u2019t even necessary at this point, so there\u2019s no reason whatsoever for the [identity] of this person to be revealed,\u201d said Louis Clark, executive director and CEO of the Government Accountability Project. Reuben Guttmann, a veteran whistleblower attorney, voiced similar sentiments. \u201cIn a situation where the inspector general finds better information than the whistleblower has, then the whistleblower\u2019s testimony or information becomes irrelevant,\u201d Guttman said. \u201cIt appears to me that this whistleblower\u2019s not going to be needed,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you\u2019re seeing is essentially retaliation against the whistleblower.\u201d Several former federal officials told NPR that Trump naming a whistleblower wouldn\u2019t be a criminal act. But Guttman contends that naming a whistleblower could lead to an article of impeachment or theoretically, be considered breaking criminal law, if naming the whistleblower was meant to obstruct justice. But the impact of the flurry of criticism and online identification of the whistleblower has implications far beyond the Ukraine scandal and the current impeachment saga. Experts and whistleblowers said Trump and his supporters\u2019 handling of the situation will have a chilling effect on others who want to come forward about wrongdoing. \u201cWhistleblowers are a check and balance of last resort,\u201d said Sherron Watkins, who blew the whistle on accounting fraud at Enron. \u201cTo me, when we seek out the messenger, the whistleblower, we\u2019re doing the wrong thing. \u201cThe more we persecute them, ruin their lives, let their name [be published],\u201d she continued, \u201cIt is concerning to me we will wipe away this check and balance of last resort.\u201d Frank Serpico, who memorably exposed corruption in the New York police department, offered a bleak view of the situation. \u201cWhistleblowers will always be treated the way they are,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey do this because, as a whole, whatever the organization is, they want to discourage it \u2013 because it affects whatever shenanigans they\u2019ve got going on. \u201cIt\u2019s always been that way,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
