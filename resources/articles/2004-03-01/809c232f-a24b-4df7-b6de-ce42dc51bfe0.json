He has been signed up to front a new regular music programme as part of the first wave of schedule changes ordered by the new controller, Lesley Douglas, who took over from Jim Moir who retired in December. Veteran arts host Sheridan Morley is being replaced by journalist and broadcaster Mariella Frostrup, who will bring her famed husky tones to a new two-hour arts show at 10pm on Friday nights. O'Leary, who started his career on Channel 4's youth strand T4, is considered one of the broadcaster's hottest talents. He also presents music show Re-covered for BBC3 and most recently fronted reality show Shattered for Channel 4. He will start on Radio 2 in the autumn in an as-yet to-be-revealed slot. Unveiling what she described as an \"exceptional\" schedule, Ms Douglas also confirmed that Radio 1 DJ Mark Radcliffe will appear on Radio 2 over the spring and summer - along with former station mates Zoe Ball and Steve Lamacq - as it continues to woo disaffected younger listeners turned off by the chart music on Radio 1 and its commercial rivals. Ms Douglas took over as controller of the country's most listened-to radio station last year, replacing the retiring Jim Moir, and vowed not to change his winning formula of attracting new younger listeners through big names like Jonathan Ross. The first changes to the schedule under her command reflect that approach, with former Radcliffe also confirmed as a new presenter. For the first time since beginning their radio career more than 10 years ago on Radio 5, the laconic Mancunian will be split from his sidekick Marc Riley, also known as Lard. Radcliffe will present a new nightly evening show between 10.30pm and midnight, replacing Richard Allinson, while Riley will present a new show on digital station 6 Music, which is also overseen by Ms Douglas. \"I'm thrilled, honoured and humbled to be asked to join Radio 2's veritable panoply of mercurial visionaries where I plan to revolutionise late night radio listening by playing records and talking in between,\" said Radcliffe. Former Capital Radio DJ Allinson will continue to present his Saturday afternoon show as well, as taking over anchor duties on live music strand Live and Exclusive and fronting a poll to find the most popular 100 songs of all time, the results of which will be broadcast over the spring bank holiday. \"It feels like being signed to Arsenal! I'm very flattered that such an established and massively successful station and brand want me to be part of it,\" said O'Leary. Former Radio 1 DJs also dominate documentaries scheduled over the summer. Lamacq will mark the tenth anniversary of the death of Kurt Cobain and chart the story of Creation Records, while Zoe Ball returns to the BBC airwaves for the first time since she quit the Radio 1 breakfast show as the presenter of a documentary on rave culture. According to the most recent Rajar figures, Radio 2 won back the listeners it lost during the second half of last year, with its audience rising by 670,000 listeners to 13.2 million. The biggest challenge facing Ms Douglas remains the question of what to do when Terry Wogan, who presents the station's popular breakfast show, finally hangs up his microphone. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
