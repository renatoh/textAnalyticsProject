Or not", "bodyText": "AND ALL YOU NEEDED WAS JUST A LITTLE TIME 2019 hasn\u2019t been kind to many of us, not least your fifth-favourite tea-timely football email. But spare a thought for Nathan Jones. The Welshman\u2019s hopes of becoming \u201cthe world\u2019s best manager\u201d have stalled during a dreadful 10-month spell at Stoke, which was mercifully brought to an end on Friday. Let\u2019s relive the coach\u2019s year in quotes: 9 January: Jones leaves League One high-flyers Luton to replace Gary Rowett at Stoke. \u201dThis is not a job for me, this is a lifestyle,\u201d he tells assembled hacks. \u201cIf the players buy into that from the beginning, just think how good they will feel years down the line when we are where we want to be. In the words of Miley Cyrus, it\u2019s the climb.\u201d 26 January: Stoke are knocked out of the FA Cup by Shrewsbury, but bounce back to beat Nasty Leeds (\u201cWe sat in the Holiday Inn and planned it on Tuesday night\u201d). A home defeat to Preston follows. February: Three draws and two defeats. Jones: \u201cMy staff will earn every single penny. It\u2019s good for the club that we don\u2019t get paid by the hour! If we did, we\u2019d be far more expensive.\u201d March: Victory over Nottingham Forest is followed by four consecutive 0-0 draws. Jones: \u201cWe are evolving into a real fluent side.\u201d April: A 1-0 win at Blackeye Rovers is backed up with a five-game winless run. Jones: \u201cWhen we recruit, we will recruit what we call \u2018Stoke City players\u2019. They will play in a certain way, act in a certain way, will be athletic, will be courteous.\u201d May: Stoke finish 16th after a draw at home to promoted Sheffield United. \u201cIt is a glimpse of what we will turn into,\u201d Jones trumpets. \u201cI sacrificed a promotion at Luton to come here. We\u2019ve made great inroads and I\u2019m excited by what we can achieve.\u201d August: The new season begins with defeats to QPR and Charlton. Jones: \u201cPeople are not having to score good goals against us at the moment. We\u2019ve got to be better in both boxes \u2013 in between, not a problem.\u201d September: A home defeat to Bristol City leaves Stoke with one point from seven games (\u201cThere are teams with far more points than us, but are playing worse than us\u201d). The month ends with another home loss, to Forest. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was much wrong with the performance apart from the errors, three big errors,\u201d Jones muses. 19 October: Wins over Swansea and Fulham earn Jones an unexpected reprieve: \u201cWe\u2019re starting to get some continuity. I am a passionate guy and that is what has got me the career I\u2019ve had. I\u2019ve gone back to being me and I like me.\u201d 26 October: Stoke lose at Sheffield Wednesday and Rowett\u2019s Millwall. \u201cI\u2019m flabbergasted.\u201d 1 November: Jones is sacked after six wins from 38 games. Stoke are second-bottom of the Championship, six points below promoted Luton. According to the bookies, Chris Hughton, Michael O\u2019Neill, David Moyes and Sam Allardyce are vying to rip up Jones\u2019s philosophy and bludgeon their way to safety. Stoke may even turn, baseball cap in hand, to Tony Pulis. As for Jones, at least his claim that he would never \u201cuse [Luton] as a stepping stone\u201d remains intact. QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cOne day I miss the lesson on purpose and from the ladies\u2019 toilet I hear how they run around yelling for me like they are mad. When Liam Brady [the head of the academy] comes up to me in the canteen later he grabs hold of me and says: \u2018What are you thinking, young man? Where have you been?\u2019 He has heard a story about how I was hiding underneath a table. That\u2019s not true and I tell him that with a clear conscience. That is not the only clash\u201d \u2013 an extract from the new Nicky Bendtner book, you say? Oof! FIVER LETTERS \u201cRe: yesterday\u2019s Fiver. In the part of northern England where I grew up (where Boris Johnson was politely asked to leave: no, not that part, nor that part, nor even that part, the other part), Mischief Night was 4 November, due to the Gunpowder Plot being discovered the next day\u201d \u2013 Darren Leathley (ex-Morley. Well, just off J28 of the M62). \u201cWhen I read the headline referencing \u2018Mizzy Night\u2019 I was sure The Fiver had taken the opportunity to take the Fizzy Milk theme to the next level. But, of course, The Fiver missed this opportunity, opting to instead continue down the \u2018Being useless at your job\u2019 theme\u201d \u2013 Spencer Weills. \u201cI think Tony Crawford (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters) might have overestimated the amount of readers The Fiver gets if he thinks we could club together to buy an election. We may be able to scrape enough together to buy a pack of chocolate digestives, mind you\u201d \u2013 Oliver Billenness. \u201cI\u2019ve never met the poor thing but I suspect Fiver Jr needs to go out on loan to aid his development\u201d \u2013 Patrick O\u2019Brien.

Liverpool boss J\u00fcrgen Klopp wants football authorities to start putting players\u2019 interests first. Good one! \u201cThere would be a few solutions possible but there was not one day where Fifa, Uefa, the Premier League, the Football League and the other leagues sit at a table and think about the players and not about their wallet,\u201d he tooted. And Bayern Munich gro\u00df K\u00e4se Uli Hoeness has been reflecting on his love of the club after his spell in the slammer. \u201cI can only smile about [the criticism],\u201d he parped. \u201cI think the fans know that, deep down, I have always ripped open my @rse and given everything for them.\u201d STILL WANT MORE?
