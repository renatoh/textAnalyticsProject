The cast of the Everyman production, printed on a different page of the programme, should have been credited as follows: Dermot: Ruairi Conaghan; Kevin: Matthew Dunphy; Joe: Ciaran McIntyre. Many apologies to all. In editing a letter from Dr M Louise Pirouet of Cambridge Oakington Concern, page 29, yesterday, we caused her to say \"...the manager of Oakington invited me to meet him about allegations of aggression and racism by some of his staff ...\" This made it appear that the manager had raised the allegations of racism. In fact, as Dr Pirouet's letter had originally made clear, it was she, not the manager of Oakington who raised the matter when they met. In an article about the Irish choreographer Michael Keegan-Dolan, page 11, G2, February 23, we said he had given up dance and become a bicycle courier when, in 1997, the call came from a regional dance institute in Limerick to set up his company, Fabulous Beast. That is incorrect. It was the Institute for Choreography and Dance in Cork, not Limerick, that commissioned Michael Keegan-Dolan to create his first work, Sunday Lunch, and second work, The Good People, for Fabulous Beast. One of the clues in yesterday's quick crossword (No 10,866), \"Welsh tenor\", required the answer Bryn Terfel. He is actually a bass baritone as we pointed out on March 5 last year and again on October 9. The picture of Red Detachment of Women, showing a chorus of Chinese dancers holding rifles (making them all apparently left handed), pages 12 and 13, Friday Review, yesterday, was reversed. It was submitted to the Guardian that way. The readers' editor writes about picture manipulation, page 24. It is the policy of the Guardian to correct significant errors as soon as possible.
