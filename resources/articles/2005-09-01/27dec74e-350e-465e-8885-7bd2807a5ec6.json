Those performances are only available on separate discs, however, each coupled with other works by Reich, so the Smith Quartet have the field to themselves for anyone wanting his works for string quartet together. The two pieces are strikingly different. In the semi-autobiographical Different Trains the use of pre-recorded interviews generates the speech melodies on which the whole work is based, and places it closer to the documentary style of Reich's video operas than to his other instrumental pieces. Triple Quartet is a virtuoso compositional exercise in which the live quartet is heard against two recordings of itself in a 12-part texture. If lacking quite the rhythmic edge and tension the Kronos bring to this music, the Smiths are impressive in both pieces. Also included is the exquisite little Duet from 1994, in which Reich's music sounds disconcertingly like Arvo P\u00e4rt's."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
