For a while, after Andy Caddick, Craig White and Jimmy Ormond had reduced the provincial side Otago to 61 for six as they chased a notional target of 261 in 45 overs, there were vague hopes of forcing a win that had seemed unlikely when the tourists were 88 for seven in their first innings. But Andy Flintoff was missing from the attack with a knee strain - nothing serious - and the Otago captain Craig Cumming, going in first wicket down, held things steady for 2 hours with an unbeaten half-century containing 10 fours. He and Nathan Morland were still together, having added 63 for the seventh wicket in 18 overs, when the teams called it a day with three overs of the match left. Richard Dawson even got a bowl and, as he had not turned his arm over in two matches since the second Test in Ahmedabad in mid-December, that was almost cause for hanging out the bunting. Now it is on to Christchurch for the remaining warm-up match against Canterbury, beginning on Thursday, by which time the Test team will almost certainly have been finalised. Caddick bowled well enough once more on a surface which had dried out significantly from the first day, although rhythm was hard to maintain in the buffeting crosswind that whipped Lake Wakatipu into a froth of white horses and caused light aircraft taking off from the airport behind the ground to hover like hawks. Caddick claimed three of the first four wickets - dismissing the opener thanks to a gymnastic catch by Warren Hegg behind the wicket, high to his right and poached from first slip - to finish with three for 43 and a match tally of seven for 85, figures that will carry him confidently (although not over confidently, one hopes) into the first Test, starting tomorrow week in Christchurch. There was a useful workout for White too, who needs all the bowling, and indeed batting, he can get if he is to compete for a Test spot. The man he may be up against is Michael Vaughan, who should be fit for the Canterbury match after the partial dislocation of his right shoulder during the penultimate game in the recent one-day series. But however Vaughan performs, there must be some doubt whether White can recapture the yard of pace that made him such a dangerous proposition with a reverse-swung old ball. Of Ormond there is less to say except that his lack of general conditioning stands out as starkly now as did that of Flintoff two years ago - and given that he has had four months since the end of the season to start putting that right, it will not have gone down well with an England management which demands that players demonstrate their commitment. Because of the time lost to the weather on the first two days, Cumming declared the Otago first innings at the overnight 150 for six, three behind England, and then saw his opening bowler Kerry Walmsley remove Mark Butcher and Graham Thorpe, each without scoring, in his first three overs. All that succeeded in doing, however, was to unleash a whirlwind from Marcus Trescothick and Mark Ramprakash, who blazed away for 18 overs to put on 99 for the third wicket. Ramprakash hit two sixes and five fours in his 42 before becoming the third of Walmsley's five victims, and Trescothick had 10 fours in his 68, including five belted in one over from the left-arm pace bowler David Sewell. But another middle-order collapse, in which both Flintoff and White made ducks, had England in trouble at 162 for eight. Then, for the second time in the match, Dawson batted sensibly, adding an unbeaten 35 to his 24 not out of the first innings as he and Ormond, whose 38 atoned for a first-ball duck on Sunday, put on 62 for the ninth wicket to take the game beyond Otago. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
