You have until 11pm on Monday 1 January to post your nomination and make your justification. RR contributor Chaz Cozens (who posts as HopelessCase in the comments) will select from your recommendations and produce a playlist, which will be published on 4 January. Here is a list of all songs previously picked and therefore ineligible for the series. A note: we tackled \u201cfresh starts\u201d back in 2009, but the nuance here might be different ... If you want to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers\u2019 suggestions \u2013 and potentially blog about the process/selection for the Guardian \u2013 please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com with the subject line \u201cRR guru\u201d, or make yourself known in the comments. Here\u2019s a reminder of the guidelines for RR: Tell us why it\u2019s a worthy contender. Quote lyrics if helpful, but for copyright reasons no more than a third of a song\u2019s words. If sharing links, make sure there is appropriate copyright permission. Listen to others people\u2019s suggestions and add yours to a collaborative Spotify playlist. If you have a good theme, or if you\u2019d like to volunteer to compile a playlist from readers\u2019 suggestions, please email matthew.holmes@theguardian.com There\u2019s a wealth of data on RR, including the songs that are \u201czedded\u201d, at the Marconium. It also tells you the meaning of \u201czedded\u201d (picked for a previous playlist so ineligible), \u201cdonds\u201d and other strange words used by RR regulars. Many RR regulars also congregate at the \u2019Spill blog."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
