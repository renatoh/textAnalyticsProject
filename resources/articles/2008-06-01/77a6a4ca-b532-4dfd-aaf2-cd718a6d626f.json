This sequel is a little more understated, resulting in a seemingly unfocused first half that really doesn't prepare you for what follows. Dealing with a proposal for a huge power plant that several small villages will have to be cleared away to make room for, corruption and treachery is the overriding theme. Unusually for Indian cinema, there is no clearly defined hero in this tale, no good guys to cheer on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
