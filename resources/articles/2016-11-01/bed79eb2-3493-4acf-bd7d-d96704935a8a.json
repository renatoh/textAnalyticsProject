In 2015 sales of adult colouring books soared by nearly 1,000% as crafts were seen to promote emotional wellbeing. Origami, with its Zen-like calming qualities, appears to be building on that, presenting a practical challenge for adults seeking a break from technology. Hobbycraft, the UK\u2019s largest craft retailer, said sales of origami kits and papers are up 20% compared with last year, and predicts that it could be one of the top trends of this year. At John Lewis, sales of origami books have increased by 58% week on week, while at Paperchase products have sold out. Origami originated in Japan in the 17th century, although China has also long had a flourishing paper folding tradition. The word is derived from the Japanese \u201cori\u201d meaning \u201cfold\u201d and \u201ckami\u201d meaning \u201cpaper.\u201d It involves creating paper forms entirely by folding \u2013 typically animals and geometric shapes, puppets, masks and boxes. Experts say benefits include developing hand-eye co-ordination, sequencing skills, attention skills, patience, temporal and spatial skills, and maths reasoning. \u201cAdult colouring was a real phenomenon in 2015 and while people are still picking up their pencils \u2026 origami is definitely becoming the new adult colouring as fans look for new and more intricate challenges,\u201d said Katherine Paterson, customer development director of Hobbycraft, which has UK stores as well as an online ordering service. \u201cWe have the wider wellbeing trend to thank for encouraging people to spend time away from technology and be more creative, which is why the craft industry is booming. Adult colouring and origami are very therapeutic and we have recently relaunched our origami range to support the demand.\u201d At John Lewis, Lisa Rutherford, buyer for stationery and seasonal events, said adult colouring books were still being snapped up, with sales up 10% week on week. \u201cHowever, the latest trend is for origami books, which we are seeing fly off the shelves, with sales increasing by 58% week on week.\u201d Sales of colouring pens and pencils were up 52% week on week, she added. Elsewhere on the high street, stationery chain Paperchase has recently launched origami workshops in its larger stores, where customers can learn how to make intricate flowers and gift boxes in a fun and sociable environment. And for those keen to share their completed colourful creations via social media, they are inherently Instagram-friendly. \u201cEarly indications are that origami could be a very popular trend following hot on the heels of the colouring book phenomenon\u201d said a spokesperson for Paperchase. \u201cWe recently offered an origami kit and it sold out incredibly quickly. We know our customers love to be creative and origami obviously allows customers to express themselves. We expect our new workshops to be very popular and to further build the category.\u201d Origami is also influencing fashion as Spring/Summer 17 shows by Carolina Herrera and Bea Szenfeld featured many origami-style folds and pleats and geometric designs. And a TED talk \u2013 \u201cThe Math and Magic of Origami\u201d by US physicist Robert Lang, a pioneer of the newest kind of origami \u2014 which claims to use maths and engineering principles to fold \u201cmind-blowingly intricate designs that are beautiful and, sometimes, very useful\u201d \u2013 has been watched more than 2 million times."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
