The rulings against the judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne and Didier Gailhaguet, president of the French federation, were announced after a two-day hearing of the International Skating Union in Lausanne. Previously the longest suspension was a year's suspension. Le Gougne and Gailhaguet were accused of manipulating the scoring in the pairs competition, a controversy that led to the unprecedented awarding of duplicate gold medals and allegations of corruption within the sport. Le Gougne said she had voted for Elena Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze ahead of the Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier under pressure from Gailhaguet as part of a deal with Russia to favour the French team in the ice dancing. Le Gougne later claimed she had been under emotional duress and was harassed by ISU officials, including Britain's Sally Stapleford, into making false claims against Gailhaguet. Le Gougne was found guilty of misconduct on two counts - voting for the Russian pair on Gailhaguet's orders and not reporting him to the ISU. Gailhaguet was suspended for instructing Le Gougne to give first place to the Russians. Both plan to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. \"This hearing was arranged in a totally biased way,\" Le Gougne said. \"I've been the scapegoat from the beginning. Some people have said, 'You are the Bin Laden of figure skating.' My God, how is it possible to say such an insult?\" The French pair and their lawyers complained that the ISU had not called the other four judges who voted for the Russian pair. The only two who testified were Canada's Bernard Lavoie and Germany's Sissy Krik, both of whom voted for the Canadians. \"It was a farce,\" said Max Miller, Le Gougne's lawyer. \"If you're going to allege a conspiracy between the Russians and French, then the Russians are a necessary party. They weren't there, they weren't invited. That's why it's a farce.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
