But in recent weeks just a single victory has been forthcoming from nine matches and the over-achievers of Gillingham have been coming closer to realising others' expectations of them. Watford, then, should have held all the aces for this fixture, except they have been grossly under-achieving themselves, and are probably still coming to terms with the philosophical dissimilarities between their last and present managers (Graham Taylor and Gianluca Vialli). They did occasionally attempt a subtle interpassing game, but such moments were fleeting, and for the first half it was the error level of both sides that distinguished the match. That alone suggested that it would be extremely unlikely for the game to remain goalless, yet it continued to do so. There was no shortage of goalmouth incidents; but clear-cut chances in the first half were few, the best falling to Gillingham when Guy Ipoua's delicate touch put Marlon King into space on the half-hour. With only Alec Chamberlain to beat, King, who had looked the most dangerous of the Gillingham trio up front, poked it wide. If the first half was not pretty, it was at least even. In the 45th minute, the game turned Watford's way when Gillingham's striker Iffy Onuora lashed out at Paul Robinson and was dismissed. Robinson himself was doubly fortunate to escape censure from the referee, for it was his two-footed lunge that incited Onuora to retaliate. The Watford defender, who had already been spoken to by the referee for some caustic language, then compounded his crime by giving a thumbs up to the Watford fans. It was childish stuff. Though diminished in numbers, Gillingham were by no means out of contention in a second half that surpassed the first in passion and in goal chances. It barely surpassed it in quality, though. Playing a 4-3-3 formation, Gillingham simply depleted their forward line as the visitors' attacks mounted. Predictably it was Watford who came closest to breaking the deadlock in the second half with Heidar Helguson, brought on for Marcus Gayle in the second half, having a decent shout for a penalty in the 76th minute when tugged down by Barry Ashby. In the 82nd minute, when Stephen Glass's free-kick thwacked the bar, Watford must have realised that this would not be their day. Nor in truth did they deserve it. In the dying minutes, most the traffic was directed at the Gillingham goal. The result could be an omen for both teams: Gillingham to keep over over-achieving (ie they could stay up) and Watford to keep under-achieving (ie they won't go up). Man of the match : Marcus Browning (Gillingham)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
