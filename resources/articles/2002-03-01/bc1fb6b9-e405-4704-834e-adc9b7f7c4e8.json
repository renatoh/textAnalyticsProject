Not that Coulthard was blowing his own trumpet; he is too wily and seasoned for that. But he clearly feels that the new McLaren-Mercedes MP4/17 could tip the performance balance in his favour as he squares up to the world champion Michael Schumacher's Ferrari and the other great threat, Juan Pablo Montoya in the Williams-BMW. Coulthard joshed with the media in characteristically reserved style, admitting that one of his biggest problems so far in Melbourne had been coming to terms with the striking new McLaren uniforms. \"These satin trousers with fitted underpants are giving me big trouble when I walk,\" he said, looking uncomfortable. He is clearly relishing his role of de facto McLaren team leader after his old sparring partner Mika Hakkinen opted for a sabbatical and was replaced by another Finn, Kimi Raikkonen. Yet he is taking nothing for granted. He has no concerns about the emergent reputation of his young team-mate. \"I'm getting on fine with Kimi, thanks,\" he said. \"To say that I miss Mika would be unfair, but ultimately my goal here [at McLaren] isn't to have a nice time with my team-mate. It's to win the world championship.\" Coulthard, second in the series last year, relishes the challenge of Melbourne's 3.295-mile Albert Park circuit, where he scored the first victory for the McLaren- Mercedes partnership in 1997, although a repeat victory in 1998 was denied him when he had to gift the race to Hakkinen after a pit stop mix-up. The track has a variety of slow- and medium-speed corners which should suit the excellent handling of the new McLaren chassis. Coulthard is also banking on Ferrari having made a tactical slip in bringing last year's car to the opening race of the season after experiencing problems testing the new F2002 contender. Nevertheless it seems that the Italian team's decision to use the old car may not have been as spontaneous as they would like rivals to believe. In December they took the decision to build another two F2001s, correctly anticipating that the new car might take longer to develop than had originally been expected. For his part, Montoya had a broad grin on his face as he anticipated celebrating the first anniversary of his formula one debut on Sunday. \"I must admit, I didn't really fancy racing at Melbourne for the first time last year,\" he said, \"but once I got the hang of it, it was a pretty good place to compete. \"As Melbourne is the first race of the season, there will be a big question mark over everyone's speed, even though I think we will be all right. We have done miles of testing recently but despite this I always want to do more before the first race.\" Montoya too has expressed the view that Ferrari may already have made a crucial error. \"If we brought last year's Williams we would qualify 10th,\" he said. Schumacher was philosophical about having to use last year's car. \"How much we suffer from this decision remains to be seen,\" he said, \"but I am sure we will be somewhere up at the front.\" Nobody doubts it. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
