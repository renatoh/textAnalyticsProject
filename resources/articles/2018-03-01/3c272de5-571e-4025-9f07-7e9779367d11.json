He stated his players needed to \u201cgrow up\u201d and that the club\u2019s \u201cfootball heritage\u201d of recent poor European performances meant there should be no surprise at Tuesday\u2019s last-16 exit. The manager also said he was going nowhere and pointed out it was only 10 months since he won a trophy. Mourinho, whose side host Brighton in the FA Cup quarter-finals on Saturday, defiantly read a prepared sheet of statistics regarding United in Europe since 2011, when they reached the final. \u201cThere is football heritage,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what [I inherited] is the last time Manchester United won the Champions League, which didn\u2019t happen a lot of times, was in 2008. Since 2011: 2012, out in the group phase. In 2013, out at Old Trafford in the last 16, I was on the other bench [as Real Madrid manager]. \u201cIn 2014, out in the quarter-final. In 2015, no European football. In 2016, back to European football, out in the group phase, go to the Europa League and out in the second knockout. \u201cIn 2017, play the Europa League, win it with me and United go back to the Champions League. In 2018, win the group phase with 15 points out of a possible 18, and lose at home in the last 16. So in seven years with four different managers, once not qualify for Europe, twice out in the group phase and the best was the quarter-final \u2013 this is football heritage. \u201c We went out to a side that\u2019s more successful than Manchester United in the last seven years in Europe. Do you think they didn\u2019t have any players who could play in my team? I cannot name them \u2013 if I name them their agents will jump with happiness and they will say: \u2018Tag, tag, price.\u2019 In Sevilla, there are many players who would play in my team. \u201cThe fans, they read what people write, they listen to what people say, and the people that write, the people that say, are people with a lot of ideas. I used to call them idealists or idiots \u2013 they can be both.\u201d Mourinho pointed to United\u2019s Premier League record and that of Manchester City. He claimed he inherited an inferior squad to the one Pep Guardiola did at City. \u201cThe last victory was \u201912-13 and in the four seasons [since then] United finish seventh, fourth, fifth and sixth. So in the last four years the best was fourth. \u201cIn the last seven years the worst position of Manchester City was fourth. In the last seven years Manchester City was champions twice and if you want to say three times [meaning this season, too], and they were second twice. That\u2019s heritage. \u201cDo you know what is also heritage? Is that Otamendi, Kevin De Bruyne, Fernandinho, Silva, Sterling, Ag\u00fcero, they are investments from the past, not from the last two years [since Guardiola took over]. The United players that left the club last season \u2013 see where they play, how they play, if they play,\u201d he said of Wayne Rooney, Adnan Januzaj, Bastian Schweinsteiger, Memphis Depay, Morgan Schneiderlin, V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s, Paddy McNair, Henrikh Mkhitaryan and Donald Love. \u201cOne day when I leave, the next Manchester United manager will find here Lukaku, Matic, of course De Gea from many years ago. They will find players with a different mentality, quality, background, with a different status, know-how.\u201d Mourinho believes he is rebuilding the squad and questioned whether going one round further in the Champions League would have mattered. \u201cIn terms of the process, what\u2019s the difference \u2013 between being in last 16 or quarter-finals?\u201d he said. He was reminded that he had noted before Tuesday\u2019s game that teams can smell the final once in the last eight. \u201cI cannot be in competition and say we have no chance,\u201d he reflected on Friday. Mourinho criticised the bulk of his squad by picking out only two players for unqualified praise. \u201cI prefer to say that Matic and Lukaku are performing at a high level until the last match,\u201d he said. \u201cI cannot tell you the ones that are not performing.\u201d Mourinho was adamant United are playing catch-up and could give no assurance they will compete seriously for the title next season or progress further in the Champions League. \u201cWe try but the reality is that some clubs, they were ready to win,\u201d he said, in reference to City. \u201cOther clubs are not ready. One thing is to go for the jugular and another is to build a different process. I\u2019m not saying that [we will never catch up]. I won the Champions League with Inter [in 2010]. We can and we\u2019ll fight for it again, no doubts.\u201d Asked if supporters should lower expectations he said: \u201cThe players have to learn how to cope with that level of expectation and pressure. They have to survive and when they survive they become stronger. An easy life and the fans not upset and no critics, that\u2019s not good. \u201cIf you want to make a real top team, with top mentality, you need to grow up and the best way is to have this kind of feeling. I don\u2019t want the fans to have low expectations, I want the fans to have high expectations because I want the players to have expectations too.\u201d Mourinho bullishly alluded to his record. \u201cI am not going to run away or disappear or to cry because I heard a few boos. I\u2019m not going to disappear from the tunnel, running immediately. I am not afraid of my responsibilities.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
