There was also confusion over whether Sir Bradley Wiggins\u2019 medical records had been passed to UK Anti-doping (Ukad) as promised by the Team Sky team principal, Sir Dave Brailsford, in parliament. Sources claimed he was yet to do so but others close to Wiggins insisted the 2012 Tour de France winner had done everything possible to cooperate with the inquiry. On Monday Collins pressed Brailsford three times over the issue, asking him whether he agreed Wiggins\u2019 medical details should be checked to see whether it corresponded with what he claimed had been treatment for the decongestant Fluimucil. \u201cYou\u2019re absolutely right,\u201d Brailsford replied. \u201cAnd my understanding is they have been made available to Ukad.\u201d Later the Team Sky principal said: \u201cIf Bradley had taken something he shouldn\u2019t, then he was tested afterwards, and my understanding is that would have created an AAF [adverse analytical finding]. So I think the fact he has shared his medical records for that time is very much a step in the right direction.\u201d Team Sky and British Cycling are also likely to face further questions about their use of Fluimucil \u2013 which Brailsford has used regularly \u2013 given it has emerged acetylcysteine (the brand name for Fluimucil) is a medicine only available by prescription in the UK because it is an unlicensed drug. That means there should be a paper trail stating who prescribed it and when. However, it is understood Ukad has yet to be presented with incontrovertible paper evidence of what was in the package. Collins said he remained \u201copen\u201d to interviewing Cope and bringing back previous witnesses in the new year, but said he would wait for Ukad to publish its investigation into a medical package delivered to Sky at the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 in June 2011. In October Cope told Cycling News the package was \u201cnothing to do with Brad\u201d and that there was \u201cno story\u201d. Events in parliament on Monday proved otherwise. \u201cWe are open to calling people back to ask them further questions,\u201d added Collins. \u201cAt this stage we are not ruling anything out.\u201d Cope would be likely to be asked explain his movements after delivering the package to Team Sky. On Monday Brailsford said the coach was coming to France anyway to help with the logistics of moving the team to another venue in northern Italy. However, a few minutes earlier Sutton told the committee he shared a car back to Geneva airport after Cope had made the delivery. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to get Ukad report early in the new year, but if we feel we can find out extra information we will look at interviewing Cope,\u201d Collins said. \u201cCertainly we want to find out whether Cope went to Team Sky specifically to deliver this package or whether he was going out to France anyway.\u201d Collins also expressed concern about reports Brailsford had apparently offered a \u201cmore positive story\u201d to the Daily Mail journalist Matt Lawton in September in a bid to stop him writing about Team Sky. \u201cWe need to know when he knew what was in the package, and why he was seeking to close down a perfectly legitimate enquiry,\u201d Collins said. \u201cIt was perfectly right for Lawton to pursue this. Brailsford needs to explain what he knew and when \u2013 and why he didn\u2019t tell Lawton what was in the package when he was first asked.\u201d A Team Sky spokesman said they remained fully behind their team principal despite the claims in the Daily Mail and his admission to the select committee on Monday that he had made mistakes. \u201cDuring the committee session, Dave acknowledged once again his own mistakes in handling the issue over recent months,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are continuing to cooperate fully with Ukad and we look forward to their report. We are confident that when Ukad report, it will be clear there has been no wrongdoing.\u201d A British Cycling spokesperson said they were seeking clarification from Ukad about whether they were able to investigate the medical package as requested by the MPs on Monday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
