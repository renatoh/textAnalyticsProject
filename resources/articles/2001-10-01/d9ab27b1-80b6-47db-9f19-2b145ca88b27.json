Polishing your boots, wearing your goggles secretly around the house, dreaming of the time when you'll hit the slopes again. When you finally get there, you don't want anything to interrupt your trajectory from chalet to snow (with a short stop for morning hot chocolate). Novice skiers, queues, annoying people stopping to fix their skis - you leave them in a cloud of your snow dust. Or at least you would if you could find your ski pass. Which is here somewhere, honestly. Swatch may have come up with the definitive way to banish those embarrassing ski pass moments. Its ski watch stores ski pass information and has an antenna that communicates with a scanner at the fast-track ski lift entrance. One swipe of the wrist and you're through. It can be used at more than 450 resorts worldwide by buying the pass from a Swatch outlet once you arrive. All this and it tells the time. \u00b7 From \u00a332.50.
