In an application filed in an Ontario court this week Ravelston's vice-president, Peter White, said the company was unable to meet its debts. \"The applicants are facing an immediate financial crisis,\" the affidavit stated. \"I believe the value of the assets of applicants exceeds the liabilities of the applicants. However, because of the various lawsuits and other proceedings ... the applicants are not now in a position to satisfy obligations as they become due. \"As a result, the management of the company believes an independent court-appointed officer would be best able to preserve value and represent the interests of all of Ravelston's stakeholders.\" The move follows the dramatic eviction notice served on Lord Black and Ravelston by Hollinger Inc requiring him to hand over the keys and quit his Toronto headquarters. Hollinger Inc has issued an eviction order on Ravelston Corp, ordering it out of the historic three-storey building by the end of May. Lord Black is also facing legal action from a committee of Hollinger International's board of directors to recover what they say are hundreds of millions of dollars that were siphoned from the company. He has denied any wrongdoing. Hollinger Inc is suing Ravelston, Lord Black and several colleagues for more than Can$600m (\u00a3256m). \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
