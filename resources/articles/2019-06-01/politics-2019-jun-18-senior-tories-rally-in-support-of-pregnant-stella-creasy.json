The Walthamstow MP, who is pregnant, received support from Jeremy Hunt and Sajid Javid, two of the contenders to succeed May, who both urged action to be taken over the issue. Creasy said the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) had told expectant mothers it did not recognise any form of maternity leave and would not automatically provide extra support for constituency work after she gave birth. Writing in the Guardian, Creasy said she had decided to speak out after experiencing two miscarriages during which she was forced to continue to work as normal without any additional support. Now pregnant again, she said she had been told MPs would not be provided with any additional funding by Ipsa for support staff to allow her to get extra help with constituency work. Asked about Creasy\u2019s article, May\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cNo one should have to choose between being a mum and being an MP. While parliament has made positive changes to becoming more family-friendly in recent years, such as introducing proxy voting and changing sitting hours, Stella Creasy\u2019s comments highlight that there is much more to do. \u201cIt is ultimately up to Ipsa to make decisions on pay and allowances for MPs, but the prime minister would urge them to look very closely at the issues that have been raised by Stella Creasy and determine what more support, such as temporary staffing, can be provided.\u201d Hunt and Javid also urged action in tweets. Hunt, the foreign secretary, said it was \u201cimpossible to argue\u201d with Creasy\u2019s views, adding: \u201cInsidious to force MPs to choose between serving their constituents and spending precious time with their newborn. Come on Ipsa, do the right thing.\u201d Javid, the home secretary, tweeted Creasy to congratulate her on the pregnancy, saying: \u201cI completely agree that we must strive to ensure parliament is an inclusive workplace. It shouldn\u2019t be more difficult to be a female MP than a male MP.\u201d Valerie Vaz, Labour\u2019s shadow leader of the Commons, said: \u201cIt is Ipsa\u2019s responsibility to ensure that there are proper policies for parental leave that are fit for the 21st century. MPs have a constituency workload as well as all of their responsibilities in the House of Commons. \u201cIpsa must ensure that MPs are properly supported to do their job representing their constituencies regardless of their personal circumstances.\u201d Creasy said that during her first miscarriage, she had carried on constituency work \u201caching and bleeding\u201d, including joining a protest for the extradition of a man who had raped and murdered a constituent. After her second miscarriage, she said she had to arrange the medical procedure around constituency advice surgeries. \u201cHeartbroken by all the years that I have struggled with fertility, I\u2019ve kept these events to myself and made sure my constituents have never been affected,\u201d she wrote. \u201cNow I\u2019m pregnant once more and terrified \u2013 not just that it will go wrong again, but because I know that my resolve to keep my private and professional lives separate has become impossible.\u201d Creasy said she had approached Ipsa about funding for cover but was told it \u201cdoes not \u2018recognise\u2019 that MPs go on maternity leave\u201d. \u201cHumiliatingly, it is making me beg for extra staff funding \u2013 or give up any chance of spending time with my child to make sure my constituents don\u2019t miss out,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf a GP or vicar were on leave, a locum would be provided to ensure continuity of services. In Denmark, a member of the national parliament would have a substitute MP appointed.\u201d Creasy said she had been heartened by the introduction of proxy voting, introduced this year after the Labour MP Tulip Siddiq, who was heavily pregnant, was forced to delay her caesarean section and vote in a wheelchair, but said far more had to change. Siddiq, the MP for Hampstead and Kilburn, told the Guardian she had been refused extra help with her first pregnancy, a year after she arrived in parliament in 2015. Having given birth to her second child four months ago, she said she had not even bothered to make the application. \u201cThat is because of the negative reaction I had first time around. They were utterly baffled I was even having a baby; I was passed around and I was told: \u2018We have not got a historic policy on that because we have not had many women in parliament who give birth,\u2019\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
