Klopp\u2019s team won 1-0 at Tottenham thanks to a first-half goal from the magnificent Roberto Firmino to give them 61 points from an available 63 this season. No team in any of Europe\u2019s top five leagues has ever taken more points at this stage of a season. Klopp, however, made it clear this kind of detail paled when set against what is at stake in terms of the title. Liverpool are now 16 points clear of second-placed Leicester with a game in hand. \u201cI really try to respond in an appropriate way, but when somebody told me I didn\u2019t feel anything,\u201d Klopp said of the record. \u201cIt is just not like that. I am in football for 50 years or so and if somebody would have told me that would ever happen I would probably have said it\u2019s not possible. Now it happened I don\u2019t feel [anything]. I don\u2019t know exactly what is wrong with me. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously very exceptional but we didn\u2019t think for a second about it before the game. And after the game somebody had to remind me about it. It\u2019s obviously exceptional but if it stays like this then I can think about it after five years or so. In the moment, I can just say what we try to do. All we have is still to create the basis for the rest of the season. We have a lot tough games to play, the next one is especially tough [at home to Manchester United] and we have to make sure we are ready for that.\u201d Klopp paid tribute to Firmino. \u201cWhen I went to him and wanted to give him a hug after the game, he wanted to stop and talk first,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cHe said: \u2018I know I should have scored more goals.\u2019 It was absolutely not what I wanted to say! He is a super player. I don\u2019t say this for the first time and will hopefully not say it for the last time.\u201d Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, who felt his Spurs team deserved something from the game, is primed to sign the Portugal midfielder Gedson Fernandes on an 18-month loan from Benfica. The 21-year-old has two caps."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
