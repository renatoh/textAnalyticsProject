Reserve deputy Robert Bates, a wealthy 73-year-old insurance executive, has been charged with second-degree manslaughter after shooting dead Eric Harris. Bates said he meant to use a stun gun instead of a gun during the incident, which occurred during an undercover operation by the violent crimes task force into the illegal sale of firearms on 2 April. \u201cMr Bates has been to the range several times and is qualified, and that is documented,\u201d Tulsa County sheriff Stanley Glanz said at a press conference on Monday morning. Lawyers for Harris\u2019s family said on Monday afternoon that they are not focused on a lawsuit now, but that the attorneys are continuing to investigate the incident, which was recorded on video. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a race issue, it\u2019s a dehumanization issue,\u201d said the Harris family\u2019s attorney, Daniel Smolen. Two other deputies have faced scrutiny for their role in the incident, including Michael Huckeby, who kneeled on Harris\u2019s head after the man had been shot. Smolen said that Huckeby\u2019s father, Thomas Huckeby, was a supervisor at the Tulsa County jail when black employees filed a discrimination lawsuit against the department. He also signed off on some of Bates\u2019s timesheets. Smolen said that case had been settled for $1.7m. He showed a video of Thomas Huckeby\u2019s depostion during the time, where he talks about one of his tattoos, which he had learned was a Nazi symbol. \u201cEric\u2019s family doesn\u2019t know about the Tulsa County sheriff\u2019s office,\u201d Smolen said. \u201cThey don\u2019t want this case to be about race.\u201d Smolen said that Harris\u2019s brother Andre is \u201ctrying to get his life back to normal as much as he can.\u201d Glanz apologized to the family in a press conference on Monday. \u201cWe are sorry Eric was taken from you,\u201d Glanz said. \u201cMy sympathy goes out to that family.\u201d Glanz also said that he does not believe his office falsified training records but acknowledged that some of the officer\u2019s training documents are missing. He told reporters he did not know how many are missing but promised to release those records if and when they are located. Glanz said the FBI has completed a civil rights investigation into the killing and found no wrongdoing. A video released by the sheriff\u2019s office shows Bates shouting \u201cTaser\u201d before a shot is heard, and Bates says: \u201cI shot him, I\u2019m sorry.\u201d Glanz said that two of the officers in the video had to be reassigned because of threats that have been made against them. In the video, an officer can be heard saying \u201cFuck your breath\u201d to Harris, who is lying on the ground after being shot. On Saturday, Bates\u2019s official records were released. The collection was missing three years of firearms qualification records and nearly all of the necessary field training officer records. The department is also reviewing whether Bates was trained on the gun he used to kill Harris. Bates had donated equipment to the sheriff\u2019s department and made a $2,500 donation to Glanz\u2019s re-election campaign in 2012. Bates and the sheriff\u2019s office have repeatedly disputed reports that the deputy reserve officer\u2019s training certificates were falsified. A report by the Tulsa World said that three supervisors were reassigned after refusing to certify Bates\u2019s training. \u201cThat is unbelievably unfair,\u201d Bates said in an interview with NBC\u2019s Today show last week. \u201cI have donated equipment as I saw fit, when the need happened to arise to allow the task force and other areas of the sheriff\u2019s office to better do their jobs on the streets of Tulsa.\u201d In the interview, Bates also apologized to the Harris family. \u201cThis is the second-worst thing to ever happen to me \u2013 or first,\u201d he said. Bates clarified that he nearly died from cancer, but that the shooting was the top thing he regrets in life. Two of the Tulsa World reporters who wrote the report alleging falsified documents resigned on Monday, according to Talking Points Memo. Tulsa World executive editor Susan Ellerbach confirmed that staff writer Dylan Goforth and enterprise editor Ziva Branstetter resigned, the same day Branstetter was named a finalist for the 2015 Pulitzer prize for local reporting for another story. They and two other reporters are leaving for a not-yet-launched local news site, according to Goforth. The sheriff\u2019s department pushed back on the story about Robert Bates records, but Ellerbach would not say whether the newspaper stands by the report. \u201cWell, I\u2019d say their leaving was not related to the article,\u201d she told TPM. Police on Monday also released dash cam video of the incident, showing Harris attempting to illegally sell police a gun before running away."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
