Speaking on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program on Monday night, Hawke became the latest member of the government to publicly back the controversial proposal to follow the Trump administration in shifting Australia\u2019s embassy from Tel Aviv. A member of the outer ministry in Scott Morrison\u2019s government and a conservative power broker in New South Wales, Hawke said Australia should \u201crespect\u201d Israel by moving the embassy. \u201cI think it is [in the national interest],\u201d he said. Describing Israel as \u201cthe only stable democracy in the Middle East\u201d, Hawke said Australia should \u201cstand up for what\u2019s right\u201d in the international community by supporting the shift. \u201cAnd supporting Israel is one of those things,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s absolutely in our interest to stand up for democracies in the world and other nations that we can get along with and are compatible with western values.\u201d Asked if he would be \u201cdisappointed\u201d if Morrison didn\u2019t go ahead with the proposal, which he floated before the Wentworth byelection, Hawke said the government would weigh up the security, trade and foreign policy considerations. But, he said, there were \u201cvery good arguments\u201d for moving the embassy. \u201cUltimately the Australian government\u2019s got to make a decision about what\u2019s good for Australia and there are very good arguments about ensuring we respect Israel\u2019s capital of West Jerusalem,\u201d he said. \u201cThis didn\u2019t come about about the byelection, as Mark [Dreyfus, the shadow attorney general] says.\u201d Morrison first flagged the idea of moving Australia\u2019s embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem during the lead-up to the Wentworth byelection in October. The proposal \u2013 which the prime minister has said he will make a decision on before Christmas \u2013 sparked a diplomatic blowback and has caused growing division within the government. On Thursday the treasurer , Josh Frydenberg, publicly rebuked Christopher Pyne for commenting on the possible move, describing the defence minister as a \u201clegend in his own lunchtime\u201d. Pyne, who last month floated the idea of two diplomatic presences in the fraught territory, an idea he repeated on Monday, said it was up to his colleagues to explain why such a delicate foreign policy debate was being played out publicly. It followed reports the minister for defence industry, Steve Ciobo, told his Indonesian counterpart there was \u201cless than a 5% chance\u201d of Australia moving its embassy, and Frydenberg\u2019s advocacy for the change. Labor\u2019s shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, told the Q&amp;A audience the proposal was a \u201cmonumental blunder\u201d made for \u201cgrubby\u201d political reasons. \u201c[It was] a monumental blunder [for] Morrison to have even suggested without consulting his foreign minister, without consulting any neighbours, any neighbouring countries, without consulting our security agencies, he just announced for really quite grubby political reasons of scrounging for a few votes in the Wentworth byelection, and now we watch this government in complete disarray,\u201d he said. \u201cToday they\u2019ve fallen to fighting with each other about this decision. This is a problem entirely of Mr Morrison\u2019s own making.\u201d Another panellist, the US journalist Susan Glasser, said she imagined the Trump administration would be \u201cdelighted\u201d if Australia followed the US in moving the embassy, and that it was possible it was pushing for that behind the scenes. \u201cI imagine that President Trump would be delighted if Australia followed him,\u201d she said. \u201cOne of the things that\u2019s been striking about this decision once it\u2019s been taken by the US president is that many other countries have not followed behind. \u201cThat\u2019s one of the things that\u2019s notable in general about the Trump foreign policy. It\u2019s a much more unilateral moment in the US. We\u2019ve been used to leading with partners and pursuing a much more multilateral course. And would have avoided in the past actively avoided taking steps that we knew others weren\u2019t going to follow, whether it was internationally or at the United Nations, for example. \u201cPresident Trump has shown a real willingness to go it alone. I imagine he would be eager for others to follow. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if behind the scenes you\u2019re seeing actual pressure from the Trump administration to this government here in Australia.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
