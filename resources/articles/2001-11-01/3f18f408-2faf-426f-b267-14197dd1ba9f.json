A senior BBC insider said talks had broken down because ITV lawyers insisted the network took the first repeat window and wanted the BBC to foot the bill for residual fee payments for all the talent involved. \"They wanted the first repeat and they wanted us to foot the bill,\" the source added. \"There's no way the BBC governors would have allowed us to spend licence fee money on a commercial rival.\" But an ITV spokeswoman immediately disputed the BBC's version of events. \"All ITV asked for was the right to repeat the episode at a later date. ITV was fully prepared to pay all artists residuals, and made that clear to the BBC.\" ITV's director of channels, David Liddiment, has said he was willing to allow the Millionaire? set and brand to be used in the Only Fools special, while requesting that in return his channel was allowed to repeat the show after it was first broadcast on BBC1. But talks between the two sides broke down, with ITV insiders claiming the BBC dismissed its request to repeat the show and the BBC insisting ITV had attached unacceptable conditions to the deal. \"We're surprised the BBC has rejected the idea we have put to them, but our door is still open for discussion,\" an ITV spokeswoman said. \"ITV is keen to help bring [Only Fools and Horses creator] John Sullivan's idea to life, but the BBC wants to use one of our most valuable programmes and it seems perfectly reasonable that we would be able to repeat the episode later on.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
