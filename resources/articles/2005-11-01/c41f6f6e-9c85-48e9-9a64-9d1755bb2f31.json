Mr King and his colleagues on the monetary policy committee (MPC) are anxiously awaiting the January wage round when most annual settlements are made for any signs that high oil prices are feeding into inflation-busting pay deals. In statements to the Treasury select committee, Mr King said it was crucial pay settlements remained moderate. \"We're going through a pay round in the next few months; it's very important in that pay round that wage rises don't pick up to compensate for the rise in inflation,\" Mr King said. While the risks to inflation were broadly balanced, Mr King said, October's dip in the consumer price index - the government's preferred measure of inflation - was not necessarily as a sign that price pressures had peaked. \"Where we could go wrong is if it turns out to be the case that much of the oil price increase hasn't yet come through,\" Mr King said. \"If that were to materialise - and I stress if because it is not our central view and it hasn't come to pass yet - that is one of the upside risks and we would have to respond ... if we see the upside risks materialising then policy might need to be tightened.\" Asked by the Labour MP for Newcastle Central, Jim Cousins, whether wage increases could lead to an increase in interest rates, Mr King said: \"If there were to be further increases in average earnings growth, that would be one of the factors that we would look at.\" Analysts said Mr King's preoccupation with higher energy costs and their possible impact on inflation virtually ruled out a cut in borrowing costs in the near future. \"Today's comments by the MPC kill off any lingering hopes for an early interest rate cut,\" said Howard Archer of Global Insight. \"Not only are MPC members sending a loud and clear message that interest rates are on hold for the next few months at least, but they are also indicating that the eventual next move in interest rates may not even be down.\" Comments by Mr King's colleagues reinforced the impression that the Bank was in no hurry to cut rates. Those members who had backed a 5-4 vote to reduce rates in August said they had not envisaged a series of reductions then and neither had their peers. One MPC member, David Walton, told MPs: \"I would hazard a guess, if you had asked any of us did we think that rates were going to 4% by the beginning of next year, I think you would have found a pretty unanimous agreement.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
