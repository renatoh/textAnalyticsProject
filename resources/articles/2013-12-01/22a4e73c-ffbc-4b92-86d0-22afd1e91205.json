Seven renewals have come and gone since 2005, and the recent roll of honour makes it look like a cartel: if the conglomerate from Ditcheat does not win, then the mega-corporation from Lambourn surely will. But this could be the year for a family Christmas. Cue Card, the 3-1 favourite, will be saddled by Colin Tizzard and ridden by his son, Joe, who still milks the cows on the family farm in Dorset when his father is too busy with horses. They have 60 horses in all, which would have been a big string back in the 60s when Arkle and Mill House were winning the King George. These days, the major operations have twice that and more. But they do not have Cue Card, a horse who was relatively cheap at \u00a452,000, surprised even his trainer when he streaked home in the Bumper at the Cheltenham Festival in 2010 at odds of 40-1, and has continued to defy expectations ever since. Joe Tizzard has been in the saddle for every one of Cue Card's 19 starts, winning 10 including four Grade Ones, and between them, father and son have refined his raw talent, turning Cue Card into a worthy favourite for one of the season's most prestigious events. Colin Tizzard tried, and failed, to hold back the tears when Cue Card returned after his latest unexpected victory, a breakthrough performance to win the Grade One Betfair Chase over the longest trip he had attempted. \"It wasn't all because it was my son,\" Tizzard says, \"I was so proud of the horse as well, because we bought him as a foal and then for him to go and run like that. Then my daughter [Kim] rang me up as soon as he went past the post and she was crying down the phone. Then I got there and congratulated Joe, and the next thing I knew, it was catching up with me. \"I could feel it coming up through my heart and my throat and the next thing I knew, I couldn't speak. I was just chuffed and proud of everybody around me really who'd helped us to get that far. It catches you out at times.\" As Joe says, \"that was the first time I've ever seen him being brought to tears, but it just shows. That's what we work hard for, and we're reaping the rewards. \"Being a family business definitely puts a lot of strain on us as well. As a jockey, I can't get off after a race and just give my spiel and then it's not my problem. If things go wrong, I have to deal with them at home as well. But it also means a lot more when you put in a lot of hard work and you have the big days, and Dad certainly showed that after Haydock.\" Tizzard the jockey rarely receives any instructions from Tizzard the trainer, and where Cue Card is concerned, no instructions are required any more. The horse who charged home eight lengths clear of Al Ferof \u2013 who is also in the nine-strong field on Boxing Day \u2013 at Cheltenham nearly four years ago is now as straightforward as they come. He is fit and healthy too according to his trainer, who has spent the last week regretting a suggestion that there might be a virus in his yard. \"We will discuss how we think a horse should be ridden, but I'm in a lovely position riding-wise, because I go out and do as I feel and if it doesn't work, then we go back to the drawing board,\" Tizzard says. \"I'm never tied to instructions at all. \"Cue Card was difficult to start with but he's so easy now. I just sit as quiet as I can on him, let him relax and try not to touch him, let him prick his ears and then you know he'll pick up for you. He's learned to race, he always saves himself a little bit, and I think it was the King George last year [when Cue Card faded after early mistakes] that did it for him. \"He got very tired, and that made a man of him and taught him that he doesn't just need to rip off and pull the jockey's arms out and go as fast as he can. Now he settles after a couple, and waits and skips along.\" Colin Tizzard concedes that there is extra pressure involved in having his son in the saddle, as well as the added satisfaction when everything clicks. \"It makes it more of a test of your never when you're son is riding,\" he says. \"You feel more responsible. You don't want anything to go wrong, or go wrong with the horse. It would probably be easier if an outside jockey was riding, but at the same time, the family will be the first ones in on Christmas morning, and again in the afternoon when everyone else is off. They have played just as big a part in getting this horse to the standard that he is as I have.\" Training racehorses started out as a hobby for Tizzard, then turned into the main source of income during the winter as Joe's talent as a jockey became apparent. The dairy cows are still part of the operation, however, and will not be disappearing if or when Joe takes over the licence at some point in the future. \"It's as much a change as anything,\" Joe says. \"I can forget about horse racing, especially if I'm having a bad run, and go and do my bit of farming. We've still got 250 cows and I'll still milk them once a week. We've been brought up as dairy farmers and we're not thinking of getting rid of the cows. If anything we're trying to push on a bit and milk a few more.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
