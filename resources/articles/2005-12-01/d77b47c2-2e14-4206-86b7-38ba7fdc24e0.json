This pair, their semi-finalist contemporaries \u00c9tienne Bacrot and Alex Grischuk and seven others, go through to the 2006 candidates matches, in which 16 GMs will compete for four spots in the 2007 Fide world championship. Ratings will determine who meets whom in the candidates, except that Aronian is seeded No1 and faces the lowest ranked qualifier, Magnus Carlsen. Carlsen, at 15 the youngest ever candidate, has a large public following in Norway. A Norwegian TV channel's website covered his World Cup games move by move and attracted up to 250,000 hits, with a peak for the game shown here in which the prodigy defeated a 2670-rated Russian GM and thereby broke Bobby Fischer's candidates age record. Norway wants to host the six-game Carlsen v Aronian series. It will be hard for the teen since the laid-back Aronian, a self-confessed \"cheap tactician\", was cool about his own play in Siberia and believes he will improve further: \"I'm not satisfied with my performance, I played rather badly, and have some vacancies in my chess knowledge\". The spotlight now turns to the current Russian title contest in Moscow and in particular to the classical world champion Vlad Kramnik's attempt there to revive his shrunken credibility.
