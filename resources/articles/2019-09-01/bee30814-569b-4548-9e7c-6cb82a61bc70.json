Though the Pacific is estimated to contribute just 0.03% of global emissions despite making up 0.12% of the world\u2019s population, the climate crisis is already having a devastating impact on the region. The ocean, which has been the source of much of the region\u2019s food and resources, is now the site of impending catastrophe. Rising sea levels, coastal erosion, the destruction of crucial reefs and warming that leads to more frequent and more severe cyclones all threaten the region. As the crisis has hit the Pacific, leaders have emerged. Despite the tiny populations of their countries, they have had an outsized influence on the global climate fight. As the world\u2019s leaders gather for the United Nations General Assembly and climate summit, we speak to three Pacific leaders who have been on the frontline of the climate crisis and are taking the fight to New York. Frank Bainimarama, prime minister of Fiji The fight against the climate crisis has been the great second act of Frank Bainimarama\u2019s prime ministership. After his role in the 2006 coup, which saw the Fijian commodore seize power and then refuse to call elections for eight years (Fiji has since held two, both of which Bainimarama has won), Bainimarama was ostracised by the international community. But in recent years, he has emerged as a leader in the global climate fight, becoming the president of COP23 in 2017, the UN\u2019s leading climate change body, and the only Pacific leader to have held the title. \u201cI and my officials come from a little tiny island and we had to go onstage and fight these big emitters,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to be standing up on stage telling the big emitters: \u2018Come down off your high horse and do what needs to be done to fight this\u2019.\u201d But Bainimarama says it was important to have a Pacific leader in the role. \u201cBy then we knew what climate change was doing, especially to Pacific Island nations,\u201d says Bainimarama. \u201cWhen we took up the presidency, our fight was really the fight of the Pacific and the vulnerable islands, low-lying islands.\u201d While Fiji, which is one of the most populous and more economically-developed countries in the Pacific, is not considered among the most vulnerable to the impacts of the climate crisis \u2013 that dubious honour goes to Tuvalu, Kiribati and the Marshall Islands \u2013 it is still feeling the effects. \u201cEverywhere I go in Fiji there are only two things people want, especially on the coastline. One is a seawall, the other is a hurricane shelter,\u201d says Bainimarama. In 2016, Fiji was devastated by Cyclone Winston which killed 44 people and inflicted damage equal to one third of the country\u2019s GDP. Under Bainimarama\u2019s leadership, Fiji has offered refuge to the entire populations of Tuvalu and Kiribati in the event that the countries become uninhabitable due to the climate crisis. He is also willing to take the fight to much bigger powers, frequently making headlines and causing diplomatic tensions for his blunt assessments of the behaviour of wealthy countries unwilling to curb emissions (including neighbouring Australia). At this year\u2019s climate summit and General Assembly in New York he will be demanding countries take immediate action to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial temperatures and calling upon developed countries to mobilise at least $100bn in climate finance per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. \u201cOur fight will never stop,\u201d he says. Enele Sopoaga, former prime minister of Tuvalu Enele Sopoaga hails from the fourth-smallest country in the world by area and the second-smallest by population. But he wants the world to know its name and to see in its fate, the fate of the planet. Until this week, Sopoaga was prime minister of Tuvalu, which scientists predict could become uninhabitable in the next 50 to 100 years due to the climate crisis. An election in early September saw him retain his seat in parliament, but lose the leadership of the country, so he will not be attending the climate summit and UN General Assembly in New York, though he has spoken at many of them, as well as COP summits, since becoming prime minister in 2013. \u201cAs soon as I took on the leadership of my country I went to the first conference of parties in 2014 \u2026 I said, \u2018Unless we save Tuvalu, we cannot save the world. Save Tuvalu to save the world\u2019.\u201d Sopoaga has been outspoken on behalf of his country. As the main spokesman for the Pacific Small Island Developing States at the 2009 UN climate conference in Copenhagen he proposed amending the draft climate treaty to require countries to limit warming to 1.5C, a proposal that was rejected. At the recent Pacific Islands Forum, hosted by Tuvalu, he was one of the main leaders urging Australia to stop opening new coal mines, saying he told prime minister Scott Morrison: \u201cYou are trying to save your economy, I am trying to save my people.\u201d Tuvalu is home to just 11,000 people. Its total land area accounts for less than 26 sq km and according to its government, two of Tuvalu\u2019s nine islands are on the verge of going under due to sea-rise and coastal erosion. When UN secretary general Antonio Guterres visited the country in May, he said Tuvalu was \u201con the extreme frontlines of the global climate emergency\u201d and that climate change was \u201cstriking in Tuvalu is a more dramatic way than anywhere else in the world.\u201d \u201cWe are predicted by IPCC scientists to be the first victims of submersion into the sea,\u201d says Sopoaga. \u201cNow, if that happens it doesn\u2019t mean climate change is going to stop, it is going to continue ... We may be the first one, but others will follow. So my call to save Tuvalu, save the world, is not irrational, it is very pragmatic.\u201d Sopoaga says that anyone who doubts the effects of climate change should visit Tuvalu \u2013 partly to see the impacts of the crisis on his tiny nation and partly to experience the nation\u2019s rich culture, which would be lost if the country is lost to the waves. \u201cCome to Tuvalu, I will show you how these islands have been badly affected and eaten by erosion, but also come so I can show you how the salinity has eaten into the freshwater table, how it has eaten into the basis of the food supply here. \u201cYou come here I\u2019ll show you how the beautiful coral reefs \u2026 are now white-ish because they are attacked by acidification and plastic and carbon,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the thing is, do you need to see this in order to be convinced that climate change is happening? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d Hilda Heine, president of the Marshall Islands Hilda Heine is a leader of firsts: when she was elected president in 2016 she became the first female leader of her country (she is currently the only female Pacific leader except for Jacinda Ardern in a region with the lowest rate of female political representation in the world). She is the first person in the Marshall Islands to ever get a doctorate, her country was first to submit its targets to meet the Paris agreement and it could be one of the first to see large-scale migration as a result of rising sea levels. In April, one of the local governments in Marshall Islands, purchased 283 acres of land in Hawaii as a climate change bolthole for citizens, if dire predictions for the country\u2019s future come to pass. \u201cI think all of us as leaders realise that we\u2019re coming to the end of this,\u201d she tells the Guardian. \u201cIf we don\u2019t take action now, when are we going to take action? There is no time left for us to be indecisive \u2026 otherwise the future of our Pacific Island countries will be lost.\u201d But Heine is not ready to accept that outcome yet. She, like many leaders of the Pacific, will be speaking at the climate summit in New York on Monday, where she will demand countries provide \u201ccommitments to enhance ambition in line with the IPCC special report on 1.5C\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019ve made the conscious choice to lead from the front, because otherwise, who would take the moral responsibility and the leadership on this? Even though we don\u2019t cause this, it impacts our livelihoods more than it impacts others, so for us to just wait to take action would not make sense to our people,\u201d she says. Heine is adamant that the most vulnerable members of society should be prominent in discussions around the climate emergency. She is the chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a group of around 50 countries that have contributed negligible amounts of greenhouse gases but are particularly endangered by climate change, and a key advocate for more women being brought into the climate debate. \u201cLike any other vulnerable members of our society, [women] are more impacted by climate change,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s why I think it\u2019s important for women to understand the issues and also to be brought to the table too, to help make policies that are relevant to them as a marginalised group.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
