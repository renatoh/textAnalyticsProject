The Turnbull and Hodgman governments will confirm that 14 pumped hydro sites have been earmarked across the state with a combined potential generation capacity of up to 4,800 megawatts. The projects add to Tasmania\u2019s \u201cbattery of the nation\u201d concept \u2013 a plan to double the state\u2019s renewable energy capacity by developing pumped hydro energy storage, building windfarms and upgrading existing generation assets. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning Under the plan, renewable energy would be exported to the mainland if a planned second interconnector goes ahead. During his visit to Tasmania, the energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, is also expected to unveil support for a windfarm project in the marginal seat of Braddon, which is one of the seats being contested in the so-called \u201csuper Saturday\u201d byelection contests. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, has been campaigning in the seat over the past few days. In April the Turnbull government allocated $2.5m to a feasibility study examining the possible replacement of the Tarraleah power station, and the viability of separate pumped hydro projects, including four adding about 2,500MW hours, which would nearly double the capacity of Tasmania\u2019s hydro system. Pumped hydro storage works by pumping from a lower reservoir into a higher reservoir when energy is cheap and then dropping the water downhill through a turbine to create electricity when energy is expensive and in high demand. Frydenberg said in a statement before Wednesday\u2019s announcement that identifying the optimal sites, \u201calong with the business case study for a second Tasmanian interconnector\u201d, would improve the affordability and reliability of the national electricity market. \u201cThe next step for the 14 high potential sites is a 12-month pre-feasibility assessment, including surveying to the highest available accuracy, modelling of both the market and water resource and identifying environmental, cultural and social impacts,\u201d the energy minister said. Funding to identify the Tasmanian sites was provided through the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. Thirty potential sites were identified, with 14 lake sites classified as high potential. The federal and state governments have also jointly funded the business case for the second interconnector, to the tune of $20m. Economic modelling conducted as part of the \u201cbattery of the nation\u201d proposal suggests it would create up to $5bn in new investment and 3,000 regional jobs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
