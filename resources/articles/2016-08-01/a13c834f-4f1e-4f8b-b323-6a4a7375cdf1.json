The world is changing fast; millions of others found Sir Ian\u2019s penis on their laptop, Kindle or mobile phone. But I still love the elegance of a printed page, so the cricket legend\u2019s john thomas was delivered to me the old-fashioned way. At dawn. Through the letter-box. With a bang. I haven\u2019t finished. When I woke up, I was amazed by what I found all over the mat. (I know I already said it was left on the doorstep, but let\u2019s just assume I get two copies of the Sun on Sunday, and move on to the next paragraph.) Last Sunday, news that Ian Botham does not suffer from erectile dysfunction was splashed across the front of Britain\u2019s cheeriest tabloid. The great sportsman has been having impotence treatment, he \u201cbravely revealed\u201d, but only as a preventative measure. He urged men to throw off pride issues around penile function and confidently seek treatment for impotence \u2013 but not men like himself, because he doesn\u2019t suffer from it. No siree. No Sir-Ian. \u201cI\u2019m a male and men do have problems and you have to front up to them,\u201d said Botham, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t have a problem.\u201d Nevertheless, Ian Botham has been undergoing Vigore Linear Shockwave Therapy. He mentioned this several times, while bravely revealing his total lack of a problem. It doesn\u2019t say he was paid for this, although he does also appear on the website for Vigore Linear Shockwave Therapy saying: \u201cI\u2019m happy to recommend Vigore offered by the Regenerative Medical Group and they will provide a screening first to ensure you are suitable. Please call 0800 999 2662 or email admin@vigore.co.uk for further information.\u201d It\u2019s certainly possible that Sir Ian is doing all this for free, in order to encourage men to have no shame about undergoing such treatment. After all, he is keen to see the end of the embarrassment albatross: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be embarrassed about,\u201d he assured potential patients in his interview. Not that Ian Botham would need to be embarrassed anyway, because, as he quickly clarified: \u201cI didn\u2019t need the treatment.\u201d We would already know that Ian Botham has no trouble in that department if we\u2019d ever seen a photograph of his erect penis on Twitter, which of course we haven\u2019t, because the person who put a photograph of their erect penis on Ian Botham\u2019s Twitter feed with the note \u201cWhat are you thinking..xx\u201d was a hacker. But we trust him. He volunteered to have his privates zapped with shockwaves for no motive other than insurance against the possibility of erectile problems in the future. It may sound grisly but it\u2019s better than using Viagra, argues Sir Ian. Not that he has ever used Viagra himself. (\u201cI have never needed to,\u201d he explains.) Poor men. It seems like they have to have erections all the time these days. Ubiquitous internet porn access shows a relentless gallery of unrealistic women demanding to be satisfied around the clock. The documentary Brought Up On Porn, released on BBC iPlayer last Monday, reveals that one in four new erectile dysfunction patients is under 40, which seems to reflect the anxiety created by technology. Latest news in London is that businessman Bradley Charvet, who is launching the Fellatio Cafe in Geneva this December, now hopes to open a branch in Marylebone. Yes, it is what you think: a cafe where men can receive oral sex while having a coffee. This is an appalling, dangerous and irresponsible idea. We drink far too much coffee already. The prospective cafe\u2019s name is disappointing. \u201cThe Fellatio Cafe\u201d? They\u2019re not even trying. I myself would have called it Cup And Saucy. But even Hot Drinks would have been better. What about Just A Splash, An Extra Shot or Mine\u2019s A Grande? Other possibilities (I have given this some thought) include The Daily Grind, Morning Glory, French Roast, Johnny Come Lattely, Our Coffee Sucks, The Foamy Lip, A Little Bit Of Sugar In Your Bowl, Fluid, The Drip Method, Cup And Balls, Cup This and Starsucks. I\u2019ll leave it with you. Have a nice afternoon. Where was I? Ah yes. I\u2019m sure this ghastly cafe won\u2019t open, though it really is opening in Geneva, but the very idea that a normal man might be expected to perform under such circumstances adds to the general taxing expectations (and the word \u201cperform\u201d itself is a stressful one, which should probably be phased out.) So Ian Botham\u2019s interview in last Sunday\u2019s Sun was not \u201cbrave\u201d at all: it was weedy, unhelpful and wrong. Correctly or incorrectly, people will assume he was paid for his Vigore endorsement and people are pretty media-savvy. They\u2019ll know a company like that would look long and hard (yes, yes) for a celebrity who suffered from erectile dysfunction and the closest they could evidently find is someone who\u2019s careful to state over and over again that he definitely doesn\u2019t. The company could find nobody who would talk openly about it without this tub-thumping proviso. And celebrities will do anything. Therefore the notion that it\u2019s taboo is emphatically reinforced! And it\u2019s reinforced alongside the weird possibility of extra guilt and regret for any impotent men who didn\u2019t have shockwave treatment as a \u201cpreventative measure\u201d. Of course there should be no shame in this sort of thing. The human body is a beautiful, complicated, interesting ecosystem; glitches happen. Impotence causes such terrible sadness, loneliness and frustration, it\u2019s a proper wide-scale tragedy that thoughts of ignominy and humiliation prevent anyone from either seeking help or living a proud and happy life regardless. That Ian Botham would despise the idea of anyone thinking he has \u201ca problem\u201d, yet agree to be the man who talks publicly about impotence anyway \u2026 if there is shame in anything, it\u2019s that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
