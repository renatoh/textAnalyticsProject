As the economic downturn begins to bite, media owners are accepting the inevitable and closing channels that have seldom scored more than zero in the ratings. Two weeks ago Carlton bit the bullet by announcing the closure of its joint venture with Sainsbury's Taste and the transfer of its star turn, Anthea Turner, to sister service The Food Network, which is also under review. Granada's venture with Boots the chemist, the Wellbeing channel, is also languishing and around 80 jobs are to be axed. Former 60s pop crooner Adam Faith doesn't believe the public is ready for channels based on niche interest groups. Faith founded The Money Channel, a personal finance channel, in 1999 but it collapsed in May this year, followed closely by the Angela Rippon fronted Simply Money. Faith said: \"Although there are now over 6m digital subscribers out there, it's very hard to attract them to your channel. The public doesn't have the appetite for television it had in the old days.\" He believed the biggest problem for The Money Channel and others of its ilk was a lack of distinction among a rash of similar channels. \"We ended up being a poor man's CNBC,\" Faith said. \"If you're offering a niche service it still needs to be unique and attractive to viewers.\" While the dawn of the digital age, and its added capacity, brought the costs of launching a channel down considerably, the boom did as much harm as good, according to Faith. \"The focus of all of these channels has very much been on the technology and on formats. What people are forgetting is that you still need the eyeballs.\" With many smaller digital channels still registering fewer than 2,000 viewers, thus earning them a big fat zero as far as Barb ratings are concerned, the battle for the right kind of viewers is paramount. \"Unless you've got a huge marketing budget or a sugar daddy prepared to bankroll the early years, any independent channel is going to struggle and ultimately close,\" said Faith. He also laid the blame at the door of the advertisers, which he claimed had been slow to catch on to the benefits of a targeted niche audience. \"Agencies will eventually come around to the fact that these channels can deliver a highly targeted audience with less wastage,\" says Faith, but, recalling his days as a launch director on Melody Radio, believed it would take a number of years for the medium to establish itself. The only way for specialist channels to survive in the interim, Faith believes, is to have some sort of interactive shopping element. He singled out TV Travel Shop and QVC as examples of channels that could drive revenues through direct sales as well as advertising. \"Ultimately, when the interactive technology is better, people will feel more comfortable buying through their TVs and these channels will become like virtual Yellow Pages,\" he predicted. Faith's biggest bugbear from his Money Channel experience was that he felt the channel, and others like it, were being strangled by overzealous management rather than given the freedom to exploit the medium fully. \"It's going to be a very long haul and you have to take a long-term view. I think we're now entering a new phase where digital television is reaching the mass market and people are learning form the mistakes of the early pioneers. \"But it's going to take a lot of time, money and patience to establish an audience for any of these channels.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
