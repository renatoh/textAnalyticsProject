Despite his campaign attracting a large amount of coverage, it was revealed this week that carpetbagger Andrew Muir was roundly beaten in this year's election of directors. He had hoped to win a seat on the society's board as part of his campaign to try to persuade the society to convert to a bank and pay windfalls he claims could average between \u00a3700 and \u00a31,000. But the society's members gave him, and his windfalls manifesto, the thumbs-down. Mr Muir's poor showing in the ballot prompted Carpetbagger.com - the website that acts as a rallying point for those seeking to force societies to demutualise - to declare that carpetbagging as we know it \"is dead\". Carpetbagger.com says it is now changing tack and will be focusing its attention on other issues. Mr Muir, a recruitment firm boss from Slough, Berkshire, submitted a conversion resolution to the society earlier this year. \"This may be your only chance to claim a windfall that is rightfully yours,\" he had claimed on his website, nationwidewindfalls.com. But the society rejected his resolution as invalid. He then decided to stand for election to the board, but while the four existing directors seeking re-election all polled at least 1.2m votes, Mr Muir only managed to rustle up 468,701 votes. This is substantially fewer than he polled when he stood unsuccessfully for the board in 1998, while all the existing directors saw increases in their votes. Some commentators were surprised at just how badly Mr Muir did, bearing in mind that while it can be difficult to motivate members who support the society's stance to get out and vote, all the carpetbagger members will presumably have put their mark next to Mr Muir's name without hesitation, and sent their form back, considering this was their only chance to make their feelings known this year. If Mr Muir had got on to the board, this wouldn't of course have meant that Nationwide would then demutualise, but it would have sent a strong signal to the society's bosses that a sizeable chunk of the membership were unhappy with how things are and wanted it to convert. Also contesting this year's election was Alan Debenham, a long-standing pro-mutual member from Somerset who was demanding improvements to \"membership democracy\" and was concerned in particular about the levels of directors' pay. He polled 427,758 votes. Following the vote result, Richard Yendall of Carpetbagger.com said his site would no longer be submitting conversion resolutions to building societies. \"In this respect, 'carpetbagging' is dead. Windfalls may still materialise but I am resigned to the fact that any such move must be initiated by the board of directors.\" Some Nationwide members living in hope of a windfall were cheered by the news that the society's chief executive Brian Davis - dubbed Mr Mutuality - is retiring later this year. But the man replacing him, Philip Williamson, was quick to stress that he is firmly committed to Nationwide staying a mutual, saying: \"There will be no fundamental change in our strategic direction from me.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
