Stutters, more like, although that is too cruel. Poodles, perhaps, or its near relative, pootles. One should, after all, be kind to the train for it - or at least the steam engine - is unfathomably old. It is an ancient relic built in the late 19th century that has miraculously survived into the 21st thanks largely to the fact that until a few years ago no one ever thought of closing it. Now, recently blessed with Unesco World Heritage status, the line's future seems assured. One also has to be gentle on the train because it is ridiculously small. They call it the toy train and the description is accurate. For those who know anything about trains, the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway is a 2ft gauge, less than half the normal width between the rails, and consequently the carriages are small, a squeeze for any westerner with a broader than average beam. The locomotives are painted blue, just the same colour as Thomas the Tank Engine, and the resemblance does not end there: the engines teem with life, giving them a personality. Each one, as it chugs up the hill, has a team of half a dozen men perched on every protruding part - as well as the driver and the fireman, there are two sanders on the front buffers ready to sprinkle grit where the track has worn too smooth for good adhesion. There is also a man to operate the switchbacks and, on top of the coal bunker, a coal wallah, whose job is to break up the lumps for the furnace and hand them down to the fireman. With so many people sitting precariously on the engine, it is hardly surprising that the maximum speed is just 15mph and even this is rarely reached once the train leaves the plain. The railway is a vertical Victorian folly, a testimony to British engineering skills and imperial madness. It was built in 1879-81 by the Darjeeling Steam Tramway Company in response to the need for improved transport links to Darjeeling which was beginning to be recognised as a key tea plantation area and booming hill station for those escaping the Calcutta heat. The only connection to the plain was the old Hill Cart Road, still the only route for trucks, and the journey by tonga , the light two-wheel carts, was tortuous. But this was not exactly good railway territory. The expression \"hill\" is only used because of the contrast with the huge Himalayan mountains that seem to pop out of the sky when the mist disappears in Darjeeling but by any other reckoning, these are serious mountains, requiring an ascent of 7,000ft in 50 miles. The engineers avoided expensive tunnelling and, instead, hit upon a series of ingenious solutions that make travelling up the railway a unique experience. First, there are reverses. Where the hill is simply too narrow to accommodate a bend, the train chugs into a siding, the points are changed by one of the team sitting on the engine and the train then reverses up the next section. There are half a dozen of these switchbacks on the steepest parts of the hill which offer passengers the chance to jump off for a quick snap. Indeed, the whole journey is a bit like that. You can hardly get left behind since even the moderately fit could soon chase it down, so people get on and off all the time to stretch their legs or trigger their shutter buttons. The other wonderful eccentricities are the loops where the train goes round 360 degrees in order to gain height, like taking a deep breath before braving the steep incline up the side of the hill again. Because the gauge is so small and the speed so slow, the bends are very tight, and frequently you look out of the window at a sheer drop of several hundred metres down the hill. Accidents on the railway are rare, they tell you reassuringly, and at least there are no red lights to go through since there is absolutely no signalling. The trains meet each other at prearranged points where, briefly, the track is doubled. But, in truth, as the trains pootle up and down the hill so slowly but so noisily, there is no chance of a head-on crash. The topography of the railway has changed over the years as bits have been washed away in the monsoons and various reverses have been replaced or resited. Also, the railway was closed for 18 months when there were political troubles in the late 1980s as the dominant local Nepalese population fought for a measure of independence for the hills, which they duly won. It was a miracle that the line was reopened at the time as it is a heavy loss-maker and, having become part of Indian Railways at independence in 1948, it is dependent on an administration which really cannot be bothered with toy railways when there are 12 million people travelling on the main system every day. Because the journey is so slow, the train allows you to study the gradual changes in the environment as it first traverses the plain and then starts to go up the hill. The train starts at New Jalpaiguri (NJP) next to the main line station where the Darjeeling Mail, the overnight train from Calcutta, arrives in the morning. The first few miles are little different from countless other Indian rail journeys as the line passes through Siliguri, a sprawling town that has grown up because it is a junction. At Sukna, an hour out of NJP, the train starts to climb and the track, rather cruelly exposed in the hot plain, soon becomes shrouded in thick cooling forest. Although the steam engines are indeed like slightly oversize toys, they come into their own as they start to drag the little carriages up the hill, making the same wonderful noise as their big brothers and sisters did on Britain's railways 35 years ago and, indeed, on many of India's main lines until the late 1990s. By the time you reach Tindharia, nearly 3,000ft above sea level, the forest is thinning out and the views start to reflect the scale of the place. Soon after, the train reaches the best part, Agony Point, where the line seems to be playing a joke as it drags towards the precipice, just avoiding it with a bend so tight that in Britain it would have long ago been banned by the inspectors from the Health and Safety Executive. Kurseong, nearly a mile up, is the most significant town on the line and you pass so close to the stalls that shoplifting the green but tasty oranges out of the window is a temptation. By now the countryside is barren, at times even rocky and stark, but peppered with Buddhist monasteries and schools filled with smartly-dressed children in uniform. The train reaches its maximum height at the small town of Ghum before descending slightly into Darjeeling. It is the triumph of man and machine over nature that attracts steam enthusiasts from over the world to travel on the railway. I was travelling with a group of eccentrics from the Friends of the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway, an organisation formed in 1995 to support the railway in its endeavour to survive and flourish. But there is a downside to running a railway with century-old steam engines. They are unreliable and have a constant need for water, which is in short supply on the hill. This is one of the reasons why it takes eight or nine hours just to cover the 50 or so miles up to Darjeeling. The special train that took the Friends up the hill for the World Heritage celebrations took a staggering 17 hours. While the Friends were happy enough to take the slow train, the problem for the railway is that it needs to attract tourists to ensure its survival. Apart from the obsessives, how many people will put up with what must be the slowest rail journey in the world, even though it is also stunningly beautiful and amazingly cheap - just 20 rupees (30p) for the whole trip? Although the Indian Railways minister promised \u00a31m for investment at the inaugural celebrations, that will go mainly to replacing the worn-out track and repairing the locomotives, which, with each spare part needing to be engineered, is a financial bottomless pit. Given the tiny revenue from the fare box, and the fact that the railway employs 850 people, there will always be a need for massive subsidy. But that will be a good investment for the local economy if the railway can expand its appeal beyond the enthusiasts' market. Darjeeling is somewhat on its uppers, having had its heyday during the Raj and now finding itself having to compete for tourists with many other parts of Asia. The tea plantations are now run by Indians and the expats have largely left, which has reduced the number of Western visitors. Nevertheless, it does have several attractions to make the journey worthwhile. There is the sight of Kanchenjunga, the world's third highest mountain, which on a good day pops up as the train approaches the end station and which seems to stretch up improbably from the valley below, completely out of scale with the surrounding hills. Then there is the zoo which is mostly, like all zoos, quite sad except for the breeding colony where both red pandas and, most wonderfully, the snow leopards seem to flourish. There is the attraction of a couple of luxury hotels - the rather brash, refurbished New Elgin and the stately Windamere. The latter is set out on top of the hill rather like a Scottish laird's summer residence and offers a relatively cheap (\u00a360 a night full board including porridge for breakfast, unfortunately served with watery buffalo's milk) respite from the cold climate and the sheer exhaustion of travel in India. Darjeeling is cold, even in summer, and often shrouded in mist. On all four days of my stay, I rose at dawn to try to see the sun rising over the Himalayas, the most famous tourist attraction, but every day the mountains stayed hidden. Darjeeling needs the railway to make it special. The trick would be to speed up the journey, a difficult task given the age of the locomotives, or to offer special tourist trains which might stop off halfway up where, at the moment, there are only spartan local hotels. There is already a daily special train from Darjeeling down to Ghum costing a staggering 200 rupees (\u00a33) in specially refurbished coaches, but in reality that is a synthetic little trip compared with taking the normal train up the full length. The slow way up the hill is a very Indian experience. You may end up hungry, cold and splattered with soot, but the journey will have been an adventure, tinged with uncertainty about the ability of the train to drag itself up the hill. Staying on the narrow Glacier Express St Moritz to Zermatt Full-day journey across three mountain passes in the Alps. Trains are modern with panoramic windows. Other similar lines close by. The Brocken Wernigerode to The Brocken, Germany. On the former border between East and West in the Harz Mountains. Steam-hauled to the summit for superb views. Before reunification, it was closed as it was in a militarily-sensitive area. Vivarais Railway Tournon to Lamastre, Central France Steam-hauled from the Rhone Valley into the Massif Central. The journey takes two hours each way but most passengers make a day of it and combine the trip with lunch in Lamastre. Cumbres and Toltec Railroad Chama (New Mexico) to Antonito (Colorado), US Sixty-four miles of genuine Western railroading. This steam-hauled line makes the highest crossing of the Rockies at 10,015ft at the Cumbres Pass. White Pass and Yukon Railroad Skagway (Alaska, US) to Fraser (Yukon, Canada) Relive the days of the Gold Rush and follow the route the early prospectors took through the mountains from the coast. Most trains are pulled by diesel locos. Apple Express Port Elizabeth to Thornhill, South Africa \"Two foot\" gauge with a difference. This scenic line is the only section of an extensive network that still has passenger services. There is still a lot of heavy freight on the line that sets it apart from most other lines of this size which are now run purely as tourist railways. Puffing Billy Railway Belgrave to Gembrook, near Melbourne, Australia Probably the most famous steam tourist railway in Australia, this picturesque line is easily reached by a regular suburban service from Melbourne city centre. Tranz Alpine Railway Christchurch to Greymouth, New Zealand This line only comes into the narrow gauge family because all railways in New Zealand are narrow gauge. Even so, it is well worth a visit because it goes through such stunning scenery from east to west coasts on South Island. Way to go New Jalpaiguri is reached by overnight air-conditioned sleeper from Calcutta for \u00a39 . Air India flies from Heathrow to Calcutta (present fare \u00a3528 return booked through Travelbag 0870 7377820), BA (0845 7733377) offers \u00a3470 + \u00a339.40 taxes. You can fly into Bagdogra airport, near Siliguri from either Delhi or Calcutta.
