Instead, this Liverpool group were acclaimed as wildly eclectic, their 2004 debut album selling an astounding 600,000 copies. Produced by Stephen Street, the second album is much easier on the ear than its unvarnished predecessor. The stylistic palette has moved on to 1972 (imagine early Roxy Music without Ferry or Eno); the drums have punch, the instrumental textures a rounded warmth, and the band work hard to accentuate the songs with telling detail and ear-catching hooks. The songs certainly need that kind of loving care. Midway between Robbie Williams' megaphone confessionals and the oddball insinuations of the Beautiful South's Paul Heaton, David McCabe sounds a troubled soul, expressing frustration and dyspepsia in cleverly written kitchen-sink fantasies. Such is his morose, vehemently cheesed-off singing style, however, that you could be forgiven for overlooking a mordant wit that can rhyme \"language\" and \"sandwich\" in the hangover anthem It's the Little Things We Do. So this party-pooper is fortunate to be surrounded by party-people to energise, dramatise, in short popularise his sour lucubrations, in fulfilment of Pet Shop Boy Neil Tennant's dictum about the best pop making you feel happy feeling sad. Each of the 11 songs that make up this old-fashioned 40-minute album boasts memorable and seductive little bits - Someone Watching Over Me's slide guitar outro, Valerie's Roy Wood-style brass break, the game (if still L-plate) saxophone honking of Abi Harding. If any single factor can account for the Zutons' phenomenal popularity, it is her; every band should have that little bit extra."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
