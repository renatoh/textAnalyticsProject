The Public Health (Covid-19 Restrictions on Gathering and Movement) Order 2020, which came into effect on Tuesday, has a 90-day sunset clause. The legislation also provides for the order to be revoked sooner if authorities deem it safe. The order, however, can also be extended, or a new order imposed, if the threat of Covid-19 transmission remains. Mick Fuller\u2019s comments on Thursday are the strongest indication yet that NSW will go the full distance of the legislated 90-day lockdown period. They follow the federal government reducing the allowable size of public gathering to just two people (who don\u2019t live together), which has come down from 500 to 100, and then 10 over a little more than a fortnight. Fuller said the rules would remain in place for 90 days, but, he hoped, not a day beyond. \u201cI certainly won\u2019t be seeking an extension \u2013 people will have gotten the message by then, hopefully,\u201d he said. The commissioner conceded there was public confusion about what was permitted and what was prohibited. He urged people who were unsure about the rules to act as if they had Covid-19 and stay home in isolation. \u201cA good rule of thumb is that if you are questioning whether you should be doing something, it is best to give it a miss,\u201d he said. \u201cThe safest place is at home in isolation.\u201d The NSW order makes it unlawful for any person in the state to leave their place of residence unless it\u2019s for an essential purpose \u2013 shopping for essentials, exercising, medical or compassionate care, and working or studying that cannot be done from home. The government gazette lists 16 \u201creasonable excuses\u201d for a person to be outside their home. Leaving home without a reasonable excuse can now attract an $11,000 fine, or six month\u2019s jail. NSW\u2019s 90-day lockdown is the longest state-mandated movement restriction. It appears draconian next to Victoria\u2019s 14-day stay at home directions under the Public Health and Wellbeing Act. But Victoria\u2019s restrictions \u2013 escalated to \u201cStage 3\u201d on Tuesday \u2013 are designed to be regularly reviewed and extended. \u201cIt is highly likely, that they will be further extended beyond that [April 13 date],\u201d the premier, Daniel Andrews has warned the Victorian public of the social distancing measures currently in force in the state. Andrews said widespread adherence to Stage 3 restrictions would delay, and possibly obviate, the need for Stage 4 and 5 lockdowns. Queensland\u2019s home confinement direction is in place \u201cuntil the end of the declared public health emergency, unless they are revoked or replaced\u201d. It outlines eight essential reasons people are allowed to leave their homes. Tasmania\u2019s movement restrictions have been imposed for four weeks, from Monday. The only lawful excuses for leaving home are buying essential supplies, going to school or work, to exercise, or to check on neighbours or elderly relatives. The rules, Premier Peter Gutwein has argued, are intended to avoid a \u201cfull lockdown\u201d where no movement is permitted. The Northern Territory has not gone into lockdown, although the territory\u2019s borders are closed to travellers and some internal movement restrictions apply. Chief Minister Michael Gunner has urged all Territorians to stay home \u201cif you can\u201d. \u201cWhen you\u2019re out in public, around a lot of other people, you\u2019re rolling the dice on your health and your family\u2019s health,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of rolling the dice choose the safest bet, stay home if you can.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
