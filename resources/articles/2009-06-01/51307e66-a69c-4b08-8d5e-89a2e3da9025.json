The truth of this became all too clear to me when I undertook the foolhardy challenge of visiting as many of Britain's biggest festival's 50-odd arenas as I could in four hours. It was a tough gig, with 900 acres to cover and upwards of 175,000 people milling around. And my ultimate reward? A halloumi sandwich and a few minutes of Neil Young. As I hurried to cover the central stages, I seemed to be constantly out of sync, first at the beautiful Bandstand Stage, then at The Queen's Head, where Scroobius Pip and Dan Le Sac's sampled bass was so heavy it made the water in the puddles outside the marquee jump. I ticked off eight more stages as I trudged through the mud, including the Jewish Tent (conveniently located next to the Hare Krishna tent) and Slippery Dick's Love Shack, where a cocktail-fuelled crowd skanked to classic ska. At Strummerville Camp, the spirit of the former Clash singer was being celebrated round the campfire to an acoustic punk soundtrack. Next, the festival badlands \u2013 the Shangri-La and Trash City fields \u2013 where tutus and facial tattoos were standard. In Slumberave Hotel, revellers lounged on beds as a woman dressed as the robot from Metropolis danced to DJ Charlie McFarley. Out in Glastonbury's nether regions, I stumbled across incredible things watched by incredibly few people. Myself and a steward in a pink bib were the sole witnesses to a dinner-jacketed Frenchman miming to Afropop in the Cabaret field; while only six of us made it through to the end of a 15-minute poem about feral wolf children in The AstroGlabe tent. At the Mandela Stage, a fixed tandem bicycle was powering the PA for the gentlest folk band imaginable. I was nearly defeated by the climb up to the Park Stage, having already walked five miles and clocked up 35 stages. But Dance Village provided an unexpected bonus with six areas all bleeding into a single throb. A shimmy past The Dirty Boots Stage and The Guardian Lounge and I was home, just as Neil Young clunked into action. Never had burned halloumi tasted sweeter."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
