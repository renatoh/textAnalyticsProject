Beckett, a former foreign secretary who is campaigning for a second referendum, said she thought the Labour leader was open to the idea but some of his closest advisers were preventing him from budging and would be prepared to allow a no-deal Brexit. \u201cI don\u2019t get the impression that Jeremy himself is the stumbling block,\u201d she told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme. \u201cThere are people very close with great influence on him who are passionately opposed to it \u2026 and he wants to keep the party together as much as possible. \u201cUnfortunately, it\u2019s looking more and more that some of the people who he wants to accept the majority view are not just expressing reservations but completely oppose, and I\u2019m beginning to think some of them do actually want Britain to leave no matter what and they don\u2019t give a toss.\u201d Corbyn\u2019s spokesman rejected that idea. \u201cReaching back into political history, I think we\u2019re all familiar with the trope about good kings and their bad advisers\u201d, he said. But he added: \u201cThe idea that Jeremy doesn\u2019t make his own decisions is laughable.\u201d The spokesman said Corbyn was continuing to consult with trade unions and members of Labour\u2019s national executive committee about the party\u2019s Brexit policy. \u201cJeremy is trying to make sure that there is wide consultation in the Labour movement. That includes the affiliated trades unions who have 49% of the vote at Labour party conference, and they are a vital part of our party. \u201cIt\u2019s a consultation to try and find a position that the party can unite around.\u201d He said that process would be completed \u201cin the next few weeks\u201d. He said there was already a consensus over avoiding a no-deal Brexit and over the shift towards advocating a public vote on any deal, as announced by Corbyn after last month\u2019s European elections. But he added that there was still no agreement about what could be on the ballot paper in any referendum Labour might support, and whether the party would now commit to campaign for remain. He added that a referendum was \u201cnot the only part of our policy on Brexit. We want to see a general election. We want to see a public vote on any deal. Our alternative compromise plan is still on the table.\u201d Beckett declined to say which advisers and Labour figures she was talking about. Shadow cabinet ministers had been expecting Labour\u2019s position to move to full backing for a remain position in a second referendum at a meeting on Tuesday. But Corbyn is understood to have told shadow cabinet ministers there would be further consultation with unions and a decision on the next step in the coming weeks, to the frustration of several present including the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell. Sources in the room said McDonnell had said he was \u201cunder the impression we were making the decision today\u201d on how to advance Labour\u2019s position. The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, also questioned why a decision was not being taken and said it was \u201cabout showing leadership\u201d. \u201cBasically, Unite stepped in yesterday and put the brakes on,\u201d one shadow cabinet source said. McDonnell \u201cis obviously trying to push us forward but Loto [the leader\u2019s team] are pushing back\u201d. Speaking at a car industry conference on Tuesday, McDonnell was asked directly whether the Labour party was campaigning for a second referendum. \u201cWell, I\u2019m arguing the case,\u201d he replied. \u201cThe discussion we are having in the Labour party now, and it is no secret, is what would our attitude be if there is a referendum? \u201cI\u2019ve said personally I\u2019d vote for remain. I campaigned for remain because I can\u2019t see anything better than what we have got at the moment. I can see the consequences in terms of jobs and living standards.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
