Fry and co-star John Bird reprise their roles as Machiavellian spin doctors who run the blue-chip PR agency Prentiss McCabe. The BBC is hoping that Absolute Power should do for PR what Drop the Dead Donkey did for the newsroom. And if that's not enough, Fry makes his directorial debut with Bright Young Things, adapted from Evelyn Waugh's satirical novel, Vile Bodies. As Fry observes, 'It's a period film shot with modern pace and cinematography. It deals with fame, sexual scandal, greed, nightclubbing and the frantic glamour of youth.' The film has a glittering cast including Emily Mortimer, Dan Aykroyd, Stockard Channing and Peter O'Toole. Although the film is stunning to look at, with virtually note-perfect performances, it can be hard to care about the butterfly lives of the idle rich. Likely to be a monster hit - but is it just Notting Hill for flappers? LH \u00b7 Bright Young Things is released on 3 Oct; Absolute Power starts in late Nov 12 Theatre Philip Pullman Nicholas Hytner's National Theatre will take one of its boldest leaps later this year, with the staging of Philip Pullman's trilogy, adapted by Nicholas Wright as two complete plays which audiences will see together on one day, or separately. Hytner, who directs, thinks of His Dark Materials as 'the defining epic' of the era, one that 'invents a new mythology for a secular age' - and in doing so, presents a challenge to which the National must respond. It promises to do so spectacularly. After the 'aesthetic austerity' of his \u00a310 season at the theatre, Hytner wants the company to spread its wings: to use the resources that only the National has, and use them at full stretch. Aiming to involve the audience in 'an imaginative conspiracy', he's planning 'a series of very beautiful images' - created by a mixture of traditional and new theatre crafts, a juxtaposition of the epic and the intimate - intended for teenagers (and older) rather than for young children. A cast of 30 will include Anna Maxwell Martin as Lyra, Patricia Hodge as Mrs Coulter and Timothy Dalton as Lord Asriel. The daimons will be represented by a particular kind of puppet devised by the puppet-maker Michael Curry, who has worked with Julie Taymor. The big drum revolve of the Olivier will be 'dusted off', allowing the action to spring out and up and over and round the stage; video will be used, sparingly, as the action cuts between different worlds; there will be music by Jonathan Dove 'though no one's going to be bursting into song'. Pullman enthusiastically collaborated with the adaptation, even when whole swathes of plot had to be cut. The stage will get there before the movies: Tom Stoppard is writing the screenplay. Meanwhile, Pullman's new book, Lyra's Oxford will appear in November. SC \u00b7 Olivier, London SE1 from 4 Dec 13 Pop Indie Anniversaries There aren't many independent record labels left. All the more reason to treasure two of the best, celebrating their birthdays this autumn. Rough Trade, arguably the world's best-loved indie and home of The Smiths, The Fall, Aztec Camera, Mazzy Star, The Strokes and now Belle &amp; Sebastian, turns 25. Meanwhile, Domino Records (Pavement, Will Oldham, Elliott Smith, Four Tet, Franz Ferdinand) marks 10 years as a home of left-field music. The Rough Trade festivities have been scaled down, but there is an album, Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before (released on 6 October), of current RT bands covering classic RT bands' songs; Domino, meanwhile, unleash Worlds of Possibility, a month-long series of gigs, films and exhibitions at the ICA (www.ica.org.uk) and other venues around London (4-27 Oct) and a 36-track double CD compilation. KE 14 Dance Scottish Ballet After agonies of argument and confusion, Scottish Ballet is about to be reborn. Ever since the death of its founder, Peter Darrell, in 1987, the company has been in search of a role. Should it tour Swan Lake to the Highlands and Islands or leave the classics to better-funded foreign companies? With Ashley Page as its new director, the re-formed company has gone for a radical option. For his inaugural season, Page has secured favourite works by three acclaimed contemporary dance choreographers, Stephen Petronio, Siobhan Davies and Richard Alston. He's included his own Cheating, Lying, Stealing , made for the Royal Ballet in 1998. JP \u00b7 Season starts at the Edinburgh Festival Theatre, 25-27 Sept, before touring 15 Art Turner Prize 2003 After the highs of the mid-Nineties, the Turner Prize had become enervated. The 2001 prize, when Martin Creed won and Madonna said 'Fuck', was a self-hating circus. Last year's event was barely enlivened by Kim Howells's comment that it was 'cold, calculated, mechanical bullshit'. The prize had fulfilled its promise to bring art to a wider audience, but had acquired a hollow, formulaic ring. Now, in its twentieth year, it has perked up. There's Grayson Perry, the ceramicist who has maintained one Turner tradition: the tabloid story. His pots derive more from Penelope Leach than Bernard Leach. Weirdly, the Prize has eluded the Chapman Brothers so far. They're bound to liven things up with their daubed Goya prints - will they encounter any counter-iconoclasm? Anya Gallacio is a strong choice for her installation pieces of organic material, although her Tate Britain show stopped short of being her greatest leap forward. And finally, there's film and photographic artist Willie Doherty on his second bash at the Turner: he was first up for it nine years ago. 2003: the year the buzz came back. OB \u00b7 Tate Britain, London SW1 (020 7887 8000), 29 Oct-18 Jan 2004 16 Books Helen Fielding 8.15am. Hurrah! The Wilderness Years are over! Today is day when new Helen Fielding novel arrives in shops. Has been four long years since the last one. Must get up immediately and head for Waterstone's. 8.20am. Just thinking about Bridget Jones. Really love her. Kind, funny, a bit bonkers. Like me! Also, likes a drink and a fag. Wish I could write bestseller like Helen Fielding and make millions of pounds and go and live in Hollywood. But will never happen while I lie here in fleecy pyjamas staring at alarming stain on bedroom ceiling. 8.25am. New book is called Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination . Is about a girl spy who can swing from helicopters while still clutching on to Prada bag. Sounds v. exciting. According to Sunday newspaper, Fielding was paid a six-figure sum for it. Grrr. Think how many mini-breaks that would buy! 8.30am. Will get up in a moment. Just thinking what to wear. Bookshops often full of attractive and clever men. Must remember to hide Olivia Joules under something by W.G. Sebald at cash till just in case. But if still singleton at end of shopping trip, can devour book at one sitting while eating chocolate croissants! RC \u00b7 Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination will be published by Picador in November 17 Film Love Actually It would be easy to get all high-minded and sniffy about this directorial debut from Richard Curtis, writer of Four Weddings and a Funeral and Notting Hill, but it would also be wrong. It's winter, it's cold and we'll all need a bit of incredibly skilful rom com. The film tells the intertwining stories of a vast range of characters, played by such luminaries as Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman, Colin Firth, and of course Hugh Grant, whose love interest is Martine McCutcheon. It got a terrific reception at the Toronto Film Festival and should push all the right buttons. DO'C \u00b7 Love Actually is released on 21 Nov 18 Books Joan Bakewell Joan Bakewell's autobiography Middle of the Bed will not be middle of the road. It promises to be an acute, undefended self-portrait of the woman whose television appearances inspired the phrase 'thinking man's crumpet'. But it will be hard to resist the temptation of turning straight to Pinter in the index. It was the seven-year love affair with Bakewell that inspired Pinter's masterpiece Betrayal (about to transfer to the West End in a Peter Hall production). Hall, incidentally, is a player in Bakewell's book - along with Michael Frayn, Mark Boxer and Jonathan Miller. Bakewell also writes about her most painful relationship - with her mother. KK \u00b7 Middle of the Bed is published on 13 Oct, Hodder &amp; Stoughton, \u00a320 19 Opera Aida Despite a new Orlando starring the mezzo of the moment, Alice Coote, and its first-ever Sondheim in the shape of Sweeney Todd, Covent Garden's fastest-selling autumn ticket is a new production of Verdi's Aida marking the operatic debut of cult theatre director Robert Wilson. Launched last year at Brussels' La Monnaie, whence also came its conductor Antonio Pappano, Wilson's production promises to strip this grandiose work down to its bare essentials. 'Gripping' and 'affecting' was the verdict of one Brussels critic, as the opera's 'core elements of emotional conflict and ethical choices' were conveyed via 'hieratic poses and hand gestures' derived from ancient Egyptian art. AH \u00b7 Royal Opera House, London WC2, from 8 Nov 20 Theatre Neil LaBute It's not easy to think of 'mercy' and Neil LaBute in the same breath: his plays show human beings in hard places, behaving badly, without hope. The latest LaBute, The Mercy Seat , is informed by what director Michael Attenborough describes as the dramatist's 'harsh glare on relationships'. On the day after 9/11, in an apartment overlooking Ground Zero, a man and a woman engaged in an adulterous liaison consider the idea that this catastrophe could be an opportunity for them, a chance to disappear and start a new life together. Sinead Cusack will take the part played by Sigourney Weaver in New York; John Hannah will be her younger lover. Meanwhile, the movie of LaBute's The Shape of Things, directed by the playwright, with the same cast that appeared when the play premiered at the Almeida, is released on 28 November.
