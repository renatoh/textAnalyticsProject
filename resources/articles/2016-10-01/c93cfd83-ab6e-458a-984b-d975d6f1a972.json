Neither did a number of the other women I called who had crossed paths with Donald Trump. But few of them had documented their encounters as thoroughly as Harth, whose 1997 lawsuit alleging attempted rape against Trump is a matter of public record. Harth had kept quiet for almost 20 years. But a few months after my call, her lawyer got in touch. The impetus, as Harth put it in an emotional hour-long interview at the Guardian\u2019s New York office in July, was Trump\u2019s repeated insistence that any woman alleging misbehavior on his part was lying. Trump is still calling Harth and many others liars, even as the number of women accusing him of sexual misconduct has risen into the double digits. Long before crass tapes of Trump boasting about sexual groping entered the picture \u2013 and Harth\u2019s story suddenly became front-page news \u2013 the Guardian was the rare publication that took Harth\u2019s story seriously. We were the first to publish her account last July, even as other outlets dismissed stories like it as too frivolous or implausible. We also published the accounts of fat-shamed beauty queen Alicia Machado and legally bullied Sheena Monnin, well before Trump\u2019s mistreatment of women became the defining story of the presidential election. Harth, who charged Trump with sexually assaulting her in one of his children\u2019s bedrooms at his Mar-a-Lago estate in 1993, didn\u2019t come to the Guardian by chance. She came to me because she knew the Guardian was committed to telling her story; and she sensed I had the time, flexibility and resources I needed to tell it. She was right. When Trump clinched the nomination last spring, my editors asked me to dig deeply into Trump\u2019s long history of misogyny, and gave me the support I needed to do so. But the Guardian\u2019s commitment to this kind of in-depth reporting is time consuming and expensive. That\u2019s why I\u2019m writing to ask for your support by making a contribution or becoming a member. The business model for investigative journalism is broken. As comedian John Oliver explained recently in this brilliant segment, nobody in journalism has figured out a sustainable formula for making money on the internet. Online ads generate a tiny fraction of the revenue that print ads once did \u2013 and news publications like the Guardian are competing with tech giants Google and Facebook for digital advertising revenue. From Bill Cosby to Roger Ailes to Donald Trump, this election year may go down as the moment our country finally started taking sexual assault seriously. These stories found an audience because of the brave women who told them, but also because of the journalists and the editors who listened first. We did that at the Guardian, and now we hope you\u2019ll listen back.
