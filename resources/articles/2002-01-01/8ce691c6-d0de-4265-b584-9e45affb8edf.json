The West Ham manager confirmed he will look to sign a forward if, as expected, Di Canio moves to Old Trafford - and Milosevic, who plays for Parma, seems a prime target. Roeder was evasive when asked if he was interested in signing Milosevic. \"Not at this stage,\" he said, before referring to the Yugoslav approvingly. \"He was a good player at Villa - one in three, I think.\" That reference to Milosevic's Premiership goalscoring ratio - he hit 29 goals in 90 games - smacked of a manager who had done his homework. Milosevic recently turned down a move to Blackburn, choosing to stay at Parma under their new coach Pietro Carmignani after losing his place in the previous regime of Daniel Passarella. Roeder may hope the lure of London will induce the 28-year-old to return to England. Although he insisted there had been no formal approach from United for Di Canio, he made it clear he would not prevent the Italian leaving and also spoke highly of Dwight Yorke, who is available for transfer at Old Trafford. \"I have always really enjoyed watching Dwight Yorke play, whatever club he's been at,\" Roeder said. \"Dwight's a star turn.\" At \u00a38m he looks out of West Ham's reach although Roeder could suggest a part-exchange deal involving Di Canio. Roeder said that, regardless of Di Canio's future, he hopes to bring in three players this month, up to two on loan. \"All this uncertainty is not good,\" he said ruefully. \"I hope it will be laid to rest, one way or another, by the middle of next week.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
