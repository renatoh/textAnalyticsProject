The morning before \u2013 as on most other days \u2013 she had gone enthusiastically into Kabul University where she had been studying public administration and policy. At least 35 people were killed in Monday\u2019s attack on Afghanistan\u2019s most prestigious university. Dozens more were injured; many are fighting for their lives in the hospitals of the Afghan capital, relatives waiting outside intensive care units, wrapped in blankets against the cold of the night. Three gunmen stormed the university\u2019s gated campus in west Kabul on Monday morning, throwing grenades and riddling classrooms with bullets. Dozens of students jumped out of the upper-storey windows, fleeing for their lives. The attack, claimed by Islamic State, lasted for six hours and was countered by Afghan forces and US commandos. A convoy of Humvees only left the university\u2019s premises at dusk when the three attackers had been killed. Throughout the afternoon, sustained gunfire could be heard and several loud explosions had people running for cover. While Marziah\u2019s family recited Qu\u2019ran verses over the freshly dug grave decorated with red flowers and rose petals, some crying silently, others loudly, less than a kilometre away in the devastated university building the smell of blood and smoke lingers. The floors are covered in bullet casings and broken glass; a blood-smeared Taliban flag hangs from one of the windows. The surrounding area \u2013 usually a serene campus full of leafy trees and wide pathways, a rarity in Kabul \u2013 is now deserted and empty. Marziah had studied public policy hoping one day to enter politics to shape her troubled country\u2019s future. She had been part of a vibrant, post-Taliban generation, hoping for peace, willing to invest time and resources. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge loss for our generation,\u201d says Sayed Haseebullah, her 26-year-old cousin, wiping tears from his eyes with his scarf. He stands surrounded by other male relatives; the atmosphere solemn. Marziah\u2019s parents are in shock, he says, her mother mourning at home with female relatives as custom requires. Marziah was not only his cousin but a close friend, he says. He\u2019d looked out for her, he listened to her, he\u2019d occasionally offer advice. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing left to say now. This land is not valuing human life. Marziah has left this world, she is gone for ever.\u201d Afghans fear levels of violence will increase: the UN has already documented almost 6,000 civilian casualties in the first nine months of 2020 \u2013 with more than 2,000 of them killed. Attacks in urban centres as well as targeted killings have been on the rise \u2013 just last week Isis attacked a private education centre in a predominantly Shia area, murdering at least 30 people, most of them students. On Tuesday, demonstrators gathered in front of the university demanding not only justice and security but a boycott of the Doha talks, the direct negotiations between the Afghan government and the Taliban that officially launched on 12 September. While the militants have denied any involvement in the attack, many government officials \u2013 and Afghans generally \u2013 think the blame lies with them. After Monday\u2019s assault, interior ministry spokesman Tarek Arian told journalists that the Taliban was involved in the attack. And with US troops leaving \u2013 their numbers already below 5,000 countrywide \u2013 many Afghans are worried about widespread insecurity and increased violence. Decades of war have affected the life of every Afghan, though Mushtaba Asqari, 27, says he always prayed the conflict would never hit so close. On Tuesday, kneeling by his 20-year-old sister\u2019s graveside, his face is raw with shock and pain. He is mumbling under his breath as he touches the soft, fresh earth covering his sister\u2019s bullet-riddled body. Seba was a law student. \u201cAs soon as we heard about the attack, my mother ran to the university,\u201d he says quietly. \u201cShe stood there all day with the security forces, listening to gunfire and explosions, not knowing her daughter\u2019s fate.\u201d At night, after soldiers had cleared the area and evacuated the injured and dead, the family had started driving across the city, visiting private clinics and government hospitals, looking for Seba, refusing to give up. Their hope faded at the mortuary. From there, they took her body home. \u201cIt\u2019s this fading hope that our entire generation lives with,\u201d Asqari told the Guardian. \u201cWe fight so hard for change, but we live in constant fear.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
