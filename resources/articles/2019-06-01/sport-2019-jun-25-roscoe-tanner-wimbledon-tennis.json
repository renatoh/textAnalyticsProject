Playing Bj\u00f6rn Borg at Wimbledon could do that to a man. This was 1979 and the ice-cold Borg was a big favourite to win the title for a fourth consecutive year while Tanner, a blond left-hander with a hammer for a serve, was in the final for the first time. Tanner wasn\u2019t afraid, though \u2013 not even of Borg, who had made Wimbledon a fortress. This wasn\u2019t fear. The champion on grass at the Australian Open a couple of years earlier, Tanner had a game made for grass, his lefty serve \u2013 once recorded at 153mph \u2013 a vicious weapon. And yet, as officials waited for him to come out at the scheduled time, he just sat, stalling. The American broadcaster NBC, which was showing Wimbledon live for the first time that year, had asked for the start time to be delayed by a few minutes, to allow their commentators to set up the final. The request was denied but Donald Dell, Tanner\u2019s agent and also an NBC commentator, asked Tanner if he could take matters into his own hands. At first, Tanner refused. \u201cI said: \u2018I\u2019ve been fighting my whole life to get to this match, and to delay it \u2013 I might get point penalties or all kinds of problems that could develop from me not being ready when they call me,\u2019\u201d he says now. \u201cSo I said: \u2018No, I won\u2019t do it,\u2019 and he said: \u2018OK,\u2019 and he left. Then I was sitting there and I thought: \u2018There is one way I can.\u2019\u201d When Leo Turner, the locker\u2011room attendant, approached Tanner to take him to the court, the American said his stomach was acting up and that he needed to go to the bathroom. \u201cSo I went into one of the stalls and locked the door and I just sat on the toilet, Tanner recalls. \u201cHe kept knocking, saying: \u2018Mr Tanner, Mr Tanner, we\u2019ve got to go,\u2019 and I said: \u2018Leo, I can\u2019t yet.\u2019 I was just sitting there looking at my watch. I saw it was about eight minutes and I said: \u2018OK, let\u2019s go,\u2019 and went out on the court.\u201d In the 40 years since then, Tanner has been no stranger to controversy \u2013 of a more serious kind. He has been jailed four times, once in Germany and three times in the US, for charges relating to writing dodgy cheques and failing to pay child support. He has spent much of the past three decades in financial difficulty and for a long time was estranged from his five daughters. In 1979, though, he was in his pomp. Tanner had reached the semi-finals at Wimbledon in 1975 and 1976, losing against Jimmy Connors and Borg respectively, and three years on he dropped just two sets on his way to his first final. \u201cReally I thought I had a great chance against Bj\u00f6rn, because I\u2019d beaten him earlier that year in Philadelphia,\u201d he says. \u201cI knew that if I played the way I could, especially on grass, I had a good chance. If I played him on clay I\u2019d have had a different feeling.\u201d And he had his chances, winning the first and third sets as it went to a decider. In the final set he held two break points at 4-3, 15-40 \u2013 only to blink. \u201cI hit a very good return, he was coming to net, which is where you would like Bj\u00f6rn to be, and he hit a volley and popped it up about three\u2011quarter court, easy to my forehand,\u201d Tanner says. \u201cI\u2019m thinking, cool, I\u2019m looking to hit it down the line but I want to make him think I\u2019m going to hit it cross\u2011court, so I wanted to hold it for a beat. He covered cross-court and I hit it about three inches wide. So that was a chance to have a break in the fifth set.\u201d Four decades on the disappointment is still there, but overall the feeling is one of pride after he was ultimately beaten 6-7, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, 6-4. \u201cThere\u2019s always a slight nagging feeling but I\u2019d say overall it\u2019s an exceptionally good feeling,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was the finals of Wimbledon, which to me is the event. Sure I would love to have won, that\u2019s the nagging feeling. But I was in the final and it was a good final. I\u2019d have a different feeling if I\u2019d lost like 2, 2 and 2. But it was a good final, I trained hard for it and I played well. Couple of shots that I missed that I wouldn\u2019t like to have missed, but overall I feel like he raised his game and beat me, so that\u2019s OK. He didn\u2019t beat me by much. Then later in the year, in the quarter-finals at the US Open, I beat him. That was a tiny bit of revenge. I can be honest and say that, it was on my mind. I would have traded my quarter-final for his final, but I did it.\u201d Tanner won 15 singles events, including one grand slam title and total prize money of \u00a31.67m. Considering that the singles winners at this year\u2019s Wimbledon will pick up \u00a32.35m each, does he think he was unlucky to have played when he did? \u201cIf I was born in the wrong time, think about [Rod] Laver,\u201d he says. \u201cWe were pretty fortunate, we were getting paid to play a game and as far as we were concerned it was big money then, way bigger than the guys before us. But Borg won five Wimbledons in a row. If you take all those cheques and add them together, it\u2019s [only just over half] what [Stefan] Edberg won [when he secured the title in 1988]. It went crazy. And I think part of it was tennis going live back to the United States. That helped.\u201d Tanner says it is around 20 years since he last attended Wimbledon but he hopes to return for this year\u2019s championships. In recent years, he has worked hard to make amends with friends and family and he is working with underprivileged children through the Learn to Serve Foundation in Orlando. \u201cI made some very bad decisions and I paid the price for it,\u201d he says. \u201cMy kids are all on a way better footing now, so I don\u2019t have any of those issues any more. I regret all those things, but in a sense it\u2019s taught me a lot. In Orlando, we\u2019re developing a tennis programme for kids who don\u2019t have anything. The idea is not so much to make them pros but maybe help them get college scholarships. Education is what\u2019s going to get children out of their situation. I think maybe some of the stuff I went through did hit me in the head and made me realise this is what I\u2019m meant to do. They can\u2019t say to me I don\u2019t understand because I\u2019ve been there. So it gives me a platform to talk to them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
