Having qualified for Euro 2016 with an immaculate record of 10 straight wins, England will begin their preparations for the tournament by playing against Spain in Alicante on 13 November, followed by France\u2019s visit to Wembley four days later, and Hodgson is planning to field his strongest possible team on both occasions. The games give him an opportunity to test Barkley against a higher level of opposition after his impressive performances against Lithuania and, in particular, Estonia but Hodgson mixed his praise for the midfielder by saying that he was still not guaranteed a slot in the team, urging him to maintain his current form. Asked whether it was important to see how Barkley would fare against two of Europe\u2019s stronger football nations, Hodgson said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so, he will play if I feel he is deserving of a place in what I consider to be our best team because I will be picking teams to play against Spain and France that I consider to be the best 11 of the moment. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of football between now and then and we follow all our players very closely. There will be lots of reports and lots of sightings. Ross will have to continue doing well for Everton and continue to show that this is a player that deserves to be one of the first names on the England team-sheet, like he has shown he is one of the first names on Everton team-sheet. So it\u2019s entirely up to him. \u201cHe has certainly not done his cause any harm. All you can do when you are given a chance to play for England is to go out against whoever that opponent may be and do it very well. And if you do that, you get yourself in the forefront of the manager\u2019s mind.\u201d Hodgson has spoken in the past about Barkley, for all his outstanding ability, needing to improve his decision-making on the pitch. He thinks the 21-year-old is best as an attacking midfielder rather than operating slightly further forward, in the classic No10 role he fills for Everton, and has been greatly encouraged by Barkley\u2019s increasingly influential performances for the Goodison Park club. \u201cI think it is all down to the fact that he plays every game and he is starting to feel his place on the team-sheet is more guaranteed than maybe it has been in previous years,\u201d said Hodgson. \u201cHe realises how much faith his team-mates, his manager and everyone at the club has in him and, of course, he has worked hard at his game. \u201cHe has taken on board all of the advice he is given from his manager and coaching staff and, when he comes to England, the work we try to do with him. Basically, he is aligning that coaching advice to his enormous talent and we are seeing the benefit of it. He is not always going to score spectacular goals and dribble past people as if they are not there, and against better opposition he will find that harder as well. But I think he is balancing his decision-making in a way that we think is very, very good and I am sure Roberto Mart\u00ednez agrees with me.\u201d As well as the Spain and France games, England have also lined up a trip to Berlin to play Germany on 26 March and are finalising a game against Holland for the same month. \u201cI think the March friendlies will be more important than the November ones, not least because we might have a few players back by then and the team might look more like the team I would have in my head for the tournament,\u201d Hodgson said. The England manager knows there is a danger of the team losing their winning momentum in these friendlies, thinking back to the defeats against Germany and Chile before the last World Cup. \u201cWe will have to accept that. If you want to guarantee momentum, you don\u2019t play Spain away, you don\u2019t play France, you don\u2019t play Germany away. You play teams you feel you are quite capable of beating and then you get a pat on the back for going a bit further. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want that. I don\u2019t see it as a risk at all. The worst that can happen is we lose the games. The very worst that can happen is we lose them playing very badly and if that was to happen \u2013 and I don\u2019t believe it will \u2013 it would be an important lesson for us and there would be important things to know going forward.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
