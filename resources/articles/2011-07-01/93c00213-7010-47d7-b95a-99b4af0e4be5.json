Fermyn Wood has a renowned inhabitant \u2013 the purple emperor. The second biggest British butterfly, it is an enigmatic beast that soars around the tops of oak trees, rarely gracing ground level. The male is of particular note; in the right light the upper surfaces of his black-and-white wings reflect a sheet of iridescent purple. A good objective for an afternoon walk. As gaps in the clouds pass over, there are plenty of butterflies on the wing: brown ringlets and gatekeepers abound around the grasses and brambles in the woodland rides; pretty black-and-orange commas and plain whites haunt the sunlit bushes; red admirals swoop from the soil to canopy. We learn trees by textbook characters \u2013 shape, texture and colour, but trees also move and resonate distinctively. The ash flexes in the gusts of wind, leaves casually turn over, swishing softly like waves on a sandy beach, and the branches sway together. The English oak moves more stiffly, the shaking leaves resist the speeding air, the noise is a little harsher and the branches spring quickly back into their preferred station. The leaves of the aspen twist and flutter, their whitish undersides make the tree glitter and the call is a loud, tinny rattle, sharper than even the oak. As I climb into the car to depart, I spy something perched on its roof: a small greyish butterfly with a white line along the wings and a little orange \"eye\" on the bottom corner. It opens them to reveal brown uppers with a patch of metallic purple on the forewing. The purple emperor may have eluded us, but this purple hairstreak is a rewarding compensation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
