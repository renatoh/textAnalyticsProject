Bye! Roll up! Roll up! Essential World Cup reading: Kadeisha Buchanan\u2019s first-half header is sufficient to seal victory. It was an underwhelming Canada performance \u2013 but they have the three points they so badly craved. Deanne Rose was very lively off the bench, definitely a plus point for Kenneth Heiner-M\u00f8ller, their Danish coach. As for Cameroon, it could be a painful couple of weeks. That was a very stodgy performance, and that is being kind. They offered precious little, despite staying in the game for so long. 90 min: There will be two added minutes. 88 min: And now a goalmouth scramble ensues! Cameroon \u2013 somehow \u2013 manage to hack the ball away, with Canada desperately trying to force it goalwards. Heroic defending \u2013 and great play again by the substitute Rose. She is surely a shoo-in to start their next Group E match, against New Zealand on Saturday. 87 min: Christine Sinclair thumps the ball just wide! That was a cracking volley. She hit it sweetly \u2013 but it zooms past Ndom\u2019s post. Cameroon survive. 86 min: Fleming plays in Beckie, who has a pop from 30 yards. It seems a decent effort but on closer inspection, it was rather wayward. She took a touch with her left foot to steady herself and then took aim with her right. It was always moving away from goal, though. But back come Canada ... 83 min: Labbe gifts the ball to Enganamouit \u2013 but Cameroon hand it straight back to Lawrence. It is on a plate for the Canada winger. Meanwhile Yango has been withdrawn for Cameroon. 81 min: Saying that, apparently Canada are the fifth-best team in the world. They have flattered to deceive for much of this. Deanne Rose has made a splash since coming on and Nichelle Prince was lively, dangerous in fits and starts. Christine Sinclair has been fairly quiet. Canada have simply not been good enough going forward, despite hogging the ball more-or-less all evening. 79 min: Time is ticking for Cameroon. And Canada win another plucky foul on halfway. That eats into the African side\u2019s chances of finding a leveller. Cameroon have been totally ineffectual in the final third. Really, really poor. 77 min: Canada go close! Rose does brilliantly, pulling the ball back for Sinclair \u2013 but the veteran striker cannot divert it goalwards. It was a cracking cross by the substitute, who has made a real impression since coming on, and Sinclair did well to bend her run to get something on it. But it bounces just wide. 76 min: Rose\u2019s first touch is positive, as Canada raid down the right. They need a second goal to ease any late tension. Cameroon, as poor as they have been, still sense an opportunity to snatch a late equaliser. Canada have gone very flat. 74 min: Kenneth Heiner-M\u00f8ller, the Danish Canada coach, has seen enough. Deanne Rose replaces Nichelle Prince, the Houston Dash winger who has certainly been one of their better performers. It has been a fairly underwhelming performance \u2013 even if they have dominated large spells. 72 min: A crude challenge by Leuko, the Strasbourg defender, on Beckie earns Canada a free-kick 35 yards out \u2013 and a little respite, in truth. But they fail to make anything of it. Adding a second would avoid a nervous finish. 70 min: Claudine Meffometou nods just wide! Cameroon get a rare corner \u2013 their third of this game \u2013 and Meffometou drops a downward header agonisingly past Labbe\u2019s post. That was comfortably Cameroon\u2019s best chance, best opening. It was a decent delivery, Meffometou ghosted towards the back post relatively unmarked but could not get her effort on target. A big let-off for Canada, who have drifted off to sleep in the last 15-20 minutes. Cameroon\u2019s subs have lifted their spirits. 69 min: Labbe lobs the ball out of play. This game has died of death in the last few minutes. Canada have been so untroubled, they appear to be struggling to motivate themselves. It is Cameroon, if anything, that are probing now ... 67 min: Another change for Cameroon: Enganamouit replaces Ndoumbouk. A like-for-like change. Cameroon have offered nothing going forward. 65 min: A change for Cameroon: Akaba replaces Nchout. 64 min: Canada are cruising. They have not been troubled by Cameroon. At all. It is getting increasingly difficult to see Cameroon equalising. 62 min: Prince gets away from Manie \u2013 but slices the cross! It all looked so promising for Canada. Some lovely footwork had left Manie dazed. 60 min: Onguene\u2019s getting a lecture from the North Korean referee. Cameroon will be relatively happy with this, though. They\u2019re still very much in it \u2013 even if they have offered precious little. Canada are frustrated by that five-strong defence and have made few clear in-roads. Cameroon, however, have made none. 58 min: Prince drags wide! A big chance goes begging for Canada. Beckie sends in a Canada corner in from the right, Cameroon do well to clear. They think that\u2019s the end of that but Canada have other ideas, recycling the ball out on halfway. They dink a pass into Nichelle Prince \u2013 but she skews her effort wide. Replays show the winger was in fact offside, so any goal may not have counted. But, we will never know. 56 min: Buchanan, the goalscorer, is a little overzealous in the challenge and Cameroon have a chance to whip it in from the left. The ball drops on the penalty spot \u2013 but Christine Sinclair, helping out in defence, powers clear. Cameroon get a corner out of it but Canada welly it away through Scott. 54 min: Cameroon lump a deep free-kick straight at Labbe, the Canada goalkeeper, who gratefully cradles the ball. She will pump it back downfield. 52 min: Lawrence twists and turns her way into the Cameroon box \u2013 the Canada winger does well, bamboozling the opposition defence. Bums are momentarily off seats \u2013 but the winger is eventually halted in her tracks. Prince and Lawrence have provided plenty of energy for Canada from wide areas. 51 min: Ah. It is straight into the wall by Sinclair. 49 min: Canada try to up the ante but Cameroon crowd out Fleming. But not cleanly, according to the Korean referee. And Canada have a golden opportunity to take aim at goal. Yango was penalised but Fleming appeared to simply trip. Anyway, it is Christine Sinclair and Sophie Schmidt who fancy it ... 47 min: Cameroon almost wriggle the ball away from Scott on halfway but they fail to break. Canada pick it back up and this games resumes order. 46 min: The second half is go. Cameroon kick-off. Some bits and pieces to get stuck into at half-time: Kadeisha Buchanan\u2019s downward header is the difference at the break. This is not a classic \u2013 far from it \u2013 but it is all to play for. 45 min: There will be two added minutes. Kadeisha Buchanan, the Lyon defender, arrives late at the back post and crashes in a header from a corner. Buchanan nodded into the ground and it cannoned into the net. Ndom, the Cameroon goalkeeper, had absolutely no chance. 42 min: Nichelle Prince\u2019s effort is deflected on to a post by Yvonne Leuko! Chapman did superbly, even if she did slightly overcook her pass, sliding the ball across goal for Michelle Prince. And the Canada winger came within inches of an 11th international goal. Prince struck at goal from an acute angle and Leuko, who plays for French club Arras, and Annette Ndom, the goalkeeper, threw themselves at it to keep it out, and the former\u2019s intervention proved sufficient. Cameroon survive, but back come Canada ... 41 min: Prince bends a decent ball into Beckie \u2013 but Cameroon nod the ball clear. Without looking too composed, they have stood firm when called on. They are not going to roll over anytime soon, that\u2019s for sure. Canada are going to have to dig deep if they are to garner victory here. 40 min: \u201cSimply for the sake of narrative, I hope Beckie takes free kicks for Canada,\u201d emails Peter Oh. \u201cBend it like Beckie.\u201d We can hope! 38 min: Well, well, well! A few hundred supporters run ducking for cover, as the rain lashes down on fans seated in an uncovered stand at La Mosson, home of Ligue 1 side Montpellier. They are scurrying for cover. Back to the football, and Canada continue to dominate the ball, with Ndom punching clear from Chapman. 36 min: Ndoumbouk, the Cameroon forward, frowns after going into the book. And then has a brief sulk. She clattered the Canada midfielder Scott on halfway. 35 min: Zadorsky is penalised for handball \u2013 it is a little harsh \u2013 but Cameroon will take it. It is a golden opportunity to ping the ball towards the box but Canada survive without truly breaking sweat. Oguene forces the Canada defender into an error but then loses her footing, and it is back to square one. 33 min: Christine Sinclair is looking pretty isolated up front for Canada. For a player with such an impeccable scoring record, that is not good. They need to get her involved more often. Beckie has been lively, however. 32 min: Cameroon attempt to build, releasing Oguene down the right but Canada are oh so quick to snuff it out. Canada look strong and organised in defence \u2013 and pretty nifty going forward. But they are yet to really turn on the style. 29 min: Cameroon earn a corner, the crowd lap it up, they sense blood \u2013 possibly even a goal \u2013 but when the ball eventually comes in from the right, it is painfully poor. And Canada comfortably seize back possession. Breaking down a five-strong Cameroon defence is their biggest challenge. 26 min: Cameroon leather the ball downfield from a goal-kick but Schmidt gleefully collects on halfway. An athletic Canada side are patiently knocking the ball around nicely but that killer final pass continues to elude them. Cameroon are working their socks off with little \u2013 if anything \u2013 to show for it. 25 min: A Canada corner lands kindly at the feet of Buchanan \u2013 but she cannot divert the ball goalwards. But they do manage to recycle the ball, with good work by Janine Beckie down the right, who springs the offside trap. But Prince ends up skewing the ball wide of Ndom\u2019s goal. Canada are seeing plenty of the ball but are yet to conjure up a meaningful chance against a Cameroon side powerless to do much else but soak up wave after wave of pressure. 24 min: \u201cAs an expat now living in Toronto I am hoping this will be a day of a double triumph for Canada,\u201d emails Claire McConnell. \u201cFirst, a win for the women\u2019s soccer team and then the mighty Raptors taking the NBA championship away from the US for the first time in history. We The North!!\u201d 22 min: A little lull in play as Sophie Schmidt takes a knock. The Canada midfielder is fit to carry on, though. 19 min: Canada fly forward down the left but they force the final pass \u2013 and Cameroon gobble the ball back up inside the 18-yard box. 16 min: Cameroon feel aggrieved with Hyang-Ok Ri, the Korean referee. They get a little fortunate and break two-on-two, but Ndoumbouk appears to be hauled down, only for the referee to award Canada a free-kick. It all started up the other end, after Ndom gathered another high ball into the box. 15 min: And now Ndom makes a smart save from Schmidt! Canada are knocking at the door. But now all I can think of is the postcode lottery ... 14 min: Clever play by Beckie on the edge of the area, collecting a one-two from Fleming, but the move breaks down. Cameroon are struggling to get out of their own half. 12 min: Canada parachute the ball into the box, and they help it on towards Sinclair, who is lurking at the back post. It looks promising but Meffometuo acrobatically clears. The move culminates with Beckie driving wide of goal from 20 yards. That was more like it from Canada. They are grinding through the gears. 10 min: Cameroon probe for an opening but Lawrence, the Canada defender, is alert to it and comes bundling out from the back with possession. Canada, who are ranked fifth in the world, are yet to get fully into the groove. 8 min: Yango is late on Chapman and the Korean referee has a stern word with the Cameroon defender. Another opportunity for Canada to swing in a free-kick from a dangerous position, 30 yards out. Beckie, who plays her club football for Manchester City, has a pop but it is lacking in conviction. 7 min: \u201cLooking forward to a good game,\u201d emails Kimberly Tomasson. And we have one here. Things are beginning to spice up in Montpellier. 6 min: At the end of that Cameroon attacking phase, Schmidt slipped and clattered Onguene, the forward, on the follow through. The referee allows the player to receive treatment but waves play on, despite some clamour for VAR to intervene. 5 min: Good movement by Manie at the corner \u2013 but she stabs just wide of goal. Cameroon\u2019s tails are up after being made to sit and suffer early on. 4 min: And now Cameroon attempt to apply some heat, penning Canada in to win a corner. \u201cWhat a story Christine Sinclair is,\u201d emails Alex from Enfield. \u201c35 years old and still as prolific in front of goal as ever. Men\u2019s football \u2013 take note!\u201d 2 min: Christine Sinclair heads just wide! Canada maintain the pressure, winning a free-kick from the right flank and the striker rises highest to nod at goal and it is deflected wide. But Cameroon manage to ride out the early storm, hacking away a corner. 1 min: Canada win an early corner, there is bit of argy-bargy between Fleming and Yango, but Cameroon clear. Good start by the Canadians, though. Canada get the ball rolling in Montpellier. Canada and Cameroon trot out to the sound of Seven Nation Army, and we are just the national anthems away from kick-off. The teams are in the tunnel. Here we go ... ! Any pre-match thoughts, prediction or things to get off your chest? \u201cI\u2019m watching it in Ottawa,\u201d emails Ivan. \u201cWe\u2019ll soon see if Canada\u2019s younger players can step up or if it will be up to Sinclair to do all the scoring. As much as I hate to say it, I think they\u2019ll have a tough time against Cameroon today ...\u201d Now, then. This is Cameroon\u2019s second appearance at a World Cup having reached the last 16 when making their debut in 2015 (losing 1-0 to China PR). And here is some further pre-match trivia: the defender Estelle Johnson is set to make her international debut for Cameroon in France despite having an American father and a Malian mother. The Sky Blue FC centre-back was born in Maroua, a city in the north of Cameroon, and pledged her allegiance to the country having been inspired by the team\u2019s efforts at the 2015 World Cup. \u201cAs a team we want to perform better than we did in 2015 and we know we can achieve something interesting at the World Cup. I always wanted to play for Cameroon.\u201d Essential pre-match reading: Canada (4-4-2): Labbe; Lawrence, Buchanan, Zadorsky, Chapman; Prince, Scott, Schmidt, Beckie; Sinclair, Fleming Subs: Quinn, Ross, Grosso, Riviere, Huitema, Carle, Sheridan, Leon, Woeller, D\u2019Angelo, Agnew, Hellstrom Cameroon (4-5-1): Ndom; Leuko, Awona, Manie, Johnson, Meffometou; Ajara, Feudjio, Tango, Onguene; Ndoumbouk Subs: Ejangu, Ngono Mani, Meyong Menene, Abena, Sonkeng, Mambinga, Enganamouit, Akaba, Mbeleck, Takounda Engolo, Abam, Ongmahan Referee: Hyang-Ok Ri (Korea) Welcome to Group E. Canada kick things off against Cameroon, who boast arguably the best \u2013 and most formidable-sounding \u2013 nickname at the tournament: the Indomitable Lionesses. Canada are ranked fifth in the world for a reason, though, and in 35-year-old Christine Sinclair, they have a prolific goalscorer, who can break the all-time goalscoring record, should she find three goals between now and the end of the World Cup. Sinclair is three short of the record of 184 goals held by American former World Cup winner Abby Wambach. \u201cThe second I lose that burning desire is the second I have to hang up the boots,\u201d Sinclair says. \u201cWhat motivates me right now is to win a World Cup.\u201d And this represents the perfect chance to get off to a flyer. Kick-off: 8pm (BST)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
