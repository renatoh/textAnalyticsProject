The country\u2019s three biggest media organisations \u2013 the ABC, News Corp and Nine \u2013 called for legislative and cultural change in an unprecedented show of unity at the National Press Club on Wednesday. The ABC managing director, David Anderson, who has asked the federal court to set aside the warrant that authorised the AFP raid earlier this month, was joined by the executive chairman of News Corp Australasia, Michael Miller, and the Nine chief executive, Hugh Marks. Marks said he was shocked to discover how laws had multiplied over the past few years to stifle the media, and he likened the process to a frog in boiling water. News Corp is also going to mount a legal challenge against the AFP raid on Annika Smethurst\u2019s home. Anderson told the press club that a free media must be \u201centrenched in law\u201d and journalism must be decriminalised. \u201cThe legacy is a patchwork of laws that make it difficult, sometimes impossible, for the media to do its public duty,\u201d Anderson said. \u201cJournalists are increasingly accused of crimes for performing their job. Whistleblowers, whose brave interventions are so important to identifying wrongdoing, run the risk of being cowed out of existence.\u201d The three men represent the views of Australia\u2019s Right to Know Coalition, which includes Guardian Australia, Australian Associated Press, the West Australian, Bauer Media, subscription and free-to-air television, community broadcasting, the Media Entertainment and Arts Alliance and commercial radio. The media executives handed out a six-point plan that includes a review of defamation law, protections for public-sector whistleblowers, a stronger freedom of information scheme and a new regime that limits which documents can be stamped secret. The media is also calling for journalists to be exempted from tough new national security laws in the name of public interest reporting and for all warrants to be contestable. The AFP raided the broadcaster earlier this month over a 2017 report into the clandestine operations of Australian special forces in Afghanistan just one day after the AFP raided the home of a News Corp political editor over articles she published in 2018 on proposals to expand Australia\u2019s domestic surveillance capabilities. \u201cAs a society, we shouldn\u2019t fear truth,\u201d Marks told the press club. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t fear debate. We shouldn\u2019t fear opinions. The Australian public\u2019s right to know makes our democracy function. \u201cWe are operating at a time when a combination of factors \u2013 including technological change, bad legislation across several fronts and overzealous officials in the judiciary, bureaucracy and security services \u2013 have steadily eroded the freedom within which we the media can operate.\u201d In his speech Miller demanded the right to contest any kind of search warrant on journalists or news organisations before the warrant is issued. \u201cPublic-sector whistleblowers must be adequately protected and the current laws need to change,\u201d Miller said. The CEO of the MEAA, Paul Murphy, added the media union\u2019s voice to the call to stop laws stifling public interest journalism. \u201cThe raids by the AFP earlier this month have highlighted just how vulnerable press freedom is in Australia,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThose raids were not justified on national security grounds and were intended to identify the sources of leaks which have embarrassed the government and the defence establishment.\u201d The media organisations want: \u2022 The right to contest any kind of search warrant on journalists or news organisations before the warrant is issued \u2022 Public-sector whistleblowers to be adequately protected with current laws to be changed \u2022 A new regime that limits which documents can be stamped \u201csecret\u201d \u2022 A proper review of freedom of information laws \u2022 Journalists to be exempted from the national security laws enacted over the past seven years that can put them in jail for just doing their jobs"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
