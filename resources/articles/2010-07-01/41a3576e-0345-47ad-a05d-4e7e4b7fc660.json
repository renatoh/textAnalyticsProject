Two days earlier, in the flat lands of northern France, he had been pretty pleased with himself when he became the youngest rider of the modern era to win a stage of the Tour. Now, after a 203km ride into the high Alps, he had learnt what being a Tour rider really meant. \"I was hurting today. It's a strange feeling ... a complete emptiness,\" the 21-year-old Lance Armstrong said that evening, agreeing to a conversation with some reluctance after his soigneur had tried to massage the aches away. He paused before trying to describe the experience of confronting the series of climbs with which the stage had culminated before the finish line. \"It's demoralising when you see a sign at the bottom that says '21km to the summit'. They just keep on coming \u2013 boom, boom, boom. I didn't even get the chance to go hard. I was just too wasted. Tomorrow may be my last day. I don't want to kill myself.\" The next day was indeed his last on the 1993 Tour. Phil Anderson and Sean Yates, his Motorola team\u2011mates, nursed him through another mountain stage, from Serre Chevalier to Isola 2000, but when the riders reported for the start of the next day's run down to Marseille he was no longer among them. What he had left behind was the impression of a young man using setbacks as the fuel for his ambition. He became more animated as he spoke of his experience 11 months earlier at the Cl\u00e1sica San Sebasti\u00e1n, a one-day race. He arrived as the newly crowned Olympic champion but crashed several times in the rain and finished 111th and last, with the crowd's derision ringing in his head. \"I just remember those people laughing, which gives me another reason not to finish this race. I mean, I could finish it, but I want to be fit to go back to San Sebasti\u00e1n next month and get my revenge.\" Then, his voice fading in the gloom, he stated a credo with which the world would become familiar. \"I go to the start line,\" he told me, with what seemed like his last ounce of strength, \"and look at the other guys and I say: 'Well, there's no way they want to win more than I do.' No way. Because I want to win more than anybody.\" Today on the Champs-Elys\u00e9es, he will again leave the Tour after failing to match his own expectations. This time there will be no return for a man who exploited that ambition, that rage, to make himself him one of the world's most famous and controversial athletes, in whose presence the president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, visiting the Tour on Thursday and encountering the seven-time champion in front of the television cameras at the top of the Col du Tourmalet, looked almost overawed. It was Bradley Wiggins who paid an eloquent tribute to Armstrong last week, having ridden alongside him through the mountains last year, when the Englishman finished in fourth place to Armstrong's third. Wiggins gave a rider's view of a man who continues to divide opinion inside and outside the sport. On the one side are those worship him, not just for his historic victories after conquering cancer, but for his work in the worldwide battle against the disease; on the other are those who choose to believe the accusations made by Floyd Landis, a former team\u2011mate who was stripped of his own Tour victory in 2006. Landis recently gave details of what he alleges to have been a systematic doping regime surrounding the Texan in the days when they both rode in the colours of the US Postal Service, whose sponsorship \u2013 involving the use of public money \u2013 is now under federal investigation. \"I love him,\" Wiggins said. \"I think he's great. He's transformed the sport in so many ways. Every person in cycling has benefitted from Lance Armstrong, perhaps not financially but in some sense. Even his strongest critics have benefitted from him. I don't think this sport will ever realise what he's brought it or how big he's made it. \"Cycling was in the dark ages before he came along, in many ways. You only have to look at the support along the roads, compared to what it was 20 years ago. The majority of that is because of Lance Armstrong. Obviously he has his enemies and people among the fans who don't like him, but they've all benefitted from him and his existence on the Tour.\" Last year's third place justified Armstrong's decision to return to the race four years after his retirement, but he has failed to make good on his promise to do better in 2010. Wiggins blames bad luck, particularly the American's fall on the Col de la Ramaz during Stage 8, for a performance that, barring accidents, will see him finish 23rd in the general classification in Paris today. \"You can't account for bad luck and that wiped him out of the Tour, really,\" he said. \"Without that, you never know how he'd have got on. Look at his form coming into the race \u2013 he was second on the Tour de Suisse, up there with [Robert] Gesink and those guys. He'd certainly have been in the top 10.\" That fall on the Ramaz, however, was only one of four such embarrassments, including a capsize in the neutral zone before the race had even started. In his prime, Armstrong seemed impervious to banal accidents and fortune's whims. Perhaps it is better for everyone when heroes return to normal proportions before taking their final bow. For all his acquired celebrity and notoriety, for all the stardust and the sulphur, Armstrong has appeared more mortal during this Tour than at any time since his debut 17 years ago. And he leaves the race that made him famous with a past which continues to invite inspection."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
