Their stories are at least self-sufficiently interesting and often actually amazing, but their special claim on our attention has to do with the ways they allow us to apprehend symbolic values at the same time as we enjoy actual events. This combination of figurative and factual power is something that all creative artists aspire to - which helps to explain why one of the best-known myths, the story of Orpheus, should have been so often retold through the centuries. It is an exceptionally potent mixture of the familiar and the extraordinary, and centres on a celebration of the power of art. Monteverdi, Telemann, Haydn, Liszt, Glass and Birtwistle have noticed this in their music; Pope, Southey, Rilke, Auden, Heaney and Ashbery in their poems; Pynchon and Rushdie in their novels; and Marc Almond, Nick Cave and Rufus Wainwright in their songs. Orpheus, in fact, could reasonably be called the patron saint of artists. This means the bare bones of Orpheus's story are pretty familiar. The son of Apollo and the muse Calliope, he is given a lyre by his father in childhood and learns to play on it so beautifully that he not only soothes the savage breasts of beasts, but coaxes trees and rocks to gather round and listen. His music seduces Eurydice, too, but shortly after their marriage she is bitten and killed by a snake while trying to escape the unwanted attentions of her husband's halfbrother, Aristaeus. Orpheus is distraught and enters the underworld to plead for her return, once again using the sweetness of his singing to achieve the impossible. Persephone and Hades grant his wish on one condition: that he doesn't turn round to look at Eurydice until he and his beloved have both reached the sunlit world again. When Orpheus finds that he can't keep his side of the bargain, Eurydice is spirited back to the underworld, and Orpheus is condemned to wander the earth grieving - or, as Thomas Bulfinch put it, \"melting the hearts of tigers and moving the oaks from their stations\". Eventually Orpheus is murdered by a gang of drunken women who resent his indifference to them, and buried by the Muses at Libethra, where the nightingales are said to sing more sweetly than anywhere else in Greece. Zeus places his lyre among the stars, and Orpheus returns to the underworld for a second time, where he wanders the happy fields with Eurydice for all eternity, free to gaze on her as often as he likes. Astonishing creative powers, perfect love, tragic loss, heroic bravery, a recognisable human failure, noble grief, ignominious death, final union: it's easy to see why the Orpheus story has commanded such interest over the centuries. It is a balanced, compelling tale of finding and losing, making and marring. But when we read it in the context of Jason's journey to seize the Golden Fleece, as in this booklet, we realise there are still further ways to explain its power. To start with, it seems that Orpheus has been invited aboard the Argo as a very superior sort of on-board entertainment: when he sings, he tells his own story \"of love and loss, of secrets and treachery, triumph and folly\", but so beautifully that \"even the waves stopped rolling as if eavesdropping on [his] tale\". As soon as the Argonauts reach Colchis, however, it turns out that his words have a more practical purpose. Jason is a figure of courage and selflessness, but also of some naivety - and listening to Orpheus's experiences with Eurydice makes him \"a little less unworldly\". This helps Jason question what Hera wants from him and why - ostensibly her purpose is to punish Pelias for not paying her sufficient honour - and also prepares him for a later crisis, involving Medea. Although only 16 years old when she meets and falls in love with Jason, Medea is cunning and unscrupulous enough to help him possess the Fleece and to dispatch her brother Apsyrtus, whom she resents for being the heir to the throne of Colchis. It's the beginning of a long career in murder and trickery for her, and a crucial step on the road to heroic fame for him. It introduces yet more layers of doubt (about motivation) and subtlety (about intention) into the story, which deepen the significances of the Orpheus story it surrounds. Orpheus, like Jason, is a character whose authority as a mythical figure is bolstered by his demonstration of recognisably human doubt, uncertainty and even (in the case of that fatal backward glance) weakness. One may be a poet and the other a man of action, but because they both embrace this paradox, it is no surprise to find them sailing in the same boat. \u00b7 Andrew Motion is the Poet Laureate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
