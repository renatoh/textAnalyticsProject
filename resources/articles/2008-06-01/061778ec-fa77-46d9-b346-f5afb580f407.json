Instead, Surrey county council wants governors to act as champions for looked-after children to help raise their achievement in school. The council has made improving the educational attainment of looked-after children a key priority for 2008-09. Andrew Povey, a councillor who chairs a working group on the issue, has written to governors urging them to do more for the county's 800 children in care. \"It is essential that each governing body should appoint a governor who is trained to act as an advocate for these children and to scrutinise the arrangements made in the school for them. The designated governor should be prepared to act as a \"pushy parent\" on their behalf, to ensure that they have every possible opportunity to gain the best possible education.\" Povey quotes \"stark\" test results to support more action - the percentage of children gaining five GCSEs with grades A*-C in Surrey is 60%, but this falls to 13% for looked-after children - a statistic reflected nationally. Surrey's campaign comes as the government announces \u00a356m of funding to help all local authorities to organise personal tutors, homework support and theatre trips for children in care. The Department for Children, Schools and Families has announced that those at risk of falling behind at school will get an extra \u00a3500 a year to pay for the sort of activities that parents provide for their children to help with learning. Ofsted recently reported on what schools can do to help such children make more progress, but governors need to be clear about their responsibilities. All governors should be fully aware of the legal requirements and guidance available. Governors should have an overview of the needs and progress of looked-after children in their school and must ensure that all the school's policies and procedures take them into account. However, this needs to be done with sensitivity, as one of the findings of the Ofsted report was that looked-after children loathe being made to feel different. Children's minister Kevin Brennan said: \"When we consulted with children in care, they also said they wanted the same boundaries as other children. They want to be able to lead 'normal' lives.\" Governors also need to ensure that the school has a designated teacher who has adequate resources and training. Each year the governing body should receive a report on the number of looked-after pupils on the roll, their attendance, their Sats scores, the number of fixed-term and permanent exclusions (if any), and the destinations of pupils who leave the school. The information should be reported in ways that respect the confidentiality of the pupils concerned. There are times to be pushy, and times to be discreet. \u00b7 More information is available from everychildmatters.gov.uk/childrenincare EducationGuardian.co.uk/governor"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
