Richard Ayre said Mr Dyke, the BBC's director general, had showed a lack of restraint in responding to Alastair Campbell's complaints, and said Mark Byford, the newly-appointed deputy director general, may find himself in the top job sooner than he had expected. \"The facts are that 'far from being a director general who exercises some kind of restraint over senior staff - being patient, making sure the response to Campbell's complaint was accurate - he was hands-on. \"He stood over the word processor, and he stood by the director of news [Richard Sambrook] dictating the first half of the most controversial reply to Campbell. \"The governors have to decide where [the responsibility] lies. It may be with Greg Dyke, it may not. The BBC can't afford to lose a whole panoply of senior executives.\" In a statement announcing his resignation, Mr Davies said there was an \"honourable tradition in British public life that those charged with authority at the top of an organisation should accept responsibility for what happens in that organisation.\" However, Mr Ayre, a former deputy chief executive of BBC News, said the statement was \"spectacularly self-serving\". He added: \"It's as if he is resigning to expunge the sins of the whole BBC. But he had to resign not because of what Gilligan did, but because of the failures of the BBC governors and their failure to hold the BBC to account. That's why he had to go.\" Mr Byfor, widely regarded as a \"safe pair of hands\", was installed as deputy director general as part of the corporation's attempt to pre-empt any criticism in the Hutton report. He was charged with overhauling the BBC's complaints system. Mr Ayre said Mr Byford would \"bring a bit of strategic direction into the handling of complaints. Who knows, he might find himself in the top job sooner than he might have guessed.\" He added: \"In some ways the most interesting thing is that the BBC is not going to say anything else tonight. By and large that's a good thing. The head of the organisation has now gone and that should be enough blood for the nation for one night. The BBC has to think really seriously whether other resignations [are required] - including Greg Dyke - and who, if anybody, else should go. \"The BBC needs to think if it needs new rules and regulations. I hope it doesn't rush to write new rules because of a problem which already happened six months ago. New rules and regulations won't by and large make for better journalism. The BBC has to go pursuing difficult stories which will sometimes embarrass the governments of the day.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
