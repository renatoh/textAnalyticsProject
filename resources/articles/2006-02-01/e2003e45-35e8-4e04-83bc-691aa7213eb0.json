Her seven novels were written in about seven years, in a fruitless attempt to increase the audience for her poetry. Thereafter, she returned to her first love. Secondly, So I looked down to Camelot, the title of a poem and of her first published volume, is not an hommage to Tennyson. It is an instance of a dialectic expressed in much of her work, fiercely repudiating the glorification of an ideal world in which everything is OK, frozen in beauty and uneventfulness. Looking down to Camelot is engaging in and affirming life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
