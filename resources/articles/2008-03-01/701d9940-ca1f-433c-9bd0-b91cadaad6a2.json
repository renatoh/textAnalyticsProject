They might be struggling to pay their bills, watching as the little equity they have accumulated in their homes evaporates, wondering how they can possibly retire what with rising healthcare costs, a collapsing private pension system and the ominous clouds of inflation overhead. But when it comes to self-identifying, even as more and more commentators wring their hands over the \"shrinking middle class,\" most people tell pollsters they are still members of that middle class. Millionaire businessmen and plumbers might never socialise, but, at least when it comes to opinion polls, both claim a shared class identification. Maybe that means America is a more genuinely class-mobile society than most other parts of the globe: that so many think they are middle class means they at least glimpse the possibility of being able to afford the sort of lifestyle we generally associate with the bourgeois classes of affluent modern nations (or, conversely, are loathe, because of the illusion that the country is fundamentally egalitarian, to self-declare membership in the nouveau upper-classes). Possibly, however, it means people have been socially promoting themselves to pollsters because of a deep-rooted shame at not being able to keep up with the Joneses. If your next door neighbor has clambered up into the middle classes, well surely you should have too? Perhaps that explains, at least in part, why so many people get so far into debt in the US trying to purchase their way into comforts of class that they cannot truly afford. Thus the emphasis in political discussions about helping the shrinking middle classes, or alleviating the tax burden for the middle classes, or working out ways to stop the middle classes from sinking into property foreclosures. From the time of de Tocqueville onward, the rhetoric of middle classdom, its risks and its entitlements, has profoundly shaped the policy discussion in America. Don't get me wrong, these are certainly important issues. It's good for no-one when the middle classes are squeezed. But it's a truncated dialogue, one that ignores the fact an awful lot of people, even at the height of the go-go-1990s boom, were never even close enough to middle class realities to keep up the pretense. These days, with the economy tanking and wealth inequality escalating, with unionized blue collar jobs being replaced by low-wage, low-benefits service sector employment, far more people are heading the wrong way on the class ladder. And this all makes their claims to middle-class membership that much more precarious. At the same time, an increasing percentage of national wealth is gravitating toward the top twenty percent of income earners, and, more dramatically, toward those at the very top of the income pyramid. John Edwards talked about structural poverty during the months he ran for the Democratic nomination. Since he disappeared from the public scene two months ago, however, the discourse around poverty has largely been denuded of specifics. Clinton and Obama, and for that matter McCain, are talking about people hurting and dreams being deferred, and I'm more than willing to believe they do care about the most impoverished Americans. But the Bobby Kennedy-circa-1968 emphasis on why people are too often condemned not just to poverty during recession but to hardscrabble lives even during the good times has largely disappeared from the discourse. If you're crafting a politics primarily around the needs of the solidly middle class, like as not you'll favor things like tax rebates to jump start consumer spending; you'll probably argue for some sort of federal aid to homeowners who borrowed too much on unsound terms and are now finding they cannot repay their loans; you might call for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to guarantee larger mortgages than they did in the past. But you're unlikely to spend much time working out how to protect renters who could never get into the home-ownership game in the first place from the vagaries of the rental market - most cities in America dismantled their rent control systems over the past generation, and nobody's really discussing bringing them back. You're also not going to spend a whole lot of political capital working out how to subsidise the rural poor during a period in which energy prices are soaring - leading to people in some communities having to go into debt simply to heat their homes in winter and put gas in their cars to drive to work. And, beyond patching up the minimum wage, you probably won't craft terribly specific plans for bridging the growing gap between low-end incomes and basic living costs, a gap that is causing millions of Americans to fall back on food charities to put dinners on their tables at the end of each paycheck period. Edwards' unique contribution was that for a few months he managed to place these issues in the forefront of the debate. For a while, poverty was no longer an abstract, to-be-avoided-in-polite-company, topic, but a core theme. But now he's no longer a contender, and ingrained poverty has taken a backseat once more. It's an issue the Democratic party should be all over. Poverty in the US is not simply a temporary problem, a byproduct of the housing and credit crisis. It existed, in ever greater quantities, before the housing bubble burst, and it will exist long after the country's financial institutions get back on their feet. After decades of rising income inequality in America, whoever is elected president in November will have to tackle not just the problems faced by the squeezed middle, but, at least as importantly, the shameful level of poverty that refuses to go away at the bottom tier of the society.
