The huge rift between the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews and the United States Golf Association, the two ruling bodies, may widen further during next week's Open at Royal Lytham. The USGA, responsible for the rules of the game in the United States and Mexico, has banned clubs it believes do not conform to the rules, such as the Callaway ERC II and the TaylorMade R300 Series. The R&amp;A, governing body for the rest of the world, disagrees and is allowing the clubs to be used in its showcase event. This means golfers who usually play on the US Tour may use a non-conforming driver in an event that counts towards their order of merit standing. Theoretically, victory in the Open with an \"illegal\" driver could mean the difference between winning and finishing second on the US order of merit. Lehman says the ruling bodies must get together to prevent such scenarios. \"We need everyone to get on the same page so we can avoid things like that,\" he said, as he prepared for Royal Lytham at the Scottish Open at Loch Lomond this week. Talks are ongoing between the USGA and the R&amp;A to resolve the issue, but so far no compromise has been reached. These will continue at the Open and Lehman says the two bodies need to come together quickly for the good of the game. \"Hopefully they can all work together and come to a conclusion so that there is one standard and everybody plays by it, no matter where you play in the world.\" At the heart of the disagreement is whether or not the clubs in question hit the ball further. The USGA claims that because such clubs have thinner titanium faces, a spring - or trampoline - like effect off the clubface is created which propels the ball further. The disagreement between the two bodies has already meant the disqualification of one of Europe's most respected golfers from a US Seniors Tour event last month. The former Ryder Cup player Tommy Horton, was disqualified from the Senior PGA Championship after it was discovered he had unwittingly used a TaylorMade R360 Series driver - the club he uses in Europe - in the first round. Lehman also plays with TaylorMade clubs and uses the 300 Series driver, but won't be switching to the R Series in the Open for two reasons. \"I'm not going to switch drivers basically because I like the driver I've already got. I've hit the R Series driver. I couldn't tell you how much further it goes, but it did go further. However, I'm not going to switch, partly because I've been highly critical of Callaway in the past for bringing out the non-conforming ERC II. That forced the rest of the industry to do the same. So for me to use such a club now would be very hypocritical.\" The reigning US Open champion Retief Goosen is another TaylorMade player. He used the R Series driver in Europe prior to winning the US Open last month, but had to switch to the conforming driver at Southern Hills. He has also chosen to stick with the club next week. \"Every time I go to America I'm not going to chop and change drivers. I did use the R360 and was definitely hitting it a little further, but I feel comfortable with the one I'm using at the moment, even though I'm a few yards shorter.\" Lehman concedes some US Tour players may use the non-conforming clubs next week, but is not sure how practical it would be. \"Some guys may come over from the States and switch,\" says Lehman. \"But it would be very hard to find a driver they feel confident with quickly and then feel comfortable enough to use it in a major championship.\" Sweden's Jesper Parnevik is a Callaway player who performs mostly on the US Tour with occasional forays into Europe. Parnevik, who uses the \"Biggest Big Bertha\" driver, feels he gets less control because of the thinner club face on the ERC II drivers. \"I have tried some of these non-conforming drivers but I don't really like them,\" said the Swede. \"I find it hard to control the flight of the ball because of the way they explode off the club face.\" There seems to be no middle ground in the rift. The R&amp;A cannot ban the clubs now because it would face massive lawsuits from the equipment manufacturers, who had been assured of their legality before going into production. Equally, the USGA would lose face if it had to admit it made the wrong decision, and could also face lawsuits. However, Lehman feels the issue will not be solved unless the USGA backs down. \"I think the USGA is going to have to give a little bit, and say, 'OK, let's relax the standard to where the Callaway ERC II is or where the new TaylorMade is'.\" Furthermore, the American says the distance modern balls can fly may yet prove an even bigger problem. \"Probably for the first time ever, the golf ball has gotten to the stage where it goes too far. Using the Pro V1, which I do, I've gained at least 20 yards, and sometimes as much as 40 or 50 yards from what I used to with the Tour Balata.\" Lehman says the problem for classic courses like Royal Lytham is that they have to be made \"strategic enough to challenge the best players so that they can't just run over them\". His message is clear. If the authorities do not do something about the distance today's professionals are hitting the ball, then courses such as Royal Lytham may soon become obsolete."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
