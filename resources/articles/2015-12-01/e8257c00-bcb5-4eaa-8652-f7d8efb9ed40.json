The last time the managers met, in January 2011, the Newcastle United manager\u2019s then Wolfsburg side lost at home to Klopp\u2019s Borussia Dortmund. It was to be the former England coach\u2019s penultimate Bundesliga match because after the following fixture, a defeat at Hannover, he was sacked. In contrast Klopp\u2019s side went on to win the German title. \u201cThey beat us in Dortmund at the start of the season,\u201d recalled McClaren. \u201cBut by the time we played them again they\u2019d got stronger and stronger, they were already top of the League and a really good team, very well-organised. That\u2019s why I was sure J\u00fcrgen Klopp would be a success at Liverpool. I had no doubts. \u201cBrendan Rodgers signed some very talented players at Anfield and J\u00fcrgen\u2019s just taken it on and given them belief. I think they\u2019re genuine title contenders. Daniel Sturridge\u2019s return from injury is really boosting them and the League\u2019s so open this season they can win it.\u201d McClaren, meanwhile, is left fighting to retain his job on Tyneside while keeping Newcastle \u2013 who visit Tottenham next weekend \u2013 out of the Championship."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
