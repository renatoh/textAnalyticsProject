Directed by Adina Pintilie, Touch Me Not was picked ahead of 18 other films, including Wes Anderson\u2019s Isle of Dogs and Utoya July 22, by a jury headed by German director Tom Tykwer, best known for Run Lola Run. Based around an English woman\u2019s attempt to overcome her intimacy issues, and ranging across everything from disability to sex clubs, Touch Me Not blends fiction and documentary and is Pintilie\u2019s first feature film. The runner-up grand jury prize went to Mug (AKA Twarz), from Polish director Ma\u0142gorzata Szumowska, about a building worker who needs a face transplant after a gruesome accident. Guardian critic Peter Bradshaw described it as \u201ca strange, engaging film \u2013 well and potently acted and directed\u201d, delving as it does in questions of national identity that are currently convulsing Poland. Isle of Dogs was not completely ignored by the jury however: Anderson was given a Silver Bear for best director for his stop-motion animation about a pack of dogs living in a dystopian near-future Japan, which the Guardian\u2019s Jonathan Romney said \u201cshows an indefatigably fertile imagination letting rip in inimitable style\u201d in a four-star review. Bill Murray, who voices one of the dogs, accepted the award on Anderson\u2019s behalf. The two Silver Bears for acting went to Ana Brun, star of The Heiresses, a Paraguayan film directed by Marcelo Martinessi about two apparently-prosperous women in a lesbian relationship who run into financial troubles, and Anthony Bajon as a junkie trying to beat his addiction in a priest-run retreat in the C\u00e9dric Kahn-directed drama The Prayer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
