So, when a female police officer approached him and a friend while they sat in their car at the Lost Paradise music festival in December last year, he wasn\u2019t too worried at first. \u201cI knew I didn\u2019t have anything on me, no drugs or anything, so it was no problem,\u201d he says. \u201cBut then the dog started sniffing around the car and she started saying \u2018you look a bit nervous mate, you look nervous, if you have drugs on you then you might as well tell me now or I\u2019ll take you to the strip-search tent and we\u2019ll find them that way\u2019.\u201d Elies says the officer started recording him using her body-worn camera. While he continued to deny he had any drugs, she continued to press him on why he looked \u201cnervous\u201d. \u201cI said, \u2018because you are interrogating me and you have the dog there\u2019. She was being so rude about it as if I had done something wrong already,\u201d he says. Elies was eventually strip searched in a makeshift tent. Two male officers instructed him to lift his shirt, drop his pants and hold on to his genitals while they \u201cwalked around\u201d him. \u201cI was a bit shook up,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t know. I just, yeah, I was shook up by it to be honest.\u201d The experience Elies describes is common in New South Wales, where thousands of people are strip searched by police each year. Many of them take place at music festivals and about a quarter follow an indication by a drug dog. In about two-thirds of cases, nothing is found. Despite that, the number of strip searches has increased almost 20-fold in the past 12 years \u2013 from 277 times in the 12 months to 30 November 2006 to 5,483 in 2018 \u2013 and police have steadfastly defended their use. This week the police minister, David Elliott, insisted he \u201cwould want\u201d police to strip search his children if they were suspected to be in possession of drugs. Those comments came after Guardian Australia revealed that in the past three years police in NSW have strip searched 122 girls, including two 12-year-olds. One woman, Madz Piper, described a potentially illegal search that occurred in 2011 when she was 15 in which, she says, an officer \u201cgrabbed\u201d her bra and \u201cjiggled it\u201d. Then, on Friday, the NSW deputy coroner released the findings of her inquest into the deaths of six young people from MDMA toxicity at music festivals across the state. Besides recommending a pill-testing trial in NSW and the complete scrapping of the use of drug-detection dogs at festivals, Harriet Grahame said strip searches should be dramatically curtailed to only being used in cases of suspected supply. Her published findings revealed that in the 2018-19 financial year, 91% of strip searches were conducted on suspicion the person was in possession of drugs. She noted that meant the search was often being conducted for an offence that carried a punishment equivalent to a traffic infringement. The \u201cwholesale practice of strip searching young people\u201d was of \u201cgrave concern\u201d, Grahame said. \u201cWe know strip searches are causing great harm to the community and now we have the deputy state coroner confirming that this invasive practice is having a devastating impact on young lives,\u201d Sam Lee, the head of police accountability at the Redfern Legal Centre, said on Friday. \u201cThe proposed changes recommended by the deputy coroner are far from radical, but merely reflect parliament\u2019s original intent that such an invasive procedure be only utilised in the most exceptional of legal circumstances.\u201d Grahame also revealed the NSW police had sought to stop her considering strip searches as part of the inquest. A submission from the commissioner, Mick Fuller, asserted the evidence did not \u201cestablish a sufficient link between the deaths under investigation and the police practice of strip searching\u201d. Grahame rejected that and, following the publication of her findings on Friday, Fuller released a statement saying he \u201cstrongly defended\u201d against the suggestion police were \u201cimplicit\u201d in the deaths. The use and legality of strip-search powers in NSW has been placed under increased scrutiny since the Law Enforcement and Conduct Commission held public hearings for its investigation into the potentially illegal strip search of a 16-year-old girl at a 2018 music festival. During the inquiry the LECC\u2019s commissioner, Michael Adams QC, said he was considering whether the practice of making people squat during a search was legal. \u201cBut squatting is not the only problematic area in strip searches that requires greater clarification,\u201d he said. Under the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act, or Lepra, police in NSW are allowed to conduct a strip-search outside a police station if the \u201cseriousness and urgency of the circumstances\u201d make it necessary. Critics have long argued that \u201cbroadly defined\u201d threshold fails to give police clear guidance on when a strip-search should be carried out. On Thursday, Labor\u2019s shadow police minister, Lynda Voltz, told Guardian Australia she believed the act was not specific enough and as a result the police interpretation of when a search was justified was \u201cvery loose\u201d. During the LECC inquiry, Adams asked a police officer under what circumstances \u2013 apart from a suspicion someone was hiding drugs in a body cavity, which police are not allowed to search \u2013 it would be urgent for an officer to conduct a strip search at a music festival. \u201cI can\u2019t think of any, actually,\u201d the officer replied before admitting that all 19 of the searches he conducted at the 2018 Splendour in the Grass festival may have been illegal. Grahame added her own voice to that point in her findings, saying it was likely that searches are being conducted \u201cunlawfully\u201d. \u201cGiven the number of times that searches occur when there is no emergency or risk of serious harm, one can only assume that many searches are conducted unlawfully including many which occur at music festivals,\u201d she wrote. Also subject to scrutiny is the basis on which a search is executed. In NSW, a positive detection from a dog does not constitute the legal criteria for conducting a strip search. But the LECC heard evidence that officers used indicators such as a person\u2019s nervousness following the indication from the dog, like in Elies\u2019s case, to form their suspicion. That, experts say, is too shallow a basis on which to form a reasonable suspicion because nervousness is a natural reaction to an interaction with a drug dog. Peta Malins, a lecturer in criminology and justice studies at the RMIT University in Victoria, this year published a study on the emotional impact of drug dog detections and strip searches. \u201cEveryone I spoke to who had been stopped by police as part of a drug dog detection reported really quite significant embodied responses about fear and anxiety coming up for them in that exchange,\u201d she told Guardian Australia. \u201cHands shaking, sweating, heart rate increasing. Even if they knew they\u2019d done nothing wrong and had no drugs, they still felt really anxious and fearful in that encounter. \u201cSo it\u2019s really problematic that police might be relying on nervousness as an indicator about whether to search someone or take them aside for strip searches.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
