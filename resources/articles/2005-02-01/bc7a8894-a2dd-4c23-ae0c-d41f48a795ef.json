Unleashing an attack on Labour as a party whose \"time has come and gone in Wales\" - on the day the Labour first minister, Rhodri Morgan, celebrated five years in the job - Plaid Cymru's leader, Elfyn Llwyd, pledged to \"fight for Wales\" on pensions and NHS waiting lists. But he made it clear the bid on the part of one of his MPs, Adam Price, to impeach the prime minister over the Iraq war would not form part of the campaign. Instead, the party would focus on the issue of \"trust\" in relation to the war. Plaid Cymru, which campaigns for \"an independent Wales in Europe\", has four MPs in Westminster and is the second biggest party in Wales, but it admitted it would be using the UK elections as a \"springboard\" for the 2007 Welsh assembly vote. It currently has 12 members of the assembly, in Cardiff. Another of the party's MPs, Simon Thomas, said: \"Our real aim is 2007. These elections are a springboard for that.\" The party is hoping to regain the seat of its former leader Ieuan Wyn Jones, which was lost at the 2001 election to Labour by just 800 votes. Known as Anglesey in England, the island is listed by its Welsh name of Yns Mon at Westminster. Launching the party's campaign today at a Cardiff Bay bar, ahead of an official manifesto, Mr Thomas dismissed Mr Morgan's five year record - which included vowing to put \"clear red water\" between himself and Tony Blair - as a \"lot of bluster, [a] lot of talk, no delivery\". Mr Llwyd said the campaign slogan would be: \"We can build a better Wales.\" He said: \"We want Wales to be a country that people look up to as a beacon of hope, but instead we live in a land where young people can't afford a home, [where] soon they won't even be able to afford an education and where parents are seeing the dreams they had for their children evaporate before their very eyes. \"The people of Wales are working harder than ever, working nights, working weekends, working all the hours to make ends meet. We will fight for those families who are having to hurt themselves to give their kids a chance. We will fight for those workers who have seen their pensions melt away and deserve to be helped. We will fight for elderly people living alone in fear and for young people living without hope in the clutches of drugs.\" Mr Thomas suggested there would be some tactical voting in the election to help to hurt Labour the most. In Cardiff Central, Labour is barely 500 votes ahead of the Liberal Democrats, while Monmouth is a Labour/Tory marginal seat. Mr Thomas said: \"We have never gone out and advocated tactical voting, but in those areas Plaid Cymru votes will not be the most important.\" The party's opposition to the war in Iraq would not form a central part of its campaign, Mr Llwyd said, but the issue was \"shorthand for the fact you cannot trust Tony Blair\". Plaid also called for a \"proper\" parliament for Wales, better public services, affordable housing and action to tackle global warming. Mr Llwyd said he was not worried the campaign would become dominated by the three other main parties. \"Every time there is a Westminster election we don't get the attention we should,\" he said. Meanwhile, the Welsh first minister, Rhodri Morgan, said today that, at 65, he still had the ambition of \"undoing the damage that Margaret Thatcher did to Wales. That's what I have a burning ambition to do.\" He said the political definition of \"Morganism\" would simply be that politicians were closer to the people. \"Nobody [should] feel afraid to come up to me wherever I am and have a chat,\" he said. Mr Morgan insisted he is not ready to retire as his \"batteries are not burnt out ... I feel no different. It is exhausting at times but at the same time it revitalises you. You have an opportunity to shape the future of Wales. You are not going to give that up lightly just because you feel a bit tired in the morning.\" Mr Morgan said the image of Wales being run by a \"governor general\" figure, in the shape of the secretary of state for Wales, was being eroded. Asked about his greatest achievement as first minister, he said: \"I think the very substantial ... fall in unemployment ... from 7.7% to 4% ... from the start of devolution.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
