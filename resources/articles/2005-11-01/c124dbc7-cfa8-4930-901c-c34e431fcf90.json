Addressing the Faculty of Public Health annual lecture, Ms Hewitt said the government's Choosing Health programme would rely on \"the degree to which we are able to find, and work with, people's will to change\". The tradition of a uniform society accustomed to deferring to authority had made way to a \"diverse, querulous\" population that demanded better, faster services, Ms Hewitt said. The challenge for the NHS was to meet this demand, she said, by creating a supportive and resourced environment which encouraged people to live \"the healthiest possible life\". \"Sustainable social change will never be delivered by conscripting and coercing people into changing the way they behave,\" she said. \"Nor should it. Sustained health improvement needs willing, collaborative, behavioural and cultural change.\" But Ms Hewitt qualified these comments by also stating that the right to a free health service should be balanced by responsibilities to avoid unnecessary health risks. The UK's biggest killers were no longer infectious diseases, but chronic diseases, where risk could be dramatically reduced by lifestyle choices such as quitting smoking, losing weight, and staying active. Personal health plans would be an essential element to help people choose healthier lives, as part of a new contract between \"government and the people\". This was the \"very opposite of the so-called nanny state\", she said. The government would play its part by creating the conditions that people were entitled to expect to improve their health, she explained. In the past, not everyone had been able to choose health because of their income and postcodes, Ms Hewitt said. Efforts to improve access to healthier lives though improving childcare, to better school meals, sport facilities and measures to tackle poverty were part of the government's duty, she said. The government would also seek to remove barriers to health that were beyond individuals' control. But individuals and communities also had a responsibility to act, Ms Hewitt said. \"My basic argument is simple,\" she said. \"Making it work will require a concerted effort from every part of society.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
