I speak in a lot of places and talking so much is dangerous. When I spoke yesterday I wasn't being accurate. \"I wasn't criticising Ronaldo when I said he didn't get involved in defensive work for the team, I was just stating a fact. He gives us great attacking qualities and to give him defensive duties wouldn't suit his characteristics.\" \"Zidane, Figo and Raul, to name the most famous players, all work hard for the team. They know that they shine when the team is playing well and winning titles.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
