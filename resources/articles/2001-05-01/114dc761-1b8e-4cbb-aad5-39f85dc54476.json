At least that's one view on developments in the teaching of the subject once described as the dismal science. The difference between economics today and in 1776 when the Wealth of Nations, was published, can be summed up in one word: maths. These days the subject uses increasingly sophisticated mathematical techniques to analyse how the economy works. That means undergraduates entering most British university courses should have done A-level maths. It isn't yet compulsory at some universities, at Oxford and Cambridge, for instance, entry requirements are still at the discretion of individual colleges. But as Professor Michael Waterson, from the University of Warwick, puts it: \"if you are the kind of student who gave up maths at school, thinking 'thank goodness that's over', economics may not be the right subject for you.\" That said, universities do differ in how much emphasis they put on quantitative skills. At Oxford, the subject is taught as part of the PPE degree - politics, philosophy and economics - and the approach is more on political economy and less on maths. Warwick on the other hand offers a highly rigorous course which demands a fair level of mathematical knowledge. But lack of maths need not be a show stopper: some universities offer catch up courses for the mathematically challenged. Appropriately, the London School of Economics heads our table of the best places to study the subject, followed by Birmingham, then Oxford and Cambridge. The LSE certainly has a high reputation for the quality of its research, although former students warn that not all the big names are involved with teaching. All the lecturers we spoke to, however, said that enthusiasm for the subject was more important than a star-studded publications record. \"You can be an inspiring teacher without being a creative mind,\" said one. The economics curriculum at most universities follows a standard pattern: offering core courses in macro economics and microeconomics and optional subjects like labour, public, health and econometrics. How well the core courses are taught is critical, because economics is a subject where understanding builds up over time. Prof Waterson says a good course will be structured, cumulative and rigorous. Lecturers say that students often find that many of the key concepts do not fall into place until they have been over the material several times, so it may be a good idea to look for a course where the assessment is weighted towards the end of the degree programme. In the collegiate universities, particularly Oxford, most teaching is still done in colleges and the quality can vary enormously between tutors. It's a good idea to find out which colleges have a good reputation for teaching PPE. A good course will place equal emphasis on equipping students with the necessary mathematical skills and on discussing the big questions which make economics interesting. Simply talking about the big issues without having the technical skills is \"half an education\", says Partha Dasgupta, head of the economics department at Cambridge. Professor Dasgupta says the subject attracts a wide variety of students. He has workers from development charities apply because they want to learn more about theories which the World Bank and International Monetary Fund use when advising developing countries on how to run their economies. Economics students go on to many destinations. Some apply to courses with the intention of becoming professional economists - either in the City or at the Bank of England or the Treasury. Professor Waterson says the most common destination for Warwick students is accountancy or banking. What is becoming less and less common is for UK students to go onto to do research degrees. To the alarm of some in the profession, places on PhD courses are increasingly being filled by international rather than UK students. For Partha Dasgupta, the lack of home-grown economics research students is not a concern as long as there are talented students from Eastern Europe and Asia to fill the gaps. \"Some of the best English undergraduates go the United States to do their graduate work,\" he points out. Professor Dasgupta counters accusations that the increasingly mathematical nature of the subject is putting students off. In fact, he says, rather than becoming abstruse and mathematical, the subject is becoming increasingly grounded in real world data. As more data becomes available, the kind of techniques needed to analyse it become more sophisticated. And the subject is getting closer to answering - rather than further away from - the questions which have driven economists ever since Adam Smith first posed them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
