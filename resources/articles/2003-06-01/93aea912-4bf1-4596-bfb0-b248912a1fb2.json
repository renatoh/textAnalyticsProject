But what can you do if it all goes pear-shaped? If you book a package holiday through a reputable travel agent or tour operator, you're in a strong position to sort things out. You have a legal right to expect to receive the holiday you booked and paid for, so the first thing to do is to complain directly to the tour operator as soon as problems occur. This may sound like common sense, but it's also important legally, because if you go on to pursue a claim against the firm, you must show you have taken all reasonable steps to minimize the disruption to your enjoyment. If you want to pursue your complaint once you're back home, the next step is to write to the tour operator, giving full details of what went wrong. The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA), which represents around 70% of travel agents, has a code of conduct which says agents must respond to written complaints with 28 days. If you're not happy with their response, write a second time - again, they have 28 days in which to respond. Depending on what the problem was, and the extent to which they accept responsibility, the company may offer you some kind of refund as a goodwill gesture. Yet Brenda Wall, founder of Holiday Travel Watch, an organisation which advises on travel complaints and lobbies for better redress from tour operators, says many simply apologise for any inconvenience and promise it won't happen again. If you're not happy with the company's response, you have three options: to pursue your complaint through ABTA's independent arbitration service; to take the firm to the small claims court; or to sue them for breach of contract. There are three possible elements to any compensation claim: loss of value (that is, the difference between the value of the holiday you paid for and the one you actually got); out-of-pocket expenses (where the company has to refund any money you had to spend as a result of the breach of contract); and loss of enjoyment. You can also sue for personal injury - if, for example, you contracted food poisoning during an all-inclusive holiday. There are limits to what constitutes a breach of contract, though. Flight delays of up to 10 hours are deemed reasonable, for example, so long as the tour operator offers you refreshments. Any more than that and they must put you up overnight or offer you a refund. Depending on how much you think your claim might be worth, Ms Wall recommends instructing a solicitor who specialises in travel cases. \"If you go through ABTA's arbitration, or down the small claims route, it's likely to be your word against that of an experienced lawyer, so the scales of justice are unbalanced,\" she says. On the other hand, lawyers' fees may be prohibitively expensive, whereas you could claim up to \u00a35,000 through the ABTA arbitration service for just \u00a398.75, or the same amount through the small claims court for \u00a3115. Unless your holiday was a disaster from start to finish, don't expect to get back the full cost. ABTA's arbitrators are not in the business of dispensing goodwill. They work on the assumption that accommodation accounts for just 40% of the holiday cost, for example, so if your hotel was terrible you could only hope for 40% of a total refund. If your travel agent or tour operator is not an ABTA member, or if you bought flights and accommodation separately and direct, pursuing a complaint is likely to be more difficult. Suing a hotel, for example, would require you to appoint lawyers at home and in the relevant country. There's also a particular problem if you buy flights direct from an airline which then goes bust. Charter flight passengers are covered against airline failure by Air Travel Organisers' Licenses, issued by the Civil Aviation Authority - but flight-only deals booked direct with scheduled carriers are not. Buying tickets with a credit card offers some protection, because section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act obliges credit card firms to underwrite purchases of more than \u00a3100 - although this clause was removed from the European Consumer Credit Directive draft last year so the situation may change in 2004. Shopping around for travel insurance that includes scheduled airline failure cover is the safest bet. Some insurers include SAFI up to a fixed limit in their comprehensive policies, or will quote for it as an additional element of cover. It should cost up to around \u00a35 a head.
