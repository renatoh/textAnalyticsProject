At first Sharma sounded like no more than a rumour, maybe even a hoax. He turned out to be a sporting experiment, propelled by the fast-bowling coach Ian Pont. Sharma was a teenage javelin thrower, a cricketing novice with a supreme physique: ballooning pectoral muscles, 28-pack stomach, legs like twin bodybuilding dwarves. Pont's plan was to remould Sharma's javelin hurl into a biomechanically perfect round-arm sling, in the process creating a fast-bowling Frankenstein's monster. Clips appeared on YouTube of Sharma lifting tyres, chopping logs, hurling boulders and even trotting out his muscle-bound slingers in the nets. There were rumours of 100mph-plus speeds. Amazingly, the cricket virgin Sharma was awarded an IPL contract in 2009 by the Rajasthan Royals, as the world awaited the unveiling of this machine man, the conqueror of all cricket. At first glance Sharma doesn't have much in common with Samit Patel, England's returning one-day all-rounder, whose contrasting state of fitness has been much discussed this week. Sharma is perhaps the anti-Patel: physically supreme but equipped with the cricket skills of a newborn baby, or a cat, or a chair leg. It is a polarity worth bearing in mind. Those familiar only with Patel's statistical outline \u2013 a fine county record in all formats \u2013 are likely to be disappointed by his real-life contours if he makes the cut in Bristol. What with all the talk you might be expecting something special: chin-juggling ghee mountain decked out in medical trousers, maternity sweater and a belly wheel. Patel isn't really fat. He isn't exactly a panther. But what we're talking about is perhaps no more than a twin-finger grab of muffin-top around the waistband. This is the source of the swollen body of work dedicated to Patel's swollen body. So intense has been the focus on one man's unchiselled abs it is almost tempting to wonder if there might be something else going on here. If there is a coherent source for the rather unkind public debate over Patel's heft it is the England management's fixation with nurturing a pack-like sense of intimidatory conditioning, the relentless corporate identity that so thrillingly steamrollered the Australians in the winter. The second coming of Chris Tremlett has incorporated a deeply sensual focus on his wonderfully beef-caked physique and that Panzer-tanking rumble to the crease, reminiscent of the Iron Man emerging from the sea clutching a half-eaten tractor in his cocked right hand. International cricket is a physical game now: Australia sped this process along by fielding wonderful players who also happened to look like contact-sport athletes, the all-track bullies Matthew Hayden, Adam Gilchrist and Brett Lee, one glimpse of whose slabbed physique was enough to set Shane Warne off on the path of the slimming pill. With England the preoccupation with physical supremacy may have become a little extreme. Stuart Broad is the glistening epitome of this kind of cricket-athlete: gloriously lean, stamina-loaded and plumbed with mains-pressure game-aggression. Despite this Broad still seems callow when it comes to skills, the high-end devil required of a Test match opening bowler. In another climate it might be Broad being publicly vilified for the failure to develop not his biceps but his bowling, for resembling still an eager, intelligent South Korean bowling robot complete with handsome blond head attachment, and for suggesting at the point of delivery an athletic man doing a brilliant impression of \"bowling\", perhaps an elite high jumper on a skill-swap weekend or a top footballer doing it for a bet. I'm not suggesting Broad might be England's own rarefied version of the log-hurling Sharma \u2013 what American political analysts might term the Atul Broad Possibility \u2013 but he does illuminate how well-developed Patel's cricket skills are. There are plenty of ticks for the fat man: Test-contender standard four-day batting; ODI-level boundary hitting; Twenty20 crease knowhow; useful second-tier left-arm spin. All of these skills were acquired not by double-fisting entire Swiss rolls into his slavering jaws but through hard work. Patel may or may not make it as an England player, but determination cannot be measured by muscle tone alone and here is a man who is plump with acquired cricket knowhow. The multi-format game has made all players into all-rounders, but not everybody can be Imran Khan or MS Dhoni and something must fall by the wayside. Alastair Cook is yet to master the short forms. Kevin Pietersen has lost his 50-over rhythm. For Patel, whose aim is to bat in three formats and bowl in two, it is a hard-won, gym-honed fitness that has remained undeveloped. The skills have been attended to, though, and it is a little depressing that the reward for this has been public humiliation over a little extra heft. Sharma never did play for the Royals. He vanished back into obscurity, body-building's great mystery slingshot pace bowler. If there is any lesson to be drawn from his story it is perhaps simply the indivisible base value of hard-won craft as opposed to hard-worn brawn.
