The surf rolls in too fast for most swimmers - though I see one local man diving for shellfish. Well away from the main road and surrounded by smallholdings of tapioca, cashew and pineapple, this is the kind of palm-fronded paradise that has made Kerala so desirable. But from the bluff that juts out into the bay the view is equally idyllic and far more intriguing. To the right the coastline sweeps towards Trivandrum and, through the spray, vivid with sunlight, I can see an old church steeple and a large pink-and-green mosque. Looking left - or south - is a small, ornate Hindu temple and a homely B&amp;B in the same gaudy style. Behind me, and no less symbolic, is my hotel's licensed bar and restaurant. The cheek-by-jowl proximity of world religions and a tolerance of western customs even while clinging to ancient traditions of dress and behaviour are peculiarly Keralan traits. On the drive over the hill, I pass other key symbols of Keralan life: communist graffiti dominates, alongside flyposters for the Green party and adverts for Ayurvedic treatment at state clinics as well as luxury resorts. Back on the highway, there's a Tibetan craft shop, a sign for a German bakery, and temples that betray Tamil influence. Faces and skintones reveal many other corners of India: Gujaratis, Marwaris, Parsees and Kudumbis have all come to settle in Kerala during centuries past. This rich masala of ideologies, fashions and native character means our experience of Kerala might be rather more than a week of fish curries and sunbathing - though there's nothing wrong with those. Sinna, my guide - the word fails to suggest what good company he was - protested that \"coming to the beach is not coming to Kerala at all, as beach culture is simply not an Indian thing. You're only likely to meet westerners on the beach, and you'll pay European prices for westernised food\". I'd come into the province slowly, via the stunning Unesco temple site at Mamallapuram in Tamil Nadu and a long overnight train journey from Chennai to Kochi. This pretty colonial town is probably the ideal gateway to Kerala, as it compresses in a tiny space the region's ancient history - spices, Judaism, fishing and trading - with that of the later Dutch, Portugese and British settlements. Cosmopolitan, liberal, artsy, Kochi is as welcoming to tourists, expats and backpackers now as it once was to Egyptian sailors and Chinese merchants. Trade goes on here much as it has for centuries. The cantilevered Chinese nets on the main dock provide scant supplies these days, but the ocean-going boats bring in vast catches of bass, catfish and seer fish and huge tiger prawns. The hauls landed, buyers come to negotiate, dressed in bleached white lungis (sarongs) and starched dress shirts, using tiny hand movements to indicate the price they offer and quantity of fish required. Tourists too can buy a fish and take it over to one of the grill restaurants to have it prepared to taste. The Mattancherry Palace (aka Dutch Palace) has another angle on tolerance, as expressed by artistic representations of Krishna. The \"playboy of the Indian epic\" is smiling and lounging around looking ever so innocent, but is actually using his toes to tweak his lovers' nipples and rummaging with his hands through the folds of assorted saris. Just as many Keralan men now stroll around topless, local women once wore very loose covering up top - until the Raj Victorians told them to hide their natural beauty. After a walking tour of Kochi's posh hotels, charming alleyways and a sweet, clove-scented cuppa at a stylish, if very westernised tea shop - this has to be India's best, or only, town for flaneuring - Sinna took me to Kayees. Opened in 1949, this simple canteen serves the best biriani in town for 30 rupees, with forks available if you need them. It opens at noon and 6.30pm every day and each sitting closes when the food runs out. After this, we strolled through Jewtown. Readers of Salman Rushdie's The Moor's Last Sigh will be familiar with the beauty and significance of the Pardesi Synagogue. Built in 1568, it's the oldest extant synagogue in the Commonwealth and while many of its former congregants have relocated to Israel in recent years, the building is well-preserved. Kochi also boasts the oldest European-built Christian temple in India, St Francis Church, formerly the burial place of Vasco de Gama. Jewtown's nearby spice market is an exercise in deconstructing curry, as you wander from warehouse to warehouse drifting through pungent clouds of pepper, turmeric, ginger and star anise. Tourism is helping Kochi upgrade its colonial architecture and reverse the flow of migrants outwards, especially from the so-called \"Anglo\" community. Instead of heading for major cities to the north or overseas, English-speaking middle-class Keralans, many of them Christians, are now staying behind to establish boutique-style homestays in their old family houses in the Fort Kochi district. On the Parade Ground - Kochi's main square, and a screamer for a game of cricket - several works in progress were already beginning to look like classy B&amp;Bs. All this activity, historic and contemporary, makes for a heady dose of culture and information, but it's a short hop from this urbane port town to the backwaters. A man-made network of channels linking three major rivers, some 40 lesser rivers and countless tributaries to the Vembanad lake and several smaller lagoons, this is Kerala's green beach - a vast inland wetlands brimming with wildlife and wondrously peaceful. The rice boats are luxurious, usually coming fitted with two double bedrooms, a sun-lounge space, dining room, en-suite loos and a small kitchen. The chef on board prepared a lunch banquet of pineapple curry, vegetable curry, pomfret fish, ladies fingers and cabbage, with cold glasses of Haywards 500 \"the largest selling strong beer in India\" which, even allowing for teetotal habits elsewhere, must still sell pretty well. Some of the channels get choked by the African reed - aka water hyacinth - thought to have floated over the Arabian Sea, but for the most part you just glide along the calm, obstacle-free surface to the gentle hum of the small motor. Fly-by-nighters often choose to spend just one day, and maybe a night, on the backwaters, but there's more to the region than idling. This is the very heart of Kerala's agricultural wealth and there are communities and working plantations spread all over. From the deck, you only have to focus beyond the hedgerow of waving coconut palms to rice paddies and groves of vanilla, betelnut and cocoa, all located lower than the level of the backwaters. When we stopped at a 1,400-acre plantation called R-block, owned by nine families, I was also witness to ample proof that, far from being a new fad destination, Kerala was pretty fashionable - though for a more aristocratic visitor - back in the 1950s and 60s: the visitors' book contained the signatures of Jacqueline Kennedy, VP Singh and Rajiv Gandhi, as well as numerous district collectors (\"basically, gods,\" quipped Sinna) and visiting Soviet dignitaries. The latter are a reminder of the link between local left-wing politics and Kerala's forward-looking agrarian policies. Back in 1967, one assistant collector had praised the backwater dykes of the \"Holland of Kerala\" as evidence of \"the triumph of Man over nature\". Stone walls keep the water at bay, with bunds - or locks - to allow flooding of the rice fields. But the skies provide more entertainment, with bird life everywhere. The common pond heron is known as the \"paddy bird\", and he shares the channels with white-breasted kingfishers, bee-eaters, egrets, terns and the magnificent brahminy kite, which we saw plummeting down at great speed to nab a fish supper. I could have slept on the boat but opted to stay over at Coconut Lagoon, the backwater resort that pioneered the Kerala boutique-shack look by dismantling and relocating an old rural residence. There was a lavish buffet restaurant on site, as well as an ultra-hip cocktail bar playing Bangalore-club dance beats and soft Indianised jungle. But we stole off to a Toddy Bar to eat a basic chilli-charred fish and drink coconut sap firewater with the local farmers. Toddy smells like ammonia and tastes like watery tequila laced with coconut milk, but I got neither the mild inebriation promised nor - the following day - the extreme diarrhoea that apparently assails even regular users. Some of our fellow drinkers were quaffing a rough, artificial version called Anamayaki, or \"Puts Elephants to Sleep\" while talking politics and prices. After the gorgeous retreat of the backwaters we returned to the coast road - the NH47 - skirting the clifftop resorts at Varkala, the ugly, bustling market town of Kollam and Kerala's capital, Trivandrum. We would also take in Kovalam which, many people had told me had become \"too modern\", overdeveloped, swamped by hawkers, and was slowly succumbing to death by charter. I drove down at 7pm to see the two beaches framed by rocky headlands, all bathed in a strange blue-orange light coming from a dying sunset. The scene was tame and tranquil, something like an English seaside resort with Maldives vegetation: Indian families strolling at the edge of the surf, honeymooners having their photo taken with the lighthouse, and Chinese, English and Indians sitting down to eat freshly caught mullet and butterfish by candlelight. However, at the Coconut Grove restaurant they offered chow meins - middle-class Keralans often prefer Chinese food for dinner. There was less hustling than on Brick Lane and the shops I went into - a jewellers and Mr Joseph's spice shop - were delightful and soft sell. After dark, Kovalam's other self - the fishing port - is more in evidence, with lights twinkling far out to sea. Using the vast nets made from coir (the coconut rope that is as much a staple of the Keralan economy as the fruit itself), large teams of 30 or 40 men sail out beyond the breakers on traditional vallams (fishing boats). Before I left Trivandrum, I asked the taxi driver to take me past the Communist HQ of Kerala. The office was closed for a Hindu festival - Trotsky would have gone even redder in the face if he'd witnessed Kerala's respectfully religious style of people's revolution - but there was no mistaking the importance of the building: a massive three-dimensional steel hammer and sickle was hanging over the main portico. With the old Ambassador car parked outside, it could have been Havana - but here people have chosen Marxism and modified it over the years to suit their whims. As a branding exercise, Kerala ranks with Bollywood and Bangalore, and there's no doubting the soft adventure appeal of the fertile coastal region when compared with other, more clamorous corners of this vast nation. But Kerala is built on coming and going, trading and touring and the current trends - whether package tourism, boutique hotels or massage-and-meat-free health sojourns - will no doubt be absorbed into the Keralan world-view with time. Where else will you find Zoroastrians who follow the Premier League, commies worshipping Krishna, and north-Europeans paying good money to be oiled up for a thorough two-hour massage followed by a glass of lukewarm water designed not to stimulate the \"fire\" in their alimentary canal? At the end of the 19th century, Swamy Vivekananda called Kerala a \"lunatic asylum of castes\". There may still be a kind of madness to the mix here, but there's nothing like variety for encouraging neighbourliness and understanding - from the beaches to the backwaters, Kerala offers strict Hinduism, genteel hedonism and everything in between.
