The first English-language book written by the Mexican author, Lost Children Archive is inspired by the plight of the tired, poor and huddled masses of refugee children who have fled danger and persecution, only to find that themselves interned or turned away from the US. In other words, it\u2019s about one of the most important stories of our times. It\u2019s a cry for compassion and empathy and the ideal book to round off this turbulent, difficult decade. But there\u2019s more to it than politics. In the New York Times, the critic Parul Sehgal called Luiselli\u2019s book a \u201cmould breaking new classic\u201d, saying: \u201cThe novel truly becomes novel again in her hands \u2013 electric, elastic, alluring, new. And the story of the migrant, she believes, insists upon a new form: How else to tell a story that has no end?\u201d In the Guardian, Lucy Hughes-Hallett pointed out that it\u2019s also a road-trip novel, referencing the Odyssey, The Children\u2019s Crusade, Jack Kerouac and Cormac McCarthy. \u201cLuiselli is an ambitious writer,\u201d says Hughes-Hallett, discussing the novel\u2019s multiple narrative viewpoints, virtuoso writing and cleverness. Happily, we are also told to expect warmth and humour. So while Lost Children Archive sounds like a serious work of literature, there should be plenty of scope for discussion and enjoyment. It\u2019s also worth noting that, in a first for the reading group, the book that has come out of the hat was nominated by a Guardian journalist, Richard Lea. It is going to be fun to put him on the spot and see how his choice measures up. More importantly, I\u2019m also very keen to hear what you make of it. I hope you\u2019ll join me. Thanks to publisher 4th Estate, we have five copies to give to the first five people from the UK to post \u201cI want a copy please\u201d, along with a nice, constructive thought in the comments section below.
