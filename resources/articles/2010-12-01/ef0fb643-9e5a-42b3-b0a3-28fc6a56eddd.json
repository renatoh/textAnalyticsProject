And yet still Ann Widdecombe managed to entertain by allowing her partner Anton Du Beke to manhandle her around the dancefloor. In fact never was Widdy better than when neither of her feet were in contact with the ground. The image of her in a harness, flying towards Du Beke with arms flapping as the floor came up to greet her, is not one easily erased from the viewer's mind. Likewise, the couple's paso doble \u2013 a dance that had previously reached its Strictly lowpoint with John Sergeant's famously stompy rendition \u2013 was quite jawdropping, as Ann was dragged around the floor to Wild Thing \"like an appliance \u2026 a hoover or something\". A hoover in a bonkers yellow be-frilled frock: the costumes \u2013 sequinned palazzo pants, brightly coloured ankle-length leggings, lots of boleros \u2013 have been as dotty as the dancing. Then there was a 12-point salsa that Widdy declared \"Queen Victoria could have watched without blushing\". , although she forgot what she was doing halfway through. There was also a samba that largely depended on du Beke's brute strength. He whizzed Widdecombe round in a style most often seen in primary school playgrounds; at one point grabbing hold of her ankle while she hopped round in a kind of pirouette, marabou dress trim bobbing, banana yellow leggings on display. But while a large portion of many of Widdy's best dances seemed to involve her lying down while Du Beke dragged her around a bit and danced, she did at least manage to stay mostly upright for the pair's take on Titanic, a hilarious production which looked as if it had used up most of the world's supply of dry ice, and in which Widdy moved at a pace that fittingly, could only be described as glacial."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
