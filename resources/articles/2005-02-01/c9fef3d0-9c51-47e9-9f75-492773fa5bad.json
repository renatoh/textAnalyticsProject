If life continues, it will never be the same again. If it doesn't, there's not long to beg mercy with the man upstairs, or indeed get those library books back. As it turns out, it's just a cold snap and things got a bit lairy at Wetherspoons last night, but the Fiver can be forgiven for waking this morning and thinking the apocalyptic worst: Chelsea have lost twice. In a week. And 007-cool Jose Mourinho isn't just shaken or stirred, he's downright apoplectic. Or at least, we assume he is. He hasn't spoken to the media since his post-defeat temper tantrum last night, in which he and his tensely-extended index finger accused Barcelona coach Frank Rijkaard of influencing referee Anders Frisk, who sent Didier Drogba off approximately 11 minutes after the alleged conversation. Today Uefa are still waiting for Chelsea's official complaint, but fully expect it to arrive scrawled in the back of an exercise book, contain extensive references to hatred, unfairness and Marilyn Manson, and conclude by theatrically threatening suicide if they don't get their own way. \"I said to Frisk, 'Hello, pleased to see you,' and something about the game - not in an aggressive way,\" insisted Rikjaard, sticking to an explanation as convincing as his haircut is credible. Rumours also abound as to an informal half-time rendezvous between Mourinho's backside and Barca backroom boots, but both clubs have poured cold water on that story, and flushed its head down the bog for good measure. Whatever went on, it was enough to provoke an increasingly familiar attack of the Queen Victorias in Mourinho, who could now be penalised for skipping the post-match press conference to swill 20/20 and smash up benches at the local rec. * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I really need complete rest for a few weeks, but we're just trying to get through until the end of the season\" - kicking lumps out of everything that moves has finally taken its toll on Blackburn's scowling Scottish whippet Paul Dickov. * * * * * * * * * * * JOLLY RUBBISH CHAPS People, all of whom are bonkers, fancy teams for a variety of arcane reasons. Back in the 1990s, hordes of non-Germans developed a liking for Borussia Dortmund simply because of those foxy black-'n'-dayglo jerseys; puritans worship West Brom because of the 'no smoking' logo they once had emblazoned across their kit, and the Fiver frequently decides to love or hate a team solely on the basis of its name. Our favourite club? The Mysterious Dwarfs, who play, of course, in Ghana's first division. Our least favourite outfit? All your dull-as-the-daily-commute Uniteds, Cities and Argyles. The club we're frankly baffled by? Why, that has to be the team taking on Middlesbrough in tonight's hotly, well, hardly-anticipated Euro Vase showdown: the 'Dear Gentlemen of Gack'. Whatever they were on about when they plumped for that moniker, the one thing that is sure is that Liebherr GAK, from the Austrian city of Graz (and therefore disconcertingly close to the Young Boys of Berne), arrived at the Riverside today with fire in their bellies. Perhaps emboldened by the knowledge that their last trip to England saw them beat Liverpool 1-0, the Spiffing Fellows have been spouting angry words, with captain Anton Ehmann bellowing that Boro were \"arrogant, defensive and destructive\" in the first leg. \"We weren't happy with the 2-2 draw at our place; Middlesbrough are a decent team but certainly not one we fear,\" continued the leader of a mob who in recent weeks have been battered by Mattersburg and (another Fiver favourite) FC Superfund. Given that they'll be without suspended striker Roland Kollmann - the competition's joint top-scorer - serious observers must surely conclude that the Lovely Darlings will only reach the next round if, bearing in mind that several feet of snow are forecast to fall between now and full-time, they've cunningly brought their skis with them. * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Fernando Hierro, aged 247, will finally retire from football at the end of the season. Kleberson is leaving Manchester United's bench to join Corinthians. \"We had a 90% chance before - now we have a 99% chance,\" cooed his Mr 10% as the Fiver searched desperately for a percentage-based pay-off.
