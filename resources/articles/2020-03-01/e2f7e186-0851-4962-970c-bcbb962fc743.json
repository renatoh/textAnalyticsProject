Only footy; so why did Richmond v Carlton have to go ahead while the country struggles to come to terms with the mounting crisis? This was the cognitive dissonance curtain-raiser. The footy in question was committed but underwhelming. As expected, last season\u2019s premiers triumphed over the side that finished third from bottom. The one-sided first-half, especially the speed with which Richmond established their lead, meant the action did not hold the attention, highlighting the essential value of a crowd in supplying the sense of theatre live sport demands, especially when it\u2019s elevated to a TV main event. This was reinforced in the second half when Carlton staged an unlikely fightback, one lacking the palpable sense of jeopardy with which the yo-yoing emotions cascading from the stands should have furnished. The symbolism of the naked MCG could not be avoided. This colossal monument to the significance of sport in Australian life stripped bare. This time last year there were over 85,000 jammed in screaming themselves hoarse. The last time football graced the venue no seat was untaken. Just 11 days ago at the record-breaking Women\u2019s T20 World Cup final it was the backdrop to a vital and vibrant celebration of women\u2019s cricket that took the breath away. On Thursday it was apologetically quiet. Ordinarily the umpire\u2019s whistle pierces the air for the briefest of darts, its presence announcing a wave of caterwauling that engulfs the precise trill, swallowing it whole. But when Simon Meredith put his instrument to his lips the note carried over the Great Southern Stand and into the Yarra Park night unimpeded. It was hollow. There was a hollowness to everything. The AFL machine has become masterful at fashioning grand occasions from what was previously routine. Round one is no exception, topped by the now-annual G-filling Tigers v Blues blockbuster. The near six-month off-season begins each September with a clear waypoint on the horizon, providing a focus for each subsequent week of denial, before anticipation builds to the inevitable release. And then this. No pilgrimage to Jolimont Station. Goals dumped into vacant rows of seats. A facsimile of a scene featuring a stellar cast but not the all-important support. There was a knowingly performative element to the entire spectacle. There is no question the players gave their all in pursuit of premiership points, but the set-piece around it and efforts to make it seem like business as usual may as well have been Vera Lynn serenading the troops. The world as we know it might be crumbling around us but for a few minutes there was footy and everything was OK. Instead of bellowing out their raucous club song after the final siren, Richmond could have warbled We\u2019ll Meet Again. Who knows how many more matches there will be? Probably not many before at least some kind of suspension. An AFL figure contracting coronavirus seems a matter of when, not if, starting a domino rally that can only end one way. The NBA had Rudy Gobert, the Premier League Mikel Arteta, the AFL? In some respects Gobert and Arteta probably did their competitions a favour, alerting authorities of the need to act urgently, and providing them with the incentive to do so. The bird\u2019s eye view of a football oval mid-match has always resembled a petri dish with players dotted around like spores. \u201cI can almost guarantee that some time in the next couple of weeks, someone at an AFL club or an NRL club or an A-League club is going to test positive for this virus,\u201d said Dr Peter Brukner, the man with the most accomplished CV in sports medicine. \u201cI think it is pretty much a certainty. What happens then?\u201d During the half-time commercial break a government advisory reminded of the need to provide social distancing. The football broadcast resumed with a highlights package of players making a mockery of that advice. Again, the cognitive dissonance kicked in. Was it admirably defiant or needlessly cavalier? This season marks the third iteration of the AFL\u2019s marketing campaign based around the slogan \u2018Don\u2019t believe in never\u2019. This year\u2019s spin sees three of the four words crossed out until only believe remains. It\u2019s run-of-the-mill sporting hyperbole but in these uncertain times it carries a much more powerful message. The AFL lived its brand on Thursday. Let\u2019s hope belief continues to prevail."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
