Speaking on the ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A program, the Indigenous singer-songwriter, of Arrernte and Gurindji heritage, said Australia could not have a united national celebration on the anniversary of New South Wales being declared a British colony. \u201cThe fact of the matter is that it doesn\u2019t include us, it excludes us.\u201d he said. \u201cIt excludes anyone who has any type of sympathy or empathy towards our story, which is a hell of a lot of Australians. To call it Australia Day is wrong.\u201d Sultan made the comments in response to a question by a D\u2019harawal Saltwater woman, Shannon Foster, in the wake of two Melbourne councils voting to scrap Australia Day celebrations and citizenship ceremonies out of support for the campaign to change the date. The attorney general George Brandis, whose ministerial colleague Alex Hawke stripped those two councils of their right to perform any citizenship ceremonies in the wake of their Australia Day declarations, said there was a \u201cnatural logic\u201d to marking the national day as \u201cthe point in time in which the Australia we now recognise, modern Australia, had its beginning\u201d, while still reflecting on \u201cthose parts of our history that are dark passages\u201d. That\u2019s a problem, Sultan said, because it consigns those problems to history when issues including suicide and an over-representation in deaths in custody remained pressing issues for Indigenous Australians today. \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated issue but also very simple as well,\u201d he said. \u201cDoes it include everyone or doesn\u2019t it? No, it doesn\u2019t. Don\u2019t call it Australia Day.\u201d Sultan is featured on a song by the Indigenous hip-hop outfit AB Original, the \u201csubtext\u201d of which, Q&amp;A\u2019s host, Tony Jones, suggested, was that Australia Day was racist. There was no subtext, Sultan said. \u201cAustralia Day\u2019s always been racist \u2026 It\u2019s pretty straight up about it \u2026 it is racist.\u201d When the Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie said she did not support changing the date of Australia Day and agreed with a questioner who felt the number of immigrants who did not speak English was changing the character of Australia, Sultan remarked: \u201cHeaven forbid you lose your culture.\u201d Lambie said her priority was in closing the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians, saying: \u201cThe gap is killing us.\u201d Brandis agreed: \u201cThis is a debate about symbols. I think symbols are very important \u2026 [but] those practical outcomes matter even more.\u201d \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d Sultan said. \u201cI think one of those practical things to do is to stop ignoring Aboriginal people when they tell you what we\u2019re looking for and what we need \u2026 This is me as an Aboriginal person telling you how an Aboriginal person feels and you\u2019re telling me I don\u2019t feel that way.\u201d The Labor frontbencher Tony Burke said it was \u201cdishonest\u201d to pretend there was not a problem with the way Australia Day was viewed in the public consciousness, and said the date itself \u201cmust evolve\u201d. \u201cWe need as a country to be able to find a day where the whole nation can celebrate together,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that\u2019s an incredibly valuable thing. And we should be working to be able to achieve that as well.\u201d Burke said he supported calls by the prominent Indigenous broadcaster Stan Grant to amend the plaques on statues of colonial figures including Captain James Cook and the NSW governor Lachlan Macquarie to acknowledge that the land they claimed was occupied. \u201cAnyone who was told that this nation was discovered by Captain Cook was told something that is factually untrue,\u201d he said. \u201cJust factually untrue.\u201d Brandis said that amending the statutes would be akin to an Orwellian destruction of history, saying they stand as monuments to history as it was interpreted at a certain point in time. Lambie proposed simply adding a new plaque addressing any factual errors or omissions in the original plaque. \u201cIf that\u2019s not telling the whole truth, then we do the right thing, we lead by example, we put in another plaque and we tell the Australian people the truth,\u201d she said. Christine Forster, a Liberal councillor and sister of the former prime minister Tony Abbott, said she did not think the majority of Australians supported either changing the date or changing the plaques. Forster, a prominent gay rights advocate who is campaigning for a \u201cyes\u201d vote on the postal survey on marriage equality, said that despite her misgivings the survey did offer Australia the chance to have \u201can Ireland moment\u201d, referencing the 2015 poll when Ireland voted 62% in favour of marriage equality. \u201cIt will be the point in time where we say that we recognise that every single Australian is equal before the law and should be recognised as such,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we embrace that as a country and as a community and we can move on from there.\u201d Forster, who with her partner has six children, said concerns that legalising same-sex marriage would lead to an increase in same-sex couples having children were ill-founded, because same-sex couples already had children. \u201cThe sexuality of the parent is not the important thing; the important thing is the quality of the parenting,\u201d she said. Forster, Burke and Brandis, who have all said they will vote yes on the postal survey, said suggestions subsequent legislation to change the Marriage Act would do anything beyond allowing two people of the same gender to marry was \u201cscaremongering\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
