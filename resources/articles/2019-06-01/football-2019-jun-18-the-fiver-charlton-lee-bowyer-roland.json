Then there was Hatchet Man, the column that went in hardest. The good old days. So, imagine our surprise when, a little after 5pm on Monday, Charlton Athletic published what at first appeared to be the kind of biting satire we haven\u2019t served up since (um, yeah, we\u2019ll get back to you on that one) \u2026 with its behind-the-scenes take on contract negotiations, replete with passive-aggressive accusations of unrealistic wage demands and the influence of Mr 15%s. Only, it turns out it was a real-life actual football club statement. At some stage on Monday, Charlton owner and serial fan-angerer Roland Duch\u00e2telet started emitting words in the fresh and funky style. \u201cLee [Bowyer, the manager] has been offered a one-year extension to his contract at a level which is approximately three times what he had since his last increase when he became permanent manager in September [2018]. It is six times what he earned when he started as assistant manager in 2017 and 50% more than what any Charlton manager previously had (excluding the Premier League years) \u2026 But Lee wanted much more.\u201d Oof! As kicks to the swingers go to a manager who has just taken the club back into the Championship, it was quite a hefty one. The statement then rambled on about Bowyer\u2019s choice of Mr 15% and hinted at a potential conflict of interest before revealing that the club would look for a new manager unless Bowyer chose to stay. You might think after a public doing-over that could only have been made worse had Bowyer been tarred and feathered while being force-fed \u00a350 notes in The Valley centre-circle [or at one end of the ground due to safety concerns \u2013 Fiver Ed], he\u2019d have launched himself through the door marked Do One. However \u2026 \u201cBowyer stays, the journey continues\u201d cheered an Addicks social media disgrace post on Tuesday morning. \u201cThis has been a long process and I never wanted to leave, I love this club,\u201d sniffed Bowyer. \u201cI\u2019d like to thank the owner for giving me the initial opportunity and now for continuing to believe in me,\u201d he added, after scrawling his signature on a one-year extension. Duch\u00e2telet has form when it comes to getting staff members to work for less than what they feel they are worth and it is not clear whether he has been successful in doing this with Bowyer. But in any case, Duch\u00e2telet\u2019s desperation to flog Charlton as soon as possible means Bowyer might have a new boss soon, one who won\u2019t spit his dummy out at every bump in the road or seriously suggest that the Football League, in which the club competes, should buy the team. Miffed Addicks fans will certainly hope so. But this is football, where good owners are as rare as unfunny tea-timely emails about football. So, don\u2019t hold your breath.
