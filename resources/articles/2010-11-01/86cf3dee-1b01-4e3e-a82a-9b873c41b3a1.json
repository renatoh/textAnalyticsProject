However for Edits, their latest production, the six men all come dressed as women: vamps, coquettes, hostesses with marcel-waved hair. Dressed by Sandy Powell in tea frocks, Lurex and sweeping velvet gowns, they look both elegant and very scary. In many ways, Edits is like an abstract dance of a silent film. Organised around three free-standing wooden frames, Anderson's choreography is divided into dance equivalents of the closeup or the cinematic take \u2013 intense little solos or duets that are contained within a spotlight or one of the frames. Sudden shifts of light, or a convulsive, jerky move then create the equivalent of a cinematic edit, as the dancers switch to another configuration. The vocabulary, too, is a distillation of film. Anderson bases an entire solo on the quivering play of emotion across a dancer's face \u2013 on a gestural flourish or a swooning embrace. And with the atmospheric additions of dry ice and Steve Blake's otherworldly score, the piece starts to feel like a gallery of the cinematic living dead: stiff, anguished characters emoting within the prison of their ancient celluloid roles. As a concept it is delicious \u2013 but as dance it becomes increasingly frustrating. During the work's 70 minutes, Anderson limits herself almost entirely to these small, fraying, inward vignettes, and only at the end does she expand into the dynamic, meticulously constructed ensembles that are her special strength. I wish I'd seen Edits in a different venue, though. For the Village Underground, it has been reconfigured as a promenade event, not a conventional stage performance. And for a piece that's all about composition and perspective, it feels perverse to be given only restricted, random views."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
