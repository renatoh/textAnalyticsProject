It\u2019s not traditionally part of my culinary culture. Its more popular sibling, Florence fennel \u2013 with its cultivated bulbs \u2013 is now a mainstream presence in salads, raw or roasted. One of the first and most memorable ways I\u2019ve ever eaten it was 15 years ago, when fennel bulbs were all the rage, at Sant Ambroeus in New York. It was served Sicilian style: thinly shaved fennel and raw artichokes, Parmigiano-Reggiano, orange and mint. It was a total revelation to a small-town girl from Sydney. Fennel is in the umbel family, which includes carrots and coriander. Unlike Florence fennel, bronze fennel \u2013 Foeniculum vulgare purpureum \u2013 will not form a bulb. A lesser-known variety, it doesn\u2019t quite make a regular appearance in grocery stores or even farmers\u2019 markets. However, it\u2019s actually pretty available \u2013 you\u2019ve probably seen it growing wild by the roadside, and you can buy seeds and potted plants at nurseries. Its culinary uses abound. I\u2019ve had bronze fennel stems pickled, the leaves in soups and salads, and on meat and fish. When visiting my husband\u2019s family in New Zealand, I spotted wild fennel everywhere. It was confusing to me, when I wanted to use it for dinner. I was told by his family: \u201cOh no, we don\u2019t eat that!\u201d. When I questioned why, they said: \u201cIt\u2019s poisonous!\u201d I had just come from my first Attica experience where I was presented, proudly, with railway-line-foraged yellow sorrel flowers in a broth. So much stigma surrounds commonly sighted \u201cinvasive weeds\u201d that we have lost sight of what is edible and highly nutritious. We would be doing the world and our health a service to make them a regular part of our diet. Obviously where we source these \u201cweeds\u201d is extremely important. You would not want to pick and eat something from a chemically sprayed or highly polluted environment. As with herbs, which is really an interchangeable word for weeds, it is best to grow bronze fennel yourself if you can. As a bonus, it is a highly attractive plant, easy on the eye and desirable to all the insect pollinators around. It will become the life force of your garden or balcony, drawing bees, butterflies and hover flies galore. The dreamy fronds of smokey plumes come with an explosion of floral clusters, the most happy shade of fluoro yellow. It is a stunning contrast and will thrum and dance with constant insect activity. As for the taste, my friend chef Pasi Petanen\u2019s constant critique whenever trying out any food unfamiliar to him is: \u201cIt will be better if it has dill in it.\u201d I wholeheartedly agree. I would never suggest to him that these herbs are interchangeable to a home cook, but don\u2019t worry, yes you can. Just don\u2019t tell Pasi. Recently, I had a bronze fennel dish that will be seared forever in my palate, like the first time I ate raw Florence fennel in a salad. At the innovative and outstanding Kadeau, in Copenhagen, chefs Nicolai N\u00f8rregaard and Kyumin Hahn used it in a dessert. I\u2019ve eaten some remarkable things since then, but this dessert stands out like the north star in a sky full of diamonds. Perfumed, semi-dried damson plums, glazed with a tart rose-hip syrup, a delicately bitter taste tempered with the fresh herbaceous hint of meadowsweet leaves, and the liquorice aniseed of young bronze fennel tips, rounded off with fragrant wild carrot seed oil. It\u2019s a genius dish, using like with like and herbs as the sweetening component. My first Florence fennel was presented in a traditional context, and this was a thoroughly modern one. That\u2019s the beauty of humble, everyday sidewalk ingredients. When they are used so cleverly, they hide in plain sight, then elevate the whole. Bronze fennel pistou-ish A key pantry staple that can be pulled out to be put on absolutely anything that you\u2019d want to pep up. Served with raw, roasted or steamed vegetables it makes for a delicious dip. It\u2019s brilliant stirred into soups, and thinned out it can be used as a salad dressing. It keeps refrigerated for a month, but in my household it never lasts that long. My husband sneaks a spoonful every time we open the fridge 1 cup packed organic bronze fennel, chopped \u00bd cup packed organic parsley, chopped \u00bc cup organic pumpkin seeds, soaked overnight in apple cider vinegar then dehydrated in the oven at 60C until dry 2 cups best quality extra virgin olive oil 2 organic wax free lemons, zested and halved 6 cloves organic garlic, chopped 2 tbs sea salt 5 spicy organic fresh chillies \u00bd cup grated Parmigiano-Reggiano In a blender, or if you\u2019re keen a mortar and pestle, blitz or pound the pumpkin seeds, garlic, chilli, bronze fennel and parsley with one cup of olive oil. Slowly keep adding oil so your blades don\u2019t get stuck. If pounding, add oil towards the end. When the ingredients are a rough paste, stir in the salt, lemon zest and Parmigiano-Reggiano. Scoop out whenever you\u2019re walking past the fridge with whatever chip, veg or spoon you have on hand."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
