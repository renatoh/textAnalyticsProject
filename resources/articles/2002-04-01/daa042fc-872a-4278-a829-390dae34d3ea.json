X-rays yesterday confirmed that Newcastle's striker had broken his nose in a collision with his former club-mate Robert Lee at Derby on Saturday. The accident came eight weeks after Shearer suffered the same damage against another former Newcastle player, Steve Howey, in the FA Cup win over Manchester City. But the former England captain, who also had five stitches in a head wound after the collision at Derby, shrugged aside suggestions that his injuries would keep him out of Newcastle's side. Shearer intends to play against Charlton on Saturday in the continuing pursuit of his 200th Premiership goal as Newcastle attempt to clinch Champions League qualification in their last four games. He insisted: \"It won't be a problem. After all, it's not the first time I have played with a broken nose. Fortunately it doesn't look as though I will need an operation and, provided they take the stitches out of my head wound before Saturday, there should be no problems.\" Shearer was not aware that he had collided with his biggest friend in football until he fully recovered his senses in the dressing room. \"I wasn't too happy with the fact that I stayed in the dressing room while he went back on with his head bandaged,\" he joked. \"But Rob and I and our wives all had dinner on Saturday night and we both looked a sorry sight.\" Meanwhile Newcastle's manager Bobby Robson will keep faith with the out-of-form striker Carl Cort even though he admits his \u00a37m signing will not be back to his best until next season. Cort, who has scored once in eight games since returning from knee and ankle injuries, was pulled off at Derby after another unconvincing performance. Robson predicted: \"Carl will come good and I will keep faith with him because I recognise his quality and I know what he can do.\" But Shearer's determination to play and the expected return of fit-again Craig Bellamy - the PFA's young player of the year - before the end of the season means that the Newcastle manager faces a difficult selection decision. Robson's team, currently fourth, are assured of at least a Uefa Cup place but they have their sights trained on finishing in the top four to qualify for the Champions League. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
