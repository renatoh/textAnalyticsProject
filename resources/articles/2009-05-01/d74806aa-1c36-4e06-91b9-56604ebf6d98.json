This place is like home for the big South African. He has raised a family here, in a house off the 16th fairway of the West Course. He has put his mark on it, too, remodelling many of the famous old holes. He won seven World Match Play titles here and when the BMW Championship starts today he will be looking to add any victory to that outrageous record of achievement. \"Sure, it would be nice to win this week,\" he says with a wry smile. Sure, it would be, but if one of the great conundrums in modern golf remains unsolved \u2013 how is it that Els has won so many matchplay events at Wentworth, but not one strokeplay tournament there \u2013 then one suspects that the pain will quickly subside, although not because of any lack of ambition on the part of the player. Indeed, despite rumours to the contrary, Els remains as driven as ever but where once a loss on the course came as a crushing blow, now it is tempered by a healthy perspective, the lasting legacy of personal experience. It is three years since Els' son Ben was diagnosed with autism, and 10 months since the golfer and his family \u2013 wife Liezl, 10-year-old daughter Samantha and Ben, aged six \u2013 moved from Wentworth to Palm Beach, Florida, in search of a better life for all, and the best treatment possible for Ben. \"He is quite severely touched by autism, but he is doing great, really great,\" Els says. \"There aren't that many schools for kids like Ben in this country, although there are places where people would look after him. But they were not really educational places. In Florida, he goes to a school where there is one teacher for every two kids. He also has a private tutor who goes with him everywhere.\" Yet if any mention of Ben's progress illuminates Els face with delight, it also stirs deep gratitude. He is only too aware, he admits, that others do not have the financial wherewithal to alleviate, or at least challenge, the worst effects of autism, a neurobiological disorder that is without cure. \"I didn't know a thing about autism before, other than that it was just something that happened to other people. But when Ben was about three years old it was obvious that there was something wrong \u2013 he wasn't walking properly, he wasn't making eye contact,\" Els says. \"We started going round the circuit of doctors and consultants and specialists and they kept telling us 'He's fine'. But I am just a dumb professional golfer and I knew there was something wrong.\" There was. Like one in 150 children born in the UK and the United States, Ben Els had been touched by autism. \"That was perhaps the most shocking thing about all of this \u2013 the number of people it affects,\" says Els, whose wife bore the greater share of the early responsibilities that came with Ben's condition, especially as the family sought a definitive diagnosis. Els played his part, too, while at the same time trying to maintain his high-profile career. Inevitably, his game suffered \u2013 not that he ever made the connection between his dip in form and Ben's condition, either publicly or even privately. He still doesn't, although he will concede that he was often frustrated by ill-informed critics. \"There were a few times I would be sitting there and you guys would be asking questions and I would be thinking to myself 'I don't give a flying you-know-what about golf right now, I've got other things going on',\" he says. \"It was particularly bad in South Africa. When I went back there they were saying all sorts of things \u2013 I've lost my drive, I'm not practising, I'm drinking too much \u2013 and I was like, 'You have got no idea'.\" They did get the idea after Els and his wife went public in their support of Autism Speaks, a charity that aims to raise awareness about the condition, as well as raise money to help find a cure. Just over a year ago the player turned up at a PGA Tour event in Florida with the organisation's logo stitched into his golf bag. \"Liezl and I are really private people but we discussed it at length and we decided it was time for us to start making an effort to raise money and let people know about autism,'' he says. \"We did it in a way that would make people come to us and ask, rather than going out there and shouting about it. We just didn't want people to feel sorry for us \u2013 it is not just our family that is dealing with this, it is millions of people all over the world. We are in a really good position compared to people who have to work \u2013 and I mean really work, not play golf.\" If Els has long been a world-class golfer, then he clearly shows a bit of promise as a fund-raiser. Last month he rustled up a few of his buddies, the likes of Gary Player and Jack Nicklaus, for a pro-am in Florida and managed to raise $700,000 (\u00a3450,000). There will be more where that came from, he pledges, and for many years to come. On a broader stage, the hope is to encourage governments in this country and in the US to provide more and better facilities for educating autistic children (Els cites state-of-the-art facilities in Singapore and Dubai as the model). On a personal level, he just wants the world to know his son better. \"Ben is going to get bigger and will be around a lot of public places. He might act a little differently, he might say things a little differently, but, hell, he's not going to pull out a gun,\" Els says. \"He is a loving kid and I want to take him around society. I don't want to hide the fact he is autistic.\" For further information on Autism Speaks visit www.autismspeaks.org.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
