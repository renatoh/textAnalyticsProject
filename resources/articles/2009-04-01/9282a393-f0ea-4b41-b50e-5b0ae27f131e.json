The non-combat zone of Match of the Day's sofas was a safe setting from which to decline invitations from Joe Kinnear to become a Newcastle coach and Steve McClaren to join the England set-up. The former England captain was saving himself for just the right managerial opportunity. Only on first inspection is it the wrong opportunity to take charge of a side 18th in the Premier League, two points from safety, in a week when Chelsea are motoring north in search of an easy kill at St James' Park. Mike Ashley's money alone would not have smoked Shearer out of Gary Lineker's debating salon. The last of the Geordie Messiahs will have examined his squad, studied the fixtures, looked at the other struggling sides around him (West Brom and Middlesbrough look cooked), taken account of the burst of enthusiasm his appointment will bring and gambled that he is on to a sure-fire winner. Shearer thinks in outcomes. He most likely imagines himself leading the club he loved as a boy to safety while some other poor saps drop into the Championship. Newcastle's trips to Liverpool, Spurs and Aston Villa on the final day are daunting, but home games against Portsmouth, Boro and Fulham look winnable. After the Chelsea game comes a visit to Stoke, by which time the whole of Tyneside will have swung behind this great escapology trick. Finishing 17th in the league is his short-cut to managerial grandeur. Roy Keane, to whom he stood up so memorably in their playing days in a clash of the hard men, started when Sunderland were in peril of falling into League One. Another contemporary, Paul Ince, set out with Macclesfield and Milton Keynes. Tony Adams tried his hand at Wycombe before presiding over the end of Pompey's FA Cup-winning pomp. This way Shearer can achieve maximum credit for minimum energy expended. \"How to become a hero all over again in seven weeks\" is surely his next book. Like all on Tyneside, though, he remains vulnerable to the whims of an owner who bought a club without properly checking how many debts were stacked in cupboards, ignored Mark Hughes to bring back Kevin Keegan, replaced 'Special K' with a throwback with a history of heart trouble and then decided Chris Hughton could save the team from relegation. Playing the people against cockney invaders could not save Keegan, and Shearer will need an even greater swell of popular sentiment to secure absolute command of the playing side \u2013 an obstacle to him joining in the past. Clapping, seal-like, in the background are the Hall and Shepherd families, who between them took nearly \u00a3146m out of the club in revenue from share sales, salaries and dividends. The uniquely rancid odour from Newcastle's governance these past 10 years will be strong in Shearer's nostrils but he is no \"Mary Poppins\", as Freddy Shepherd, the former chairman, referred to him to undercover News of the World reporters. Nor is he the B&amp;Q man who talked of creosoting his fence in his autobiography. From an early age Shearer found refuge in a Jaguar-driving, conflict-avoiding persona \u2013 the northern rock, the heir to Jackie Milburn, the last of the working-class heroes \u2013 which also kept the money rolling in from squeaky clean commercial deals. In 2004 Ruud Gullit, who made the mistake of dropping Shearer for a derby match with Sunderland, said: \"I looked him in the face and told him: 'You're the most overrated player I've ever seen.' He didn't reply. Maybe that's why they call him Mary Poppins; because he's always so innocent.\" But we all know who won that skirmish in the end. In the same year that Gullit vented his bitterness Sir Bobby Robson rested Shearer for a Uefa Cup match against the Norwegian side Valerenga. Shearer was 33 and Robson told him: \"According to my report, we can get by without you. You played against Boro on Saturday and you're playing again on Sunday.\" Robson's recollection of his captain's response was: \"Fine, I'm disappointed but I understand.\" After the match Shearer told the press he was \"angry and disappointed\" at being omitted, which created a media firestorm and strained relations between the two local idols. The point of the story is to illustrate that Shearer has always played Tyneside politics as well as any of the characters in Our Friends in the North and will have to go on doing so now, as he runs into all Ashley's other appointments in corridors and draws up an alliance with Michael Owen, an old friend and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9 in the Tony Stephens-Umbro management stable. Proprietorial chaos and Shearer's own sharp ideas about the how the club should restore its identity and stability are bound to create their own friction. In his own gilded sphere Shearer's skill at looking after No1 gives him the basic kit to drive through eight points-yielding results and strip Ashley of his power to appoint mates to important positions and invent jobs with brackets. His first game is on Grand National day but this is no pin-sticker's punt. Nor is it an exercise in vanity. It is a well-timed run in Tyneside's Messiah marathon. Even if it fails, Shearer can plead innocent: the characteristic Gullit tried to nail him with."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
