VIP schemes have been cited in a succession of cases in which addicts were showered with free gifts as they racked up thousands of pounds of losses. But midway through the industry\u2019s Responsible Gambling week a Guardian analysis of jobs websites suggests gambling firms have no plans to rein in the loyalty schemes. One advert for a \u201cVIP executive\u201d to work at Gala Bingo\u2019s online business, part of the GVC-owned Ladbrokes Coral group, states that candidates will be working to increase \u201coverall player lifetime value and the revenue contribution for the VIP player base\u201d. Charles Ritchie, of the charity Gambling with Lives, set up by parents bereaved by gambling related suicides, said: \u201cThis advert is particularly chilling \u2013 the end of a player\u2019s \u2018lifetime value\u2019 to the company may well be the end of the player\u2019s lifetime. The predatory practices of these gambling companies are designed to maintain and increase addiction. Suicide is highly correlated with gambling addiction.\u201d Applicants for the job are told they should contact the VIPs on a regular basis and \u201creach out to lapsed VIP players to try and reactivate dormant accounts\u201d. The advert also states that staff members should do this while ensuring they are \u201cfollowing the responsible gambling guidelines\u201d. Tony Parente, a former VIP customer with Ladbrokes, who was offered gifts such as free football tickets and flights as he bet more than \u00a31m of stolen money, said the job description was incompatible with responsible gambling. \u201cThe key responsibilities so clearly displayed in these adverts show that the role is target driven with no consideration of the harm it can create, enhance and sustain,\u201d he said. An advert for Foxy Bingo, also part of GVC, says VIP managers should be able to \u201cidentify triggers\u201d that help the company extract maximum value from customers. They should also be able to spot players who \u201chave the potential\u201d to become a VIP. Companies do not disclose what constitutes a VIP but some firms are known to have a \u201cnet loss threshold\u201d above which VIP status is conferred. A spokesperson for GVC said the firm was committed to giving customers \u201cthe safest possible gambling environment\u201d, adding: \u201cWith regard to VIPs, as in any other industry we want to ensure that our most loyal and regular customers are given the best possible service.\u201d GVC said VIPs were subject to enhanced checks on affordability and sources of income, and VIP managers received extra training. A third advert calls for staff to help oversee \u201cbusiness crucial\u201d VIP gamblers at Betfred, including the planning and hosting of \u201chospitality events and [\u2026] rewards campaigns throughout the year\u201d. A spokesman for Betfred said staff ensured customers were \u201calways comfortable with their level of spend and activity\u201d. Another advert, for a VIP support representative at the online site 888 casino says staff may be required to \u201cundertake special projects\u201d. It does not mention responsible gambling but does insist on \u201cpromoting the interests and welfare of the company at all times\u201d. A spokesperson for 888 said it had changed its business in recent years to promote responsible gambling, resulting in \u201csignificantly fewer\u201d VIP customers. \u201cRevenue from VIP customers now represents just 10% of our UK casino revenue,\u201d the spokesperson said. Shares in gambling companies plunged last week, after the Guardian revealed that a cross-party group of MPs had been pushing for much tighter curbs on online gambling. The proposals included reform of VIP accounts, which have cropped up in multiple cases in which the Gambling commission has issued sanctions against gambling companies, including Betfred, Gala Coral, 32Red and LeoVegas. Carolyn Harris, who was the Labour MP for Swansea East and is the deputy leader of Welsh Labour[, chairs the group. She said: \u201cThese adverts are yet a further demonstration of the industry paying lip service to safer gambling measures. The Gambling Commission must undertake an urgent review of the operation of VIP accounts and the inducements which gambling companies use to entice customers to gamble.\u201d In a recent speech to gambling firms in Malta, the commission\u2019s chief executive, Neil McArthur, said the regulator was looking at such schemes and had received an offer from one operator to draw up a code of conduct."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
