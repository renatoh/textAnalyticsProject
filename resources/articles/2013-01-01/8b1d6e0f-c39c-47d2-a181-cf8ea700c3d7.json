With that in mind, we head for Admiralty Arch, where Cabinet Office minister Francis Maude MP turns up to give a speech marking the retirement of Paul Noon after 13-odd years at the helm of Prospect, the union for such as air traffic controllers, scientists, HSE inspectors, and many in Whitehall. Given the ongoing hostilities, his very presence is an irritant to many. There is a changing of the guard, says Maude. \"I've been asked to speak at a lot of events for senior union officials who have retired lately \u2013 almost one a week, in fact. First there was Jonathan Baume, general secretary of the First Division Association; then Brendan Barber, general secretary of the TUC; and now Paul Noon, who has left the helm at Prospect. And I'm very much looking forward to being invited to speak at the retirement function for Mark Serwotka of the Public and Commercial Services union. Hopefully soon.\" Serwotka's not retiring any time soon. But if he did, Maude might get some sleep. \u2022 Of course Serwotka was also happy to dish out a bit to Labour, too, and one wonders how he might get on with Andrew Pakes, the party's prospective parliamentary candidate in Milton Keynes South. Pakes was invited to address the Labour Students National Council at the weekend. He apparently described a meeting some time ago with two shop stewards from a Midlands car plant facing closure. They were \"drunk\", he said, according to reports. \"Inarticulate\". It was like \"listening to someone outside a nightclub\". And what about the \"Noddy Holder accents\". Cue consternation, an apology, and the defence that he was not mocking their class but the fact that they were from the Socialist Workers party. Milton Keynes just became a target for the SWP. \u2022 Still, if he can fight them off, it might be the making of him. And Milton Keynes South is winnable; could herald the arrival of a Labour government. Some think we already have one. Just this week, on parliament.uk, a live stream of PMQs, a shot of Labour's leader and the caption \"Questions to the Prime Minister Edward Miliband\". Could be the high point for Ed. He should find the link and keep it. \u2022 Soul-searching among Lib Dems about the row, rehearsed here, over its lack of progress on equalities. And a turbulent time since the weekend revelations that a \u00a3775,000 donation to the party from pizza magnate Rumi Verjee has been referred by Labour to the Electoral Commission. And the two worries coincide, to some degree. For hitherto, the main vehicle for dealing with the dearth of Lib Dem women and minorities has been an attempt to cast the net wider through the party's leadership programme. Hasn't been a runaway success. Many complain it has merely fast-tracked the progress of a few figures who might well have made their mark on the party anyway. And who have been the prime movers in the programme? Baroness Brinton, this week forced to deny accusations that she scuppered a motion on equalities destined for party conference. And the Domino's man himself, Rumi Verjee. He helped to pay for the programme and, exercising his prerogative perhaps, may then have sat in on interviews to identify candidates \u2013 a prospect that even then was a source of concern for some Lib Dems. It's \"causing great alarm around the potential for a conflict of interest\", wrote Issan Ghazni, chair of the Ethnic Minority Liberal Democrats, to party chairman Tim Farron and all the Lib Dem MPs last year. The silence was deafening. \u2022 Heartening, finally, to hear Pat Nevin \u2013 formerly of Chelsea and Scotland \u2013 pronouncing for the BBC on the Swansea ballboy assault and proclaiming himself to be a \"lefty Guardian-reader\". Generally Guardianistas draw the line at assaulting kids, however irritating. But our influence only goes so far. Nevin admits he'd probably have kicked the boy too. Ex-Chelsea star Graeme le Saux once revealed that his team-mates would bully him because he alone at the club read the Guardian. Perhaps owner Roman Abramovich will buy each of his players a subscription. Call it corporate social responsibility of a sort.
