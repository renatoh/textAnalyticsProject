His latest effort, Song of the Cosmos - commissioned to celebrate the 125th anniversary of the Bach Choir, who gave the premiere under their music director David Hill - struck me as one his weakest works. It should be pointed out in Tavener's defence, however, that its impact may have been blunted because the performance did not follow his instructions as printed in the programme. Song of the Cosmos, dealing with the relationship between God, man, the angels and the earth, demands the vertical arrangement of four groups of performers. At the top, a soprano (Patricia Rozario) and chamber ensemble represent holy wisdom. On the lowest level, an Orthodox priest, Deacon Meliton, indicates suffering mankind and is meant to be surrounded by percussion. In between, Tavener stipulates two choirs and orchestras symbolising the angels and the earth respectively. Given the tiered layout of the Albert Hall, I would have thought such an arrangement possible, but apparently not. Although Rozario's voice floated down from the dome, the two choirs were placed side by side, while priest and both orchestras occupied the stage. The structure is simple. Soprano and priest alternate a sequence of melismas, interrupted by the slab-like sound of the choirs singing the word \"holy\" to phrases that resemble the second movement of Berlioz's Te Deum. Had Tavener's instructions been followed, we might have had the effect of interlocking blocks of music hitting us from different directions. Instead, all we heard was a sonic slosh that went on forever. After the interval, Yan Pascal Tortelier took over the baton for Holst's Planets, turning in an electric account, marred only by a performance of Saturn that didn't quite sear as it should. The work could also be described as a mystic song of the cosmos, and as Tortelier steered us through the outer limits of Neptune, we seemed to be contemplating both infinity and the divine. Tavener, I'm afraid, doesn't come within spitting distance of any of it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
