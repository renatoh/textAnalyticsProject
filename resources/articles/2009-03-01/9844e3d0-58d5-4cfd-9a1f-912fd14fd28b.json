The 37-year-old suspect is also accused of possessing a firearm with the intent to endanger life and will appear in court in Northern Ireland tomorrow. He is believed to be a former Sinn Fein councillor who left the party twelve years ago. Constable Carroll, 48, was shot dead in Craigavon, County Armagh, earlier this month \u2013 the first PSNI officer to be killed by terrorists. The Continuity IRA claimed responsibility for his murder. Earlier today a 17-year-old man appeared in Lisburn's Magistrates Court charged with the murder. The 17-year-old appeared in court to face four charges, including murder, possession of an AKM assault rifle and 26 rounds of ammunition, gathering intelligence likely to be of use to terrorists, and membership of the Continuity IRA. There was heavy security around the court house this morning with armed PSNI officers and armoured land rovers deployed. The youth, who cannot be named because of his age, denied all the charges, according to his solicitor. Carroll, 48, was shot dead as he answered a call for help in Craigavon on 9 March. He was the first Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) officer to be murdered by terrorists. It emerged during the brief five minute hearing that the teenager refused to speak to detectives during 13 days of detention in Antrim Police Station. The Continuity IRA said it had shot the officer in the back of the head as he sat in an unmarked patrol car at Lismore Manor. On Monday, two men aged 27 and 31 were released without charge after being arrested last week. Meanwhile four people are still being held over the fatal shooting, which came two days after two soldiers were killed at Massereene army barracks in Antrim. They were Sappers Mark Quinsey, 23, and Patrick Azimkar, 21. Eight people being held over the three murders by dissident republicans in recent weeks have won high court permission to challenge their continued detention. The case will be examined in a full judicial review hearing later this week. Among those who won the right to challenge their detention was Colin Duffy, a prominent North Armagh republican and ex IRA prisoner. The 41 year is currently refusing food in protest over being held in connection with the murder of the two soldiers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
