I received a voucher for Europa Cars and \u00a3229 was debited from my Egg credit card. On arrival at Malaga, Europa Cars would not honour the voucher and we had to pay again. We have been trying to resolve this since. JM, Johnstone Hire for Lower, the car-hire broker, went into liquidation last month. People who have paid for a voucher but not yet used it, or are in dispute with Hire for Lower, are not likely to see much of their money back unless they paid by credit card. Those who paid by debit card, cash or cheque have a problem. The liquidator, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, has written to customers, although anyone who slipped through the net can contact PWC on 020 7583 5000. Customers are unsecured creditors and will at best get only a percentage of their money back. PWC is still trying to identify all the company's assets, which include a villa in St Tropez. Fortunately, you paid by credit card and can claim a refund from Egg, which says first it will try to get a refund through Visa and Higher for Lower's credit card bank. If Visa says no money is forthcoming, Egg will pay under its Consumer Credit Act responsibility but says this will take two or three weeks. Hire for Lower's sister company, Autos Abroad, is included in the liquidation. Hit by 'enhanced' bank services My Coutts bank statements used to detail where ATM cash withdrawals were made. A few months ago this stopped and statements now show only the date and the amount. Complaints merely elicited a reply that the Royal Bank of Scotland took over Coutts and 'degraded the narrative'. What can I do apart from change my bank? IM, London This is part of an 'enhanced service' says Coutts, without irony. The same has happened in the rest of the group: Royal Bank of Scotland and NatWest. Improvements include real-time banking - instantaneous transactions - and a full service at an additional 2,000 cash machines. But First Direct has real-time banking and can still tell customers which ATM they used. Coutts has no plans to reinstate the information. Paying for the differences I notice that guaranteed income bonds (net) pay less interest than fixed-rate bonds after tax. Why is this? PN, London Although both pay a set return for a fixed period of time, they are quite different products sold by different types of institution. Guaranteed income bonds are single-premium life insurance policies, sold by a few smaller, sometimes foreign, insurance companies for a minimum \u00a35,000. Fixed-rate bonds are sold by banks and building societies, minimum down to \u00a31,000, and are straightforward deposit accounts. Interest on guaranteed income bonds is paid net but non-taxpayers can't reclaim the tax paid. With fixed-rate bonds they can. Higher rate taxpayers pay an extra 20 per cent on fixed rate bonds, the difference between the basic savings and the higher rates of tax. On withdrawals above 5 per cent of the premium from guaranteed income bonds, higher-rate payers pay 18 per cent extra, although this becomes 20 per cent from the next tax year. With foreign insurers' policies, the excess is taxed at the higher rate in full, 40 per cent. My girlfriend and my pension I am single and belong to a public-sector pension scheme that provides a pension to members' widowed spouses. I can nominate another dependent person instead of a spouse but I cannot nominate my girlfriend, who is no more or less dependant than my colleagues' spouses. As I will never want the fund to pay a pension to anyone else, can I be compensated for the extra claim made on the fund by married members? ED, London Unfortunately not. If you died before retiring, your girlfriend could receive the lump-sum payment, although not a widow's pension. Neither would she receive a widow's pension if you died after retiring. That is the current situation but there is hope. The private pension industry is moving towards greater equality, including pensions for same-sex partners, and it is likely that the public sector will follow in the next few years. Ask your pension scheme managers if they are yet discussing these changes to the regulations. Make sure they are aware that members feel strongly about it.
