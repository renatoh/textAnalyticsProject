And, although they may deny it, they will relish the chance to upstage the wonderful feats of the finally retired Sir Steve Redgrave. To that end they are bidding to score a rare double - to go one better than the great man 15 years ago when he attempted, but narrowly failed, to win two titles at the same championships. With Andy Holmes, Redgrave took a remarkable gold and silver at the 1987 world championships and Olympic gold and bronze a year later. They believe they need the extra challenge to bring out the best in them and they have taken Leander clubmate Neil Chugani on board to cox them in the second non-Olympic event. To add to the pressure, it will be raced first next Saturday, just two hours before their priority coxless event. Redgrave had a full day to recover. For Cracknell, it is a coming of age. 'When I was rowing in the four with Steve and Matthew, people saw me as the lucky one in the boat - like anyone can row with them and win.' Now it is clearly down to him and, with an unbeaten season behind them and an effortless victory in the four-round World Cup, they are set for an outstanding career in the pair, backed by a \u00a31.4 million sponsorship deal with Camelot. Life after Redgrave means a legacy of money and massive public recognition for the sport - and its heroes. 'It's nice to prove that rowing goes on without Steve,' says Pinsent, who has quietly assumed responsibility from Redgrave for Britain's rowing success. 'They are physically stronger than the Redgrave/Pinsent pair,' says coach Jurgen Grobler, 'but not yet as technically efficient. A pair is very different to what they were used to in the four.' Critically, Cracknell has changed sides - an adjustment that takes months to make - so clearly there is more speed to come. Yet already no one can run them close. The new four of Steve Williams, Ric Dunn, Toby Garbett and Ed Coode, who finished a tearful fourth in Sydney last year, face the unenviable task of defending the unbeaten four-year record of the great Redgrave crew. They began well, winning the World Cup series last month. They go to Lucerne as favourites although Australia and Italy - second in Sydney - have not yet shown their hand. Five men, including cox Rowley Douglas, are back from the triumphant Olympic eight in a new combination, but so far they have struggled for consistency. The women's squad are also tackling two events, but with less exalted ambitions than the men's pair. Debbie Flood and Frances Houghton in the double scull and Katherine Grainger and Cath Bishop in the pair will join four others in the eight. But with Germany and Romania dominant in these events, gold for Britain is unlikely. There are 17 British crews racing in the 24 events, with the lightweight squad resurgent under new Australian coach Marty Aitken. The men's eight, double and pair and the women's pair are very much in the frame for medals. But with 946 athletes embarking on a new four-year Olympic cycle, there are many new combinations and faces. 'This is the year for building new boats and being bold,' says team manager David Tanner. 'But we're confident that the general high level of the team will bring back medals next weekend.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
