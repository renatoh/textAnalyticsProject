Walker is appealing Pell\u2019s conviction on three grounds, the key one being that the jury came to an unreasonable verdict based on the evidence before them during the trial. Jurors heard that the first offences, which involved Pell sexually assaulting two 13-year-old choir boys after Sunday solemn mass at St Patrick\u2019s Cathedral in Melbourne, most likely occurred on either 15 or 22 December 1996. Pell orally raped one of the boys during this incident and indecently assaulted both of them. The jurors heard Pell offended again about one month later when he grabbed the complainant\u2019s genitals, once again after Sunday mass. But the Crown\u2019s written case to the appellate judges states that 3 November 1996 may have also been a possible date when the first offences occurred, as it had not been established during the trial that Pell was not present at mass on that date. The introduction of 3 November as another possible date was \u201cin itself disturbing ... and should disturb this court\u201d, Walker told Victorian supreme court chief justice Anne Ferguson, court of appeal president justice Chris Maxwell and justice Mark Weinberg. It revealed the Crown\u2019s own \u201cdoubts involving the theory that this supposed first event or incident indeed took place on the 15 or 22 of December\u201d, Walker said. \u201cAnd if it didn\u2019t take place on one of those two dates then the Crown case fails.\u201d This was because the complainant said the second incident \u2013 Pell grabbing his genitals \u2013 occurred about one month later. \u201cThere\u2019s more than a month \u2026 well and truly \u2026 between 3 November and either 15 or 22 of December,\u201d Walker said. It was in reviewing this timing that the judges should find a \u201clack of realistic probability of this offending taking place\u201d, he said. Pell, 77, was convicted in December on four charges of an indecent act on a child under the age of 16, and one charge of sexual penetration of a child under 16. In his opening remarks on Wednesday morning, Walker also argued there was a \u201cformidable list\u201d of factors and events that needed to line up for the offending to be possible and the jury would have had to believe every one of those factors had occurred. This included believing that Pell was alone for about six minutes with the boys in the priests\u2019 sacristy completely undisturbed, and possibly with the door open, after mass, he said. It was \u201cliterally impossible\u201d for the boys to have been abused, he said. Maxwell put it to Walker that someone who was in New Zealand at the time they were alleged to have offended in Australia would be an example of an impossibility that they had offended. He questioned whether it was accurate for defence to argue Pell\u2019s offending was impossible, given there was varying testimony from witnesses in the case in regards to choirboy access to the sacristy, Pell\u2019s routine after mass, and other matters. \u201cThe argument for impossibility\u2026 logically loses its force as uncertainty grows,\u201d Maxwell said. \u201cYour point is\u2026 and you\u2019ve confirmed it several times\u2026 the evidence established such high improbability verging on impossibility there must have been a doubt. I\u2019m just raising the notion\u2026 the greater uncertainty, the less forceful the argument for impossibility becomes. That must be true mustn\u2019t it?.\u201d Walker responded: \u201cNo\u201d. During their closing arguments in the trial, prosecutors pointed to numerous pieces of evidence that demonstrated why the offending was possible. Jurors were also told it was not enough to just believe the complainant, or to think Pell was lying. They had to be convinced beyond reasonable doubt. If Walker fails to convince the court that Pell\u2019s conviction should be overturned on grounds of unreasonableness, he will fall back on two other grounds of appeal. One being that Pell was not arraigned in the presence of the jury panel; and the other being that Pell\u2019s defence team should have been allowed to show a video animation of its argument during the closing address. The court accepting the appeal on these grounds would most likely result in a retrial rather than his conviction being overturned. Family members and supporters of Pell and the complainant sat in the front row of the court, which was at capacity. An overflow room was opened with a video link to the courtroom to accommodate those who could not get a seat. Supporters of the complainant and the second choirboy, who died in 2014, were also in the court. Pell attended in person, brought from the Melbourne Assessment Prison in West Melbourne where he has been held since February when he was sentenced to six years in prison. He dressed in all black and wore his clerical collar, limping slightly as he walked into the court. He occasionally took notes on a yellow notepad and watched Walker and the judges intently. Police officers sat behind him. The prosecution\u2019s response to the appeal is being led by senior crown prosecutor Christopher Boyce and assisted by prosecutors Mark Gibson, who led the trial, and prosecutor Angela Ellis. Walker is being assisted by defence barrister Ruth Shann. When prosecutors put their case to the court, they will argue, according to their written submission, that the complainant\u2019s evidence was \u201cnot only plausible, it was credible, clear and entirely believable as is reflected in the jury\u2019s verdict\u201d. \u201cThe ability of the complainant to so accurately describe the layout and wood panelling of the priests\u2019 sacristy (including the alcove) \u2013 an area in which he could not recall having ever seen either before or after this event \u2013 was a significant aspect of the Crown case,\u201d the submission states. \u201cIt bespoke both truthfulness and reliability. Any inconsistencies in the complainant\u2019s evidence were of little moment and could not have been said to have impacted on his credibility in any material way.\u201d Walker told the court doubt should have also been raised among jurors from evidence that Pell\u2019s second victim denied he had been abused before he died. When the court adjourned for lunch, lawyer Lisa Flynn, representing the father of the dead victim, said that argument should hold \u201clittle persuasion\u201d. \u201cHaving represented thousands of sex abuse victims, I can tell you that it is not uncommon for victims to wait decades before opening up about what happened to them, a lot even take it to their grave,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is not unusual to deny abuse, particularly to parents. Many survivors find it impossible to tell their parents, their beloved mum or dad.\u201d Walker was questioned throughout the day by the judges. Maxwell put it to him that \u201cyou wouldn\u2019t expect perfect recall\u201d from a child sexual abuse victim. He also told Walker: \u201cWe have to be satisfied don\u2019t we that the jury must have had a doubt, not might have.\u201d Maxwell said on his reading of the trial evidence, a significant component of the defence\u2019s case was that the complainant was a liar. The jurors would have considered the plausibility of this argument in making their verdict, Maxwell said. Walker responded that just because the jurors rejected this argument, it didn\u2019t mean they shouldn\u2019t still carry reasonable doubt. Before Walker finished on Thursday, he was asked by the judges to address the issue of the robes. In the trial and in the appeal, Pell\u2019s lawyers argued that it was physically impossible for Pell to manoeuvre his robes to the side in order to expose his penis as the complainant said. Ferguson put it to Walker that the chasuble, which is the outer layer, was like a cape and could be moved to the side. Walker said that would still leave the alb underneath, which could not be manoeuvred to the side. Prosecutors will deliver their response on Thursday and the appeal is expected to close that afternoon. While the judges may deliver their decision at the close of the appeal, it is more likely they will do so at a later date. The hearing continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
