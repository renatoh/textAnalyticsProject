The two songwriters in the band have their different strengths. Jack Mellin draws more from the spikier end of things, with Tin sounding like a slightly less ramshackle Josef K song, while Sean Armstrong tends towards the more straightforwardly melancholic end of indie \u2013 Money for Breakfast sounds very much as if it could have come from the Pastels\u2019 first album. It\u2019s not simply the sound of Scotland in the first half of the 1980s, though \u2013 Permo is also filtered through the gauzy, dreamy indie of the US in the early 90s. Yet it\u2019s very much an album out of time, music made out of love, rather than in pursuit of a trend. You need a high tolerance for wispiness, but it\u2019s hard to deny the loveliness of a song such as Floating Like You."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
