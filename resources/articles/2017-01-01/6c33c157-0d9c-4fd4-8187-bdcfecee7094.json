Pogba was signed for \u00a389m from Juventus in the summer and after a slow start is becoming a dominant performer and showing why the club paid a world-record fee. Wayne Rooney is the captain, although he is no longer first-choice and may be on the bench again on Sunday for the visit of Liverpool, who are second in the table, five points ahead of United. Asked if Pogba could lead the club, Mourinho said: \u201cI think he has the potential. I think he has the charisma. The ambition. The mentality. He is a good professional. Being so young and with so many ingredients, I think he can.\u201d Despite Pogba becoming a key member of his side, Mourinho was careful not to put any added pressure on the player to perform against Liverpool. \u201cIt is not fair to say a player has to be dominant,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is playing amazingly well, no doubts about it, but the team is also playing well. I am not expecting the team to play really bad and for one player to have all the weight on his shoulders, not Paul, not anyone. I expect the team to play well and Paul to be at the level he is playing now regularly.\u201d The player praised Mourinho\u2019s man-management of him since his return to Old Trafford from Italy. \u201cHe told me not to listen to anybody, just be focused on the pitch and enjoy yourself. That is all I am doing,\u201d the 23-year-old told the BBC\u2019s Football Focus. \u201cHe talked to me. He made me very comfortable and confident. \u201cHe said: \u2018You know how to play, do what you want.\u2019 He let me free on the pitch. He told me just to enjoy myself. That is it. That is all I need to hear from the manager.\u201d Paddy Crerand, who won the league title and European Cup in the same United side as Sir Bobby Charlton in the 1960s, praised Pogba by comparing him to the club\u2019s joint-top scorer. \u201cPaul Pogba is just a special player,\u201d Crerand said. \u201cHe is one of those that demands the ball all the time. Sometimes, if things don\u2019t go right, one or two might hide for a little spell but he wants it constantly. \u201cYou know who was the same? Bobby Charlton. If he made a mistake, he still wanted it. Others might go into their shell for a bit but he never would. Paul\u2019s the same and I think he\u2019s fantastic.\u201d United start the weekend 10 points behind the leaders Chelsea but Pogba is confident they can catch up and win the title. \u201cYou have to believe. We are not far off,\u201d he said. \u201cI know Chelsea are at the top but this is the Premier League, you never know what is going to happen. You have to keep fighting and believing. Inside I feel we can still win the league. The team is getting better and better. We all know each other now so we feel much better than we did at the start of the season.\u201d Regarding whether the match with their north-west rivals, whose 18 titles puts them second to United\u2019s 20, is still English football\u2019s biggest game, Mourinho said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I know Manchester United is the biggest club in this country. I know, you know, everybody knows. I am sorry. It is easy to know. \u201cI can feel the rivalry is big and for sure, it is a big match. Around the world, people will look to this match with special eyes, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
