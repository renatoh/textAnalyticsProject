That simple act of courage has emerged as perhaps the enduring image of the victims\u2019 resilience in the face of the hatred unleashed by the shooter on Wednesday night. At about 9pm that night, as the Bible studies class attended by Sanders, Jackson, and 10 other church regulars drew to a close, a stranger who had walked into their midst about an hour previously pulled out a gun. Dylann Roof, 21, is charged with murdering nine of the congregants, each of the deceased shot multiple times. The description of Roof\u2019s alleged offences released by the Charleston police department on Friday suggests that he stood over one of the survivors of the attack \u201cand uttered a racially inflammatory statement\u201d. Sanders\u2019 actions stand in stark contrast to the alleged racial animosity of his assailant. Accounts originating from the three survivors of the attack indicate that the young man remained strikingly calm as he tried to talk the shooter out of what he was about to do. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to do this,\u201d Sanders said. When the shooter moved to pull the trigger anyway, saying he was going to kill everyone in the room, Sanders is said to have leapt in front of the gun, putting himself between the firearm and his great aunt. He took the first bullet, but the killer reloaded and they both died. Sanders\u2019 mother, Felicia Sanders, was also at the Bible studies meeting on Wednesday. She survived by playing dead. At Roof\u2019s bond hearing on Friday she put the loss of her child in the most simple terms. \u201cTywanza is my son, but he was my hero.\u201d To Roof, she said: \u201cWe welcomed you Wednesday night in our bible study with open arms. You have killed some of the most beautifullest people that I know. Every fiber in my body hurts \u2013 I will never be the same.\u201d There were four members of the Sanders extended family in the basement of the Mother Emanuel church that night. In addition to Tywanza Sanders and Susie Jackson who died, and Felicia Sanders who survived, another family member Ethel Lance, 70, was also killed. By Friday a deep sense of shock had settled over the Sanders family home, a classic Charleston wooden house with porch just a few blocks away from the scene of the shooting. Most of the family was grieving behind closed doors, but Tywanza\u2019s cousin Horace Taylor, 33, took time to recall for the Guardian the \u201cstandup guy\u201d that he had been. Taylor said that his cousin was \u201calways speaking positive, he was always with a smile on his face. Though he was younger than me, I looked up at him as my big cousin.\u201d He said that Sanders had an entrepreneurial bent, and was forever seeking the next venture that would allow him to better himself and support his large extended family. He worked two jobs \u2013 cutting hair in a barber shop in North Charleston and working in a restaurant kitchen. In his spare time he wrote rap lyrics and poetry. \u201cWhile other kids fall into drugs and shit, he was just trying to find another way to make a better life for all of us,\u201d Sanders said. That same concern to do the right thing was on display on Wednesday night, Taylor added. \u201cTywanza tried to save my grandma. He tried to protect everybody else from those bullets. I\u2019m pretty sure he knew he wasn\u2019t going to make it, but he still did his best to save others. That\u2019s the man he was.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
