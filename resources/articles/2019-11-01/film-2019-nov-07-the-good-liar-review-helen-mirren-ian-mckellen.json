It features delicious performances by Helen Mirren and Ian McKellen \u2013 I don\u2019t think McKellen has had such a juicy role since his turn in the 1998 drama Apt Pupil \u2013 and the film has such storytelling gusto that you\u2019ll overlook bits of implausible silliness involving smartphone-type \u201chandsets\u201d with which large financial sums can supposedly be transferred from one bank account to another. The director is Bill Condon, and it\u2019s adapted by screenwriter Jeffrey Hatcher from the bestselling 2016 novel by first-time author Nicholas Searle who caused a flurry of his own by announcing that he was \u201cnot allowed to say more about his career than that he was a senior civil servant for many years\u201d. Mirren plays a retired, well-off widow called Betty McLeish looking for decorous romantic companionship from a silver-years dating website. She finds herself set up for lunch with roguish old charmer Roy Courtnay (McKellen) who enchants her with his twinkly-eyed naughtiness, and, even though Betty can see he\u2019s a little bit improper, she\u2019s no prig and likes a laugh. It isn\u2019t long before Roy has actually moved in as a platonic house guest to the astonished disapproval of Betty\u2019s grandson Steven (Russell Tovey) a postgraduate student who occasionally stays overnight at Betty\u2019s house. Steven is right to worry \u2013 because Roy is a dead-eyed predatory conman, working with phoney accountant Vincent (a nice performance from Jim Carter) to bilk greedy businessmen out of their cash and trick widows out of their savings. But maybe this scheme to hoodwink Betty will not go as smoothly as smug Roy thinks. This movie rattles along with terrific energy and dash and the flashback sequences show that it\u2019s actually far more daring and ambitious that you might expect. It\u2019s a great duel between McKellen and Mirren. \u2022 The Good Liar is released in the UK on 8 November, in the US on 15 November and in Australia on 5 December."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
