This week, we asked the Transport Direct web portal (www.transportdirect.info) for a route from London N6 to Eurotunnel. It suggested a drive lasting seven hours and 34 minutes to the Ardneil Hotel in the Ayrshire resort of Troon. This is not a teething bug. Transport Direct has been live since 2004, at a cost of \u00a330m to the taxpayer. I have searched regularly for directions to the Eurotunnel terminal in Kent, using the name Eurotunnel and Channel tunnel. It is exactly the sort of journey for which you might need directions from the web. The portal has never come up with a correct answer. Four months ago, I reported the bug to the site, and on February 15 received a response signed by David Gott, programme support office manager, Transport Direct. \"Please be assured that every comment and suggestion made is taken forward for investigation and action as appropriate.\" This week, Transport Direct's chief executive Nick Illsley blamed \"human error\"; and said it would be fixed by next week. While it might be tempting to accuse Troon chamber of commerce of hacking into the system to hijack English holidaymakers, it is more likely Transport Direct is simply overwhelmed by complexity. It is trying to run \"a world first ... the first ever website to provide national coverage for information about all types of transport\". Big question Most of the time Transport Direct works. The Department for Transport says the portal has had three million users this calendar year. Half were for \"point to point\" journeys, the portal's main unique feature. The question we want to ask is: what is the government doing in this market? In an age when it is not seen as appropriate for the public sector to run power stations or railways, why is it running nationalised industries in what should be the most dynamic sector of all, the web-based knowledge economy? The question lies at the heart of our campaign, which argues that government's role should be to collect and administer high-quality raw data, but make it freely available to everyone to create innovative services. Transport information would be an excellent example. Much of the information that goes into Transport Direct is owned by local authorities, which are funded by local rates and central taxation. Shouldn't it be available to all comers? Since its conception nearly a decade ago, \"e-government\" has been exempt from conventional political wisdom about competition, monopoly and state aid. The consequences are not only theoretical. In 2000, at the height of the dotcom boom, a London startup company called iMPower had the idea of launching a service to sell fishing licences on the web. It was supposed to usher in a new age of \"intermediaries\" providing electronic routes to public services. In theory, this was supported by government policy - but another government policy required the Environment Agency to launch its own fishing licence service on the web. The private-sector offering was unable to compete. Ilsley says that research by the department before Transport Direct's launch showed the private sector wasn't interested in providing a one-stop all-purpose site. However the site was launched in a market already populated by the private sector, albeit with less sophisticated offerings. Their operators argue that these are more in tune with public needs. One such site is Xephos (www.internet.xephos.com), offering integrated journey information based on rail, coach and bus timetables. It was set up in 2001, originally as part of the Traveline initiative (www.traveline.org.uk, a state-sponsored competitor to Transport Direct, providing regional information). Xephos is still going strong, though founder Peter White was this week working as a supply teacher to keep the wolf from the door. It does not have the bells and whistles of Transport Direct. But White says this matters little in practice. Golden rules \"The golden rule is that you can be either comprehensive or comprehensible. Transport Direct attempts to be comprehensive. We go for comprehensible; the majority of people know their local bus stop. In any case, the bus has a useful technical resource for providing information - the driver.\" Another competitor is Journeyplan, a specialist company supporting some of the 11 Traveline initiatives (www.planajourney.co.uk). The chief executive, Mac Logan, says he finds it challenging and sad to be facing such a \"powerful, nearly monopolistic competitor\" as Transport Direct. Its privileged position in the market has other consequences for the knowledge economy. It claims crown copyright on most of the information displayed on the site, and imposes restrictions on photocopying and other reproduction. Its terms specifically ban the use for financial gain of any of the material on the website. Some local authorities, which have been leant upon by central government to provide data to Transport Direct, are worried about losing control. One officer raised concerns at the plan to incorporate data on Britain's 20,000 public car parks: \"Instead of linking to our content, they want to copy the car parking info on our site so they can hold it on their site ... this will complicate matters, as we will not have control over our data and there is a potential that the information ... could become out of date and we would not be able to ensure it is changed.\" The result could be yet another chapter in the saga of Transport Direct bugs - a classic example of the public-sector behemoth entering the knowledge economy. Prudently, Transport Direct covers itself against such blunders. Its terms and conditions warn that content is \"provided on an information basis only, and should not be relied upon\". Any travellers ending up in Troon rather than Calais this summer would no doubt agree. \u00b7 Join the debate at the Free Our Data blog: www.freeourdata.org.uk \u00b7 Tickets are still available for the Free Our Data debate, hosted by RSA.
