I don't recall taking too much fear into the ring. I knew I could fight. But I got a big shock. They put me in with this rough, tough veteran called Lionel Byarm. He tested me to the limit. But I fought my heart out and, in the end, I prevailed. The story of my life, in my very first fight.\" Holyfield pauses, and then he starts to laugh, a husky giggle bursting into a rippling cackle. \"Oh boy,\" he finally says, \"I been doing this almost 19 years now. For the last 10 years people been popping the same old question at me: 'When you gonna quit?' They started asking in 1992, after I fought Riddick Bowe the first time. That was a vicious battle. Bowe weighed 30lb more than me and people were worried. It didn't matter. I went out and beat Bowe in the rematch. \"They still said I should get outa this business. They been singing the same song ever since. And when they not singing they been threatening that I'm gonna get carried out of here on my back. But you know what? I'm still standing. I'm still here.\" The laughter in his voice has already died. His words are now sombre. Holyfield knows that even the greatest heavyweight champions have been ruined by the ring. The once magnificent and implacable Joe Louis wound up a trembling and paranoid wreck in a mental institution. Muhammad Ali was ravaged by boxing in a different way, the blistering beauty of his speed and grace obliterated by Parkinson's disease. There is more devastation today. Bowe remains in jail, mumbling warnings of a comeback despite his own lawyer's attempt to explain his use of violence outside the ring as being a result of the brain damage he'd suffered between the ropes. Mike Tyson is irreparably damaged, morally and monetarily bankrupt. And then, last week, Frank Bruno joined the forlorn ranks of fallen heavyweights when he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act and confined to an east London hospital. Boxing, in the end, gets everyone. \"I feel compassion for them all,\" Holyfield says, \"especially Bruno. I've met him and he's a good man. Fighters find it hard to give up doing what they do best - fighting for a living. Bruno loved to train and keep himself in shape. And, in that sense, we're alike. So maybe I can tell him that boxing is only one aspect of his life. It's gone but, as a man, he should draw on the virtues he found in the ring. I want him to pray rather than surrender. That's the best advice I can give. \"Meanwhile, people want to decide my life for me. They keep reminding me that I'm turning 41 next month. They keep telling me boxing's a brutal business. Man! Do they think I don't know that? I been in the ring three times with Bowe. Twice with Lennox Lewis. I beat Larry Holmes and George Foreman. I whupped Mike Tyson twice. I had my ear chewed off and spat on the ground in front of me. I've seen everything it is possible to see in boxing. I know this business better than anyone. So I live and die by my own decisions.\" It is hard not to feel grave concern for Holyfield. Apart from surviving a heart scare while losing to Michael Moorer in 1994, Holyfield's Georgia twang sometimes assumes a slurring cadence. Some regard this as a sign of brain damage, a claim endorsed by those who see the decline in Holyfield's reflexes. The self-proclaimed doyen of US boxing writers, the bearded and beret-wearing Mike Katz, has castigated Holyfield's lawyer, Jim Thomas, for allowing a once great champion to endanger himself still further. \"That's a slap in my face,\" Holyfield seethes. \"Mike Katz, who ain't fought a lick, thinks he's better qualified than me to judge my future. It reminds me of the time we were negotiating a $100m fight against Tyson. Me and Jim were in a room with this accountant. He only spoke to Jim. I was the invisible man. I said, 'Hey, this is my career you're discussing. This is my money you're analysing. I make the decisions round here. You talk to me.' That got his attention. Same with fighting. The decision is mine alone.\" On Saturday night, in Las Vegas, Holyfield returns to the ring. His latest \"crossroads fight\", against James Toney, the former gun-toting crack dealer once regarded briefly but widely as the world's best boxer, is being peddled as \"The War On October 4\". Two months ago, when the contest was announced, Toney, the undisputed king of trash-talk, showed deference to Holyfield. \"It's a pleasure fighting a great champion like Evander,\" Toney began. \"I have a great amount of respect for Holyfield.\" It could not last forever. Toney reached for some jailhouse abuse. \"But when the bell rings, the respect is gone. I'm gonna be in his ass all night long. I'm gonna give this old southern boy an ass-whupping. This will be Holyfield's last fight. I'm retiring him.\" \"Toney's a very amusing guy,\" Holyfield says. \"But I've heard it all before.\" The 35 year-old Toney is an extraordinarily canny technician who has lost only four of his 72 professional fights. The last three of those defeats were a direct result of the wayward behaviour that followed his catastrophic loss to the brilliant Roy Jones in 1994. It took him eight years to recover, as he moved up the weight divisions with a remorseless display of binge-eating. Yet, even as a bloated parody of the lean middleweight he had once been, Toney never lost his old-school skills. He is unbeaten since 1997, but his career reignited only with a memorable victory over the IBF cruiserweight champion Vassiliy Jirov this April. However, against a fully fledged heavyweight, Toney is not a murderous hitter. For once, Holyfield will be the larger fighter, the man with the greater muscle and the harder punch. \"This is a different challenge to Tyson,\" Holyfield agrees. \"On the surface Tyson is more dangerous. But Toney's much smarter than Tyson. He's a real fighter. I might have to dig hard to win this one.\" Against Tyson, in their second fight, Holyfield's mental resolve was at its deepest. After Tyson had torn a chunk of skin and sinew from his ear, Holyfield gathered himself with icy composure. \"At first, when the pain came and I saw him spit the ear outa his mouth, it was a shocking thing. Shocking things are supposed to happen to other people. But you gotta re spond properly. When I came back straight at him, the hole in my ear all raw and bleeding, it was his turn to be shocked. I broke Tyson's heart that night.\" Holyfield remembers that \"people in my locker room were outraged afterwards. They were screaming with anger. I said, 'Hey, I was the one who got bit. He ain't bit y'all.' I got them to link hands. I led the prayer asking that we could be given the strength to forgive.\" Having fathered two illegitimate children since then, despite his marriage to Janice, a doctor, Holyfield acknowledges that \"I've now had to ask for forgiveness myself. I'm just a man. I also make mistakes.\" As the beaming dad of nine children - five boys and four girls - and as the multi-millionaire owner of a marble mansion in Georgia, two record companies and a TV station, Holyfield no longer needs to fight. But he grinds on. The sweat still rolls down his face like a glistening stream of tears at the House of Pain gym in Houston. He still sings out loud an old gospel song - Jesus I Am Thirsty - while he trains. \"The main goal now is to renew and refreshen myself,\" Holyfield claims. \"I need to just delight again in what I do.\" \"Delight\" is a curious word to hear amid the savagery of boxing. \"Oh no,\" Holyfield says, \"if you don't delight in your work you already lost.\" Holyfield has won only two of his last seven fights. The fact that two more of those bouts were adjudged draws cannot obscure the three losses he has suffered since 1999 - against Lennox Lewis and, more gallingly, the limited John Ruiz and the elusive Chris Byrd. \"During those fights,\" Holyfield protests, \"I couldn't use my left arm. There was an entrenchment of a nerve which stopped me throwing it with any power. So earlier this year I had surgery. It feels great now.\" \"But why go on,\" I ask, \"especially when your life is at risk?\" Holyfield begins a weary outline of his old dream to regain the undisputed heavyweight championship. As I listen silently, he suddenly stops. Holyfield thinks quietly before continuing. \"It's only natural that the word 'quit' is sometimes in my head. But I ain't chosen to say it yet. I'm still happier saying, 'I go on . . .'\" There is a sound of almost unbearable poignancy at the back of his throat. I ask Holyfield one last question. \"Which was your sweetest moment in boxing?\" \"Whipping Tyson was real sweet,\" Holyfield says. He pauses again. \"But, deep down, I reckon the sweetest moment will come when it's finally all over. When, at last, I know that I can stop fighting. Of course it'll also be a little sad. The sweetest moments, y'know, always come with just a little sadness.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
