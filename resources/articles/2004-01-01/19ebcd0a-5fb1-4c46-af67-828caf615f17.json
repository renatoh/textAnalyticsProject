Goldsmith had been in a coma since last Wednesday after complications resulting from anaesthesia during plastic surgery, according to her lawyer, Steven Mintz. She died at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan on Thursday, he said. Goldsmith was a management consultant before she began writing humorous fiction. Her debut novel, 1992's First Wives Club, was the tale of three women whose husbands leave them for younger partners. It was filmed in 1996. Other novels included The Bestseller, Flavor of the Month, Young Wives and Switcheroo. \"She wrote these wonderful, celebratory satires, which seamlessly wove her moral convictions and instruction into popular entertainments,\" her literary agent, Nicholas Ellison, told The New York Times. She was born Randy Goldfield in New York City. She changed her legal name to Justine Rendal, and wrote under the pen name of Goldsmith. She is survived by her mother and two sisters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
