The reward for global triumph was revealed yesterday as Fifa moved to reassure England and other leading European nations who have been lobbying for more money, fearing they would stand to lose from the most costly finals ever. England were also told they should not lose out financially if they fall short of reaching the final. The Football Association believes taking part will cost between \u00a33m and \u00a35m, due to the high costs of being based in Japan as well as increased security and insurance payments after the September 11 atrocity. Fifa originally said that, after an initial \u00a3400,000 contribution to each of the 32 finalists, it would pay a match fee of \u00a3550,000, a rise of only \u00a3130,000 on France 98. England and other countries wanted a \u00a31m match fee and Fifa responded by offering more money, claiming that it is now offering 51% overall more than in France. The worst scenario, an exit at the initial group stage, could still prove expensive for the FA. But there is at least a set minimum on offer, with a country knocked out after those three games receiving just over \u00a32m. There are then rising rewards for further progress and the winners' jackpot of \u00a35m-plus would be 70% more than France received in triumphing in 1998. The FA last night welcomed the increase, the head of communications Paul Newman saying: \"The FA are delighted by Fifa's decision. They have recognised the huge increases in expenditure for all teams competing in Japan and South Korea.\" Neville Southall's nomadic career yesterday took him into his first managerial job, in charge of the struggling Conference club Dover. The former Everton and Wales goalkeeper will be assisted by the former Chelsea and Sunderland winger Clive Walker. The new management team's first game will be against their local rivals Margate on Boxing Day. A new board was also appointed yesterday and the 43-year-old Southall, who has had various coaching spells with Nationwide League clubs, said: \"It's very rare in football to get to talk to people who genuinely love their football club, especially chairmen and directors.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
