As well as refurbishing one of the country\u2019s earliest factories, millions of pounds will also go towards supporting a new railway museum, the restoration of Lincoln Cathedral, and a unique \u201csave our sounds\u201d project to digitise birdsong, accents and other significant recordings. In all, nine projects will receive \u00a398m. Jodrell Bank, home to the Grade I-listed Lovell telescope, and the only remaining site in the world to showcase the entire story of the development of radio astronomy, will receive \u00a312.1m towards a new exhibition pavilion. Prof Brian Cox, the physicist and TV presenter, said it was the \u201cstandout icon of UK science and engineering\u201d and his visits as a child had inspired him to become a scientist. \u201cThis new project will inspire many more young people to carry on our great tradition of science and engineering,\u201d he said. The Science Museum in London will receive \u00a38m for a major redevelopment of its medicine galleries, showcasing 3,000 objects showing the transformation in medicine and health over 500 years, and due to be completed in 2019. Derby Silk Mill\u2019s Museum of Making, on the foundations of the Lombe brothers\u2019 18th-century silk thread plant \u2013 the world\u2019s first fully mechanised factory \u2013 is to get \u00a39.3m. The Great Central Railway\u2019s Mainline \u2013 Bridging the Nation project, to create a heritage railway museum in Leicester incorporating a unique double-track line between the city and Loughborough, has been awarded \u00a39.9m. There is \u00a39.5m for the British Library\u2019s project to digitise the country\u2019s rare, unique and most vulnerable sound recordings and put them online. Recordings range from interviews with Kindertransport child refugees from Nazi Germany to extinct birdsong, accents and dialects to music including British jazz and skiffle. Dorset County Museum, whose collection includes about 3 million archaeological items as well as textiles including the red dress owned by Thomas Hardy\u2019s sister Kate, thought to have inspired the one described in his novel Tess of the d\u2019Urbevilles, is to get \u00a310.3m. Another two museums, the Geffrye in east London, based in 300-year-old almhouses, and the Burrell Collection in Glasgow, will receive \u00a311m and \u00a315m. Lincoln Cathedral, on Historic England\u2019s at-risk register, will receive \u00a312m towards refurbishments. Sir Peter Luff, chairman of the Heritage Lottery Fund, said the money was being used \u201cto tell the spellbinding story of the UK\u2019s scientific and industrial excellence\u201d. The culture secretary, John Whittingdale, said: \u201cI\u2019m thrilled that nine exciting projects across England and Scotland will benefit from this significant \u00a398m investment. Whether it\u2019s a new railway museum in Leicester, Lovell telescope at Cheshire\u2019s Jodrell Bank, or saving the UK\u2019s most vulnerable sound recordings at the British Library, these grants will not only make a lasting difference to local areas and the UK\u2019s wider heritage, but will also use culture to inspire young people to learn more about science and technology for generations to come.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
