The 21-year-old, who has played 46 first-team games for Saints but only two this season, is set to cover for the injured Byron Ford at Bradford on Sunday. Ford will be missing for two weeks with a knee injury sustained in the derby match with Hull FC on Monday. \"Ian is a player of great ability and he will add a touch of flair to our backs,\" said the Hull KR coach, Justin Morgan, who is now hoping to add a forward signing to his squad before the weekend. Leeds Rhinos have lost their New Zealand second-row Ali Lauitiiti for the remainder of April after tests revealed a medial ligament strain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
