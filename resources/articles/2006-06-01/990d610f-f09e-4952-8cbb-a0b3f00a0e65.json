We need also to tackle the underlying causes of ill health, which range from poor recognition to discrimination, poverty and lack of employment opportunities. We know that carers are not aware of their benefits entitlements, with more than \u00a3660m of benefits going unclaimed every year. We also know that one in five people gives up work to care, and that they will find it harder to get back into the workplace, some never returning. Carers have lower pensions in retirement. Every day we hear of countless stories where carers face discrimination that prevent them working, having a bit of time off, or even having a life-saving operation. We need to ensure that all of these issues are addressed. Preethi Manuel Carer, London My daughter Zahrah has cerebral palsy and has specialised needs. I can't ever relax. I am always on night duty. If I get sick, I still have to get up or my daughter won't have any breakfast. Going out or having any kind of social life is extremely difficult. I think direct payment is so important. It gives us some flexibility to get help when we need it the most. I am always on, or near to, the poverty line. And, because Zahrah is now 18, the benefits drop. Yet I am expected to do more. She is much bigger than me now and needs assistance to get in the car or in the bath. You go from one battle to another with agencies. I am 49, and my parents are still having to help me out. There's a lack of recognition of carers. We need to feel valued. Pat Sinclair Carer, County Durham I'm a carer of two people - my 29-year-old son, who has mental health problems and lives with me, and my mother. It means two totally different sets of problems, different forms to fill in and different departments to deal with. Half of my caring time is spent battling with services. Yesterday, I spent three hours on the phone with eight different departments to get an answer to a single question. There is no communication between departments. In Australia, they have an umbrella organisation where carers can go and they sort everything out. We need something like that here. Carers need equal pay and support. It is impossible to say what one thing would help us, because there are so many. I don't know about Fathers For Justice - it should be Carers For Justice. Amy Balhatchet Young carer, South Warwickshire Me and my brother and sister all live at home and we were quite young when my mum first went into hospital. I am 13 and that was five years ago. We do the normal chores, but we have to do other things that she can't do, such as helping her with getting dressed. My dad helps, too. He is off work helping, but I think he should go back to work - not meaning to be rude, but he needs a break. I go to meetings once every few weeks at the [Princess Royal Trust for Cares] Young Carers' project. I have been going since I was eight. It really helps to have people to talk to. Fiona Moorcroft Carers coordinator, Macmillan Cancer Support Understandably, the health sector is very patient focused, but as a result the needs of carers are often overlooked. The health sector needs to be more aware of the needs of carers of cancer patients, to be able to identify carers as early as possible and to offer, or signpost, the support available. If carers are identified alongside the cancer patient and offered support earlier in the cancer journey, this will enable carers to maintain their own health and emotional wellbeing, which in turn will ultimately benefit the person they are caring for. Developing an NHS information and support strategy for carers would help. Jane Matthews Author of The Carer's Handbook By the time it occurs to carers that they need help they often lack the time, energy and bullish perseverance to find out what support might be available and where to get it. The state fails so many carers by failing to spot the obvious: that every time someone arrives in a surgery or hospital waiting room with a debilitating condition, there's likely to be someone else, hidden in the wings, trying to pick up the pieces. We should train every health and social care professional to ask \"is someone helping care for you?\" and hand that carer the information they need to begin to try to access support services. We must mean what we say. It's scandalous that carers can arrive finally at a carer assessment only to be told there are no funds left to deliver, for example, just a few hours' respite a month. Caroline Waters Director, people networks, BT Many of the UK's 3 million working carers deal with the stresses of what must seem like two jobs, one paid and one unpaid. At BT, we provide the flexibility and practical support our carers need to manage their professional and caring responsibilities in harmony. Supporting our carers isn't difficult, disruptive or expensive; it's plain business sense. In exchange for access to flexible working, leave arrangements, time off for emergencies, access to information, we attract and retain essential skills, increase productivity, cut costs and release the potential of our organisation. Christine McCafferty MP for Calder Valley, Yorkshire I was a carer as a child and then as an adult for my mother after my father died. There are an estimated 175,000 carers under the age of 18, with 12,000 caring for more than 50 hours a week. Many are unknown to social services and slip through the net. I am keen that there should be a way of identifying them. GPs are probably most likely to do this. I would like to see a database of carers, especially of younger carers, and would like to see more opportunities for carers to network with other carers, although that would presuppose that respite care was available. Carers should be offered an annual health check, which would be a huge preventive measure. Shan Nicholas Chief executive, the Princess Royal Trust for Carers The identification and support of carers (primary health care) bill calls for best practice procedures to identify carers before they reach breaking point. Primary care trust funding for carers' services is patchy. Inducements should be increased to GPs to identify carers, and each GP practice should be required to nominate a carers' champion. The 5.2 million carers in England and Wales are not just \"customers\" of health and social care, they are (largely invisible) partners in care delivery and, as such, are key to the proposals for home-based self-care."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
