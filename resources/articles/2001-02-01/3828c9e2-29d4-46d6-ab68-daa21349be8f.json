His team, play-off semi-finalists for the past two years, are 12 points better off than they were this time last season and have a League Cup final to look forward to, but Francis is discovering that chasing success on two fronts puts increased demands on a man's squad. \"I've never been in this position before so I will have to learn as I go along,\" he said after an undistinguished performance which still produced a third win in a week. \"I've got to get the balance right between picking up points and thinking about the final.\" Next Saturday's visit to Sheffield United presents another problem. With only two fit centre-halves and one of them, the influential Darren Purse, on four yellow cards, a booking would see him miss the February 25 final. Francis will spend the week monitoring David Holdsworth's comeback from injury in a reserve game. Karren Brady, the managing director, will also be asked if anything can be done about their far-from-level playing field. \"Liverpool or Arsenal would struggle to pass the ball on that,\" said Nigel Worthington, the Norwich manager who missed out on a game for Francis's Sheffield Wednesday in the 1993 League Cup final due to suspension. \"They should be ashamed of it.\" Birmingham began playing with much of the pride they displayed against Ipswich in the cup semi-final, but this time with the debutant Curtis Woodhouse, who first met up with his team-mates at 1.15pm, impressing in midfield. Stan Lazaridis soon fired a left-wing cross over and though Andy Johnson got a touch, Bryan Hughes knocked the ball home. Then they ran out of ideas. Fortune, or perhaps the pitch, favoured them after the interval, however, Lee Marshall handling and Purse doing the honours from the spot. Chris Llewellyn pulled one back for Norwich to ensure a nervous 10 minutes for the faithful, who could at least be grateful that Geoff Horsfield's booking means he will be suspended for the visit of West Brom the week before the final. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
