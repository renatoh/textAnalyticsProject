He has been around a long time, making his county debut for Kent in 1998, his international debut in 2002. Yet Rob Key is only 30 years of age and could still be seen in England colours again. Kevin Pietersen's injury opens up all sorts of possibilities. Should another batsman fall by the wayside or England decide to play six batsmen, there is a conundrum. The selectors say they have their plans but reveal no details. When quizzed on Thursday, Ashley Giles tossed out three names: Owais Shah, Jonathan Trott and Rob Key. So do not read too much into the omission of all three from the recent Lions team that played against the Australians at Worcester. In his last two completed Championship matches for Kent Key has mustered 270 not out against Glamorgan and 123 run out against Surrey but he could not buy a run in May and June. \"I had my worst bout of form ever at the start of the season. It made sense that I didn't play at Worcester [for the Lions]. This summer [Joe] Denly started off really well; they like the look of [Stephen] Moore and when they picked the team I'd scored no more than 100 runs all summer. They both deserved to play.\" But his recent glut of runs allied to the fact that we are moving further away from vague hypothetical means that Key is properly back in the frame. He has not represented England since January 2005 in South Africa, where he played the last of his 15 Tests, between the ages of 23 and 25. So he was still a relative novice, though capable of hitting a Test double century against West Indies at Lord's. He served his apprenticeship but England never reaped the benefit of that learning experience. \"At the start of 2005 it was a choice between Ian Bell and myself,\" says Key. \"They chose Bell. Then my method was simply to see the ball and hit it.\" He is confident that he is a better player and a different one. \"Now I have the experience and would be better prepared. \"When I was in the England team it was one of the best in the world as it approached the Ashes series of 2005. At the start I felt overawed with the likes of [Nasser] Hussain around. Now it contains the likes of Fred [Andrew Flintoff], who is a close mate. I've played with or against Swanny [Graeme Swann] since about the age of 10.\" Key would be comfortable in this side. And suddenly he is comfortable with his batting. He gives an illuminating insight into how a season can be transformed. \"Down at Beckenham early this month I bumped into Neil Taylor [the former Kent player of the 1980s] and he said, 'You are batting with your hands away from your body'. I realised this was probably a consequence of playing so much Twenty20. I was trying to make some room to swing the bat. One small observation made all the difference. You can learn so much chatting to ex-players, who only see you play now and again.\" Key has become one of the least likely beneficiaries of the Twenty20 revolution. \"There is no doubt that Twenty20 has increased my stock,\" he says and he himself sounds surprised by that. \"Back in 2004 I thought this new competition would be the best possible holiday during the summer \u2013 just three hours' play. I couldn't have been more wrong.\" Even for a traditional-style player like Key, Twenty20 has become a highlight of the season. \"We had 8,000 at Canterbury last week [for the quarter-final]. We've played in front of full houses at The Oval. The current generation are very lucky to experience that.\" Key's burgeoning reputation in this form of the game is based as much on his shrewd captaincy as his batting at the top of the order. The Twenty20 skipper has no thinking time; he has to trust his instincts and go. \"It's a pain in the arse,\" says Key but it's clear that the game offers challenges that he relishes. He must be a good captain; Kent keep qualifying for the Twenty20 finals day. Even so it was something of a surprise when Key was selected in England's squad for the recent World Cup. He played one game in place of the injured Pietersen. Somehow he ended up batting at six, where he was expected to slog a few sixes at the end of the innings, not really his forte. He explains what happened and denies that there was any rift between him and the hierarchy after that Twenty20 campaign. \"In that tournament I was going to open but I was in such poor form that the idea was shelved: then KP got injured and I was drafted in at three but Ravi [Bopara] and Luke Wright batted for 10 overs so then I slid down the order and ended up at six.\" Without explicitly criticising his own selection Key says. \"You need three or four batsmen, lots of bowlers and a few who can smash the ball in a Twenty20 team.\" You do not need a converted opener flailing around in the middle order. It was a fine mess that he found himself in. But he says there was no fall-out between him and the management, which was rumoured. \"I just tried to offer as much help as I could.\" Which is what he would be prepared to do now if the call came. By modern Australian standards he is still a pup. They seem to have more faith in the thirty-somethings than their novices. So Key keeps on waiting, patiently and phlegmatically."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
