The Liverpool manager has repeatedly stated Sterling will not be sold this summer having rejected a \u00a3100,000-a-week, five-year contract. His stance hardened on Friday when he declared Fenway Sports Group, Liverpool\u2019s owners, would keep the 20-year-old on his \u00a335,000-a-week deal rather than sell to Manchester City or elsewhere should there be no agreement when contract talks resume at the end of the season. Liverpool began negotiations with Sterling\u2019s representative, Aidy Ward, at the time of October\u2019s win at Queens Park Rangers, the winger\u2019s former club and their opponents at Anfield on Saturday. Rejecting a \u00a365,000-a-week pay rise has cost Sterling in excess of \u00a31m so far (Liverpool did not offer \u00a3100,000 a week from the outset) and he will miss out on \u00a33.38m next season should the impasse continue until the summer of 2016. Sterling would then have only 12 months remaining on his contract and be in a stronger position to test Liverpool\u2019s resolve over a transfer. Clarifying Liverpool\u2019s position for the summer on Sterling, Rodgers said: \u201cWe\u2019ve made our position clear from the beginning and the owners are very much supportive of that. Raheem won\u2019t be going anywhere this summer, even if there\u2019s not a deal agreed.\u201d Sterling claimed in a BBC interview last month that his contract dispute was not about money but the ambition to achieve his career goals at the highest level. That line of argument remains valid with Liverpool likely to fall short in the race for Champions League qualification, as they did in the semi-finals of the FA Cup and Capital One Cup this season. Rodgers countered: \u201cLook, everyone wants to win trophies, everyone wants to play in the big competitions; but it\u2019s also important that you have the opportunity to do that. We\u2019ll just be reinforcing our stance that\u2019s been in place all along \u2013 that this is the best club for him at this moment where he\u2019s got the opportunity to play and to fight and be competitive. \u201cI think he looks a lot more relaxed now than he has done for a while. He looks comfortable in himself again. We had a couple of good meetings. He came to my house and we had a good chat on a personal level as well. It\u2019s not just about the football side, it\u2019s also about his welfare because he\u2019s still young and he\u2019s been through a lot in the last couple of years.\u201d Rodgers said it was not uncommon for him to invite a player to his home in an attempt to resolve any problems. \u201cI do it with some when the moment\u2019s right. We had a good chat and it was about making himself comfortable as well. It\u2019s not just football; it\u2019s parenting as well, helping him and making sure everything is all right outside of his football.\u201d Sterling\u2019s form has dipped markedly in recent weeks but Rodgers attributes that to the team\u2019s failings rather than a byproduct of the contract controversy. The manager said: \u201cWe\u2019re very much a team so when it functions it\u2019s set up for everyone to work well and play well. But the thing I love about Raheem is whether he\u2019s playing good, bad or indifferent he\u2019s on the training field every day, he works his socks off, he wants to learn and when he goes on to the field he gives everything.\u201d Rodgers confirmed the club had held discussions over new contracts for Brad Jones and Kolo Tour\u00e9, who are free agents this summer. He added Liverpool will have no qualms over providing Chelsea with a guard of honour at Stamford Bridge next Sunday should Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s team win the title on Sunday. \u201cAbsolutely we would,\u201d he said. \u201cThis club is built on dignity, respect and class. So whoever is the champions and wherever it is that\u2019s what you do.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
