Pyne, the former defence minister, announced last week he had taken up a job with EY to help the consulting group expand its defence business. The current federal ministerial standards require that ministers do not lobby, advocate for or have business meetings with government, parliamentarians, or the defence force on \u201cany matters on which they have had official dealings\u201d in the past 18 months. The standards also say that ministers should not use information they have obtained in office for private gain. The guidelines are not enforceable, and transgressions are rarely policed. With parliament set to resume on Tuesday, Centre Alliance senator Rex Patrick has now called for a Senate inquiry into compliance with the standards. \u201cMr Pyne cannot unknow what he knows from nearly three years\u2019 service at the top of the defence portfolio,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cHis acceptance of his new job with EY is unquestionably a breach of the spirit, and indeed the letter, of the prime minister\u2019s standards. The question is now what is the prime minister going to do about it?\u201d Labor\u2019s Senate leader Penny Wong, who was critical of Pyne\u2019s decision to join the firm last week, said the opposition was considering the Patrick proposal for a Senate investigation. \u201cWhen even Mr Pyne\u2019s own party colleagues raise concerns about his actions, as we saw with Senator Abetz \u2026 it is clear Mr Morrison needs to act to enforce his own code of conduct,\u201d Wong said. The Greens have also expressed objection to Pyne\u2019s new role. \u201cThe Greens have long campaigned to shut the revolving door of MPs and lobbyists yet it keeps on spinning,\u201d said Larissa Waters, the party\u2019s democracy spokesperson. \u201cWe want to see a five-year cooling of period for post-politics for-profit work that might raise a conflict of interest, and a lobbying register and code of conduct with teeth.\u201d Abetz said he wanted to see a full disclosure of Pyne\u2019s new role to ensure his former colleague had not breached the guidelines. The home affairs minister, Peter Dutton, suggested on Friday the issue might end up before the privileges committee. Pyne\u2019s appointment has also prompted frustration from the Australia Defence Association, which says ministers should be subject to the same requirements as high ranking military officers and senior defence public servants, who are typically required to avoid private work related to their previous dealings in government for 12 months. The former defence minister issued a statement on Sunday saying he was aware of his responsibilities under the code and intended to abide by them. Pyne said the providing of occasional high-level strategic advice did not equate to lobbying or using information he had acquired in his portfolio. Patrick told Guardian Australia on Sunday there would be no need for a Senate inquiry if Morrison was prepared to take concrete action to enforce the standards. \u201cThere is a statement of ministerial standards, and it either means something or it doesn\u2019t.\u201d EY has issued a statement saying it would ensure that no work Pyne did for the company would breach the ministerial standards. \u201cMr Pyne has made clear that he is totally aware of his obligations under the ministerial code of conduct and is committed to adhering to them,\u201d the statement said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
