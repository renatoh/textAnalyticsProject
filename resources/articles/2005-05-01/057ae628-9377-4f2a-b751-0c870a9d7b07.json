Jens Lehmann has been in decent form and seems a strong personality. He has made a few mistakes at Arsenal but his overall record isn't that bad. There is, though, a slight question over his temperament. You can rile him a bit and this fixture has a history of being quite heated so that could be a weakness. The fact that there's a doubt over whether Roy Carroll or Tim Howard should play shows it's been a problem position for United. Both have had wobbly moments. I think Howard will get the nod. Carroll had a run and made a few rickets and didn't look totally assured against Chelsea recently. Howard's got a lot of talent and will improve but I wonder whether he's an imposing enough character at the moment. Defence Arsenal went through a bad defensive stage but seem to have sorted themselves out. Philippe Senderos has come through and looks the part, Kolo Tour\u00e9 seems to have found his form and all of a sudden there's a bit of confidence. I think Sol Campbell will be on the bench. He was out for three months and it would be tough to stick him in when you look at Arsenal's defensive record recently. There's no doubt United are better when Rio Ferdinand is around. I think he's the best of the central defenders on show but Mika\u00ebl Silvestre has lost a bit of form and United miss Gabriel Heinze, who's been terrific. They have been letting in goals and I think that reflects the fact that they haven't had a settled back four. Midfield This is where the game's likely to be won and lost. Two months ago I'd have fancied United quite strongly, but now Arsenal can pick Gilberto Silva or Edu to partner Patrick Vieira and that means there's little to choose between the sides. Gilberto and Edu are quality players who were missed for a big chunk of this season. They give Arsenal strength and balance in the middle. Then Robert Pires will be on one flank and 17 goals is a good return this season. United have dominated midfield against Arsenal recently so they'll be confident. Roy Keane's not the overpowering presence he was in his prime but is still a huge influence. Paul Scholes is top drawer with touch, awareness and goals. And they can use one or both of Ryan Giggs and Cristiano Ronaldo . United's biggest challenge is probably replacing Keane, Giggs and Scholes. Attack It's obviously a blow to Arsenal to be without Thierry Henry . He's priceless with his pace and the way he makes things happen and scores goals. But even without him I think they're well covered. Dennis Bergkamp may be getting on a bit but he's had a great season. He's still got that awareness and vision and takes up good positions. Then either Robin van Persie or Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes can play alongside him. Van Persie's improving and has been doing really well. Reyes performs better when Henry's not there. I don't think it's a personality thing but that both Reyes and Henry like that little position on the left. United have great forwards. Wayne Rooney is an immense talent and shows unbelievable maturity for his age in terms of his footballing ability. He's brilliant at finding space between the back four and midfield and seems to get better and better. Most games I see he's the best player. Ruud van Nistelrooy has not had the best season because of injury but he's starting to score again and is a big-game player. This could be the time he comes through. Substitutes Both teams have players who can come on and make a difference but these big games aren't generally won by who's on the bench but who's in the starting line-up. Presumably either Giggs or Ronaldo will be among the substitutes for United and also Louis Saha. Van Persie could be the biggest danger if he doesn't start. Managers Ars\u00e8ne Wenger or Sir Alex Ferguson will end the season without a trophy but that doesn't mean they don't know what they're doing. They both have wonderful records. Their characters are different and they obviously don't get on that well, but both have that ability to bring out the best in players and their squads have a lot of respect for them. People who say Ferguson should be kicked out if United don't win are talking nonsense. Ferguson won a trophy last season and his track record speaks for itself. Every side goes through a period where they have to reinvent themselves. Both teams will play aggressively but they're positive and great to watch. Hopefully it will be a feast of football.
