Trump, sitting next to a visibly uncomfortable taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, waded into the Brexit debate minutes after Air Force One touched down at Shannon airport on Wednesday afternoon. \u201cI think it will all work out very well, and also for you with your wall, your border,\u201d he said at a joint press conference. \u201cI mean, we have a border situation in the United States, and you have one over here. But I hear it\u2019s going to work out very well here.\u201d Varadkar interjected that Ireland wished to avoid a border or a wall, a keystone of Irish government policy. \u201cI think you do, I think you do,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe way it works now is good, you want to try and to keep it that way. I know that\u2019s a big point of contention with respect to Brexit. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s going to work out very well. I know they\u2019re focused very heavily on it.\u201d In London on Tuesday Trump met the Brexiter politicians Nigel Farage, Iain Duncan Smith and Owen Paterson, all of whom have played down the idea that the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland will be a problem after the UK leaves the EU. Trump echoed their confidence in Shannon. \u201cThere are a lot of good minds thinking about how to do it and it\u2019s going to be just fine. It ultimately could even be very, very good for Ireland. The border will work out.\u201d The Irish government has mounted an intense, three-year diplomatic effort arguing the opposite, that Brexit threatens peace and prosperity on the island of Ireland. The US president\u2019s comments were an awkward start to what is expected to be a low-key end to his visit to Europe, with much of his time spent at his golf and hotel resort in Doonbeg, County Clare. From Shannon airport he took a short helicopter ride to his resort on the Atlantic coast. Addressing the media after Trump\u2019s departure, Varadkar said he explained the history of the border and the Troubles in their private meeting. \u201cWe talked Brexit. President Trump shares our objective to keep the border open.\u201d He said Trump had not elaborated on why he thought Brexit could benefit Ireland. The two leaders also discussed trade, visas and taxes paid by US corporations with operations in Ireland. The Irish president, Michael D Higgins, made an unexpected intervention on the eve of the visit by calling Trump\u2019s policy on the climate emergency \u201cregressive and pernicious\u201d, a critique protesters will echo at rallies in Shannon and Dublin. Trump told reporters he was unaware of Higgins\u2019 comments and reiterated that the US had enjoyed cleaner air and water since he became president, a claim he also made in London. After three days of pomp, pageantry and politics during his state visit to Britain, Trump and his entourage, which includes his wife, Melania, and his four adult children, will be mostly out of the public gaze in the remote, windswept landscape of Loop Head peninsula. On Thursday, Trump will travel to France for D-day commemorations before returning to Doonbeg, where he is due to play a round of golf on Friday before flying home. The Irish police deployed 1,500 uniformed officers plus 500 members of specialised units, including divers and armed and air support, to secure Shannon airport and Doonbeg. Trump\u2019s 162-hectare (400 acre) resort was in lockdown and closed to the public. Newly installed surveillance cameras with night-vision capability fed images to a police control room. Roads to the adjacent village of Doonbeg remained open. Locals have erected US flags and expressed hope Trump would visit one of their pubs, despite him being teetotal. The resort employs more than 300 people during summer and is an economic lifeline for the region. Fr Joe Haugh, the parish priest, said: \u201cThe people are 99.9% behind him.\u201d Elsewhere, there were protests by individuals and groups opposed to the US president\u2019s record on the environment and the rights of women, immigrants, ethnic minorities and LGBT people. Demonstrators set up a \u201cpeace camp\u201d outside Shannon airport, and the Trump blimp used by protesters in London was due to appear at a rally in Dublin on Thursday. The visit has created a political and diplomatic challenge for the Irish government. Trump is not popular in Ireland. Varadkar reportedly asked to have the meeting at Shannon airport, a neutral venue, rather than in Trump\u2019s resort. The hosts, however, are keen to lobby the US president over trade, visas for Irish workers and support for the peace process. They also want to explain the potential impact of Brexit on the border and try to placate Trump over Ireland\u2019s low-tax regime and use of Huawei technology in the new 5G network. Simon Coveney, the Irish foreign minister, sought a delicate balance when asked about Higgins\u2019 criticism of Trump\u2019s climate policies. The Irish president caught the mood of the Irish people quite well, he told RT\u00c9, but regressive was \u201ca better adjective\u201d than pernicious. The hosts will be hoping Trump does not broach a source of personal irritation. Environmental objections have stalled a sea barrier he wishes to build to protect his resort from erosion. The US president has described the battle as an \u201cunpleasant experience\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
