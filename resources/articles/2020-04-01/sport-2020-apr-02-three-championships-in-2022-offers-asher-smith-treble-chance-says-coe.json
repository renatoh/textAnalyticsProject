Lord Coe, the president of World Athletics, hinted that the world championships in Eugene, Oregon, which have been pushed back a year to 2022, could be staged first \u2013 most likely in early July \u2013 before the Commonwealth Games in Birmingham and the European championships in Munich take place later in the summer. \u201cI do want the treble to be on,\u201d said Coe. \u201cWe\u2019ve really not left any stone unturned here and we\u2019ve still some conversations to go. We\u2019re trying to navigate our way through what is a window, not much more than about six weeks, which is really challenging. But my guiding principle is that I don\u2019t want to put athletes in a position where they\u2019re perming one from three.\u201d Coe that for multi-eventers such as Katarina Johnson-Thompson and top endurance athletes it would be tough to do more than one major championship in a season. However, he also added: \u201cIt is my hope that we get to a sensible gap \u2013 so that at least the athletes have a maximal period of preparation after the world championships, before they head off then to a European championships and a Commonwealth Games.\u201d Coe also backed Asher-Smith and Johnson-Thompson to bounce back at next year\u2019s Olympics after the Tokyo Games were postponed because of the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cThis is not an exact science,\u201d he said. \u201cSome athletes are going to compete well one season, and maybe not so well the next. But I hope that Dina and Kat are at that point in their career where this disruption really doesn\u2019t impact too dramatically on them. \u201cWhat they have both displayed to me is they\u2019ve got resilience \u2013 and I think the resilient athletes are going to manage their way through this. So my instinct is that while the delay is not ideal for them, I think they\u2019ll figure this out and come back in 2021 really strong.\u201d Coe also revealed that he was prepared to lengthen this year\u2019s track and field season \u2013 but only if it was safe to do so. \u201cI wish I knew when it\u2019s going to be sensible or safe to be able to commence the summer season. But we\u2019ll do everything possible to extend it into September, and possibly even into early October. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t really want is for athletes to go into next season, without at least making every effort to try and resurrect something \u2013 providing we do it in a way that is safe and secure and doesn\u2019t risk their health.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
