The Rotterdam team are favourites to go through to a Uefa Cup quarter-final against either PSV Eindhoven or Leeds after their 1-1 draw in Glasgow but the news that De Boer, who missed that game, is fit has provided the Scots with a timely boost. The Rangers manager Alex McLeish said: \"Ronald has taken a fitness test and we knew if he failed it he could be out for weeks but he was prepared to try because he wants to play and put one over his old rivals and I'm sure he'll make it.\" The former Ajax player has often been singled out for abuse in Rotterdam and he will again be a target for the Feyenoord fans who will pack the De Kuip Stadium tonight. The Feyenoord coach Bert van Marwijk is under pressure. His team has surrendered a healthy lead at the top of the league and with the new pace-setters Ajax lying in wait in Amsterdam on Sunday he admitted: \"It's the week of truth.\" Feyenoord (probable, 4-4-2): Zoetebier, Emerton, Loovens, Paauwe, Rzasa, Kalou, Bosvelt, Van Wonderen, Persie, Ono, Van Hooijdonk. Rangers (probable, 4-4-2): Klos; Ross, Amoruso, Vidmar, Numan; Konterman, Ferguson, Hughes, Lovenkrands; De Boer, Mols. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
