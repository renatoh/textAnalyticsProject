Here are five key takeaways: A good night for New York liberals A long and painful drought of victories ended Tuesday night for the liberal wing of the Democratic party. In New York, liberals appear to have replaced the incumbent congressman Eliot Engel with the progressive darling Jamaal Bowman. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won her district\u2019s Democratic primary, effectively ensuring her re-election, and in New York\u2019s 17th congressional district, Mondaire Jones won a crowded primary. Some races are still outstanding as of Wednesday afternoon. In New York\u2019s 12th congressional district, the Democratic congresswoman Carolyn Maloney is in real danger of losing her seat to challenger Suraj Patel. The race has not been called yet. Overall, though, New York was the center of progressive victories and it\u2019s clear the liberal wing of the party shouldn\u2019t be written off, even in the era of Joe Biden. Not so great for liberals in Kentucky In Kentucky, Democrat Amy McGrath, the longtime heavy favorite candidate to face the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, found herself in a tougher than expected primary against Charles Booker, the youngest African American legislator in Kentucky\u2019s house of representatives. As of Wednesday afternoo,n Booker trailed McGrath by double digits. That\u2019s despite a surge of endorsements and support from the larger constellation of progressive groups and activists behind Booker. Madison Cawthorn wins in North Carolina Tuesday\u2019s primaries saw upset wins on both the Republican and Democratic side. In North Carolina, Madison Cawthorn, a 24-year-old congressional candidate and political newcomer, beat Republican Lynda Bennett, who had been endorsed by Donald Trump. Cawthorn\u2019s unexpected victory once again calls into question how far the president\u2019s reach now goes even in a Republican primary contest. Delayed results, long lines and voting problems are the new normal Delayed election results and election-day problems are becoming the norm. Many of the races on Tuesday weren\u2019t called by Wednesday afternoon. And in Kentucky, the McGrath and Booker campaigns filed an injunction to keep polls open to allow more voters a chance to cast their ballots. The injunction was denied. In New York, some of the races still aren\u2019t called, even as candidates declared victory. Political strategist are expecting similar delays and a wave of mail-in ballots could mean that the presidential election won\u2019t be called until days after 3 November. A blow to Trump in Kentucky Despite a primary challenge from the attorney Todd McMurtry and receiving criticism from Trump himself, the Kentucky Republican Thomas Massie held on to his congressional seat, beating McMurtry by more than 60 points. Like the result in North Carolina, Massie\u2019s victory calls into question whether Trump\u2019s endorsement matters much at all in some Republican primaries. He had criticized the congressman as a \u201cthird rate grandstander\u201d and warned that he would be thrown out of Congress, yet Massie won decisively."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
