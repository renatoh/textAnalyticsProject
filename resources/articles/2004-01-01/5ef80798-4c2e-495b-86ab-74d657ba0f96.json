Radio 3 will broadcast live a performance of John Cage's seminal work 4'33\", which consists of four minutes and 33 seconds of silence. For those who miss the live broadcast at 7.25pm, or the video on BBC4 an hour later of the BBC Symphony Orchestra performing the piece, all hope is not lost. Guardian Unlimited's own orchestra, hastily assembled this morning, performed a very similar piece at 11.30am today, and you can hear the recording here. Obviously the accoustics in our London office are inferior to those at the Barbican, where tonight's official performance takes place. None of us is a professional musician (though the deputy news editor was in a band once that went on tour with Radiohead), and nor did we have time to do much practice. Apologies also for the fact that the recording seems only to be four minutes long. We were a bit nervous and may have rushed through the piece somewhat. We hope you will forgive these shortcomings, and enjoy the performance. \u00b7 The BBC Symphony Orchestra's festival, John Cage Uncaged, is at the Barbican, London EC2, from tonight until Sunday.
