In an interview for G2, the business secretary, who has been monitoring government communications from Nathaniel Rothschild's villa in Corfu for the last 72 hours, describes his ascetic diet and muses on the maturing of his political tactics over nearly 20 years of frontline politics. \"I don't really see myself as a big beast. More as a kindly pussycat. Yes, a kindly pussycat. I'm a kindly pussycat, with strong views about what we need to do,\" Mandelson said. Developing his other thesis (also involving small mammals) that Labour are now the \"underdogs\" of the political scene, Mandelson puts the chances of his party winning at 50:50. While the prime minister is on holiday, Mandelson, who is also first secretary of state, takes charge of a demoralised party with weekend reports that more than 120 Labour MPs \u2013 a third of the parliamentary party \u2013 are preparing to quit Westminster at the next general election. Figures released show that 63 MPs have already told the high command they will stand down but there are suggestions this could reach 93 in the period after party conferences in October with whips prepared for a further 20 to 30 to fall by the wayside ahead of the general election, expected for next spring. In his interview Mandelson describes mellowing. He said: I think 10 years ago, and also 15 years ago, I was a very hard-nosed, uncompromising figure who was manning the barricades of change in the Labour party, and prepared to take down anything or anyone who stood in the way. I don't feel in that mode now. And secondly, I've learned from experience that you can defeat people without killing them.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
