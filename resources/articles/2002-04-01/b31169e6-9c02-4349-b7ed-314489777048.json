But the seeds of Bush's speech lay in a far less subtle performance last Saturday. Then he broke a two-day silence on Israel's occupation of Palestinian areas in reprisal for suicide bombings, to take impromptu questions from reporters at his Texas ranch. Hours earlier the United States had supported a UN security council resolution calling on Israel to withdraw. But Bush, tieless in a casual shirt, reserved blame almost entirely for the Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, and said: \"I fully understand Israel's need to defend herself.\" Washington has often stood alone with Israel in the face of international opinion. But the worldwide reaction to Bush's comments was overwhelmingly negative, with demonstrations across the Arab world. A long-growing sense among Bush's advisers quickly crystallised: it was time for a broad, new statement of purpose and a high-stakes gamble. \"What he couldn't keep doing was simply responding to questions about it,\" one senior adviser said. Instead, the adviser added, Bush \"was going to have to lay out the big vision of the Middle East\". Another official noted that the swirl of events sparked by the Passover bombing amounted to a \"sea change\" on the ground. Whether that sea change will produce anything good is, of course, another question. Bush has put himself at the centre of a conflict that has defeated countless attempts at resolution. The potential for the administration to find itself enmeshed in intractable problems it had sought to avoid is enormous. But, for now, the president seems to have deflected growing domestic and international criticism. Over the weekend, the president's senior national security officials stepped up what were already daily meetings on the Middle East into a series of \"constant, non-stop meetings,\" as one of them recalled on Thursday, to adjust a policy that was widely seen as floundering. By Tuesday, the president had more or less resolved to send the secretary of state Colin Powell, whose international reputation and personal prestige rival his own, to the region with a broad mandate to discuss political questions, not just demands for a cease-fire and security measures that the administration had long insisted must come first. That same day, and again on Wednesday, senior advisers huddled in the White House situation room, hammering out the details of a speech in which Bush would seek to adapt the black-and-white hard line of his post-September 11 foreign policy to the enduring greys of the Middle East. Mr Powell, vice-president Dick Cheney and defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld all had their say, as the president's speechwriter, Michael Gerson, and his counsellor, Karen Hughes, turned the policy points into presidential oratory. \"The challenge was to find a way of inserting a greater political dimension into this process without compromising the principle of zero tolerance for terrorism,\" one senior administration official said. \"A lot of cooks had their spoons in the soup.\" New York Times"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
