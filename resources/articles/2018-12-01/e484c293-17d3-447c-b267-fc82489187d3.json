And while praising his players\u2019 attitude, he takes the opportunity to hint they still don\u2019t have the quality he needs. \u201cIt\u2019s a positive sign [that they fought hard] but there are things I cannot get from them and I cannot say much more than this.\u201d Pressed, he says: \u201cEverybody gives everything and that is for sure. And that is a positive. I cannot tell you much more.\u201d Mustafi: \u201cThe second half the game opened up a little bit. Both teams were trying to win .. We tried everything to get the three points. [After going in front[ we have to be a little bit more clever. But at the end of the day we\u2019ve had two tough games, against Tottenham and away to United and we\u2019ve taken four points.\u201d Apparently Arsenal\u2019s second goal has been officially recorded as an own goal by Rojo. But replays suggest that Lacazette got the last touch. They also show that Bailly fell backside-first on to Lacazette\u2019s head as the Frenchman fell under ROjo\u2019s tackle. Bearing all that in mind, Lacazette really does deserve to be credited with the goal. Smalling: \u201cYou could see how much the win meant to both teams. It went end to end and we gave it everything.\u201d Matic: \u201cBoth teams attacked. I think it was a great game for supporters. We could have scored a third one, I think we deserved [that]. Everybody knows the confidence is not high but I think we showd great character tonight. This is the way we have to fight until the end of the season.\u201d Smalling: \u201cWe all know we\u2019re in a tough patch of form and have a lot of injuries but everyone has given their all. Everyone has nicks and niggles but we\u2019re all digging in because we know how important this month. We were on the front foot, we were aggressive, we caused them lots of problem and were unlucy not to get a third goal.\u201d United remain eighth in the table, eight points off the top four. Arsenal are fifth, level on points with Chelsea but outside the top four on goal difference. In terms of individual performances, Bailly was impressive on his return for United after two months out. Rojo was decent, too, after an even longer absence. Torreira was all-action for Arsenal. That was a much improved performance by United in terms of attitude, with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s side closer to the mad dogs that Jos\u00e9 Mourinho demands. In terms of creative quality, they were still way short. But so were Arsenal. It was a scrappy, error-strewn but diverting contest between two teams who are a way short of being the best in the league. 90+3 min: Guendouzi and Mkhiaryan try to infiltrate the United box from the left. But United hold firm and force them back. 90 min: There will be at least four more minutes. 90 min: De Gea makes a terrific save to deny Torreira. Then Mkhitaryan lashes the ball into the net from a seemingly impossible angle! But he was offside so the goal doesn\u2019t stand. 89 min: De Gea stands with the ball in one hand. Lacazette sneaks u on im from behind and heads it out of his hand and rolls the ball into the empty net. BUt the ref won\u2019t let it stand. Why not? Tee keeper evidently didn\u2019t have it under his control. 89 min: Arsenal work Bellerin into a fine crossing position ... and Bellerin makes a mess of the cross. 88 min: Pogba has done nothing since his arrival. Yet. 87 min: Fellaini pulls Guendouzi back by the hair, right in front of the ref. Freekick to Arsenal midway inside the United half. It\u2019s a terrible delivery. \u201cToday I am grateful,\u201d announces Matt Richman. \u201cThe quality has been decidedly low today, with 4 goals born of error and scrappy play all around, but it\u2019s been wildly entertaining! Haven\u2019t been able to say that often when watching United this year.\u201d 86 min: The ref goes back to book Torreira. 85 min: The ref waves plays on for a wild tackle by Torreira, because the ball runs to Rashford. He tries to beat the keeper from 30 yards. It\u2019s a fine, swirling shot but Leno saves it at the second attempt. 84 min: Rashford and Guendouzi square up to each other near the centre circle while play continues. The ref doesn\u2019t bother to intervene and neither play feels like following through on their feisty gestures. There\u2019s real tension in this game, with both teams knowing there could be a winner there for them ... or a defeat. 82 min: \u201cAttack, attack, attack!\u201d bellow the home fans, and their team tries to oblige... 80 min: Mustafi and Lichtsteiner get in each other\u2019s way and end up presenting United with a throw-in in an attacking position. From there United work the ball quickly into the box, and Arsenal have to charge down a shot by Fellaini. 78 min: Aubameyang sprints back to cut out a cross by Darmian. United substitution: Pogba on, Lingard off. The new arrival is greeted with a mixture of cheers and boos. He\u2019s got some redeeming to do. 76 min: Audameyang cuts on to his right foot and tries to curl into the top corner from 20 yards. De Gea tips it away! 74 min: Rashford delays a pass to Lukaku as United threaten to hit Arsenal on the counter. When he does finally make the pass it\u2019s too short, allowing Guendouzi to intervene. 73 min: Sokratis does well to dispossess Lingard at the edge of the Arsenal box. This match is now wackily open and very entertaining! United substitution: Fellaini on, Rojo off. 71 min: Chaos in the United area! The ball pinballs around after being fired into the low across the face by Kolasinac. Aubameyang tries to tap into the net from five yards but De Gea saves with his feet! Moments later another low cross from the left is poked over the ball by Mkhitaryan from close range. United strike straight back again! And it\u2019s another defensive howler. Arsenal failed to cope with a long diagonal ball into their area by Rojo, as Kolasinac mindlessly nudged it further into the danger zone. Lingard was quickest to react, nipping in to slide it past Leno! What a disaster for United! Rojo was caught in possession inside his own half. Mkhitaryan hared towards the box and sidefooted to Lacazette, who was tackled by Rojo and Bailly, wrongfooting De Gea as the ball trundled into the net from eight yards! 66 min: Mustafi is limping ... and Arsenal have made all their permitted substitutions. Arsenal substitution: Lacazette on, Iwobi off. United substitution: Lukaku on, Martial off, apparently having injured himself while tracking back and tackling Sokratis. 62 min: Slick ove by Arsenal, who work Kolasinac in behind the United defenec on down the left. But he fails to pick out a teammate from the byline. 60 min: United hold tight at the back and pester Arsenal so much that from a good attacking position, Arsenal have had to pass the ball all the way back to Leno. 59 min: After a muscular buildup by United, Rojo tries to rocket one into the net from 25 yards, Leno tips it over! 57 min: A misjudgement by Sokratis creates space for Dalot to run free down the right to collect a pass. The youngster makes it all the way into the box and looks up to check his options. He\u2019s got teammates in the middle bawling for a cross. But he fails to find any of them! 55 min: Bailly does exceptionally well to keep pace with Aubameyang and hold him off before claiming the ball and playing it neatly out of defence. The home crowd love it! 53 min: Mayhem in the Arsenal box after Lingard pokes a pass through to Martial. Sokratis and Torreira combine to get rid of the ball eventually - wth extra help from Lichtsteiner. 51 min: Darmian sneaks a crafty ball forward to start a good United move. Rashford\u2019s cross from the left is cleared behind for a corner. Rashford delivers the set setpiece, and Leno punches it away. 49 min: Arsenal have turned up the heat in the second half and are putting United\u2019s defence under pressure, without looking like breaking through yet in this half. 47 min: Lingard reacts smartly to stop Guendouzi getting off a shot from the edge of the area after a steady Arsenal approach. Arsenal substitution: Mkhitaryan on, Ramsey off. Not sure if that\u2019s because of the injury that Ramsey suffered just before the break but it\u2019s a welcome addition, all the same. Mkhitaryan has the ability to contribute the thrust that Arsenal lacked in the first period. And wouldn\u2019t he love to do just that at Old Trafford? That was a low-quality half but Mourinho can have no quibble with his team\u2019s attitude, at least. They\u2019ve fought hard and the players returning to the side, especially Bailly and Rojo, have done well. Arsenal have been disappointing given the expectations with which they arrived and the fact that they were presented with a lead by a mistake from De Gea. They\u2019ve been unable to get Aubemeyang into the game. Dare we suggest they\u2019re missing Ozil? Mind you, they tend to be better in second halves under Emery so United still have much to do to claim a plucky home point. 45 min: There will be at least three more minutes until half-time. 44 min: This has become very messy. There\u2019s a break in play as Matic and Ramsey receive treatment, each having been injured in challenges within a couple of seconds of each other. 43 min: Matic becomes latest into the box for shamelessly pulling back Aubameyang as the Gabonese threatened to make his first dangerous run of the game. 41 min: This is getting feisty. United wants Bellerin booked for a clumsy foul on Darmian. They get their wish. 40 min: Lingard sees yellow for a sneaky foul on Torreira in the centre circle, intended solely to abort a promising Arsenal move. 38 min: Mustafi booked for a sliding tackle on Rashford. He got the ball ... after sliding through Rashford\u2019s left leg. United have a freekick a yard outside the box but a yard from the byline on the left. They play a sly one to the edge of the box, where Rojo is alone. He fires into a slew of bodies and then slides in to try to retrieve it, taking the feet of Guendouzi. That triggers some shoving and whingeing from Arsenal players. But maybe Rojo has done them a favour because they need to wake up a little here. Arsenal substitution: Lichtsteiner on, Holding off. Holding has departed on a stretcher. 35 min: Kolasinac\u2019s corner is headed away. Holding is still off the pitch being treated. 34 min: A hefty touch by Bailly near half way allows Arsenal to dash forward. Ramsey ignores teammates and tries to curl the ball around two defenders and into the top corner from 20 yards. It\u2019s deflected behind for a corner. 33 min: Holding is off the pitch receiving treatment on a knee after being clattered by Mad Dog Rashford. 32 min: That was weak defending by Arsenal. They were too slow to react after Leno batted the ball away from his goal. Mind you, Herrera was fractionally offside when the freekick was taken, which is why he was able to get to the ball first. Arsenal should still have cut out his cross, though. United equalise almost immediately! Rojo curled a decent freekick over the wall. Leno pushed it wide but Herrera retrieved it and pulled a gentle low cross back into the six-yard area. Two Arsenal players missed it but Martial did not, sweeping it into the net from six yards! 29 min: Martial runs into Guendouzi and gets a freekick. It\u2019s three yards outside the D and almost perfectly central... 28 min: Now United have have to find a goal and nothing about their midfield suggests they can create an opening. Arsenal have them where they want them... Mustafi plunges to meet a corner with a header into the ground. It bounces up ... and De Gea somehow allow it to slip through both his hands. Herrera tried to boot it off the line but technology lets the ref know the ball had crossed. Arsenal have the lead thanks to an awful mistake by United\u2019s normally reliable keeper! 25 min: Lingard penalised for tripping Torreira on half-way. He\u2019s been close to the Uruguayan for the whole game so far, evidently instructed to try to nullify his influence. 23 min: For all their zest, United haven\u2019t created much. And now Arsenal look like they\u2019re getting into a groove and are controlling possession. 21 min: Arsenal produce their best move of the match, Ramsey playing a lovely ball behind Dalot for Kolasinac. The Bosnian crosses low and hard towards Aubameyang, but Smalling slides in to swipe it away. 19 min: Superb play by Bailly to win possession twice in quick succession in the centre circle. As if to celebrate after the second one, he performs an implausible flick to shock Guendouzi and stride forward. And then he passes to empty space. 17 min: Torreira flights in the corner. Darmian does well to head clear despite the risk of getting a boot in the head from Aubameyang. 16 min: Better from Arsenal, as Iwobi outruns and then overpowers Bailly to collect a pass by Kolasinac and win a corner. 14 min: United remain the better team, first to most breaking balls. Not quite mad dogs but definitely a little piqued. There\u2019s a disturbing hint of the pussycat about Arsenal. 12 min: Sokratis steps in to relieve Rashford of the ball after Lingard slipped an inviting ball through to his teammate in the box. 10 min: Herrera harasses Guendouzi into coughing up possession mid-way inside the United half, allowing the hosts to launch a counter-attack. They run out of steam before reaching the danger zone. 8 min: Rojo spoons a pass into the left-hand channel. Martial chases and wins a corner. Rashford\u2019s delivery is cleared at the near post. 6 min: It\u2019s as if Arsenal spent the buildup reading the pre-match thoughts in this here MBM and were lulled into complacency. by all the woe-is-United talk. They\u2019ve been sluggish so far. 5 min: Rashford lets fly from 20 yards after a bright buildup. He catches it sweetly but it\u2019s straight at the keeper, who holds it easily. 3 min: There\u2019s encouraging zest to United\u2019s start and the home fans are responding to the intensity by cranking up the volume. 2 min: Holding tries to Beckenbauer it out from the back and his attempt ends in predictable fashion, Martial dispossessing him. United may be at a low ebb but that was a taking a liberty by a player who has no business doing so. 1 min: We have kickoff! Arsenal do the honours. \u201cIf Jose were playing Championship Manager, would he restart the computer and flip the keyboard?\u201d asks Joe Rickards. Or might he kick in the screen and launch a campaign against the manufacturers? \u201cAs an Arsenal fan, there are few phrases as likely to summon forth a cold sweat as much as your \u2018Arsenal should win this,\u201d says Karl Tulinius with a shiver. \u201cIn the last decade or so, the team could be facing FC Bumbleby, a team from the third division of a country that is only famous for its cheese, and still there would be the expectation that a slip-up was likely. It will take more than half a season of success to unlearn those harsh lessons.\u201d The teams are in the tunnel. The home team at least look like Manchester United, in red jerseys, black shorts and red socks. Arsenal are in pale blue, like a sick Manchester City. \u201cI admit to be being massively biased against Mourinho,\u201d announces Ben Lake. \u201cI will never be able to get past him throwing medical staff under the bus in a pathetic attempt to cover his teams failings. Keeping that in mind, I\u2019m not getting on board with any attempt to lessen the fault he carries with United\u2019s current problems. Yes, recruitment has been an issue, in that he hasn\u2019t been able to get exactly who he wanted but he has had a lot of money spent on this squad. A lot. The problem remains the manager, we saw at this year\u2019s world cup that plenty of his players are completely capable of fantastic performances. Lukaku and Pogba being the obvious ones. It\u2019s also not like Pogba was being played in a dynamic attacking formation. I also won\u2019t get on board with the lazy players idea. Yes, some might not be putting a shift in but if you had a miserable boss who came into work everyday and blamed the tea lady, the feng shui and everyone around him for all his problems, we might all lose motivation too. Context must be provided but we shouldn\u2019t shy from the idea that Mourinho is cocking this up good and proper.\u201d \u201cJose\u2019s constant team changes seem to me a reaction to being mercilessly trolled by his own players,\u201d reckons David Flynn. \u201cHis starting 11 never play well and results are only saved by his subs. So he starts those same subs in the next game and they revert back to awful until he replaces them and the cycle continues. It would without doubt be hilarious if I weren\u2019t a United fan.\u201d Here\u2019s Arsenal fan Krishna Moorthi with a summary of where these teams are at: \u201cUnited are eighth, have 22 points from 14 games and a negative goal difference. Arsenal are unbeaten in 19, won the North London Derby convincingly and have been a joy for fans recently. This is the perfect time for us to screw up.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve noticed how the United players tend to get more dynamic the longer they are away from any Mourinho interaction or tactics or when his gameplan is changed via an opposition goal,\u201d writes Paul Fitzgerald. \u201cThen they reset when he gets them in at half-time. Last week\u2019s game against Southampton was a prime example.\u201d \u201cIt is with immense sadness that I provide a counterpoint to James Kelly,\u201d chimes Matt Richman. \u201cI never like to stump for sacking anyone (Mou is still a person, after all), but if I owned a business where the CEO was lashing out at all the change agents he hired I would be looking for a new CEO. Jose does not seem happy by any stretch at any rate; parting ways just seems a sensible thing to do. Another painful aspect of this is I have no replacement in mind. Would love to see Poch at the club, but he\u2019s far too dignified to make that move. Zidane would be a massive coup, but I severely doubt his interest. Sad days for this long-time supporter.\u201d \u201cJames Kelly [19.33] is right,\u201d hollers Loren Dunlop. \u201cThese are sad times for United fans, and sheer delight for the vast, vast majority of the rest of the footballing public.\u201d \u201cIn regards to Mourinho\u2019s alterations match to match, in his defence (and I\u2019m loathe to ever defend this guy) the recruitment, scouting and youth development have been all over the place since the last few years of Fergie through Moyes and Van Gaal resulting in a lopsided, incoherent squad that has no style apart from containment (which only some of the players are capable of),\u201d writes Eddie Munro. \u201cEmery has taken over from the vision of one other person, added a couple of proper central midfielders and the squad suddenly looks balanced (obviously he\u2019s also a bit of a genius).\u201d That\u2019s true. But it can\u2019t be ignored that the recruits that Mourinho sanctioned have not worked out so far. Mourinho certainly isn\u2019t the only problem at United, and maybe not even the biggest. But he\u2019s not looking like part of the solution these days, after good early years. \u201cWhen I read the line where you wrote \u2018Arsenal should win this\u2019, I felt like kicking a cat, not a real one, but my twins\u2019 stuffed toy,\u201d miaows James Kelly. \u201cI thought \u2018How dare he!\u201d Then I realised it\u2019s because the truth bloody hurts. I\u2019ve never called for a manager\u2019s head at United and I won\u2019t start now. And I remember when it was bad. However, the fact the two marquee signings of Jose are now benched due to not trying hard enough can\u2019t be ignored. I still hope he turns it around, just because the manager merry go round creates further instability. Sad times for United fans. Sheer delight for ABUs.\u201d Funny, isn\u2019t it, how Emery is acclaimed for adjusting his team from match to match to take account of the strengths and weaknesses of different opponents; while when it comes to Mourinho\u2019s alterations, you suspect some of them are motivated by exasperation and a slightly desperate bid to cover his own team\u2019s problems. Asked whether his team selection, particularly players just coming back from injury, represents a gamble, he replies: \u201cI don\u2019t think gambling, I think sacrifice. They are confident. I would never play a player if he has too many doubts. That was what happened against Southampton, they had too many doubts. They are confident and ready for that sacrifice you need, the sacrifice Jones was able to do against Southampton. Now it\u2019s for others.\u201d About Rojo, in particular, he says: \u201cZero minutes of competition all season, I think it\u2019s hard to play a game of this dimension but he\u2019s confident, mentally ready and very happy.\u201d And about the omissions of Pogba and Lukaku he says: \u201cYou know, technical and tactical decisions. We\u2019re going to play with Lingard, Rashford and Martial. We did that before against Young Boys. We were not successful with the goals we wanted to score but we were happy with the situations we were able to create. We believe the combination of these three young, fast, creative players ... we believe in their dynamic and appetite.\u201d That\u2019s a barren looking United midfield, chosen primarily to provide protection to a frail back three. Arsenal should win this. But Emery isn\u2019t careless enough to declare that publicly before the game. Instead he says: \u201cThey have big players and a very experienced coach ... This is a big challenge for us.\u201d He also says of United: \u201cWe\u2019re in a very early stage of the season and there is still time for them to get into the top four.\u201d Patronising much? Mourinho has made seven changes to the side that struggled to a draw at Southampton on Saturday - and two of them are especially notable: Pogba and Lukaku have been demoted to the bench. Both were awful at St Mary\u2019s. Without naming names, Mourinho writes in his programme notes for this match that \u201cthere is no space for players who are not ready to give their all\u201d. Meanwhile in defence, Bailly makes his return after two months out and Rojo is drafted into a back three to play his first game since being tormented by Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 at the World Cup - there\u2019s every chance that Aubameyang will treat him to a similar ordeal? United: De Gea; Bailly, Smalling, Rojo; Dalot, Herrera, Matic, Darmian; Lingard, Rashford, Martial. Subs: Pogba, Mata, Lukaku, Romero, Valencia, Fellaini, McTominay. Arsenal: Leno; Papastathopoulos, Mustafi, Holding; Bellerin, Torreira, Guendouzi, Ramsey, Kolasinac; Iwobi, Aubameyang. Subs: Cech, Elneny, Mkhitaryan, Lacazette, Lichtsteiner, Maitland-Niles, Nketiah. Referee: Andre Marriner (West Midlands) Hello, welcome to something momentous. This fixture used to be a title decider and then, in the last decade, it became a barometer showing by how far Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s Arsenal had slid. Now Arsenal arrive at Old Trafford looking to provide yet more evidence of a resurgence under Unai Emery by gaining their first Premier League win at this venue since 2006 \u2013 and that, in turn, would intensify the focus on how far United are sliding under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. It is hard to believe United finished second in the Premier League last season, 18 points above Arsenal. Now United are eighth, eight points behind fourth-place Arsenal. That\u2019s a 26-point swing and today\u2019s match is not going to radically alter the underlying causes of that \u2013 but it could certainly reinforce them. Mourinho is not responsible for all United\u2019s current ills, of course \u2013 the board and certain players also bear much blame - but nor is the manager looking like part of the solution. Injuries have complicated his selection for today\u2019s match, especially in defence, where the chances of United keeping Pierre-Emerick Aubemeyang at bay look slim. United have already been tonked here by Spurs this season \u2013 and held to draws by Wolves and Crystal Palace \u2013 and there is a real danger of Arsenal inflicting more punishment if United remain as stodgy, dishevelled and blunt as they have been for much of the season. For United to defy expectation and win, the Mourinho will need to coax the inner mad dog out of his team, especially in midfield, where Arsenal have found new dynamism. Otherwise expect more talk of a virus in the United camp, and calls for the whole place to be fumigated."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
