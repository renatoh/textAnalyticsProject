After the administrator, KPMG, approved Bates's initial bid of 1p in the pound for the \u00a335m in debts that had led to the club being placed in receivership - a settlement rejected by the Revenue commissioners - there was concern among creditors and other bidders about what the sale had generated this time around. One source close to the property developer Simon Morris and the Redbus Group claimed that their joint bid had been worth an unconditional \u00a33.5m, or 10p in the pound, to creditors. Upon the granting of Football League approval of the bid that sum would have risen to \u00a311.5m with \u00a320m available for transfers and a further \u00a35m being paid to creditors upon promotion to the Premiership. How Bates managed to top this will not be known until the creditors' report is published, which will probably not be before the autumn. A spokesman for KPMG said that was \"because it is confidential\" and that \"it had been agreed before\" that bids for Leeds would be undisclosed. And this after the man handling the administration for KPMG, Richard Fleming, had been challenged by the local Leeds MP Colin Burgon to hold his processes up to public scrutiny. Burgon's challenge received the following response from Fleming in a letter written on Tuesday: \"I consider that our actions are both correct and fully justified. The process has resulted in competitive tension that has driven up the return to creditors whilst minimising the risk of the club ceasing to exist, as a result of no funds being available to fund trading.\" This appears to have been contradicted by the claims earlier this week by the Redbus Group's Simon Franks, who claimed he had offered in writing to fund any shortfall in running costs. It is also thought that there was a request from at least one bidder for a full and open auction, which might have seemed more likely to increase \"competitive tension\". So you think it's all over Whether Bates's takeover will become definitive rests with the former Leeds director Adam Pearson, a late bidder, and HM Revenue &amp; Customs, which was owed \u00a37.7m at the time Bates filed for administration. Yet another challenge to the administration process cannot be ruled out, since both were considering their positions last night. Brooking isolated Richard Lewis's key recommendation in his eight-month-long review of youth development in English football delivered this week was for a Youth Management Group to be introduced to steer policy across the game. The Football Association's head of youth development, Sir Trevor Brooking, below, is expected to take his seat at that table but will find few friends among the Football League and Premier League, the other stakeholders. There were raised eyebrows in both organisations at Brooking's claims that \"we have to raise the bar at grassroots level\" considering that Brooking has looked after youth coaching at the FA since December 2003; before that he was chairman of Sport England. Its responsibility is for increasing involvement in grassroots sport. Paper thin The European Commission's white paper on sport turned out to be as wishy-washy as expected yesterday. Its focus was on the public health and social benefits of sport rather than tackling the trickier issue of providing legal certainty to sports organisations tired of defending themselves through the European courts. That had been the aim of the then sports minister, Richard Caborn, who set the process in motion in September 2005. Sports governing bodies will now be clinging instead to the hope that the next treaty being drafted will respond to their demands for exemption on European Union labour laws for home-grown players and for recognition of sport's specificity. matt.scott@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
