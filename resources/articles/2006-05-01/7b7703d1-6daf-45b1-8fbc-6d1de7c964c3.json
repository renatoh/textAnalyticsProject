It's wearing surprisingly well, yet is touchingly dated. They conduct extensive correspondence by post and keep each other's letters and don't have access to computers, email, fax or cell-phones. Somewhat detached from the society of their times, they seem nearer to the world of Scott Fitzgerald, whose sense of doom they share, than to the 21st century that was then a mere decade ahead of them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
