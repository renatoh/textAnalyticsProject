Ahoy there me hearties, there be somethin' afoot! 'Tis international Talk Like a Pirate Day, which be falling just two days before Manchester United v Arsenal day. This may explain why Alex Ferguson turned up to today's press conference sporting a three-cornered hat, a wooden leg and an unfeasibly ruddy face. In fact, it would not be stretching a long-winded and frankly untrue point to say that he was also swigging from flagon of ale. Unless our lawyers object, of course. The talk on the high seas is that Arsenal's sailor boys have abandoned all hope after having their timbers well and truly shivered by those Milanese pirates on Wednesday. But now that their French leader has given his scurvy dogs the cat o' nail tails treatment, the Gunners are bristling for Sunday's top of the [captain's] table fight. \"They be saying they be more determined a-comin' into Old Trafford, but we be expectin' that. We expect an Arsenal team to be determined,\" ooh-ahhed Jolly Ferg, as the annoying bird on his shoulder parroted \"Determined! Determined!\" Then, winking like Anne Robinson with Tourette's, Ferg added: \"They were determined on Wednesday night too!\" Sadly, both the wink and the dig were lost beneath his eye patch. Although it's difficult to fit into this ill-advised-but-we're-too-close-to-deadline-to-turn-back-now pirate riff, Arsenal's Sol Campbell is likely to miss the game following a family bereavement. But reports of a scurvy outbreak aboard Good Ship United are untrue, and Cap'n Keane is boasting a clean bill of health. \"No nay nothing needs to be done to the Cap'n's ankle,\" yo-ho-hoed Ferg, while swigging from a bottle of rum. \"His ankle is fine. All we need to do is decide whether he be ready for Sunday.\" But whatever happens, Jolly Ferg will not be shouting 'land ho!' from the crow's nest just yet. \"It be only September and ye don't get the [treasure] now.\" Arrrr! * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"Beckham the new King: the disbelievers surrender before his play and his stats\" - Yes, it's Spanish daily Marca again, this time hyping the fact that David Beckham is No1 in passes, plays and assists (but only the No9 in fouls received, which is a bit poor) in Spain * * * * * * * * * * * * DOWN AND OUT The Fiver's never been the kind of email news service to riff on another man's pain. Because having suffered more low blows than rockin' Ron Jeremy in his pornorific prime, if you'll pardon the phrase, we know better than to twist another man's melon when he's down. Unless that melon belongs to Carlton Palmer, that is, because with Carlton - who until 10.45am this morning was the manager of Stockport County - we can't help but make an exception. As a footballer, Carlton Palmer wasn't half bad. Well how could he have been, Graham Taylor didn't hand out caps to any old muggins, did he, eh? Eh? Oh. Right. As a manager, he was far less impressive. Hard to imagine, yes, but the facts don't lie. In almost two years at Edgeley Park, Carlton, as Taylor liked to call him, managed for 92 games, winning 25 and losing an impressive 50. And while the Fiver's no statistician, there happened to be one passing our door a few minutes ago who happily confirmed that such figures confirm Carlton to be a \"bumbling fool and no mistake\". Clearly County's chief executive Niels de Vos agreed, only he chose his words more carefully on the club's website. \"Carlton has presided over a very difficult period and in many ways can look back with pride on what he has achieved,\" he announced, surely stifling a titter. \"He has pulled together a talented young side of real potential,\" he added, as the Fiver wondered out loud why then he'd been told to \"do one\". \"Why it's obvious,\" De Vos sort of added, \"because perhaps he's taken this team as far as he could.\" There's no perhaps about it, Mr De Vos, at least not any more. * * * * * * * * * * * * THE LINES ARE CLOSED FOR THE INAUGURAL FIVER PR PERSON OF THE YEAR AWARD 2003 Well, that's it. All we've received all week is that dreadful Jack Charlton tat that's cluttering up the place, so it's clear even to us that this thing is dying a death. We'll be announcing the winner at some point next week, which buys us some time to work out exactly what the hell we're going to do to wrap up this ill-thought-out venture to everyone's satisfaction. Mind you, if anyone wants to influence the judges in any way, shape or form, feel free to contact them at The Fiver PR Person Of The Year Awards, The Fiver, Fiver Towers, 3-7 Ray Street, London EC1R 3DR. Scientific studies show that late entries are always uppermost in judges' minds, incidentally. * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Michel Salgado is a defender, which probably explains why Real Madrid are prepared to let him go. Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United are all counting their pennies and preparing \u00a35m bids as we speak. Alan Shearer won't be taking over from Bobby Robson at Newcastle. According to the Express, he's going to become a pundit on Sky Sports, where his wooden monotone delivery, lack of humour, and utter inability to hold the viewer's attention for more than three seconds will be prize assets. Liverpool's pursuit of Djibril Cisse continues - although there's a twist in the tale: if they sign him, footballtransfers.info reckons Michael Owen will be off to Internazionale. * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Birmingham City defender Darren Purse has received a three-match ban for violent conduct after his appeal for bundling over Luis Boa Morte last Sunday was rejected. Liverpool have poured cold water on claims they could share a new stadium with Everton - and insisted their plans to re-locate will continue. Chief executive Rick Parry said: \"The planning permission for our new stadium at Stanley Park will be submitted in a fortnight and we hope to be up and running there by 2006, so there is not a moment to lose.\" AC Milan vice-president Adriano Galliani has admitted Rivaldo could leave - if he asks them for a move. \"If he is happy to stay with us then he will stay, if however he asks to go then we will let him go,\" Galliani cryptically told Gazzetta dello Sport. * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO ITV1: World Football (3.15am) All week we've been banging on about Mike Carpet, and you've had enough. \"Forget Mr Carpet,\" blasts Stephen Price. \"In South Wales we have the daddy of all bad regional ads. Sky Sports 1: Soccer AM's All Sports Show (6pm) \"The ad for Crazy Mac's discount tat store, the sort of place where you can buy anything from a 10-litre drum of industrial strength detergent to water-damaged 1993 Arsenal away shirts, takes some beating. Premier League Preview Show (7pm) \"Fronted by Crazy Mac, who resembles that portly gentleman who used to run the Rovers Return and occasionally dressed up as a woman with Les Dawson, the ad plunders hitherto unimaginable depths of small screen unprofessionalism. Sky Sports Xtra: Big Cup (8pm) \"Crazy Mac is clearly not a RADA graduate and delivers his 'crazy' lines with an almost unbearable discomfort that makes for one of the most painful viewing experiences imaginable. Watch his wooden, exaggerated smile and forced craziness as his eyes flick nervously from camera. There is a sadness in those eyes, I'm sure of it.\" British Eurosport: Big Cup (7.15pm) Meanwhile Andy Phelan adds: \"I'm a little surprised no one has mentioned the brilliant ads on Yorkshire TV in the 1980s for Barry Noble's Roxy nightclub, which was, I think, in Sheffield or some such godforsaken hellhole. Talksport: Football First (7pm) \"Barry, clutching a fat cigar, used to stand outside the Roxy and deliver the line: 'I'm Barry Noble, this is my Roxy - get y'sels in.' The camera cuts to two lasses, one of whom says: 'It's great, you can meet yer mates.' Newstalk 106 (www.newstalk106.ie): Off the Ball with Ger Gilroy (7pm) \"Time and therapy have eroded any further memories I might have had. I lived in Hull then; I now live in Devon, largely due to the existence oop north of people like Barry Noble. Actually, I'm thinking the whole Phoenix Nights thing might even be based on our Barry.\" Can you recall a sponsor's message that clearly influenced a popular comedian?
