But it is actually Tracey Emin's first piece of public art, in Liverpool, commissioned as part of the north-west region's art05 celebrations. It will be unveiled today outside the Oratory, John Foster's miniature Greek temple next to the Anglican cathedral. Roman Standard features a small bird perched on a four-metre bronze pole designed as a tribute to the city's famous, mythical Liver Bird. \"It vaguely resembles a swift,\" said Emin yesterday as the sculpture was installed. \"But then it could be a starling.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
