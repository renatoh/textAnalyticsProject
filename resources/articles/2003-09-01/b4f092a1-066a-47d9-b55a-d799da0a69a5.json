I was in a research team which showed that recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) had no anabolic effect on muscle in young healthy men; my colleagues then obtained similar results in power lifters, including elderly subjects. This work has never been scientifically challenged. Instead of paying to detect a drug that confers no benefit to cheats, sports authorities should educate young athletes (and old romantics, wistful for youth) that their magic bullet will misfire. Professor Michael J. Rennie University of Dundee Impartial service Andrew Rawnsley was being disingenuous (Comment, last week) when he said that being a civil servant did not stop me from being as partisan for Margaret Thatcher as Alastair Campbell was for Tony Blair. I was no more partisan than civil service press secretaries who worked for Edward Heath, James Callaghan and John Major. We operated within a civil service code which constrained our activities and left party political presentation to the party HQs. Mr Campbell, a political appointee but paid by the taxpayer, was allowed to ignore most of the rules, though subject to a special adviser code. It may be argued that in this he was unique among the small number of politically-appointed press secretaries since 1945. The lesson of the last six years is for governments to return to the civil service spokesman system that Rawnsley scorns. Sir Bernard Ingham Purley, Surrey Singled out Laura Kipnis (Comment Extra, last week) quotes a research finding that only 38 per cent of married Americans describe themselves as happy. One wonders what the percentage would be if unmarried people were asked. Studies of happiness generally come up with a pretty low percentage! Kipnis talks of marriage turning people into 'petty dictators' whose favourite marital activity is mate-behaviour modification. But most of us could do with a bit of this. If it is worked at in a loving relationship, both partners can develop. What's wrong with trying to encourage someone to be more considerate? Who else is going to tell you to stop picking your nose in public? We all know of long-term single people who could do with a bit of behaviour modification but who have no one to tell them. Eileen Peck Benfleet, Essex Death difference One key reason behind new research suggesting that death rates among a sample of surgical patients in Britain are higher than those in America (News, last week) is that the length of stay in US hospitals is shorter than in the UK. Thirty-five per cent of US patients are discharged to intermediate care and specialist nursing facilities, compared with only 3.5 per cent in the UK. Death rates in English NHS acute hospitals are in fact reducing at about 2.3 per cent a year, slightly faster than the rate in the US. Professor Sir Brian Jarman Director, Dr Foster Unit Imperial College, London W2 Howzat? Norman Harris (Sport, last week) says 'no one has seriously addressed' the one-day cricket problem of bowlers being restricted in the number of overs they may bowl, while batsmen have no comparable limit. In 1964, at Christ Church College, Canterbury, we devised a six-a-side contest. All fielders but the wicket-keeper had to bowl two overs. Each batsman could face a maximum of 30 balls. Did we 'seriously' address the problem? Possibly not, but great fun was had by all. Clive W. Porter The Journal of the Cricket Society, Maidstone Don't sneer, cheer I was depressed by Victoria Coren (Comment, last week) relishing the fact that Emma Thompson and Chris Hampton's film, Imagining Argentina, was jeered and booed in Venice. We should be proud that a leading British actor and playwright put so much work into such a risky undertaking.
