A game described by the German as \"must win\" has been drawn, and fortunately at that, against awkward if hardly imposing opponents. The repercussions will be grim. Vogts cut a helpless figure as he had to watch from the stands because of the ill-timed one-match ban imposed after his rant at the Belgian referee during Saturday's defeat to Norway. His side laboured pitifully in his absence and briefly trailed in the first half. They were ridiculously outclassed at times thereafter, itself a damning indictment of his reign. The locals greeted their side's first point of the campaign with whoops of delight and the visiting fans, all 2,000 of them, with downright fury. Chants demanding the German's removal mixed with bellowed choruses of \"There's only one Gordon Strachan\". Scotland have gleaned two points to date and Norway, 3-0 victors over Slovenia, have edged further out of reach. Mathematically the pursuit of passage to Germany is not yet hopeless, but realistically it has become distinctly improbable after only three games. That will surely see Vogts removed by the time they next play a qualifier, in Italy in March. \"I want to stay on, but it is up to my president,\" he said, head in hand at the end. \"It is not a resigning matter at the moment.\" The SFA is not due to meet for three weeks and the manager is contracted until 2006 on \u00a3500,000 a year, but the president John McBeth and chief executive David Taylor are expected to act now. The pair sat shivering in the stands last night, as much in response to what they were witnessing as the freezing conditions. They have long shown faith in the German, their country's first foreign manager, but it is waning. The fans have clearly lost patience, with their abuse prompting the captain Barry Ferguson to approach them at the final whistle. \"The abuse was out of order,\" said the Blackburn midfielder. \"I feel for Berti and (the assistant manager) Tommy Burns. If it was up to me I'd keep him as manager, but it's not down to me. Everyone is gutted with this result.\" This was no place for Vogts's illustrious career, as a player and a manager, to fizzle out. Moldova are ranked 113th in the world, their ramshackle Republican Stadium an illustration of the problems besetting their game, yet they were by far the better team last night. Their striking Sergheis, Rogaciov and Dadu, were pesky all night, invariably fed by the impressive Spartak Moscow playmaker Serghei Covalciuc. The visitors' rearguard creaked too often for comfort. Dadu is known to the Scots, having had the misfortune to be kicked in the head by Rangers' Alex Rae during a Champions League qualifying game in August. The Moldovan took some measure of revenge here just before the half-hour. Ghenadie Olexici was allowed time to cross from the right flank and his centre was flicked on by Rogaciov for Dadu, holding off the befuddled Gary Caldwell, to spin and batter a low shot which the exposed Craig Gordon could not repel. Vogts, from his position on high, must have felt his world implode. To the visitors' only credit, their riposte was swift. Darren Fletcher marauded down the flank and his deflected cross was collected by Steven Thompson. The Rangers striker, aware that Evgheni Hmaruc was disorientated and stranded off his line, slid his third international goal and the Scots' first of the World Cup qualifying campaign inside the goalkeeper's near post. Yet that was as good as it got, Thompson later acknowledging that \"the goal meant nothing\". Instead of the swift return to parity generating momentum, it appeared to drain it in the evening chill. Covalciuc crossed for Dadu immediately after the restart, the striker controlling the centre and delivering a fierce shot which Gordon, springing to his right, did well to tip aside. Dadu, presented with a free header from Covalciuc's cross, should have given the Hearts goalkeeper no chance only to balloon high and horribly wide. When Rogaciov dragged a simple chance wide, the Scots were tempting utter humiliation. As it is, for Vogts a draw will most likely prove as damaging as a defeat. \"It is a very bad result for us and qualifying will now be very difficult,\" he said. \"I understand why the fans were disappointed. This was a must-win game, but we have to keep trying.\" Whether he will be there to oversee those attempts appears unlikely."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
