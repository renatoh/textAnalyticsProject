But there's suggestions of an FBI investigation, although the sources seem slim so far. Slate has an even bolder claim, as yet without sources. The Guardian's Ewen MacAskill files his take on the Petraeus resignation: The argument for resignation was that the affair had left him vulnerable to blackmail. All spy organisations warn their agents against affairs for that reason, and the head of the organisation could not then ignore the advice given to those further down the chain. But an alternative version in Washington was that Petraeus was under pressure over the killing of the US ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans in an attack on the US embassy in Benghazi in September. On Benghazi as the \"real\" reason for Petraeus going: if it was, then the White House would be dumping a large bucket of odure on Petraeus's head as a scapegoat. Lest we forget: the infallably wrong Drudge Report claimed that Mitt Romney was going to pick David Petraeus for his VP nominee... Couldn't have done any worse than Paul Ryan. Republicans seem to be willing to run hard with the \"it's really all to do with Benghazi deaths\" line, which hardly makes sense at all. There are some inane conspiracy theories floating around \u2013 the bar of credulity is lowered at a time such as this \u2013 but ABC News has an unnamed official denying any connection between Petraeus's resignation and the deadly events in the Benghazi: [Petraeus] was scheduled to testify next week on Capitol Hill behind closed doors about the death of four Americans, including two working for the CIA. They died at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, Libya, September 11. Holes in security at the consulate have been the subject of an internal government investigation at the State Department and a congressional inquiry. A US official stressed that Petraeus' decision to step down had \"absolutely nothing to do with Benghazi.\" Planned congressional hearings on the Benghazi incident will continue as planned with CIA Deputy Director Michael Morell filling in for Petraeus as acting director. The Associated Press reports on Petraeus's decision to step down: The resignation shocked Washington's intelligence and political communities, representing a sudden end to the public career of the best-known general of the post 9/11 wars. Petraeus has been married for 37 years to Holly Petraeus, whom he met when he was a cadet at the US Military Academy at West Point. David Petraeus had been coming under criticism for the CIA's involvement and handling of security at the Benghazi consulate in Libya, where four US officials were killed, but Senator John McCain has nothing but praise: General David Petraeus will stand in the ranks of America\u2019s greatest military heroes. His inspirational leadership and his genius were directly responsible \u2013 after years of failure \u2013 for the success of the surge in Iraq. General Petraeus has devoted his life to serving the country he loves, and America is so much the better for it. We are immensely grateful for General Petraeus\u2019s decades of work on behalf of our nation, our military, and our security. Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family. Senator Diane Feinstein, chair of Senate intelligence commitee, offers an interesting note of support for David Petraeus: I wish President Obama had not accepted this resignation, but I understand and respect the decision. Veteran CBS News radio correspondent Mark Knoller reports: David Petraeus's resignation will bring the conspiracy theorists out in droves \u2013 and let's start at the top with Rupert Murdoch: I'm not sure if that is a tweet so much as orders to Murdoch's newsrooms around the world. A statement from President Obama on David Petraeus's resignation: David Petraeus has provided extraordinary service to the United States for decades. By any measure, he was one of the outstanding General officers of his generation, helping our military adapt to new challenges, and leading our men and women in uniform through a remarkable period of service in Iraq and Afghanistan, where he helped our nation put those wars on a path to a responsible end. As Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, he has continued to serve with characteristic intellectual rigor, dedication, and patriotism. By any measure, through his lifetime of service David Petraeus has made our country safer and stronger. Today, I accepted his resignation as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. I am completely confident that the CIA will continue to thrive and carry out its essential mission, and I have the utmost confidence in Acting Director Michael Morell and the men and women of the CIA who work every day to keep our nation safe. Going forward, my thoughts and prayers are with Dave and Holly Petraeus, who has done so much to help military families through her own work. I wish them the very best at this difficult time. Reaction to David Petraeus's decision gives the sense of surprise. James Clapper, director of national intelligence, says in a statement: Dave\u2019s decision to step down represents the loss of one of our nation\u2019s most respected public servants. From his long, illustrious Army career to his leadership at the helm of CIA, Dave has redefined what it means to serve and sacrifice for one\u2019s country. NBC News is also reporting that \"multiple sources\" tell it that Mike Morrell, the deputy CIA director and a longtime CIA officer, \"would likely be offered the job as acting director but with the understanding that he may be elevated to the job permanently at some point.\" Via NBC News \u2013 which first broke the news \u2013 here's the text of David Petraeus's resignation letter to staff at the CIA headquarters: Yesterday afternoon, I went to the White House and asked the President to be allowed, for personal reasons, to resign from my position as D/CIA. After being married for over 37 years, I showed extremely poor judgment by engaging in an extramarital affair. Such behavior is unacceptable, both as a husband and as the leader of an organization such as ours. This afternoon, the President graciously accepted my resignation. As I depart Langley, I want you to know that it has been the greatest of privileges to have served with you, the officers of our Nation's Silent Service, a work force that is truly exceptional in every regard. Indeed, you did extraordinary work on a host of critical missions during my time as director, and I am deeply grateful to you for that. Teddy Roosevelt once observed that life's greatest gift is the opportunity to work hard at work worth doing. I will always treasure my opportunity to have done that with you and I will always regret the circumstances that brought that work with you to an end. Thank you for your extraordinary service to our country, and best wishes for continued success in the important endeavors that lie ahead for our country and our Agency. With admiration and appreciation, David H Petraeus AP's first take on David Petraeus's resignation: David Petraeus has resigned as director of the CIA after admitting he had an extramarital affair. According to his letter of resignation, Petraeus asked President Barack Obama on Thursday to allow him to resign, and on Friday the president accepted. Petraeus said in a statement that he had shown \"extremely poor judgment\" in having an affair. Here's more on the David Petraeus resignation: NBC reported Friday that CIA director David Petraeus has resigned from the CIA, citing an extramarital affair. NBC's Andrea Mitchell said the resignation was submitted in a letter dated Friday and was accepted by the White House. In a letter, Petraeus noted that he had been married for 37 years and had exercised \"extremely poor judgment' in conducting an extramarital affair. Petraues took over as head of the CIA in September of 2011 following his tour as head of allied forces in Afghanistan. This just breaking: former four star general David Petraeus has resigned from his post as CIA director, owing to an extramarital affair. More as it emerges, but this was for \"personal reasons,\" according to Petraeus's letter of resignation to President Obama. Here's a summary of the start of the \"fiscal cliff\" negotiations today: \u2022 President Obama demanded a \"balanced approach\" to any tax and debt deal being worked out with Republicans in Congress to solve the so-called \"fiscal cliff\". He said that any spending cuts would be coupled with revenue increases: \"And that means asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more in taxes.\" \u2022 Obama reminded the Republicans of last Tuesday's election result: \"We found out that the majority of Americans agree with my approach... Our job now is to get a majority in Congress to reflect the will of the American people.\" \u2022 'I've got the pen': Obama urges passage of legislation to extend middle income tax cuts, and promises to authorise it immediately \u2022 The White House confirmed that Obama would be prepared to veto any legislation that maintained the Bush-era tax cuts on upper income earners. \u2022 Speaker of the House John Boehner called on President Obama to show leadership \u2013 and also hinted that debt ceiling negotiations should be tied the any tax and debt deal Some reaction to Obama's remarks today, from the Senate. Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, says: It is time for us to put politics aside and give the American people the balanced approach they are demanding. Mitch McConnell, leader of the Republican minority, says: While I appreciate and share the President\u2019s desire to put election behind us, the fact is we still have yet to hear an actual plan. McConnell once again displaying his can-do spirit of sunny optimism. The name's Bush. George Bush. To be precise: George Prescott Garnica Bush. Yes, as Jeb Bush is being talked about as a 2016 Republican presidential candidate, so the latest Bush name enters the arena, says the Houston Chronicle: George P Bush, the product of Texas political royalty, has filed paperwork with the Texas Ethics Commission to run for office. Bush, 36, is the nephew of former President George W Bush and grandson of former President George HW Bush. His father is former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and his mother, Columba, is a native of Mexico. The younger Bush's move comes at a pivotal moment for the GOP, after the party's lack of success with Latino voters was cited as a primary cause for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney's loss to President Barack Obama in Tuesday's general election. Bush speaks fluent Spanish and comes from a family \u2014 particularly his father and uncle \u2014 that has successfully built inroads to Latino voters. Speaking to the White House press corps just now, spokesman Jay Carney confirms that President Obama would veto any bill that extended the Bush-era tax cuts for the top 2% of income earners. After voters in two states approved the possession and consumption of marijuana in referendums earlier this week, the question arises: what about the conflict with federal law that still criminalises it? The Associated Press says talks are underway between the states and the Department of Justice: Two states that approved recreational use of marijuana are waiting to hear how the federal government intends respond to the measures. The governor of Colorado said he planned to talk by phone with US Attorney General Eric Holder about the measures that contradict federal law banning the use of pot. Seventeen states and Washington DC already allow marijuana use by people with certain medical conditions. Still, federal drug law outlaws use of the drug in all circumstances. Voters in Colorado and Washington pushed the limits even further when they approved ballot measures Tuesday allowing adults over 21 to possess small amounts of marijuana under state regulation and taxation. Earlier this week, Justice Department spokeswoman Nanda Chitre said enforcement of the federal Controlled Substances Act remained unchanged. \"In enacting the Controlled Substances Act, Congress determined that marijuana is a Schedule I controlled substance,\" Chitre said. \"We are reviewing the ballot initiative and have no additional comment at this time.\" This just in: President Obama will visit New York City and area next Thursday, to look at post-Sandy recovery. The Guardian's Ewen MacAskill offers some rapid analysis of Barack Obama's statement: Barack Obama used his first public appearance since his return to the White House to issue a challenge to Republicans in Congress work with him to prevent the economy going into a nosedive next year. In a statement from the East Room, he called on Congress to do a deal before the 1 January deadline that would see an automatic rise in taxes across the board and swingeing cuts in spending. \u201cI am not wedded to every detail of my plan. I am open to compromise,\u201d Obama said. But, in a hint of the strife to come, he said that he still wanted to raised tax rises for the wealthy, which Republicans oppose. As part of the search for a compromise, the president invited to the White House for talks next week the most senior Republican leader left standing amid the election debris, House Speaker John Boehner, and other Republican and Democratic leaders in Congress. In his White House statement, Obama said that creation of jobs and economic growth was his top priority. There was an urgent need to deal with the impending fiscal crisis. Without mentioning the word \u2018mandate\u201d, he waved his election win at the Republicans. He said he was not going to ask working-class Americans, students and the elderly to pay for reducing the deficit while those like himself earning more than $250,000 a year \"were not asked to pay a dime more\" in taxes. Some White House press corp types are miffed that Obama has only made a statement rather than held a press conference. Frankly, although it would be better if he did, it's easy to see why he didn't. Had Obama held a press conference, all the questions would have backward looking, about the election result, and got in the way of the message on the fiscal cliff. And really, what does it matter if the press corp doesn't get to ask Obama if \"his thoughts are with Governor Romney at this time\" and similar. Then Barack Obama says he wants to make a final point: Let me make one final point that every American needs to hear right now. If Congress fails to come to an agreement on an overall deficit-reduction package by the end of the year, everybody's taxes will automatically go up on January the first. Everybody's. Including the 98% of Americans who make less than $250,000 a year. And that makes no sense. It would be bad for the economy and would hit families that are already struggling to make ends meet. OK, so that suggests Obama won't accept a deal that fails to raise taxes on upper income \u2013 $250,000 and above \u2013 earners. My guess is that means: make my day punks, let the Bush tax cuts expire. Are you feeling lucky, Republican punks? After that, Obama offers a nice theatrical flourish: a prop. Speaking of the common ground over extending middle class tax cuts, Obama says if the House Republicans want to offer a bill along the lines they have previously discussed, he's ready to make it law: Let's not wait. Even as we're negotiating a broader deficit reduction package, let's extend the middle class tax cuts right now. Let's do that right now.... In fact, the Senate has already passed a bill doing exactly this. So all we need is action from the House. Now, I've got the pen. Ready to sign the bill right away. I'm ready to do it. I'm ready to do it. And he then reached into his pocket and pulled out a ... pen! Gasp! Speaking from the White House, President Obama addresses the tax issue: Our work is made that much more urgent because at the end of this year we face a series of deadlines that require us to make major decisions about how to pay our deficit down, decisions that will have a huge impact on both the economy and the middle class, both now and in the future. Last year, I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars worth of spending that we just couldn't afford. I intend to work with both parties to do more, and that includes making reforms that will bring down the cost of health care, so we can strengthen programs like Medicaid and Medicare for the long haul, but, as I've said before, we can't just cut our way to prosperity. If we're serious about reducing the deficit, we have to combine spending cuts with revenue. And that means asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more in taxes. Obama says he isn't wedded to any particular plan on a debt deal. But: \"I\u2019m open to compromise, I\u2019m open to new ideas, I'm committed to solving our fiscal challenge. But I refuse to accept any approach that isn\u2019t balanced.\" And now he brings up the election result: I just want to point out, this was a central question during the election. It was debated over and over again. And on Tuesday night we found out that the majority of Americans agree with my approach. And that includes Democrats, independents and a lot of Republicans across the country, as well as independent economists and budget experts. That's how you reduce the deficit, with a balanced approach. So our job now is to get a majority in Congress to reflect the will of the American people. I believe we can get that majority. There's a big round of applause for President Obama as he takes the podium in the East Room of the White House. Obama is straight into it: Now that those of us on the campaign trail have had a chance to get a little sleep, it's time to get back to work. And there's plenty of work to do. As I said on Tuesday night, the American people voted for action not politics as usual. You elected us to focus on your jobs, not ours. And in that spirit I've invited leaders of both parties to the White House next week so we can start to build consensus around the challenges that we can only solve together. And I also intend to bring in business and labor and civic leaders from all across the country here to Washington to get their ideas and input, as well. Then the talk is about job creation: \"Our top priority has to be jobs and growth,\" says Obama, before moving on to the tax and spending issues that are looming. President Obama is shortly to start speaking \u2013 as the administration says Obama is inviting congressional leaders of both parties to the White House next week for talks on the so-called fiscal cliff, as AP reports Obama will announce the invitations on Friday as he addresses the nation on actions needed to avoid harsh economic consequences from a looming combination of tax increases and spending cuts. Obama is expected to urge Congress to act, including passing a bill that would prevent Bush-era tax cuts from expiring for all but the wealthiest Americans. In his address from the White House East Room, Obama is not expected to put forward a specific plan, but instead will call on lawmakers from both parties to work together to tackle the nation's fiscal problems. The issue of the federal government's debt limit on borrowing \u2013 the question that nearly brought the working of government to a halt last year \u2013 is mentioned, and John Boehner immediately suggests that the Republicans are willing to use it again this time: Reporter: Mr Speaker, is it fair to say, you could use the raising of the debt limit in early 2013 as leverage on the fiscal cliff? Boehner: It's an issue that's going to have to be addressed, sooner rather than later. Because that's going to help in reaching a deal: adding in another complex, controversial subject to the pile. Away from the fiscal cliff questions, John Boehner wasn't giving anything away about how Republicans will respond to the moves towards immigration reform that are almost certainly coming: Reporter: I just wanted to go back to your comments last night on immigration, you spoke optimistically about the chance of getting immigration reform. When you said comprehensive immigration reform, are you endorsing a pathway to citizenship? Boehner: Well, I'm not talking about 3,000-page bill. What I'm talking about is a common sense, step-by-step approach would secure our borders, allow us to enforce the laws, and fix a broken immigration system. But, again, on an issue this big, the president has to lead. I think members on both sides of the aisle want to resolve this issue. The president's going to have to lead here. Reporter: Are you endorsing a pathway to citizenship? Boehner: I'm not going to get into any of the details of how you would get there. It's just time to get the job done. From the John Boehner Q&amp;A just now, signs that House Republicans are still in a 2010 mindset: Reporter: Republicans were basically unable to get any seats for the Senate. More people voted for Democrats in the House than Republicans. Why do you have any leverage whatsoever? Boehner: There's a Republican majority here in the House. The American people re-elected the Republican majority. And I'm proud of the fact that our team in a very difficult year was able to maintain our majority. There are a lot of races out there outstanding. But Boehner also hinted that there may be some glacial movement underway, going on to say: But it's clear that as a political party we've got some work to do. And I think the principles of our party are sound ... But how we talk about who we are as a party, clearly conversations are under way, and will continue. What to make of John Boehner's remarks on House Republicans making a tax and debt deal with the White House and Democrats in Congress? The Guardian's Ewen MacAskill gives his thoughts after hearing Boehner speak: Anyone who takes John Boehner\u2019s conciliatory comments over the last few days at face value is going to have a troubling few weeks. At his first press conference since the election, Boehner repeated that he wanted to work with the president on avoiding the fiscal cliff. But Boehner then went on to say that, unlike Barack Obama and the Democrats, he does not favour raising taxes on the wealthy and that removing some loopholes and cleaning up the tax code would do the trick. Raising taxes on the wealthy would slow the economy and cost jobs because about half of those who would be hit are small business owners. That sounds ominous, suggesting lots of drama, showdowns and so on over the coming weeks. What is even more ominous is that, in answer to the very first question, Boehner was less than truthful. \u201cWhen the president and I have been able to come an agreement, there has been no problem in getting it passed in the House,\u201d Boehner said. Every reporter in that room should have been well aware that during the last stand-off, Boehner and Obama reached an agreement on a \"grand bargain\" to resolve the crisis. Boehner took it back to his colleagues in the House who, spurred on by the House majority leader Eric Cantor, blocked it. Now John Boehner \u2013 who appears to be developing a healthy Smoker's Cough \u2013 is banging on about \"the Baby Boomer Bubble\" in response to who knows what question. The next one must be about immigration from someone Boehner describes as \"the young lady\" \u2013 and Boehner says something about the president having to lead. On what exactly we don't know, but the president has to lead. To explain: the TV feed I'm watching isn't picking up the questions from reporters, only Boehner's answers, so it's slightly surreal. Here's what it sounds like, literally, just now: Reporter: [inaudible mumble mumble mumble] Boehner: Nice try. [Laughter] And he's done. My colleague Ewen MacAskill remarks: \"Well at least he didn't cry.\" The Republican Speaker of the House, John Boehner, is getting his retaliation in first, briefly speaking on the outlines of a tax and debt deal, on Capitol Hill: Now, 2013 should be the year we begin to solve our debt through tax reform and entitlement reform, and I'm proposing that we avert the fiscal cliff together in a manner that ensures that 2013 is finally the year that our government comes to grips with the major problems that are facing us. This will bring jobs home and result in a stronger, healthier economy. And a stronger, healthier economy means more Americans working and more revenues, which is what the president is seeking. This framework can lead to common ground, and I hope the president will respond today in that same spirit. As I said on Wednesday, this is an opportunity for the president to lead. This is his moment to engage the Congress and work towards a solution that can pass both chambers. Earlier this week, the president and I had a short conversation. It was cordial. I think we both understand that trying to find a way to avert the fiscal cliff is important for our country, and I'm hopeful that productive conversations can begin soon so that we can forge an agreement that can pass the Congress. Boehner then says he'll take questions from journalists. Unfortunately the question are inaudible, so this is like watching Jeopardy in that we have to guess what the question is from his answers. So: Boehner answers the first one as \"When the president and I have been able to come an agreement, there has been no problem in getting it passed in the House.\" Alex, I'll take \"But can you actually get the votes for any slightly sane deal from all the Republican Tea Party loons in your caucus?\" for $1,000. If so, then Boehner's answer is not true. In the past he has tried to make a deal and been undercut by his caucus, refusing to do anything. This may be Boehner's last shot as Speaker. If you have a PhD in econometrics from the Massachusetts Institute of Brainology you may enjoy reading this article from the Congressional Budget Office on the \"Choices for Deficit Reduction\" published yesterday. If you haven't, then read this bit to understand what the possible solutions to the \"fiscal cliff\" are all about: Lawmakers face difficult trade-offs in deciding how quickly to implement policies to reduce budget deficits. For example, CBO projects that the significant tax increases and spending cuts that are due to occur in January will probably cause the economy to fall back into a recession next year, but they will make the economy stronger later in the decade and beyond. In contrast, continuing current policies would lead to faster economic growth in the near term but a weaker economy in later years. The choice is: jam tomorrow or jam in 2022. The New York Times goes all melodramatic on the matter: The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office underscored the stakes in a report Thursday that framed Washington\u2019s dilemma. It said that if automatic spending cuts go into force and all the Bush-era tax cuts expire, the nation would slip into recession next year and unemployment would rise to 9.1%, from October\u2019s rate of 7.9%. But simply canceling those deficit-reduction measures would risk a financial crisis that would make matters worse, the report said. As you can see from the CBO passage above, it's misleading to say that budget cuts \"risk a financial crisis that would make matters worse\". Looking for a possible deal to avoid the tax/debt trap, Peter Orzag used to be director of the Office of Management and Budget in the Obama administration, so knows what he's talking about. Orzag says there's not much chance the Republicans in the House will bend at all. In that case: The White House, therefore, has three options. First, it could drive us temporarily over the fiscal cliff, let all the cuts expire, and aim for a deal in January with the clean slate that would occur once all the tax cuts are gone. This approach would create maximum anxiety and uncertainty, though. It\u2019s not clear how quickly in January a deal could come together. Second, rather than insist on raising marginal tax rates above $250,000 in income, the White House could suggest scaling back tax breaks for that cohort. House Republicans would be much more amenable to this type of approach. Still, it would be a major concession from a White House that is presumably feeling vindicated by the election. And it is always hard to trim tax expenditures such as the mortgage interest deduction and state and local tax preferences \u2013 especially now, at a moment when the economy is still recovering from a housing-led downturn and state and local governments still face significant deficits that need to be closed. Finally, the White House could push for a placeholder tax cut while negotiations are ongoing. From the department of schadenfreude \u2013 CBS News has a mildly tedious tick-tock of Mitt Romney's reaction to defeat on Tuesday night: Romney was stoic as he talked to the president, an aide said, but his wife Ann cried. Running mate Paul Ryan seemed genuinely shocked, the adviser said. Ryan's wife Janna also was shaken and cried softly. \"There's nothing worse than when you think you're going to win, and you don't,\" said another adviser. \"It was like a sucker punch.\" Their emotion was visible on their faces when they walked on stage after Romney finished his remarks, which Romney had hastily composed, knowing he had to say something. Both wives looked stricken, and Ryan himself seemed grim. They all were thrust on that stage without understanding what had just happened. \"He was shellshocked,\" one adviser said of Romney. Speaker of the House John Boehner is speaking after 11am this morning, and for what it's worth here's what Boehner said about the tax and debt deal opportunity the day after the election: Mr President, this is your moment. We're ready to be led, not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans. We want you to lead \u2013 not as a liberal or a conservative, but as the President of the United States of America. We want you to succeed. Let's challenge ourselves to find the common ground that has eluded us. Let's rise above the dysfunction, and do the right thing together for our country in a bipartisan way. On the \"fiscal cliff,\" economist Paul Krugman says it isn't exactly a cliff at all \u2013 and that the Republicans are using it as an excuse to hold the economy hostage: Both the Bush-era tax cuts and the Obama administration\u2019s payroll tax cut are set to expire, even as automatic spending cuts in defense and elsewhere kick in thanks to the deal struck after the 2011 confrontation over the debt ceiling. And the looming combination of tax increases and spending cuts looks easily large enough to push America back into recession. Nobody wants to see that happen. Yet it may happen all the same, and Mr Obama has to be willing to let it happen if necessary. Why? Because Republicans are trying, for the third time since he took office, to use economic blackmail to achieve a goal they lack the votes to achieve through the normal legislative process. And Krugman's solution? \"So stand your ground, Mr President, and don\u2019t give in to threats. No deal is better than a bad deal. After possibly the shortest post-election honeymoon in US history, politics is back with a vengeance as President Obama makes a public plea for a deal to head-off the combination of tax increases and spending cuts wrapped up in the so-called \"fiscal cliff\". Obama's address from the East Room of the White House at just after 1pm eastern time is expected to reach out to Republicans, who still control the House of Representatives after last Tuesday's general election. Obama will be preceded this morning by the Republican leader, Speaker of the House John Boehner, who has already said he is willing to work with the White House and the president to make a deal - but has firmly ruled out tax increases as a way of fixing the nation's fiscal position. We'll be following both events here live, with expert analysis, and rounding up reaction and the rest of the day's news, including the continued blame-sharing and Republican party in-fighting following Mitt Romney's emphatic election loss this week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
