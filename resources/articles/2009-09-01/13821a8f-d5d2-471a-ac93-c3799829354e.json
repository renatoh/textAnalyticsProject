The insurer fell 6.2p to 124.4p, a near 5% drop, as investors took fright at the prospect of a reported \u00a3600m rights issue, supposedly to boost its balance sheet and give it firepower for acquisitions. Traders said they would be surprised at such a move unless there was a deal in the offing, since RSA recently raised its dividend and bought back some of its debt. Overall, leading shares made an undistinguished start to the new month after their recent strong performance. While British manufacturing figures came in worse than expected, both the US and China reported better news. However, this did little to alleviate concerns that the rally may have run ahead of events, and with Wall Street down more than 150 points by the time London closed, the FTSE 100 finished 89.20 points lower at 4819.70. Angus Campbell, of Capital Spreads, said: \"In the back of many investors' minds is the concern that September is usually a poor month for equities and we haven't got off to the best of starts. UK manufacturing data showed a contraction in the sector in August when the market was expecting an expansion and on top of this Credit Suisse advised their clients to reduce their exposure to equities in both the UK and US.\" Doubts about the sustainability of the economic recovery put mining shares under pressure, with Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation down 60p at 805p and Vedanta Resources 94p lower at \u00a316.98. Lonmin lost 72p to \u00a313.89 while Anglo American fell 99p to \u00a319.22. But defensive stocks were in demand, with British American Tobacco 14p better at \u00a318.88 and consumer goods group Reckitt Benckiser up 27p at \u00a328.80. In the drugs sector AstraZeneca added 16p to \u00a328.56 after positive trial results for a blood thinner, Brilinta. In a hold note, Panmure Gordon said: \"We expect the data to result in modest upgrades but refrain from classifying the event as transforming. Efficacy was good, which should ensure registration, but there are enough points of interest regarding safety and trial design to provide ammunition to the bears to question the drug's commercial potential.\" Lower down the market SkyePharma fell 11.25p to 101.75p. The drug delivery company has been told by the US regulator it needs to do more tests on its Flutiform asthma drug, delaying US approval until at least the second half of 2011."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
