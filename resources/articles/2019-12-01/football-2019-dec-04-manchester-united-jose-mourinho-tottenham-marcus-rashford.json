Here was his finest display for Manchester United, the 22-year-old a blur of menace and inventiveness and registering both goals. On arrival Mourinho had shaken hands with a security guard and club photographer, then hugged a media officer with a warmth missing from the end of his United tenure. Back then he was a sulky figure, sacked last December following a demise signposted by the 3-0 loss to Tottenham on the day of his infamous \u201crespect, respect, respect\u201d tirade. Mourinho\u2019s latest incarnation at Spurs is as a \u201chumble\u201d 56-year-old who has learned the lessons of the United dog days. Apparently, that is. He had guided his new side to three consecutive wins since replacing Mauricio Pochettino but the new persona was yet to be tested. How a dodgy VAR decision or defeat might affect the Premier League Uriah Heep with a penchant for humblebrags would fascinate. And given his former team\u2019s stuttering form under Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r, whether United could disrupt the new Mourinho and his Spurs project was an unknown ahead of this contest. Might United prove the team who are still the only side to take a league point from Liverpool this season? Or be the rabble that lost to Newcastle, Bournemouth, West Ham and Crystal Palace? The XI Solskj\u00e6r sent out in search of a fifth win in 15 games relied on the 18-year-old Mason Greenwood to lead the line in what was his first league start of the season. Mourinho\u2019s team was attacking, embodied by the forward-thinking Lucas Moura, who was selected on the right. United\u2019s draw with Liverpool featured a 3-4-1-2 that was the platform for their campaign\u2019s most convincing display thus far. Last night\u2019s formation was a 4-2-3-1 and just six minutes in the imperious Rashford beat Paulo Gazzaniga to put his side ahead. Mourinho waved his side back for kick-off, his unhappiness contrasting with Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s demeanour. United\u2019s manager was yet to leave his seat and from there heard the Stretford End regale him with \u201cWho put the ball in the Germans\u2019 net? Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r.\u201d The mood lightened further when Harry Winks clattered Daniel James and Mourinho became collateral damage as the Welshman tumbled into him, nearly knocking him over. United\u2019s display \u2013 Spurs\u2019 equaliser apart \u2013 would prove a near-clone of that which troubled Liverpool in October, as they harried Spurs and, when in possession, zipped the ball around slickly. It meant Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s side tormented the visitors and caused their ever-more-frustrated manager to ponder the gameplan. When Dele Alli misplaced a pass up went the arms in disgust. United were dismantling Mourinho\u2019s men and Rashford was irrepressible. One of his shots crashed off the bar, another was saved by Gazzaniga \u2013 the No 10 was an inspiration. Jesse Lingard, Fred, James and Greenwood all followed his lead. This was breathless from United and made it feel quaint just how lost they can look. Inconsistency is the hallmark of young teams, of course. So, too, the inability to kill off opponents, as United had failed to do with Spurs as the interval neared. So it was that a sublime Alli touch-and-finish meant his team were back level in a contest that should already have been over. Mourinho did not gloat over the equaliser. Solskj\u00e6r, meanwhile, berated the fourth official. It meant the second half was a test for United \u2013 and their manager. They passed it admirably, thanks primarily to Rashford, who won and then converted the crucial penalty for a ninth league strike of what may prove the watershed season of his young career. In the buildup Solskj\u00e6r had spoken of the need for patience and how victories can speed up the development of his side. This result has to galvanise and give the manager some respite from the pressure. As for Mourinho, the newfound humbleness should mean the greeting of his first Spurs loss with the grace of, well, the Humble One."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
