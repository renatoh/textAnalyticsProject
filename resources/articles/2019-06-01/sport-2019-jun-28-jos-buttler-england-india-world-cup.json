And it is here in leafy south Birmingham where they are now striving to keep their World Cup dream alive, with unbeaten India on Sunday the first of two must-win games. Jason Roy is expected to return after missing the last three matches with a torn hamstring, having batted and sprinted unimpeded in training on Friday. Jofra Archer is the chief doubt after playing through a minor side strain during the defeat by Australia and then refraining from heavy work. Needless to say after three group stage losses the team could have done without any further distractions. And so Jonny Bairstow appearing to rail against the public at large during a sponsor\u2019s appearance this week \u2013 \u201cpeople have been waiting for us to fail\u201d \u2013 wasn\u2019t great in its sentiment and timing. The comments, made in response to criticism from Michael Vaughan and Kevin Pietersen, are not atypical of Bairstow, who sometimes amplifies things in his own mind before responding with determined runs. Think back to his last Test century, in Colombo, when the celebration was angrily pointed \u2013 despite no one quite knowing who the intended target was. Vaughan predictably bit back on Friday, writing on social media: \u201cHow wrong can @jbairstow21 be .. Never has England team had so much support but it\u2019s you and your team that has disappointed Jonny .. WIN 2 games and you are in the semis .. With this negative, pathetic mindset I am concerned though .. it\u2019s not the media\u2019s fault you have lost 3 games .. !!!\u201d Bairstow\u2019s words would not have been made had Stuart Broad, originally advertised as Yorkshire Tea\u2019s talking head, been able to make it. As replacements go, it was always high risk for England to let one of their more emotional players put his hand up for the appearance fee in the aftermath of defeat. Ashley Giles, England\u2019s director of cricket, knows all about such outbursts having done similar after the first Test of the 2005 Ashes. After Bairstow\u2019s comments appeared, Giles had a quiet word with the Yorkshireman to remind it rarely pays off. And certainly the message from England at training was that, contrary to Bairstow\u2019s own thoughts, there is no siege mentality in the camp at present. \u201cIt\u2019s just typical Yorkies,\u201d joked Buttler, the vice-captain, when asked about the back and forth between Bairstow and Vaughan. \u201c[But] talking about goodwill and people wanting you to do well, I think it\u2019s been great from the country. Everyone has been really behind the team. Naturally, being a good side, when we don\u2019t perform to that level, it is frustrating, people give their opinion in the media or whatever and are frustrated. As are we as a team and as individuals as well. But there\u2019s been lots of goodwill.\u201d Is Bairstow simply revving himself up for another big score? \u201cI can assure you that\u2019s not what he\u2019s trying to do but, as a player, when Jonny seems to have a point to prove he performs outstandingly well,\u201d replied Buttler. Either way, Bairstow will be grateful to have Roy back alongside him despite the risk of his injury returning. The pair average 62 as an opening pair with eight century stands from 29 innings and in a tournament that has seen No 3 Joe Root come to the crease in the first 10 overs four times (and open once), England badly need another solid start from their main duo. Buttler, who admitted his own returns to date with bat and gloves have been below his expectations, was one of a number of England personnel to stare into the Edgbaston pitch on Friday. After weeks of rain it ragged square during Pakistan\u2019s victory over New Zealand on Wednesday but an abundance of sunshine since should has at least allowed Gary Barwell, the head groundsman, better conditions with which to work. But then despite three failed run chases during the World Cup \u2013 the most recent of which have been targets below 300 \u2013 it could be argued the painting of Morgan\u2019s side as one-dimensional in some quarters has been slightly unfair. Of course they have a preference for high-scoring games but few sides rise to No 1 in the world \u2013 a crown England can reclaim with a win on Sunday \u2013 without displaying a few street-smarts along the way. Buttler said: \u201cThat\u2019s something which maybe we haven\u2019t been given enough credit for. When you have flat pitches and records are broken, it\u2019s a very obvious thing to say this is the way the team plays. But we wouldn\u2019t have been able to win the number of games we have, home and away, if we weren\u2019t adaptable.\u201d The chief difference at play this summer is tournament pressure and against Virat Kohli\u2019s India it will arguably be most acute. Overcome this, by hook or by crook, and the mood will change once more."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
