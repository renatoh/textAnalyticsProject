Although Villa would ideally like to avoid that scenario, the club are prepared to give serious consideration to Young seeing out his deal if he refuses to sign improved terms when they seek to resurrect new contract talks in the summer. There is a school of thought within the club that another 12 months of Young's services could be much more valuable than the significantly reduced transfer fee they would receive for him at the end of this season. Manchester United, Liverpool and Tottenham Hotspur are known to be interested in Young, who fuelled speculation about his long-term future at Villa when he broke off contract talks in October. Young, the Guardian has since learned, pulled out of signing at the last minute after months of discussions culminated in him agreeing terms on a new four-year deal that would have given him a significant salary rise \u2013 he is already the highest-paid player at the club \u2013 and included a clause allowing him to leave for a pre-determined fee. Although several clubs are expected to try to capitalise on Young's situation when the transfer window reopens, a senior figure at Villa has made it clear that there is no chance their most influential player will be sold next month. Randy Lerner, Villa's owner, is anxious to dispel the idea that his ambitions have changed in the wake of Martin O'Neill's resignation as manager in August, and he has no intention of allowing Young to leave when he is deemed to be vital to the side's prospects between now and the end of the season. Whether Young can be convinced to return to the negotiating table and commit his future to Villa, however, remains in doubt. This looks like being a transitional season for G\u00e9rard Houllier's side, who are only four points above the Premier League's relegation zone and 11 points adrift of the top four. With sources close to Young suggesting he is keen to test himself in the Champions League after three seasons of finishing in the top six, Villa might struggle to satisfy his ambitions. Young, who is injured after suffering medial ligament damage in training last week, joined Villa from Watford for \u00a39.65m a little under four years ago. He excelled in his first full season at the club, when he was described as a \"genius\" by O'Neill and named as the Professional Footballers' Association Young Player of the Year. After struggling to recapture that form last season, Young was left out of England's World Cup squad but has since returned to the international set-up and featured in the 2-1 defeat by France at Wembley last month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
