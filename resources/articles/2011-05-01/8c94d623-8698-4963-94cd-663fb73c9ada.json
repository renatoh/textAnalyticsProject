Garry Cook, the club's chief executive, and Brian Marwood, the football administrator, are also on their way to the Middle East to meet the owner, Sheikh Mansour, and the chairman, Khaldoon Al Mubarak, to discuss exactly how much can be spent at a time when they are increasingly aware of the financial fair-play regime Uefa is introducing. Mubarak has already made it clear there will not be breakneck spending as the club look at ways of reducing last year's \u00a3121m loss, which is expected to rise again when the next financial statement is published in October. However, Mancini believes he will need at least four top players if the club are serious about balancing their first season in the Champions League with trying to overhaul Manchester United, and he has been dismayed to learn there is a significant disparity between his plans and those of the people above him. Mubarak has gone on record as saying that two signings should be enough and that the Uefa rules are now \"driving\" the club. Marwood has spoken of a summer of \"tweaking\" rather than wholesale change, and behind the scenes Mancini has been told the priority will be to move on the players such as Emmanuel Adebayor, Wayne Bridge and Craig Bellamy, who are returning to Eastlands from loan spells elsewhere and who do not form part of his plans. Mancini's relationship with Cook and Marwood has been spiky at times during what has essentially been a season of great triumph, but he has a strong alliance with Mubarak and is encouraged that the club's chairman said last week that the final say should go to the manager. The Italian would like to start his recruitment by bringing in a new centre-half \u2013 Gary Cahill of Bolton Wanderers is a serious consideration \u2013 to partner the club's player of the year, Vincent Kompany. Alexis Sanchez, Udinese's right-sided attacker, is another target and Mancini also wants a central midfielder as well as a new striker, regardless of whether or not Carlos Tevez stays. One player who will not be leaving is Mario Balotelli, and the Italian has attempted to explain why he missed City's official parading of the FA Cup on Monday. \"I didn't understand the value of it,\" Balotelli told reporters when he was asked why he had flown to Italy rather than take his place on the open-top bus. Balotelli was instead at an end-of-season function in Milan for Serie A's club directors, attending with his agent, Mino Raiola. Television footage shows Balotelli and his friends throwing water balloons at waiting news crews before being stopped for an interview in which he was asked about his man-of-the-match award in the FA Cup final. \"At least I've done something right this season,\" he replied. The forward was also asked whether he would return to Serie A and said: \"I'm happy in England for the moment.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
