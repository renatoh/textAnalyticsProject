Then, as instructed, we had fish and chips in the beach cafe and even swam in the sea. \"Look,\" said the Daughter, pointing everywhere. \"Grandma used to sit on this wall, that bench, this bit of beach, crossed the road just here.\" Ghosts of my parents everywhere. There is my mother on a deck chair, there is my father staggering to the betting shop, there is their beach hut which blew away in the big storm, and here's their flat, and the same darling neighbours upstairs, who have made us a lovely tea and the same lemon meringue pie, in the same shaped living room. It is rather charming in Hove: seagulls squawking, smell of the sea, fresh air. But I was often bored stiff coming to stay. And Daughter didn't fancy it once she was a teenager. Now she is older, she wishes she had some grandparents left to visit, but it's too late. And I wish I had done this, that and the other, also too late. \"There's nobody nice here now they've gone. It's no fun any more,\" say the old neighbours, making us blub at the tea table. Back home I have an odd desire to play Bob Dylan, over which I can weep in a maudlin way, thinking of my youth, lost decades ago. But why bother? Youth is often rather grim. I was a prune-faced teenager and thought my parents rather vulgar. When one is 16 and sensitive, it is tough to have a Mummy who speaks very loud French abroad and very loud English everywhere else, and a father who wears pretend donkey's ears when out and about, to show that he works hard. Now I wear the ears myself while at my desk, thinking poignantly of my Daddy, but too late again. Why couldn't I have had more of a laugh a decade earlier? Why the piss-face? This is the trouble with youth; they are a generally scornful lot and tend to think the next generation up are a load of old rubbish. To them colourful, outrageous and amusing means loud, shameful and pathetic. Fielding was only ever embarrassed by his Mummy. At 16, he was a learned existentialist. She was more interested in her runner beans. Beans to beans, mothers to ashes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
