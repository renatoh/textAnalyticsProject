But effectiveness, now there is another thing altogether. Take New Zealand's all-rounder Chris Harris. Pore over the Test records and he scarcely features as a lacer of the great Sir Richard's boots: only 19 matches in 12 years, an average under 20 and a handful of wickets in the high 60s. But then there is the other side to him, one that makes him a revered figure among Kiwi sportsmen. For today at the Westpac Trust stadium Chris Zinzan Harris is expected to play his 200th one-day international. No other New Zealander comes close; Adam Parore with 179 is next. No one, not Hadlee, Chris Cairns, or anyone, has taken more one-day wickets for New Zealand than his 181; only Nathan Astle, Martin Crowe, Stephen Fleming and John Wright, frontline batsmen all, have scored more than the 3,589 runs he has scavenged. No Kiwi outfielder has more than his 78 catches. It is as if Clarke Kent in whites becomes Superman when the coloured clothing comes out. Since he made a modest debut at the SCG more than 11 years ago and a few days after his 21st birthday - \"one for 36 off six and 17 not out,\" he reels off the cuff - he has provided the backbone of New Zealand's limited-overs side. He is Adam Hollioake in spades, Mark Ealham with knobs on, a player who has recognised a niche market and cornered it. Here is a typical Harris match: Australia at the SCG last month. With the innings stagnating he makes an unbeaten 42 from 43 balls as New Zealand reach 235 for nine. Then, in the hosts' reply, he gets rid of Ryan Campbell and Steve Waugh with fizzing catches before bowling eight overs for 37 and taking three wickets, and that when the game was still there for Australia to win. His strong suit is batting: left-handed, good range of shots and more especially spatial awareness, in the way that Michael Bevan has it. Harris does not waste his strokes. At Madras in the quarter-final of the 1996 World Cup, batting higher up the order, he made a quite brilliant 130 from 124 balls that almost did for Australia before Mark Waugh replied in similar vein. Lower down the order he has 13 half-centuries, all but three of them undefeated. The end of the innings is his forte, the last 10 overs his stock in trade. His bowling, however, slow medium mostly, defies belief at times, but its innocuous appearance belies subtlety, with a blend of floaters and gentle leg rollers that curve into the surface and grip a fraction. Nick Knight, well set and playing fluently in Christchurch on Tuesday, almost nipped a return catch to Harris as soon as he was introduced. Get out to Cairns or Daniel Vettori or anyone but for goodness sake not to Harris could well become a batsman's mantra. It is more than a reputation will stand. One hundred and eighty one witnesses will testify to that. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
