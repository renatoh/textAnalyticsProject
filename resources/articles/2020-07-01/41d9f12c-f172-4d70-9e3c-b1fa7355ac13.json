Paul Pogba registered his first United goal since April 2019 to round off a 3-0 victory at struggling Aston Villa after Bruno Fernandes had opened the scoring with a controversial penalty and Greenwood added a second just before the break with a superb long-rang strike. The 18-year-old\u2019s sensational form since the restart has yielded four goals in his past three appearances, with Solskj\u00e6r admitting Greenwood had made it impossible not to select him. Asked how he was managing the development of a player who first joined the club\u2019s academy at the age of six, the United manager said: \u201cWe\u2019ll have to wait and see. He\u2019s got to look after himself. I\u2019m doing my bit to help him but he\u2019s got to do it. He\u2019s the one that\u2019s got to turn in performances at training, in the games and to live his life properly. \u201cIt\u2019s all down to him. He can go as far as he wants to. He\u2019s an exceptional finisher. He\u2019s been in the club for so long and he knows what we want for him and he knows we believe in him. You can\u2019t leave players out when they score goals. It\u2019s almost impossible.\u201d Pogba\u2019s goal was United\u2019s 100th in all competitions this season and capped another influential performance from the Frenchman since his return to the fold. But he insisted they still have plenty of ground to make up on the champions Liverpool next season after moving back to within one point of fourth-placed Leicester. \u201cWe didn\u2019t win the Premier League. We didn\u2019t win anything this year so obviously we have to keep working. There is a lot to do. A lot,\u201d Pogba said. \u201cWe\u2019re pleased with ourselves but we know we have to carry on. We are a big club and we want to keep the level up always. The performance today and the last few weeks have been very good and are the standard of Manchester United.\u201d Solskj\u00e6r was adamant that Fernandes had been fouled by Ezri Konsa for United\u2019s penalty but his counterpart Dean Smith described the decision by the video assistant referee as \u201ca disgrace\u201d after the defeat which meant Villa remain four points from 17th-placed Watford with four matches left to play. \u201cI thought it was going to get overturned straightaway,\u201d he said. \u201cHow somebody in a studio had the view that I saw only once and they had four or five viewings and came to that decision is beyond me.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
