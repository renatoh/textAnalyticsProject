The Manchester United defender has played back-to-back games on only two occasions this season, making 11 appearances in total, the longest run being three successive matches in October. Ferguson has ruled him out for a \"couple of games\", namely the Carling Cup final against Aston Villa on Sunday and what should have been his first game as John Terry's successor when Egypt visit Wembley on Wednesday, but United's medical staff cannot even be certain that is an accurate diagnosis, and there are concerns it may be a longer lay-off. Ferdinand has featured in only 26 of the last 73 games for his club and national team and Ferguson believes the player may have to prioritise matches in the future, even if that means making himself unavailable for international friendlies after the World Cup. Often playing through pain, Ferdinand has played in only four internationals in the last 16 months, and the latest setback will be of considerable alarm not just for Ferguson but also Capello, coming at a time when Ashley Cole is already a serious doubt for the World Cup and injuries, once again, are threatening to undermine England's chances. The doctors treating Ferdinand have always warned that the problem had not been fully eradicated and could flare up again and there must be legitimate concerns about whether he will be in a condition to play up to seven games in South Africa. Ferdinand turned 31 in November and Ferguson is sufficiently concerned that he plans to encourage him to follow the example of Ryan Giggs, by curtailing his England commitments after the summer tournament. Giggs has now retired from international football but Ferguson believes there is a direct correlation between the reigning footballer of the year playing so well at the age of 36 and his controversial decision, with a history of hamstring problems, to turn out only in Wales's competitive matches rather than the friendlies that have long exasperated United's management. The prospect of an England captain being selective about games is unlikely to appeal to either Ferdinand or Capello, but there is also a sense behind the scenes at Old Trafford that the most expensive defender in English football may have to make some difficult decisions for the good of his career. Ferguson is said to be \"sympathetic\" and understands the different pressures that will be on Ferdinand, but he is also acutely aware that his player is at a point of his career where he needs to take greater care of his body and not over-exert himself. The priority for Ferguson, as always, is United rather than England."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
