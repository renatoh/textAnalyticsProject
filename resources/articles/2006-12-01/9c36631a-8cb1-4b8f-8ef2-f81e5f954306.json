Nexium, which generates about a quarter of its $4.6bn (\u00a32.3bn) sales in Europe, has been the subject of challenges from Ratiopharm since 2001 - only a year after the drug received regulatory approval and went on sale across the continent. The substance patent in question, with an expiry date in 2014, was challenged by the generics firm on the grounds that it was insufficiently novel and innovative. The European Patent Office ruled in favour of AstraZeneca in 2003, but an appeal was lodged a year later. Yesterday a spokesman for the EPO told reporters an appeal ruling had now been made in favour of Ratiopharm, though he said the reasons for the decision would not be given until the new year. Shares in AstraZeneca closed down 126p, or more than 4%, at \u00a327.38. It is their lowest level since March. The setback comes two months after the company revealed that late-stage clinical trials for a promising experimental stroke compound showed it did not work well enough. The product was ditched. In a statement last night the company said: \"While disappointed with the EPO decision, AstraZeneca has confidence in the intellectual property portfolio protecting Nexium.\" Other patents linked to the drug include process, method of use and additional substance patents. Their expiry dates range from 2009 to 2019. A process patent is being challenged through the EPO, with a hearing in March. AstraZeneca pointed out that any generic copycat pill would have to meet stringent regulatory tests before being released. AstraZeneca holds exclusivity over data published on Nexium's efficacy and safety until 2010. Only after that will generic drug makers be able to use this data to support their clone products."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
