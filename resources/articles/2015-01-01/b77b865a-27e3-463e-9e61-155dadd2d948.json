Some were less significant or straightforward than they seemed, while the themes of the crisis narratives they nurtured \u2013 community churn, outward migration, foreign ownership, the inflationary and cultural effects of gentrification - have long been part of the bigger picture in the capital. What really matters, as ever, are the priorities, the politics and the balances of power at play in deciding who gets to live where and defining the best interests of the city and its people. In these respects, the struggles over the Royal Mail Group (RMG) site in Mount Pleasant were the most illuminating. The location is well known to many north Londoners. Standing at the junction of Farringdon Road and Rosebery Avenue at the north end of Clerkenwell, the grand sorting office there has for years been the place you dash to with urgent letters when you\u2019ve missed local snail mail collections. Mail processing will continue on the Mount Pleasant site, but RMG \u2013 whose controversial privatisation was an aggravating background factor in this saga \u2013 made known at least 18 months ago its intention to create a \u201cresidential-led mixed use development\u201d on the adjoining vehicle parking and servicing yards, which straddle the neighbouring Labour-controlled boroughs of Camden and Islington. RMG submitted planning applications to the boroughs\u2019 councils in June 2013. Resistance forces soon mustered. Edward Denison of the Mount Pleasant Association and University College London\u2019s Bartlett School of Architecture damned RMG\u2019s proposal for ten buildings, some as a high as 15 storeys, containing 681 housing units along with office space and shops with a pedestrian street running through it, as an architectural manifestation of the same mentality that informed the Royal Mail sell-off. The plans would, in Denison\u2019s view, result in an \u201cexclusively inward-looking fortress-like development\u201d accompanied by a misnamed \u201cpublic realm\u201d, which would, in reality, be controlled by and for private interests to create \u201cmalls without walls\u201d. Like a cancer, he wrote, this would eventually kill the neighbourhood around it. The two councils were unhappy too, in particular with the amount of affordable homes being offered in the plans for the three hectares of land \u2013 20% of the total compared with the two boroughs\u2019 targets of 50% in new housing projects. Both were set to reject the applications when, in January last year, Boris Johnson intervened. In a wake up call to all who think the powers of London mayors extend only to fiddling with bus fares and making jokes, he took the decision about Mount Pleasant into his own hands. Opponents of the scheme were furious that he did so at RMG\u2019s request. Adding insult to this injury, RMG also lowered the amount of affordable homes they were offering to a meagre 12% on a prime London site they had just picked up from the public for a song. The distinctive element of this episode was the openly pre-emptive nature of Johnson\u2019s move. Normally, some sort of compromise would have been reached in advance by City Hall and council officers behind closed doors. If the mayor was going to formally step in he would have done so only after the councils had gone through their democratic processes. But a statutory 16-week period in which the councils were supposed to have made their decisions on the applications had expired the previous October and City Hall saw no prospect of a resolution. Johnson was defiant, deriding those trying to block the scheme as \u201cbourgeois nimbys\u201d who were slowing down the delivery of new homes in a city desperate for them. He said it was his job to step in to prevent \u201cunreasonable delays\u201d frustrating good schemes. Labour said he was showing his true colours in putting the interests of developers before those of local people. But the Mount Pleasant site\u2019s fate was now to be worked out between RMG and the mayor. The result was announced in October. Johnson proclaimed it a triumph. The affordable proportion of new Mount Pleasant homes had been set at 24% - double what RMG had originally proposed to the mayor and 4% more than it had previously pitched to the unimpressed Camden and Islington councils. But the mayor\u2019s critics turned their fire on the definition of \u201caffordable\u201d \u2013 a now familiar issue in London housing rows. Of the 163 affordable homes, 98 would be for \u201caffordable rent\u201d and 65 for shared ownership. \u201cAffordable rent\u201d is a concept introduced by the coalition as part of a new, cut-price model for allocating funds to housing associations and can mean rents as high as 80% of those charged locally by private landlords. In expensive parts of London like Camden and Islington, those local rents can be well beyond the financial reach of people on low and even lower middle incomes. Shared ownership is a category of affordable housing which enables those who can\u2019t afford to buy their own homes to instead purchase a portion of one and hope to increase the size of that portion over time. It is not designed for those at the lowest end of the income scale, who are Islington\u2019s and Camden\u2019s priority. So neither type of affordable home negotiated by the mayor conformed to his critics\u2019 view of what \u201caffordable\u201d should mean if it was to help those of their residents in greatest need. James Murray, Islington\u2019s cabinet member for housing, said Johnson had \u201ctwisted\u201d the word\u2019s definition in order to hike the cost of affordable homes to unaffordable heights. The mayor looked at things differently. He stressed that the average rents of the 98 affordable rent homes would be 44% of local market rates \u2013 well short of that onerous possible 80% - and that some could be as low as 20%-30% of those rates. Sir Edward Lister, his deputy for planning, pointed out that, at around \u00a3360 a week, rents for the larger, three-bedroom, affordable rent units would be very similar to the highest amount of housing benefit that could be claimed in the area concerned, set at \u00a3350.95 a week. He was saying, in essence, that families on modest incomes would be able to pay Mount Pleasant affordable rents with a little help from the state. The same could not be said, however, for the less affordable of the affordable rent properties. Meanwhile, arguments about the design of the Mount Pleasant scheme and its implications for the area remained very much in play. In July of last year Create Streets, a social enterprise research institute which argues that mixed tenure, low-rise yet high density residential streets in keeping with a neighbourhood\u2019s prevailing style can and should be constructed in cities instead of high-rise blocks, proposed an alternative Mount Pleasant plan. This took detailed form in September, claiming to also offer better returns for Royal Mail and a better deal for the taxpayer in the long term. Produced in partnership with the public policy think tank the Legatum Institute, it argued that the site could accommodate more homes altogether \u2013 around 730 \u2013 centred on a circus design and that the finances would permit higher levels of cheaper housing than were being proposed at the time. Create Streets attracts suspicion from the left due to its connections with the right-wing think tank Policy Exchange, which has advocated the large scale sale of social rented homes in expensive areas to fund building in cheaper ones. Yet the Create Streets contribution was supported and welcomed by Edward Denison and the Mount Pleasant Association. In what the latter termed \u201ca surprise move\u201d, Johnson described the alternative scheme as \u201cvery beautiful\u201d and encouraged those responsible to make their own planning application based on it. Even so, he approved the RMG plan, described by Simon Jenkins in the generally Boris-loving Evening Standard as \u201ca mockery of localism\u201d which \u201cdrains whatever character might have been instilled in this potentially charming corner of London\u201d. How did things get to such a stage? At a very basic level is simply astounding that a large piece of London land, until recently in public hands, has somehow ended up not firmly earmarked to contain hundreds of the sorts of homes that the great majority of the London public would surely want built there and in the capital as a whole: homes that are truly affordable to families and individuals on low and average incomes that are pretty to look at, complement local streetscapes and don\u2019t rise too high above the ground. But if we set the vexed question of the Royal Mail privatisation to one side, the Mount Pleasant story also shows how difficult achieving this has become. Johnson could and should have acted differently. Mount Pleasant was an opportunity for a mayoral line to be drawn in the sand, one which demonstrated solidarity with boroughs driving harder bargains with private developers to help meet London\u2019s housing need and which stood up for architectural and community principles which, in theory, the Conservative mayor subscribes to. It is, though, worth reflecting on his defence for what he did: securing163 at least relatively affordable homes is better than securing none; a case can be made that low-to-middle income groups are being damagingly squeezed in Camden and Islington, being insufficiently poor to qualify for those boroughs\u2019 large stocks of social housing yet, if first-time buyers, not rich enough to purchase homes of their own and having to move elsewhere; it can be argued, and later was by Sir Edward Lister, that the councils were never going to get 50% affordable (or even the 40% Islington believes could have been achieved without rendering the scheme unprofitable) and that their reluctance to bend made mayoral intervention desirable if anything was going to be built at all. There are, in other words, compromises to be made and dilemmas to be faced in all dealings with the property trade - and consequences for declining to deal - whichever type of politician you are. The scope for future mayors taking a different approach from Mayor Johnson will continue to be limited in 2015 and maybe for long after that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
