I'm at the top of America's most feared run, ski tips literally pointing into thin air. Next to me, my friend Henry is lying flat on his stomach, his hands gripping the edge as he peers over into the abyss. The rest of our group have fallen oddly silent - tongue-tied, I guess, by a mixture of concern and glee at the prospect of witnessing the wipe-out of the holiday. Head swimming slightly, I gingerly look down. Jagged limestone walls gape like angry jaws on either side of a thin ribbon of snow, falling away to the valley floor. The wind howls up the chute from below, whipping up flurries of snow and blasting them into my face. There are stories of spectators coming for a look down the couloir only to be blown off balance and into the dragon's mouth. It's not a place to hang about. I bang my fists together, take a deep breath, count to five and leap. The omens hadn't been good. That morning, I'd already lost my gloves, missed the bus and got frostnip on a chairlift. Plus I hadn't slept properly since arriving in Jackson Hole four days earlier, not because of the altitude or jet lag, but because every night I was having anxiety dreams about this legendary run. I'd been hearing terrifying bar-room tales about Corbet's Couloir, for at least a decade - most about the 30ft jump at the start, the rest about the 'popped' knees and broken collarbones sustained on landing. The story goes that in 1963, property developer Paul McCollister and ski guide and Everest veteran Barry Corbet were surveying Wyoming's Teton mountains, working on plans to build a ski resort. Corbet looked up at the snow-filled breach in the sheer limestone wall of Rendezvous Mountain that would thereafter bear his name and said: 'Someday, somebody will ski that.' No one did for another four years, and even then it was by accident. Patrolman Lonnie Ball was standing at the top, peering over the edge, when the cornice (the ledge of windblown ice and snow that builds up at the top) collapsed under him, sending him down the couloir whether he liked it or not. Quickly the run's fame grew. Camera crews came to make films and adverts there, showing daredevils using the cornice as a natural springboard for dramatic aerial stunts. Before long, Corbet's had become the resort's talisman, securing its reputation as America's most hardcore resort, and drawing skiers from across the country and the Atlantic to test themselves against it. In 1994, the late Doug Coombs, two-times world extreme skiing champion, started 'steep and deep camps' at Jackson Hole - intensive off-piste instruction courses which culminate in an end-of-week graduation run: Corbet's. 'After that, people go home completely pumped for the rest of their lives,' said Coombs. The pressure starts to mount the moment our plane lands at Jackson Hole airport. I know this could be my only chance to tick skiing's ultimate box, but am I up to it? Will my nerve hold when it's my turn on top of the cornice? Thankfully, there's lots to take my mind off the nagging questions. The runway is on the high, pancake-flat Snake River plain, which is covered in a thick layer of snow and dotted with herds of elk. Along the western edge of the plain, the Teton Range suddenly soars up like a row of granite skyscrapers. It's a stunning sight, completely different from the Alps. The town of Jackson is a 15-minute drive from the airport and the main town of the 'Hole', an early ranchers' word for valley. It's billed as 'genuine cowboy town' - but unlike so many other Disneyish reproductions across the country, Jackson does have a real frontier feel. Wooden boardwalks line the streets, you enter the main square under an arch constructed from hundreds of elk antlers, and in the Million Dollar Cowboy bar you enter through saloon doors and sit astride stools made from saddles under the glare of a giant stuffed bear. At the Wort Hotel, bang in the centre of town, we tuck into bison steaks then retire to the Silver Dollar (so called because 2032 of them are set into the bar top) where a bluegrass band are in full cry. By the time I get to my (vast, cosy) room, extreme skiing anxieties have been drowned in beer. But there, on the desk is a DVD, helpfully left by the tourist office. It's called 'Someday, somebody will ski that', and the cover shows a frankly horrifying cliff, and a quote: 'Once you ski Corbet's, glory comes.' I quickly cover it up, but can dream of nothing else. Next morning we drive the 20 minutes to the slopes. Mists are rolling across the plain; the towering peaks rise above them and blaze red in the morning sun. A moose loiters in some scrub by the side of the road. 'They're mean dudes,' warns the driver. 'I'd rather meet a bear than a moose, any day.' Arriving in Teton Village, a purpose- built cluster of smart hotels, shops and bars at the bottom of the lifts, is something of a culture shock after the raw Western appeal of Jackson. The village has been swelling rapidly in recent years and now gnarly, bearded ski bums wander past the slopeside hot-tubs of the Four Seasons, where uniformed staff are on hand to bring cocktails and wrap guests in fluffy robes the moment they emerge into the freezing mountain air. Celebrity sightings are common - Russell Crowe, Uma Thurman and Jack Nicholson all holiday here, Sandra Bullock has a house, and Harrison Ford an 800-acre ranch. Rumour has it that Ford is occasionally radioed in to collect injured skiers in his Bell 407 helicopter, presumably much to their amazement. But on the mountain, it's still very much a resort for serious skiers. At least 10 inches of fresh snow has fallen overnight and as we ride the chairlifts up, skiers and boarders are flying off every cliff and jump. The trees reverberate with whoops. Surprisingly, this ski mecca has only 12 lifts (a new incarnation of the famous 'tram', a cable car that runs from bottom to very top, is due to open in late 2008) but they are long, fast and spread across a huge area. Plus the resort, hours from any major city, stays remarkably empty. For the next few days we roar around the area, lapping up the powder, hiking the half-hour up Headwall ridge to access gullies and meadows where the powder is thigh-deep. The US resort system comes into its own here. Unlike Europe's on and off-piste system, US resorts have a rope running around the entire ski area, inside which everything is 'inbounds', meaning patrolled and avalanche-protected. In Jackson Hole, this means you can casually ski terrain which elsewhere you'd think twice about taking on without a guide. At the far reaches of the ski area, bouncing alone through the trees, way out of sight or sound of the lifts or other people, it feels more like being on a heli-skiing trip in the Canadian wastes or in the midde of a multi-day alpine tour. Afterwards, in the cavernous Mangey Moose bar, at the foot of the slopes, we learn about the real stars of the resort. Not Harrison and Sandra, but the so-called Jackson Hole Air Force, a group of elite skiers formed in the early 1990s to ski the area's most extreme routes. The more we hear, the more they sound like a kind of skiing A-Team - their operations are covert (if they bragged about their dangerous first descents, the resort would ban them), and they even have a motto: 'swift, silent and deep'. On the third night, after a classically contrasting Jackson Hole evening - dinner at the glitzy Mizu Sushi, which flies its fish in daily, followed by a raucous session of beers, shots of whisky and silly dancing in the Stagecoach, a wooden barn at the roadside - I find myself back in my room, weakened by alcohol, the DVD in my hand. I crack and shove it in the player. 'Most people remember standing on top and pushing off, then they remember tumbling at the bottom, and it's all black in between,' explains one of the patrollers, interviewed on the film. My determination falters. Another describes his jump off the cornice: 'I remember looking between my legs and the ground seemed really far away. I thought boy, if I don't break my legs here, I'm really lucky.' Then the music swells and the narrator stirringly explains that Corbet's will 'always be the icon, the final exam, the symbol of that inner flame that lives within the heart of anyone that knows deep inside they were born to ski...' I go to bed, dizzy with a horrible mixture of sake, beer and nerves. The following day is our last. It's time to do or, er, die. As our group grinds slowly up the series of chairs to our appointment at the top of Rendezvous mountain, I try to reassure myself that death is actually very unlikely. Corbet's doesn't fit French ski guru Patrick Vallencant's definition of extreme - 'you fall, you die'. After the jump, which can be 10ft or 30ft, depending on snow conditions, you must turn immediately to avoid smacking into the rocks to the left. Better is to turn in mid-air. After that, if you fall you will tumble about 400ft, possibly spraining limbs, probably breaking equipment, certainly damaging your pride. But, I tell myself again as we push past the numerous ropes and disclaimers and come at last to the legendary lip, you shouldn't die ... I seem to hang in the air for an exquisite millisecond, but my life doesn't flash before my eyes and there's no mid-air epiphany - just the ground rushing up to greet me, very fast indeed. I don't have time to think, but luckily my body does what I'd willed it to, keeping my weight forward and turning in the air to avoid smashing into the rocks. I slap down into the snow and sit back on my skis, but it's so steep I'm pushed forward and upright again. Edges bite into the ice, I zip across the slope, find the deep powder and relax into some glorious, easy turns. Cheers from above echo down the couloir. Relief swells inside me - at last I can call myself a real skier. I feel invincible. Now what is it pride comes before? Oh yes: two weeks later I fell in St Anton and broke two ribs. On a blue run. If you weren't scared by the sound of that Triffide, La Grave, France Corbet's Couloir has been the scene of lots of injuries and even more embarrassment. Triffide has witnessed numerous deaths. The problem is that it is so narrow, in some places little wider than a ski length, making turning tricky, while even getting into the couloir can require abseiling over a rock band. The real danger comes with icy conditions, when those who fall can slide and smash into the rock walls. In good conditions, though, it provides the thrill of about 1,000ft at 45 degrees. Need a guide? Essential and don't forget your helmet. I did it with Keith Garvey of Skiers Lodge (skierslodge.com), which also has several other top-notch guides. Skiers Lodge offers week-long packages, including accommodation, food and full-time guiding from \u00a3660. Sous Telepherique, Courchevel, France This one is all about showing off. Start at the top of Saulire, the highest point of the Courchevel ski area, where there is a restaurant and a red run which heads off to the left. Ignore the piste and instead turn right, descending a scary, exposed, path (actually the worst bit of all), which takes you to the top of the run. It heads straight back down the valley, directly under the wires of the cable car. Wait until the cable car is about to descend - it will be full of easily impressed beginners who have just gone up for lunch - then start skiing. It's very steep, easily 45 degrees at the top but it's wide and open making it easy to find a rhythm with your jump turns. Stop for a breather, look up, and wave to the awed faces pressed to the window. Need a guide? Lots of people do it without , but you must be an expert. If you do want a guide, Olivier Lombard (00 33 612 444740) comes highly recommended, or try the Ecole de Ski Francais (00 33 479 082608; esfcourchevel1650.com). Back Of The Valluga, St Anton, Austria Another legendary run with a fearsome reputation. To get to the top of the Valluga, at 2,811m the highest peak in the St Anton area, you have to take a rickety cable-car about the size of a telephone box. Only those with guides are allowed to take their skis up, the rest simply look at the view then come back down in the lift. The off-piste run down the back of the peak towards the neighbouring resort of Zurs is steep and can be icy and ferociously mogulled, but it isn't more technically difficult than some black runs. However it is extremely dangerous - at the bottom of the first pitch is a cliff, off which several people have skied to their deaths (hence the introduction of the guide-only policy). You must ski down the fall line, then traverse left to skirt around the edge of the cliff. If you fall, you could probably stop yourself, but it's a test of the nerves. Need a guide? Yes - I did it with Thomas Schnable of British-owned Piste to Powder (00 43 664 174 6282; pistetopowder.com). Hiring a guide can be a nightmare if you're alone - one-on-one, a guide will set you back several hundred pounds per day. British-owned company Piste to Powder offers an alternative by running six guided groups every day, which you can join as an individual, or with friends, for just \u00a362. Groups cater for everything from those taking their first turns off-piste, to the seriously hardcore."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
