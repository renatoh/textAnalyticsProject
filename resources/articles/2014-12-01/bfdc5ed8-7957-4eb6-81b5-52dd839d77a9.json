In their previous three games, United have beaten Crystal Palace, Arsenal and Hull City, at Old Trafford on Saturday, in their best run of form this season. This has taken Louis van Gaal\u2019s team to fourth place despite a series of injuries with the 3-0 win over Hull United\u2019s best and most consistent display. \u201cI think everyone in the stadium felt Hull was a good performance and that\u2019s the sort of standard we want to be at,\u201d said Carrick. \u201cDominating teams and winning. We\u2019ve done it in the past but the past is the past. We need to do it again. And hopefully as time goes on we can carry on like this and that fear factor will creep back. \u201cHull was an improvement again. Arsenal was a huge result for us, the performance wasn\u2019t great, but we got the performance for long periods against Hull, winning comfortably in the end, so we will look to keep that going against Stoke. We believe we can have a really good season. It\u2019s been a strange start in many ways. Hopefully we can get the injured lads back fit but when you can bring the likes of [Radamel] Falcao and Ander Herrera on it does give you confidence. Ander came on very early and did so well. These last few wins have helped that confidence and it\u2019s coming into that Christmas time now where we still believe.\u201d Herrera was forced on after 13 minutes against Hull because of \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda\u2019s hamstring injury that rules him out of facing Stoke. Wayne Rooney also suffered knocks to his calf and knee but Van Gaal is hopeful his captain will be fine to play against Stoke. Di Mar\u00eda\u2019s was the 41st injury of the season for United and Carrick believes being fourth despite the long medical list indicates the squad\u2019s depth, and strength of character. \u201cLook at Ander coming on,\u201d said the midfielder. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy coming on so early in the first half and he\u2019s not played a lot of football in recent weeks but he came on and looked terrific. \u201cThat\u2019s the beauty of having this strength. You have players to choose from, despite the injuries. Falcao coming on at the end, he was unlucky not to get his goal but he\u2019s played for us. \u00c1ngel is world class and to lose him was a bit of a blow but when you have got players like that to step in off the bench it helps a lot.\u201d Carrick also believes that United\u2019s differing formations - Van Gaal fielded a 4-2-2-2 against Hull that featured Robin van Persie in an unfamiliar midfield role - will help players to become more flexible and fluid. \u201cIn some ways it might help us longer term knowing we have played different systems and can learn from all of them so if we do have to change again we know we can adapt, we know we have done it,\u201d he said. \u201cSome have worked great, some haven\u2019t worked so well but certainly that system [against Hull] worked fine and we looked dangerous. \u201cWe can\u2019t look too far ahead. We\u2019ve never done that. We\u2019ve never said: \u2019Right, we need to go on a 10 or 15 game run\u2019. It\u2019s bit by bit.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
