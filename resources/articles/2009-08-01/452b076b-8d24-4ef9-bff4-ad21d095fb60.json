The Oval, the Ashes. Four years ago all England needed was a draw. Now they need to go one better. Without Kevin Pietersen in the side I make Australia slight favourites, but then England will not necessarily mind being underdogs. They have often played their best cricket from that position in the past, and if they have managed to strike the right balance going into this game between preparation and relaxation, they could just do enough over the next few days. Creating that balance is one of the most crucial skills a management team can possess. On the one hand, a side needs to practise and prepare as normal, because the greater the awareness that you're about to play the game of your lives, the more chance of tension creeping in. Of course a certain degree of intensity is needed, but not too much. When we went into the Oval Test in 2005 I did my best to maintain an air of relaxation. We played music in the changing room before practice and encouraged an atmosphere of leg\u2011pulling. You had to make the mood fun, but it's a tough balance. The role of Ottis Gibson will be very important too, after the bowlers lost their lengths at Headingley. The return of Andrew Flintoff will lend control to the attack and if he is able to keep one end tight, the others could in theory feed off him and be aggressive at the other. I just hope people remember there's an Ashes series to play for here and don't get carried away with the emotion of Flintoff's last Test. It would be unfair on the other bowlers if this game becomes about Flintoff. As we saw four years ago, everyone needs to perform if you're going to beat Australia. It is not just about one man. Having said that, there's no doubt England will miss Flintoff when he's gone. All-rounders like that don't come along often, and he balances the team like no other player can. The only change I'd make to the bowling attack from Headingley is to bring in Flintoff for Steve Harmison. Yes, he bounced a couple of players out in the fourth Test, but that doesn't win you games. Five-wicket hauls are the key to success. Look at Flintoff: when he finally managed to take a five-for at Lord's, England won the match. As for the batting, I would have made one change only: swap Ravi Bopara and Ian Bell. It was clear Bopara needed moving away from the frontline, and Bell bats at No3 for Warwickshire. I don't care that his Test record there is not what it might be: he should be comfortable at first drop. Instead the selectors have taken a huge gamble by handing a Test debut to Jonathan Trott in the most high-pressure situation imaginable. I just hope they weren't swayed by all the crazy talk leading up to this Test. Some people are fretting about Paul Collingwood too, and it may be the case that he's a different player without Pietersen around. It's possible that, like the team as a whole, Colly enjoys that underdog tag too, which is a role he can perform when he's batting with KP. Does his decision-making change when the onus is placed on him? Possibly. But he's used to being under the cosh, and he's done it before against Australia. He'll just carry on fighting for England. The fact is it's been a strange series and a completely unpredictable one. If you were to look at the stats \u2013 England have one hundred, for example, to Australia's seven \u2013 you would think it was 3-0 to the Aussies. But stats can be misleading, and the truth is this series has shifted one way then the other. Australia were all over England at Cardiff, and you felt it was going to be 4-0. Then England outplayed them at Lord's and for the first three days at Edgbaston. The Australians fought back after that and won comfortably at Headingley. It's going to boil down to who is the mentally stronger side. My guess is the Australians have a few more players who are used to situations like that. With Pietersen there I'd give England a real chance. But, deep down, I believe Australia have the edge. Mind you, whenever one team has appeared to hold the advantage in this series, they have lost it almost as quickly. There could still be time for one more surprise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
