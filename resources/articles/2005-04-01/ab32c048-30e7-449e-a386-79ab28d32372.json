Gustafson Porter, the firm of architects that gave the world the Diana Memorial Fountain, aka Britain's most expensive trench, in London's Hyde Park, have struck again. It has designed a \u00a310,000 public sculpture for Camden Council which carries a quote from As You Like It, written in Braille. Unfortunately, the quote has been attributed to one 'Willim Shakespeare'. So that's now two British icons the firm has spinning in their graves. \u00b7 Those wily souls who love to hunt foxes have established something called the Free Church of Country Sports, which claims it is an 'ethnic and religious group' and that banning hunting curtails its freedoms. Members, including One Fat Lady Clarissa Dickson-Wright and Bryan Ferry's ex, Lucy Ferry, have written to the Commission for Racial Equality to complain against the government's prohibition of their beloved sport. Can't see Reynard getting too worried about this one. \u00b7 A controversial new sign has gone up in the subway connecting Westminster underground station to parliament. 'Drinking control area,' it screams. 'A police constable can require you not to consume alcohol in this area. Maximum penalty \u00a3500.' Pendennis is running a sweepstake on which of our legislators will be forced to cough up first. \u00b7 A problem looms for Ruth Kelly. In a bid to get re-elected, the Education Secretary, MP for Bolton West, sent local voters a DVD showing her with local schoolchildren. Alas, Kelly forgot to get the parents' permission to show their offsprings' faces and has therefore broken a law introduced by her own government. An ignominious start to her campaign, Pendennis opines. \u00b7 The scene: an art gallery on Islington's fashionable Upper Street earlier this month. A petite blonde strolls in, falls in love with an abstract painting and asks to buy it - providing she is offered a discount. The gallery owner looks perplexed. 'Don't you know who I am?' the blonde demands. The owner replies in the negative. 'I'm Abi Titmuss,' the blonde explains. 'And what do you do?' the owner responds. A not uncommon refrain, Pendennis suggests. \u00b7 Who would have thought it? Islamophobia is good for something. Pendennis learns the love affair between Number 10 eminence grise, Lord Birt, and Eithne Wallis, former head of the Probation Service, first flowered when the two were assigned to a government taskforce looking at ways of combating anti-Islamic tendencies. When love can blossom on such fallow ground, it gives hope to lonely policy wonks everywhere. \u00b7 A beggong email from Labour wings its way to Pendennis from ardent supporter and author John O' Farrell, beseeching supporters to hand over dosh. 'This may not be the first email you have ever received asking for money, but at least this one isn't promising that you've already won the Nigerian lottery or free drugs for the treatment of male impotency.' Shame, because that really would get you to dig deep for New Labour. \u00b7 Unseemly scenes at Windsor as reporters chased cars ferrying away guests from Chas and Camilla's reception, begging them to stop and speak about the great day. Many VIPS chose to drive off, aware other cars were behind. Not so Lord Bragg, who relished the chance to hold court through his window. When they were finally satisfied, a French radio journalist asked: 'Do you speak French?' and the culture king obligingly gave the whole interview again en fran\u00e7ais . The illuminating monologue concluded only when a security guy shouted: 'There's an elderly lady in the car park freezing to death, waiting to get to her taxi.' pendennis@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
