England\u2019s players have also been reminded that every word will be picked up by TV microphones. Supporters will not be in attendance at Friday\u2019s game at the Stadion HNK Rijeka with Uefa having punished Croatia after a swastika was marked on their pitch before the Euro 2016 qualifier against Italy in Split. The country\u2019s football federation apologised, though the fixture was already being played behind closed doors after supporters had engaged in racist chants in a previous game against Norway. Southgate is aware the atmosphere will be unusual and has sent his players a link to watch Bar\u00e7a\u2019s match in October 2017, a 3-0 win over Las Palmas played at an empty Camp Nou after Bar\u00e7a protested at the rejection of their request for the match to be postponed in the light of Catalonia\u2019s independence referendum. The England manager has also watched Lyon\u2019s Champions League game with Shakhtar Donetsk last week when Uefa banned fans from the ground for crowd trouble. The squad trained together again at St George\u2019s Park on Tuesday . Southgate continues to protect Harry Kane from the risk of burnout after his summer exertions at the World Cup and the Tottenham striker joined 18-year-old Jadon Sancho in retiring early from training. The coaching staff are measuring his workload, the 25-year-old having begun last month\u2019s friendly against Switzerland on the bench before a 29-minute appearance to see out the win. The striker has started 67 games since the beginning of last season and the management is conscious of the strain. Sancho, one of the new arrivals in the squad, has just made consecutive starts for the first time for Borussia Dortmund, against Monaco in the Champions League and Augsburg in the Bundesliga. He completed 90 minutes in the latter fixture, his first league start of the season. Danny Welbeck, Danny Rose and Alex McCarthy missed training as a precaution after picking up knocks while Jordan Henderson, Joe Gomez, Kyle Walker and John Stones departed early for a warm-down session having been involved in the Premier League on Sunday. Ross Barkley, who played for Chelsea that day, did complete the session and is convinced he can impose himself having been recalled to the squad for the first time since March 2017. The 24-year-old boasts 22 caps but has not played since before Euro 2016. \u201cI believe I\u2019m a much better playerthan the one previously that played for England,\u201d he said. \u201cI understand football a lot better. \u201cI feel much more mature now and more ready to show what I\u2019m capable of. I can produce the goods on game day. Maybe in the last few years I have been a bit inconsistent, but now I am fully focussed on giving consistent performances. I can bring something different to the England team.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
