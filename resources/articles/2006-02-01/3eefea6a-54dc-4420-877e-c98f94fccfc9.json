My boyfriend is happy to indulge me, but only so far. Do I risk our relationship by revealing the extent of my fantasies?' Sebastian Horsley: Allow me, my dear. I know a little bit about this subject. You may recall, I was crucified some years ago... Sadism and masochism may be seen by some as rare and grotesque aberrations of normal human conduct. But this is not true. Man is naturally humble and naturally masterful. Masochism, sadism, almost all vices, in fact, are only ways of feeling more human. The great object of life is sensation - to feel that we exist, even if in pain. You are not looking for a relationship of 'no strings' but 'more strings' - preferably ropes. Try to remember that as the woman and the masochist you are the one who is in control. It is time to take a risk. You know that pain is a vitalising force. If you are like me, it calls your body to the forefront of experience. It gives intensity in the place of vagueness and emptiness. Being honest is a different type of pain. Lovers generally want to share the loved one's thoughts and to keep them in bondage. You must attempt to win freedom by telling your boyfriend the truth. Tell him your fantasies, your dreams and schemes. Tease him. Please him. Bite the hand that feeds you. I think you will be surprised if you give yourself completely to him. When you do this thing people can open up like a rose in sunlight. It is up to you to give your boyfriend the illusion that he is in charge. In return, if he loves you he should set you free. He should take off the chains, manacles, chastity belt, handcuffs, thumb screws, ball and chain, the iron maiden - but only when you ask him to. I hope it works, darling. But be prepared to drink your champagne standing for a few days if it does. Marion McBride: I don't think there is any problem about unleashing your deepest fantasies. At the right time. Obviously in the car on the way to see his mother, for instance, would not fall into this category. However, this doesn't mean you can automatically expect to have them fulfilled. That's why they're called fantasies - scenarios one wants to explore as an idea, not necessarily as a reality. Just because the fantasy is, in theory at least, attainable, doesn't mean you can have it served up on a plate with a blindfold. You say he 'indulges' you, but that you feel he only does this for your benefit. The compromise has been made - by him. You can't force him to enjoy this sort of dominant relationship if it isn't an intrinsic part of his psyche. Maybe you should be glad it isn't. You've managed to discuss your increasing need to be dominated, but haven't managed to ask how he, your partner in this intimacy, experiences it. And yet now you want to escalate things, but are worried about freaking him out? How about being worried that you might not truly be listening to what he needs and wants because the voice of your own desire is drowning him out? I think you might want to get a grip here, and I don't mean on the nipple clamps. It might be worth paying someone to address your needs - not the heightened level of sexual domination you're afraid to ask your partner for, but your emotional needs. Not because your sexual compulsion is wrong, but because there may be some other dynamic here you're missing. In your unedited letter, you describe him as 'vanilla', but you can't make ice cream into chilli by dressing it in a bondage suit. You also 'count yourself lucky to have him'. Why? Don't you deserve him? Is this what your desire for punishment stems from? Please explore what lies beneath your fantasies, not just the desire to fulfil them. \u00b7 If you have a question for Sebastian and Marion, email sex@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
