Many of the crimes alleged in the complaint seem fairly standard, like soliciting campaign contributions in return for government favors. But the last charge is the most shocking. The criminal complaint [PDF] describes in considerable detail, with expletives unredacted, Blagojevich's attempts to sell a vacant seat in the US senate like a highway construction contract. Blagojevich wasn't subtle about it. His objective, quoted in the complaint, was to \"monetize\" his position as governor. US attorney Patrick Fitzgerald said in a news conference today: \"The conduct would make Lincoln roll over in his grave.\" The criminal complaint tantalises us with references to conversations with candidates numbered 1 through 6. Enterprising reporters are trying to identify the unnamed candidates as we speak. Those mentioned in speculation by the US media so far include Illinois senate president Emil Jones, Illinois veteran affairs secretary Tammy Duckworth, and US representatives Jesse Jackson Jr, as well as Danny Davis and Jan Schakowsky, all Democrats. It should be noted that none of those mentioned for appointment to the Senate seat have been accused of any wrongdoing. The senior US senator for Illinois, Richard Durbin, has called for the state legislature to enact a law to fill the Senate vacancy through a special election. Two other Senate seats are being vacated during the presidential transition, those of Delaware senator Joe Biden and New York senator Hillary Clinton. New York governor David Paterson is pondering some big names, including Caroline Kennedy, to replace Hillary Clinton. Here in Delaware, outgoing governor Ruth Ann Minner picked longtime Biden confidant Ted Kaufman to fill the seat for the next two years until Delaware attorney general Beau Biden can run. Beau Biden is now on a tour of duty with the National Guard, and thus could hardly rush home to fill his father's seat. Some observers see the arrangement as a little too cosy, but the younger Biden will at least have to run for the seat in a primary and general election, instead of having it bestowed on him. Politics in Delaware may be cosy, but political intimacy takes on a darker meaning when money is put on the table. The criminal complaint against Blagojevich describes a series of conversations in which the governor and his top aide describe ways in which to trade the senate seat for a cabinet appointment, a well-paying job, or a corporate boardroom seat for his wife. Blagojevich is captured, via wiretap, saying the senate appointment \"is a [expletive] valuable thing, you just don't give it away for nothing.\" He even directed profanity towards the president-elect for not being willing to give him what he wants. The brazen quality of Blagojevich's scheming, knowing he was already under investigation, has left observers short of breath - and of adjectives."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
