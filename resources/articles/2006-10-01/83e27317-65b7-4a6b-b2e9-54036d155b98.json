The Newcastle second-row Jason Oakes was this week cited for stamping on Lawrence Dallaglio during the Premiership defeat at Wasps last Sunday, but Fletcher claimed that two Wasps internationals, Simon Shaw and Rapha\u00ebl Ibanez, got away with comparable acts of violence. \"We are furious with what Jason did and have banned him for a week,\" said Fletcher, \"but I am totally bemused by the double standards of the disciplinary system. Ibanez's stamp was just as bad but he has got away with a yellow card handed out after the match, while television shows Shaw illegally lifting Jason in a maul and punching him in the head.\" He went on: \"Again, the citing commissioner has given him a retrospective yellow card because the referee only gave a penalty for the incident and the message it sends out is that it is OK to go round on a rugby field punching people in the back of the head. Of course, it could not have had anything to do with the fact that Shaw is going to be involved with England in the autumn internationals. It is one rule for one and one for another.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
