Southampton's fans cheered a fifth successive league win for the first time in nine years, all the while muttering under their breath about the presumed departure of their manager. Even while celebrating victory, they were accepting defeat. Southampton have not finished in the top 10 since 1990, and have not qualified for Europe for 17 years. Today they are eighth, one win away from fifth and with a game in hand. But if, as the fans fear, Glenn Hoddle is destined for Spurs a return to the bad old days could be close. And the feeling that he will go is not confined to the terraces, but permeates the entire club. \"If Glenn goes he goes but I don't think he will,\" said Paul Jones. \"He's been a big success here and it would be a huge disappointment if he leaves. Several people have just signed new contracts here because of Glenn and we would all be gutted if he goes.\" Their defender Dean Richards joined in the plaintive theme. \"At the end of the day he's taken us forward and I'm sure he feels he's only just started doing a job and there's a long way still to go. Hopefully that'll be the carrot that keeps him at Southampton. \"It would be a massive achievement for him to get a club like ourselves into Europe. These are good times here and Glenn is very much a part of that. We've got massive respect for him as a coach and we don't want to see him go because things would fall away if he did.\" As there has as yet been no approach from Spurs to either Hoddle's club or his agent, everyone was getting a little carried away. Everyone, that is, except for Hoddle himself who said only that \"what happens at other clubs is nothing to do with me\". Not yet, anyway. And if - when - the call does come no one can see him staying. \"The pull might be too strong,\" said Richards. \"I mean, that's his club. That's where he made his name as a player and he's a legend at Spurs, no doubt about that.\" Richards, along with Hassan Kachloul, is also reported to be a Tottenham target and admits that he would be tempted should an offer arrive. \"I mean, it's a big club, isn't it,\" said Kachloul. \"You've got to be interested. It's a glamour club, so anybody's going to be tempted to go to Spurs.\" It should be little surprise if Spurs were tempted by everyone at Southampton. Four places above the London \"glamour club\", on Saturday Jones became the first Saints keeper since Tommy Allen in 1921 to keep a seventh successive clean sheet in the league. Their success has been built around the honest principles of organisation and sheer hard work, and in a scrappy game they created the best chances. Twice Marian Pahars, who has scored jonly once since September, missed gilt-edged opportunities while James Beattie and Mark Draper went close. Everton, despite a sustained period of pressure following the goal, had just one meaningful effort in each half. Scot Gemmill headed wide in the first; Duncan Ferguson tested Jones in the second, both from Thomas Gravesen's crosses. The goal itself was a delight, Jo Tessem fooling the Everton rearguard into expecting a pass before turning past David Weir and running 30 yards to score. It is another two weeks before the Saints next play. Quite who the manager will be by then no one knows."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
