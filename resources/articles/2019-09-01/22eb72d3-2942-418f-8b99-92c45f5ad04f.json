At the Etihad it felt as if the whole of Manchester was returning the affection for a player whose determination to do right by his adopted city matches his fiercely competitive attitude in 11 years as a leader by example. The special song supporters sing for Kompany is based on Simon and Garfunkel\u2019s Mrs Robinson, complete with second line: \u201cCity loves you more than you will know.\u201d Not any longer, perhaps, and maybe not just City. Most of the 51,602 present were of a City persuasion, though plenty on the pitch were recently retired Reds, Gary Neville, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs among them. As Kompany said, if you are trying to tackle the problem of homelessness in a city you need everyone to be working together, and in donating the entire proceeds of his testimonial match to Manchester\u2019s A Bed Every Night charity the new player-manager of Anderlecht stood up, as always, to be counted. Perhaps that is a slight exaggeration, for while Stephen Ireland, Craig Bellamy and Shaun Wright-Phillips could be found chugging around the greensward at slightly reduced pace, Kompany surprised precisely no one by crying off late with a hamstring injury. \u201cIt\u2019s typical me,\u201d he said, \u201cbut one of the things I now know about testimonials is that it makes life a lot easier if you go for people who have finished playing. Thankfully it\u2019s a celebration game, I don\u2019t actually need to be on the pitch. It\u2019s for an unbelievable cause too, so I don\u2019t think my missing out is the most important thing, and it\u2019s how City fans know me anyway. I\u2019ve had to deal with a lot of injuries and absences in my career, the irony of me missing my own testimonial won\u2019t be lost on anyone.\u201d That brought a laugh as Kompany addressed his audience before kick-off, and the former captain was moved in return by a rousing rendition of Here\u2019s To You, Vincent Kompany, before Martin Petrov opened the scoring in the second minute when David Silva found a surprising amount of space behind Gary Neville. The crowd possibly enjoyed that most of all, and gentle booing followed Neville round the pitch until the Sky Sports pundit also tweaked his hamstring, though Kompany had already anticipated that. \u201cI\u2019m glad to have the United players here, we can\u2019t do this properly without the red side being involved,\u201d he said. \u201cEven though I am presently playing in a different country Manchester will always be special for me. My missus is a Manc and so are my kids. We were looking for an opportunity to give something back when [Manchester Mayor] Andy Burnham came along. We are happy to help. As footballers we are just normal members of society, most of us come from nothing, but we are lucky to have a bigger platform to speak up.\u201d Burnham paid tribute to Kompany, revealing that he has already raised \u00a3300,000 for the homeless through their Tackle4MCR homeless charity. \u201cI can\u2019t praise Vincent enough, I\u2019ve seen first-hand how committed he is,\u201d Burnham said. \u201cJust days after he scored that fantastic goal against Leicester he gave up his time to visit the charity in Ardwick. He may be from Brussels but Vincent is as Mancunian as they come and understands better than most that in 2019 no one should have to spend a night on the streets.\u201d Pep Guardiola, notionally managing the City Legends side, said: \u201cWhen I came to the club everyone had already told me about Vincent but it was only through working with him that I began to realise the magnitude of his contribution. He was a leader in the dressing room and an inspiration on the field. For a decade he was the soul of the football club.\u201d Roberto Mart\u00ednez, handling the Premier League All Stars for the night as they were denied victory late on by an equalising goal from the former City striker Benjani Mwaruwari, said Kompany was an old-fashioned team player who would never accept defeat. \u201cHe\u2019s got the leadership and skill to do whatever it takes to achieve success,\u201d Kompany\u2019s national team manager with Belgium said. \u201cI think his goal against Leicester last season proved that.\u201d Kompany\u2019s own view on leadership is that it simply evolves from captaincy. \u201cA good captain is someone who cares more about the team than himself and, if you can add in experience, that\u2019s what makes a good leader too,\u201d he suggested. According to Mark Hughes, the manager who signed Kompany for City, his leadership qualities were evident when he arrived as a 22 year old midfielder from Hamburg. And if you ask Kevin de Bruyne, he is not finished yet. \u201cVinny is a very smart and passionate man,\u201d City\u2019s Belgian midfielder said. \u201cHe\u2019s got a lot more to do and to achieve in his career and I think he will be just as amazing at Anderlecht. I\u2019ve told him to keep a place in his team for me in a year or seven, when I\u2019m finished here.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
