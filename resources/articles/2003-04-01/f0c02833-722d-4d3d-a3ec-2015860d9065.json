Sir Howard Newby, head of the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce), which allocates government money to universities, said that only 20,000 additional student places had been created for next year. He told Hefce's annual conference on Monday, in a speech repeated yesterday to the Association of University Administrator's conference, that a \"significant\" increase would be needed to meet the government's target of getting 50% of 18-30 year olds into higher education by 2010. \"If the government is serious about moving towards a 50% participation rate by the end of the decade then we shall need to move towards a significant expansion of student numbers,\" he said. Sir Howard indicated that this might not be until after the next spending review. The next spending review is expected in 2005. He went on: \"I am not complaining too hard about this because at the moment, as you know, developing demand for higher education among students is very dependent upon improving achievement rates at 16 to 18. At the moment the sector is more or less in equilibrium in terms of supply and demand. \"So, if we had more places, significantly more places, I am not convinced that we could fill them,\" he said. In England 43% of 18-30 year olds currently experience some sort of higher education meaning that they will have to increase by 1% a year to meet their target. It is currently estimated that around 40,000 new students are needed every year to meet that target - double next year's rate as funded by Hefce. The government is sticking by its commitment to get 50% of 18-30 year olds into higher education and hopes to meet much of the expansion through two-year foundation degrees, which they say should kick in later in the decade. A Department for Education and Skills spokesperson said: \"We currently have a participation rate of 43% and are confident of hitting the 50% target. We will see growths in student numbers both in 18 year olds taking undergraduate degrees and for mature students under 30.\" Sir Howard welcomed many of the proposals set out in the government's white paper on the future of higher education, including the declaration that the new Office for Fair Access would not interfere with universities' individual admissions procedures. But he offered little reassurance to vice-chancellors worried about their falling research budgets for department rated less than a five in the Research Assessment Exercise, blaming a \"finite funding envelope\" on the concentration of funding to the best, world-class institutions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
