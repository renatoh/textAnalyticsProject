However, the impressive figures are largely down to the acquisition in September of US advertising network Bcom3 and the results amount to an actual 3.9% fall on a like-for-like basis, which was at the lower end of analysts' forecasts. Revenues for Publicis, which owns UK advertising agency Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, grew by 20.2% to \u00a31.96bn in 2002. Publicis said its fourth quarter revenue showed some improvement on the rest of the year. However, Maurice Levy, the chairman and chief executive of Publicis, said it was hard to make many predictions. \"The year 2002 was in no way in line with expert forecasts. It was notable for its climate of prudence and uncertainty, making forecasting extremely difficult.\" The French group confirmed it was on target to report an operating margin close to its target of 14% when it announces its full 2002 results on March 11. It added it was confident of achieving a ratio of core earnings to revenues of 15% in 2003, despite some analysts believing this target could be revised downwards. \"Our 2002 numbers lead me to believe we should be in a position to realise an EBIT [earnings before interest and tax] margin in the vicinity of 14% on our revenues, which is in line with our objective,\" said Mr Levy. \"As for 2003, I remain personally confident of our ability to reach a margin of 15% EBIT towards the end of the year.\" Reporting its fourth quarter revenues of \u00a3424m for 2002, Publicis said its new business total for 2002, excluding Bcom3, came to \u00a31.3bn. In the last quarter the group has picked up the accounts for Nescaf\u00e9 and Nike in Australia, Toyota in Europe and Gap in the US."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
