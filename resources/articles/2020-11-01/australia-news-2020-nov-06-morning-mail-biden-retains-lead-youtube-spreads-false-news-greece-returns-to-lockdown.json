Top stories Joe Biden holds the lead over Donald Trump in the tense wait for the results of the US election. Votes are still being counted in the key states of Nevada, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Arizona.

The leaders of Italian regions entering partial lockdown on Friday have lambasted the government\u2019s new tiered system, which has categorised some areas with the lowest rates of Covid-19 in the country as high-risk red zones.

Recommended reads \u201cUnveiling the uglier elements of dementia is important. We need to see the worst of the illness to know what we\u2019re up against.

But this election is not proving any theory, other than that the US electoral system is, yet again, not fit for purpose.\u201d The last flight Brigid Delaney caught was back to Australia from Cambodia in early March.

We social distance into a diamond configuration around the till but no one knows who was first. We politely indicate to each other that \u2013 no, you should go first. In addition to the social hesitancy, there\u2019s a sort of stunned look on many people\u2019s faces that says: Can you believe we\u2019re even here? At an airport?
