It was owned by the eminent art critic and Turner fanatic John Ruskin, who displayed it with other gems from his private collection in public shows in 1878 and in 1900, the year he died. The painting was then sold to an unknown private collector and disappeared for more than a century. Although hundreds of engravings survive, the painting - one from Turner's 1834 Picturesque Views in England and Wales - was assumed lost until the Tate gallery launched its Turner Worldwide project last year. \"Previously, we only knew about it through a black and white print,\" the Tate's Turner curator, Ian Warrell, said. \"But as a direct result of our project, it came to light in an American private collection. The delicate watercolour, published for the first time in the Guardian, can be seen from today on the Tate website. \"The project has helped us knit together sketches and more finished works,\" Mr Warrell said. \"We know of some 800 engravings of Harlech Castle, but to have the original finished watercolour is an important discovery. It's rare to find things that had completely gone off-record.\" It is one of several previously unknown or lost paintings and drawings brought to the attention of the Tate in the past year. Creating a comprehensive archive for one of the greatest English painters has led to one of the largest online catalogues of any artist. The website reunites more than 2,000 works by Turner, in private and public collections around the world, with the Tate's own vast holdings. The reclusive artist bequeathed 30,000 of his works to the nation on his death in 1851. More than 100 public and private collections around the world are already involved, including more than 50 galleries in the UK. Works from collections in Dublin and Scotland, too fragile to travel, may now be viewed side by side with the Tate collection. \u00b7 The Turner Worldwide project, created with the help of BT, can be accessed at www.tate.org.uk/turnerww"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
