It was thanks to the network\u2019s influence that when Labour was elected to government in 1997 more than 100 of its MPs were women. As the group\u2019s treasurer for many years, Jean ensured that its limited funds were well spent on the training, mentoring and advice so vital to getting women selected as candidates and then elected to parliament. Together we wrote various training guides about how to be selected as a parliamentary candidate (including Uphill All the Way and A Woman\u2019s Place Is in the House) and took training classes at weekend events held for potential female candidates, as well as those already selected. Jean was born in Elgin, in the north-east of Scotland, the third of four girls to Norman Black, a stonemason, and his wife, Margaret (nee McLennan). She left home to work in market research in Aberdeen and then Abu Dhabi, before settling in London. Eventually she went to North East London Polytechnic (now the University of East London) as a mature student, studying sociology, market research and statistics. Jean\u2019s intellect and innate interest in people enabled her to forge a successful career, working worldwide for a number of market research firms, including IRB International, Gfk NOP, Cello MRUK and Ipsos Mori, before going freelance from 2012 to 2015. She was independent, strong, courageous, outspoken, fearless and honest, with humour, energy and common sense. She was always a good person to have on your side. These attributes helped her to cope with difficult times in her life. At 34 she was diagnosed with leukaemia and she only survived because her youngest sister, Norma, donated her bone marrow. Throughout her treatment, Steve Rickett, the husband she christened her \u201crock\u201d, was always by her side. She and Steve had met through the Labour party in 1993 and they married the following year. On each anniversary of her transplant Jean held a party to celebrate another year\u2019s survival, with the invitation boldly proclaiming: \u201cI\u2019m still standing.\u201d Years later, when diagnosed with breast cancer, she endured yet more treatment, continuing to work throughout the chemotherapy. In their early 40s Jean and Steve adopted Nicholas, then aged six. Mother and son immediately formed the closest of bonds and he became her inspiration and her joy. In 2015 the family moved to Somerset, where she started a new and fulfilling career in health and social care, contributing to the local community as a carer and a volunteer for the local food bank. She is survived by Steve, Nicholas, her mother and her sisters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
