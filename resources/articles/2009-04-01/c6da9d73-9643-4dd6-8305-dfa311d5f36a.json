Both their goals came in the opening period, Ivan Klasnic netting the first after 15 minutes and Eduardo, the Brazilian-born Arsenal forward who has fought back to fitness following an horrific leg break, scoring the second. Belarus, also in Group Six, crushed Kazakhstan 5\u20131 in Almaty to retain a slim chance of reaching the play-off stage. Barcelona's Alexander Hleb, the former Arsenal midfielder, opened the scoring soon after the interval, sparking off a rush of four goals in nine minutes which left their hosts in disarray. A excellent first half display proved sufficient for Holland to beat Macedonia 4-0 and edge them closer to qualification. Liverpool's Dirk Kuyt opened the scoring from close range after 16 minutes after a pass by Arjen Robben, who set up Klaas Jan Huntelaar nine minutes later to double the lead. An excellent pass from Wesley Sneijder, who replaced the injured Robin van Persie, handed Kuyt his second four minutes before the interval and two minutes from time Rafael van der Vaart added a fourth. Holland are top of Group Nine, having won all of their five matches. European champions Spain, leading Group Five, came from behind to triumph 2-1 in Turkey. Semih Senturk put Turkey ahead in the first half, tapping the ball in from a pass by Middlesbrough's Tuncay Sanli. Xabi Alonso, the Liverpool midfielder, equalised from the spot just past the hour after Ibrahim Uzulmez handled. Spain then grabbed a dramatic winner in injury time when substitute Daniel Guizaset set up Alonso's club-mate Albert Riera who fired home. Guus Hiddink's Russia side, semi-finalists at Euro 2008, strengthened their grip on second place in Group Four with a 1\u20130 win over Liechtenstein, Konstantin Zyryanov scoring the only goal in Vaduz. Franck Ribery boosted France's qualifying hopes with a second-half goal to give the home side a 1-0 win over Lithuania. Ribery, who also netted the winner in Lithuania last Saturday, poked the ball home from an Andre-Pierre Gignac cross 15 minutes from time. The result lifted France to second in Group Seven with 10 points from five games, two points adrift of leaders Serbia. Bulgaria, once again without their captain, the Manchester United striker Dimitar Berbatov, still proved too strong for Cyprus in Group Eight, winning 2-0. Ivelin Popov and Dimitar Makriev, in stoppage time, were the scorers. Poland thumped Group Three whipping boys San Marino 10-0. The biggest upset of the night came in Bolivia where the home team beat Diego Maradona's Argentina 6-1. Australia took another bold step nearer to the finals after beating Uzbekistan 2-0 in Sydney. In fact, they would have become the first country to qualify if Bahrain and Qatar had drawn their match in Manama later in the day. However, Bahrain defeated their Gulf rivals 1-0. The Socceroos' win had come courtesy of Josh Kennedy's second-half header and a penalty netted by Harry Kewell, the former Liverpool winger now playing for Galatasaray. South Korea scored direct from a free-kick three minutes from time to snatch victory in Seoul over neighbours and fierce political foes North Korea."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
