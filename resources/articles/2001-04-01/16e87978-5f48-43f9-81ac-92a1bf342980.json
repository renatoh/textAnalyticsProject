Drugs cases are already impacting on the title race. Tonight, third-placed Lazio take on city rivals and league leaders AS Roma in a crucial derby but they do so without their Portuguese international defender Fernando Couto, who was suspended on Friday, six days after a counter-analysis confirmed that he had tested positive for the banned steroid nandrolone. Juventus's Dutch international midfielder Edgar Davids is waiting for the counter-analysis on his positive test - should it be positive he too will be suspended pending a ban. Davids and Couto can expect the same 16-month bans handed out to Perugia players Cristian Bucchi and Salvatore Monaco and would then miss the World Cup finals should their countries qualify. In total there are now eight players from Serie A and B who have tested positive for nandrolone this season and while all protest their innocence, reports suggest as many as 40 other post-match tests have been close to the limit. For the players the positive samples could be the result of anything, just not nandronlone. It has been argued that athletes can test positive for the steroid due to dehydration or by strenuous training and suggested that legal vitamin supplements could have been contaminated. Lazio captain Alessandro Nesta even claimed he is now 'afraid to drink a glass of water'. Gianmartino Benzi, professor of pharmacology at the University of Pavia, who has a 30-year involvement in the issue of doping and sport has has heard all the excuses before. 'This is the usual answer of course - \"it is a mistake\", \"it is not me\". But the use of steroids in football is probably exactly the same as it is in other sports,' he told The Observer . The sudden emergence of positive doping results in Italy may be explained absence of testing in the past argues Benzi. Although steroids were outlawed by the International Olympic Committee in 1975, Italian football did not begin effectively testing for them until 1999, leaving plenty of scope for abuse. Benzi is dismissive of the arguments that player's samples could be pushed over the limit by other factors than drugs, 'It is not a question of two milligrams or three milligrams. For me with Nandrolone it is a question of yes or no.' The row over drugs in football began three years ago when the then Roma coach, Czech Zdenek Zeman, pointed out the alleged rapid muscle development of some Juventus players and said it was time Italian football 'left the chemist's shop', claiming too many players could not resist 'magic pills'. Zeman's comments prompted frenzied denunciations and libel cases but most importantly they led to admissions from a variety of sources that legal muscle-builders such as creatine and a whole range of 'vitamin supplements' and 'integrators' were being widely used by players. Could it be that the players took supplements thinking they were harmless legal products and later paid the price for the neglect or dishonesty of those who administered them? Sergio Campana, president of the Italian player's union thinks this might be the case. 'I think there is a kind of grey area,' said Campana, 'It is an area in which a certain product is circulating that saves three months in the gym. I do not believe there is bad faith. The players don't know, or don't know well, what they are taking - it's an oversight. They should bring together the presidents and medical staff of the clubs. They should say \"Now in 15 days tell me what you give the players.\"' Back in 1998, lawyer Ugo Lungo headed an inquiry by the Italian Olympic Committee (CONI) anti-doping task-force and concluded: 'We have not found any elements that suggest doping exists in football.' Lungo has since quit CONI but he is still involved in the doping issue - he is now advising Lazio on their strategy for defending Couto. There is certainly little doubt that doping has a long history in Serie A . 'Doping in a rudimentary manner was certainly more dangerous the way it was used just after the war. There is nothing new in this,' Genoa's veteran coach Franco Scoglio said recently. Indeed Turin public magistrate Rafaello Guariniello, as part of a controversial long-term probe into doping, has been investigating 45 cases of premature deaths of Italian footballers that could be linked to doping. While few within the game seem prepared to consider the prospect that the Davids and Couto cases are the tip of a potentially devastating iceberg, Inter Milan club doctor Fabio Forloni has expressed his fears of the worst-case scenerio. 'The biggest danger is that a lot of lads, wanting to break through to the highest level at all costs, are turning to the charlatans that gravitate to the world of football - men without scruples, not even medical people.' The question for Italian football is no longer does doping happen but on what scale and who is to blame?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
