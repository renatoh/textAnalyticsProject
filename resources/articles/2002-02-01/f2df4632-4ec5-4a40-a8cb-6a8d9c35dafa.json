It was the first time in his long and illustrious career that the 39-year-old superstar, who came out of retirement to play for the Washington Wizards last autumn, had had surgery on either knee. The operation revealed a torn cartilage, which was repaired, leaving the club hopeful that he would make a full recovery. \"Michael will rest over the next few days, then begin therapy,\" the club's general manager Wes Unseld said. \"At that point we will have an idea of the time frame for his return to action.\" The Wizards' coach Doug Collins said Jordan had become very concerned about his knee after it swelled up last Sunday on the flight back from a game in Miami. \"I'm getting old,\" Jordan said after the game. \"It's a sign that this might be coming to a closure as to where my career is heading. The body sends you messages, and tonight my body won.\" Jordan has been troubled by his knee since last summer but the problem was initially diagnosed as tendinitis and he had fluid drained from the joint on three occasions. He also banged the knee in a collision with a team-mate 2 weeks ago. The Wizards face a tough time without him. Their hopes of making the play-offs have receded after losing their past five games, and the two matches Jordan missed earlier in the season ended in defeat. \"The things that we do with Michael we necessarily can't do with the team now,\" Collins said. \"We're going to find out who we are. What if Michael doesn't play next year?\" Jordan's only previous major injury came in 1985, when he broke his left foot and missed 64 games for the Chicago Bulls. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
