But toss in a bounty hunter, a Tea Party couple from Wife Swap, a border vigilante and a University of California Berkeley undergraduate and you have the makings of Donald Trump\u2019s California delegation to the Republican national convention. Meet some of the cast of colorful characters who will travel to Cleveland this July to formally anoint Donald Trump as the presidential candidate of the Republican party. [Update: late Wednesday afternoon the Trump campaign told the Guardian that an updated list of its delegates, without William Johnson and Guy St Onge, was posted on the website of the California Republican party.] The border vigilante Robert Maupin has not been paying much attention to the presidential campaign this year, choosing instead to expend his energy putting up signs for a longshot Republican candidate for Congress, Juan Hidalgo Jr. Still, the 76-year-old rancher from Tierra del Sol said on Tuesday that he\u2019s content to support Trump because he \u201csure as hell wouldn\u2019t want to support any of the communists running\u201d. Maupin was profiled by the Los Angeles Times in 2000 for his daily practice of patrolling the mile and a quarter of the US-Mexico border that makes up his property line with \u201ca rifle slung over his shoulder and a Glock handgun strapped in his thigh holster\u201d. Six years later, Maupin still patrols his property every day, but he\u2019s not overly enthused by Trump\u2019s proposal of a wall. \u201cActually, I wanted a moat with saltwater gators,\u201d he says. The wife-swappers John and Gina Loudon are the Tea Party power couple that never quite made it off the C-list. After John was termed out of the Missouri state legislature, where he served in the house and the senate, the couple made waves by guest-starring on reality television show Wife Swap. The family-values conservative switched spouses with a polyamorous part-time wrestler, and in the ensuing weeks Gina was thrown out of the house for her \u201cdidactic judgmentalism\u201d and John grew concerned that \u201cdark forces\u201d had invaded his home, according to the St Louis Post-Dispatch. Today the couple lives in San Diego, where John works in the private sector and Dr Gina, as she styles herself, hosts a conservative YouTube show. The preacher Guy St Onge was born again in September 1995, after living a life \u201cfull of drugs, motorcycles, gangs and cops and more\u201d, according to his Facebook profile. Now a pastor with a voluminous social media presence \u2013 he appears to preach mostly in the church of YouTube \u2013 he alternates between posts about the gospel and sharing memes offering to kill Muslims. On his Tumblr page, St Onge writes about Christianity and shares such thoughts as: \u201cBarack Hussein Obama and his tranny wife Michelle hates the U.S.A.!!\u201d Update: Pastor Onge has told the Guardian he is no longer a delegate for Trump. It was not immediately clear why or even how he had dropped out (the deadline for changing delegate lists has passed). However, he said he was \u201cno longer a delegate\u201d and had chosen to \u201ctake one for the team\u201d. The celebrity interviewer Daphne Barak and Erbil Gunasti made their names as a celebrity interviewer and diplomatic press officer turned television producer, respectively, but the couple\u2019s own foray into state politics ended up a little bit wet. Barak was charged with two misdemeanor counts of battery and public intoxication in October 2015, after a fracas at a forum for mayoral candidates in Palm Springs that included Gunasti as one of the candidates. The detective who investigated the case alleged that \u201cBarak opened a water bottle and began pouring water on [another woman], who slapped at the bottle repeatedly and, at one point, struck Barak\u2019s face\u201d, according to the Palm Springs Desert Sun: \u201cAs the parties were leaving, Barak allegedly grabbed [another woman\u2019s] cheeks with a \u2018clawing\u2019 grasp.\u201d Barak pleaded not guilty, and according to her personal assistant the charges were dismissed. Gunasti did not win the mayoralty, but an interview he gave to the Desert Sun about his candidacy hints at his political affinity to Trump: \u201cPower, money, celebrity \u2013 if you can bring all three in one place, you do wonders there.\u201d Asked for comment about the couple\u2019s selection as delegates, Barak\u2019s personal assistant responded: \u201cDaphne Barak\u2019s lifestyle encompasses many well-known names from North America and worldwide. Trump family is one of them. It is a relationship dating back two decades.\u201d The Berkeley student Claire Chiara may still be a senior at UC Berkeley, where she\u2019s majoring in political science and economics, but she is wasting no time embarking on her career. Chiara recently announced that she would be standing against Tony Thurmond for the state assembly\u2019s 15th district. Last time around there were no votes cast at all for a Republican in that seat \u2013 thanks to California\u2019s open primaries, both candidates were Democrats \u2013 but she appears undeterred. \u201cEven if I don\u2019t win the election, I truly hope to start a conversation and remind each and every constituent of Assembly District 15 that they can ask questions, and they can decide whether they are being truly represented,\u201d she told Berkeley student paper the Daily Californian earnestly on Monday. The bounty hunter Clifford Jeffrey Stanley is the owner of Bad Boys Bail Bonds, a bounty-hunting and bail bond outfit with offices in San Jose, Oakland, Los Angeles, San Diego, Santa Ana and Modesto. Their slogan is \u201cBecause your mama wants you home!\u201d, and among the company\u2019s cars is a lime-green Hummer emblazoned with the Bad Boys Bail Bonds logo. The company\u2019s photo section implies that Stanley will probably feel at home with Trump\u2019s loud aesthetic; scantily clad girls model company T-shirts, while company outings include monster trucks, quad bikes, mini motos and large quantities of heartily barbecued meat. The controversial ex-lawmaker Celeste Greig is a former president of California\u2019s Republican Assembly who was ousted in 2013 after making comments about rape that led many to draw comparisons with Todd Akin, the disgraced former Missouri congressman. \u201cThe percentage of pregnancies due to rape is small because it\u2019s an act of violence, because the body is traumatized,\u201d Greig said, leading to condemnation from state and national Democratic politicians and, eventually, the delivery of a 28,000-signature petition demanding her resignation, to which Greig capitulated. Ironically, when she made the statement, she was criticizing Akin for the very comments that she immediately echoed. She now blogs about politics under the handle GreigReport. The white nationalist William Daniel Johnson is a prominent white nationalist who once proposed a constitutional amendment calling for all Americans of non-European non-white descent to be immediately deported. The Southern Poverty Law Center, which maintains a list of hate groups, describes him acidly as an \u201cuninspiring but determined white separatist\u201d. When press attention was drawn to his inclusion, the Trump campaign scrambled to change their delegate list to remove him, while at first categorically denying that he was a delegate. Once they were informed by the California secretary of state that it was too late to change their list, they then blamed a \u201cdatabase error\u201d for his inclusion; Johnson offered his resignation to the Trump campaign but nonetheless he remains certified as a delegate. The campaign director Tim Clark is director of Trump\u2019s campaign for the California primary and as such a key figure at least partly responsible for the above list. A 49-year-old former political consultant whose list of ex-clients includes Manuel Bald\u00edzon, a failed Guatemalan presidential candidate who called for public executions in his campaign platform, Clark should have had a relatively easy job preparing for the June vote (his candidate\u2019s two remaining opponents have dropped out of the race). But, critics might allege, his cakewalk to Cleveland has been complicated by the unforced error of selecting, among others, a prominent white nationalist as a delegate to the Republican national convention. An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified a Trump delegate named David Horowitz as the president of the Freedom Center, who shares the same name."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
