Paralympian John Dickinson-Lilley tried to enter the store in Holborn, central London, with his guide dog, Brett, but said he was stopped by a security guard. He said: \u201cI had finished work and because it was a really nice day, Brett fancied a walk because we\u2019d been indoors all day. \u201cWe stopped at the Sainsbury\u2019s on Southampton Row to get some wine to enjoy the weather. As soon as I walked in, the security guard said: \u2018No, no, no.\u2019 \u201cI said: \u2018What?\u2019 He said: \u2018You know what. No dogs allowed.\u2019 I asked to get the manager, but he refused.\u201d Dickinson-Lilley, who retired from competitive skiing last year, said a supervisor eventually apologised. When he complained about the incident on Twitter, Sainsbury\u2019s responded by saying: \u201cHi John, sorry for the delay getting back to you. I\u2019ve spoken to the store manager. It\u2019s clear the security guard misread the situation and this has been addressed to prevent it from happening again.\u201d Businesses are required under the Equalities Act to allow guide dogs on to their premises, but Dickinson-Lilley said that this was the second time he had been denied access at the same store, and that he had encountered a similar situation at a different London branch of the store. He said he would be taking Sainsbury\u2019s to court over the incident. \u201cThe idea that you can walk into a shop and be humiliated like that in 2019 is outrageous. \u201cThere\u2019s clearly something that\u2019s not working in their business. They know they can\u2019t sell booze, knifes and razors to children, but yet they don\u2019t know that I\u2019m allowed in with my dog. They\u2019re not prioritising disabled people.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s has sponsored the British Paralympic team since 2012 under a deal that runs until 2020. Dickinson-Lilley said: \u201cSainsbury\u2019s made quite a big thing of their involvement in sport. If you put yourself on the front line by saying: \u2018hey, we\u2019re sponsoring the Paralympics,\u2019 you have to be a leader in that field.\u201d Sainsbury\u2019s said in a statement: \u201cWe have apologised to John for his experience and reassure him assistance dogs are welcome in all our stores and petrol stations.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
