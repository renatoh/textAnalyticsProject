Nicholas Robertson allegedly refused commands to lay down his gun and \u201cwas motioning in the direction\u201d of two deputies when they opened fire, one firing 16 shots, the other 17. Robertson was killed as he crawled, wounded, on a busy street in Lynwood on Saturday morning. At a press conference, Jim McDonnell, the county sheriff, and other officials showed a video and two photographs of Robertson, 28, in the moments before and during the shooting, images they said presented another side to an encounter which has triggered protests and suspicion. \u201cThe suspect was a threat to the deputies and to the community and they took the action that they did,\u201d said detective Steve Katz, of the homicide unit. He said two women and three children who were just feet away from Robinson feared he would shoot them. The deputies gave warnings before opening fire, Katz added. \u201cHe did not comply with their repeated requests to drop the weapon \u2026 He retained the weapon throughout the entire event. It was recovered from his person.\u201d Graphic cellphone video of the encounter which took place shortly before 11am at an Arco gas station in Lynwood, a small, racially charged city south of Los Angeles, prompted shock and dismay on Saturday. It showed the deputies firing repeatedly after Robertson fell and attempted to crawl. Relatives of the African American man told media he was a good father to his eight-year-old daughter and seven-year-old twins and that the killing appeared unjustified. They said they they knew nothing about the gun, which was not registered to Robertson. Members of a small crowd which gathered at the scene shortly afterward shouted at police. Robertson\u2019s name became a Twitter hashtag, as did that of the movement Black Lives Matter. McDonnell told the press conference the investigation was in its early stages, and promised transparency. The sheriff referred to Robertson as a suspect and said he had had \u201cprior contacts with the criminal justice system\u201d, without elaborating. Detective Katz said the first of multiple 911 calls came at 10.53am, reporting an armed man walking down Long Beach Boulevard. One caller reported hearing six to seven shots. Investigators have recovered physical evidence indicating Robertson did fire his .45-caliber semi-automatic handgun, apparently in the air, Katz said. Video from a store camera showed Robertson striding through traffic to cross the boulevard, apparently talking and gesticulating to himself. \u201cThere may have been some domestic discord between him and a spouse that may have been a factor that agitated him,\u201d said Katz. Robertson briefly entered a car wash and a pizza parlour holding his gun but there was no suggestion of robbery, Katz said. \u201cHe was behaving erratically. He was yelling out some expletives.\u201d When deputies arrived at 10.59am, Robertson was at the Arco station, \u201ca highly populated area\u201d. He briefly pointed his gun at the deputies and ignored commands to put down his gun, Katz said, adding that video indicated he \u201cwas motioning in the direction\u201d of the deputies when they opened fire. The detective showed a still image, also apparently from a store camera, of Robertson on the ground with an outstretched arm, still holding the gun. There were no live rounds in the weapon but investigators found two live rounds within the suspect\u2019s grasp, Katz said. The officers involved were not named. McDonnell said they had been reassigned until the investigation was completed. With accusations of \u201cmurder\u201d and \u201cexecution\u201d still seething on social media, protesters were due to hold a rally near the scene of the killing on Sunday afternoon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
