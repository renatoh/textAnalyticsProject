The Everton manager appeared to call time on the 27-year-old's career at Goodison Park yesterday when he ordered the England international to train alone and dropped him from the first leg against Sigma Olomouc. Moyes insists, however, that the punishment is purely a response to Lescott's behaviour in training following Saturday's 6-1 humbling by Arsenal and that the centre-half will remain an Everton player unless City increase their \u00a318m offer closer to the \u00a330m he is demanding. The incentive of a World Cup place in South Africa next summer will, the Scot hopes, refocus Lescott's mind on Everton should the transfer deadline close on 1 September without a deal in place. \"It is not inevitable that he is leaving,\" Moyes said. \"All I have done is make a decision for this game that may or may not be the right decision, but Saturday's performance against Arsenal made me realise that I had to do something. I couldn't let it drift. \"It doesn't mean his valuation has dropped. If anything it has made my resolve stronger. The talks he has had with people have obviously upset him and he has lost his direction, but that can be brought back. I can see a time when he is fully focused on Everton again. He has a World Cup to aim for at the end of the season.\" Moyes has rejected two bids of \u00a315m and \u00a318m from City for Lescott, whom he signed in 2006 for \u00a35m from Wolverhampton Wanderers; they are entitled to around 20% of any sell-on fee. The Everton manager is confident of signing at least one new centre-half before the transfer deadline, with Middlesbrough's David Wheater under consideration and Richard Dunne a possible inclusion in any Lescott deal with City. The Scot claims a \u00a330m valuation of an England player with three years remaining on his contract is not excessive. \"Most people would choose a British centre-back; you think of Jamie Carragher at Liverpool or John Terry at Chelsea. John Terry and Rio Ferdinand are first choice for England and after that there is a group of Phil Jagielka, Joleon Lescott with Mathew Upson maybe between them,\" the Everton manager explained. \"After that there is another group and you ask where do England go for their next centre-backs? \"There is a lack of replacements and because of the shortage the prices of centre-backs have risen dramatically. People were talking about \u00a340m-\u00a350m for John Terry. The next group is Jagielka, Lescott and Upson, and, with all due respect to Upson, he is 30. The price we have been offered is not close to our valuation.\" Despite claiming the door remains ajar for Lescott, Moyes's verbal attack on his own player shows how deeply their relationship has been strained by City's relentless pursuit, with the Scot also claiming the defender's team-mates feel betrayed by his attitude in training this week. \"I feel Joleon has been got to and he is letting himself down with his own behaviour. His attitude has been poor post-Arsenal,\" Moyes said. \"It has not been one thing, it is just generally. Normally he is a very good trainer and very focused but he doesn't seem to be that at this present time. It doesn't mean the end of his Everton career. He might be in the first team squad for this weekend [Burnley on Sunday] if I see there is a change in his attitude. \"The biggest disappointment is that Joleon is a very good boy behind it all and the people who have been advising him are giving him poor information and have turned a good lad into something else. I can see by the reaction of his team\u2011mates that they are disappointed in him as well.\" Moyes remains livid with City's handling of the saga and called on the Premier League to intervene in alleged cases of players being \"tapped up\". He said: \"There should be some honour and integrity between clubs and if that goes it becomes a free for all.\" The Everton manager, who also hopes to sign Vladimir Bystrov, a right-winger from Spartak Moscow, in the coming days, could also not resist a dig at Mark Hughes as he looked ahead to the tie with Sigma, conquerors of Aberdeen in the previous round. \"We have a poor record in qualifiers but isn't it great that we have a chance to get into the group stages of a European competition?\" added Moyes, who will ask Phil Neville or Jack Rodwell to replace Lescott. \"There are a lot of teams out there who spent a lot of money and didn't qualify and we will do everything we can to get through.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
