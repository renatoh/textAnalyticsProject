Five years after the eight Millennium Development Goals and 18 targets were set, and 10 years before their deadline, the progress has been slow. This year, with Africa and development in focus as never before, there are those who feel the UN's credibility is at stake. The figures are shocking: \u00b7 The numbers in extreme poverty, living on less than $1 a day, rose from 271 million in 1996 to 313 million in 2002 \u00b7 Only 62% of children go to primary school \u00b7 920 women die for every 100,000 who give birth \u00b7 More than 50,000 children under five die every year, mostly of preventable diseases such as diarrhoea \u00b7 2.3 million people died of Aids in 2004 and 25.4 million are HIV-positive The millennium goals concern real, concrete change, and they are measurable. The latest progress report in January shows there is a long way to go, and that in sub-Saharan Africa some things are getting worse. While there was dramatic improvement in Asia in reducing extreme poverty between 1990 and 2001, as some economies took off and a quarter of a billion people moved out of extreme poverty (defined as living on less than $1 a day), in sub-Saharan Africa the average income declined in the 1990s. Growing numbers do not have paid work, agriculture has stagnated and HIV/Aids has taken a severe toll of those in their most productive working years. While 9 million fewer people across the developing world went hungry in 2002, compared with 1990, in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia the numbers without enough food rose by tens of millions because of growing populations and poor harvests. Aid organisations agree that the targets are likely to be missed unless something dramatic happens. Anna Taylor, head of basic services at Save the Children Fund, said the one target pinned to this year - eliminating gender disparity in education so girls as well as boys get at least basic schooling - had not been met. \"That is not a good start,\" she said, \"Some of the others [targets] are wildly off track, particularly the health goals. Others are patchy. In some parts of the world there is progress, but in others, and notably Africa, they are off track.\" Even where school fees have been abolished, girls may not attend because of the cost of books and uniforms. Many more fail to stay the course. Three of the targets are specifically concerned with health, but health underlies many of the others, particularly because of the HIV/Aids epidemic that claims so many nurses, doctors, teachers and farmers, and leaves families in greater poverty because of the loss of breadwinners. The target for reducing child mortality was to cut deaths of under-fives by two-thirds, while the target for improving maternal health was to reduce the death toll among women in pregnancy and childbirth by three-quarters. Almost half of all the child deaths under five occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where, says the report, \"progress has slowed owing to weak health systems, conflicts and Aids\". Low-cost interventions Pneumonia, malaria, diarrhoea, measles and Aids account for half of these deaths, and many could be avoided by low-cost interventions, such as encouraging women to breastfeed exclusively for longer, immunising babies for basic illnesses such as measles, bednets to protect against mosquito bites and supplying antibiotics and oral rehydration salts. Aids is a huge problem, exacerbated by co-infection with tuberculosis. Last year 2.3 million people died in sub-Saharan Africa of Aids, with a further 25.4 million living with HIV. The WTO's campaign to get 3 million people in the developing world on drug treatment by the end of this year will also fail to meet its target, although optimists hope the major efforts now being made to train basic health workers and open clinics may pay off in all-round improvements in healthcare in Africa. The G7 finance ministers stepped up the pressure at their recent meeting, by backing universal access to the drugs. More people had access to clean water in 2002: 79% compared with 71% in 1990, mostly due to major improvements in India. But the report says the obstacles to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where 42% still do not have safe water \"are especially daunting\". Half the developing world, it says, lacks improved sanitation. Even the UN secretary general, Kofi Annan, acknowledged in the report that the millennium goals would not be met unless there were substantial changes. \"Considering how far we have come, such a failure would mark a tragically missed opportunity,\" he said. Romilly Greenhill, policy officer with ActionAid UK, says the millennium goals are so important that an even bigger campaign than that for the G8 is brewing for the September summit. \"The key message is stick to the promises,\" Ms Greenhill said. \"We are five years in [to the 21st century] and the rich countries still aren't providing enough aid, debt relief and the right quality aid, and trade rules are discriminating against developing countries. It is a question of credibility for the UN. Can they deliver on the development issues? Can they hold both rich and poor countries to account?\" Ms Taylor, said: \"What we're really looking for is for 2005 to be the breakthrough year we are all hoping for, a step change not only in aid commitments but also the policy framework that goes with it.\" She said that one simple example which the Save the Children Fund wants was the elimination of fees for those needing medical treatment - many African families cannot afford to take their sick children to the doctor.
