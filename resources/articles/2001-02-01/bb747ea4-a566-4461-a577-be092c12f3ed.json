Subs: Manninger, Ljungberg, Wiltord, Malz, Luzhny, Vivas, Pennant. Referee: Urs Meier (Switzerland) 1 Arsenal kick-off this sell-out in the Stade Gerland. According to one French paper tickets have been harder to come by than Greek passports. Not bad. Anderson wins the first free-kick of the game; comes in from the right but Arsenal clear. 2 Parlour and Pires knock it around just outside the Lyon area, but in no time the home side break and are again pressuring the Gunners' goal as Anderson charges in on Seaman. 4 Anderson already a handful for the Arsenal back line - Adams lucky when Anderson tumbles over him just outside the area and the ref waves play on. 6 Lyon unlucky not to get the opener; Marlet, in space from Grimandi on the edge of the Arsenal area, tries to lob Seaman but the Arsenal keeper flaps a hand at the ball to send it wide. 7 Henry creates the first real opening for Arsenal with a useful run into the Lyon penalty area. 9 Pires catches Deflandre out of position and gets away on the left; Edmilson stops him dead. 11 Cole very lucky to survive a penalty appeal as Lyon flood forward again. Two corners in succession for the home side have Arsenal on the rack; the first is hooked clear from under the crossbar by Adams, the second is held by Seaman under pressure from his ponytail. 13 Good movement by Violeau and Brechet almost releases Marlet through the middle but Arsenal hold firm. 14 Pires releases Cole on the left but the cross is poor. 16 Free-kick for Arsenal 30 yards out on the left. Pires takes towards Adams and Vieira at the far post but Lyon keeper Coupet punches clear. 17 Pires gets caught on the ball deep on his own half; Marlet picks it up and shoots from 25 yards. 18 Arsenal come desperately close to scoring when Kanu runs through from 30 ayards, beats three men with the ball stuck to his feet and chips the ball across goal with the outside of his right foot... wide. 20 Henry played in by Vieira just outside the Lyon area. He is forced to come back on himself to shoot but still manages to force Coupet down to his right. 22 Arsenal living dangerously, allowing far too much space in midfield. Only Seaman's fine form and some fearless defending by Grimandi keep Dhorasoo and Marlet from scoring as Lyon heap pressure on the Arsenal goal. 24 Arsenal corner, Pires takes, Lyon clear. End to end stuff now as both teams run riot in the cavernous expanses now dominating the middle of the park. 27 Dhorasoo and Anderson play a one-two just outside the Arsenal area before the ball goes to Deflandre out on the right. He shoots and forces another save from Seaman. 28 Adams getting the measure of Marlet as he robs him in midfield; passes to Vieira who slides the ball through to the on-running Henry... too long. 31 Booking Cole; went in too hard. 32 And so it came to pass that in the 32nd minute things calmed down slightly. 33 For a moment at least... Violeau almost rattles the crossbar with a blistering shot from 25 yards. 35 Booking Adams for upending Anderson just outside the area. Lucky. Free-kick taken by Edmilson and it's vicious, wide of the left upright. Resulting corner comes to nothing. 37 Booking Mulller for shirt-pulling. 45 Beautiful move by Arsenal; Kanu, on the edge of the area, knocks the ball over his head for Henry to see his shot skim off the far post. Half-time. An open half verging on the reckless, but Arsenal appear to have weathered the storm and look good for a lucky away goal in the second half. 46 Lyon get the second half underway. With Arsenal clearly not ready to settle for a draw, it should make for a lively finale. 47 First chance of the half falls to Kanu. He gets away from Edmilson deep on the right and decides to go it alone with a dead-end shot to the the near post when a pass to Henry or Pires would have been more useful. 51 Henry runs at Edmilson on the edge of the Lyon area; he is beaten back but still squeezes in a shot before going down. 55 Dhorasoo wins a corner for Lyon. Dhorasoo takes, Grimandi heads clear and Violeau goes down claiming for a penalty on the edge of the Arsenal area. Ref not having it. 56 Lyon with the best chance of the half so far. Marlet finds Anderson running into the area and Seaman is at full stretch to fingertip Anderson's shot wide of the far post. 58 GOAL: Lyon 0 - 1 Arsenal A goal made by Cole when he crosses high from the left side of the area for Henry to head Arsenal into the lead. 61 Marlet in space 20 yards out and borderline offside tries unsuccessfully to chip Seaman. 64 Henry impatient as he tries to get on the end of Lauren's pass and is caught offside in what would have been a great position. 68 Seaman in just the right spot at the just the right time to save from Anderson on the six-yard line. 69 Substitution Ljungberg on for Pires. 72 Lyon getting the better of the ref's decisions as Edmilson gets away with a chop into the back of Kanu's legs. 74 Henry given bags of time and space to tee up a shot from 25 yards and force a save. 75 Substitution Malbranque and Govou on for Violeau and Dhorasoo. 76 Corner to Lyon, comes to nothing. 80 Vieira, a towering presence in midfield tonight, now playing deep as Arsenal batten down the hatches and try to hold on for victory. Neveretheless, Lauren and Ljungberg still trying to gain ground down the flanks. Lauren wins a corner on the right; vcomes to nothing. 82 Marlet comes close to ruining Arsenal's night when he puts over the bar under pressure from Vieira. 87 Arsenal finishing the game as a team of defenders as Henry manages to charge the ball downfield and waste a few moments in the Lyons half. 88 A wall of red and white greets Anderson as he as tries desperately to break through in search of an equaliser. 90 Substitution Vivas on for Kanu. Desperate stuff for Lyon as Arsenal hang on. Full-time. Lyons 0 - 1 Arsenal A season-turning result for Arsenal that sees them go second in the group after Bayern Munich beat Spartak Moscow 1-0."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
