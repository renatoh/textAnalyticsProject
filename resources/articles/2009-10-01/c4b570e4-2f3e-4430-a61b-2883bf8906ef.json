Blogposts for all five seasons will feature \u2013 as well as many, many of your comments, which have made this blog the great forum it is. Series three, episode eight D'Angelo's memory causes many waves this week. Reliving the accidental gangster's death sees McNulty, Brianna, Stringer and, finally, Avon, explore and face up to many home truths. The boy's death will always be with them, and, as D'Angelo himself tried to grasp so eloquently in prison, there are no second acts in American lives. Not in these ones anyway. D'Angelo's murder was a powerful slap across the face for the viewer back in season two. The warning was clear: don't get complacent; don't think anyone's too good to die. And it occurred just when things were looking up, relatively, for D. Deciding to finally cut his ties to his uncle, D was seemingly on a redemptive path before he was slain on Stringer's orders. Jimmy is a man with two motivations in pursuing the truth about D's demise. Firstly, he genuinely cared about him and believed he was in over his head in the game. Secondly, his obsessive chasing of Stringer leads him to this seemingly overlooked detail that no one else seems to care about. McNulty may well and truly be giving a fuck when it's not his turn in this latest line of inquiry, but we give a fuck. How could we not? McNulty may be an unreconstructed wanker when it comes to shafting many of his colleagues. He may have an unreasonable view of Stringer's danger to society compared to his desire to get his man. But in this case he is the voice of morality. What the fuck did he do? Brianna's understandable distress at being shown pictures of her son lying dead and being accused of sacrificing him for her own lifestyle would appear distasteful and downright despicable, were Jimmy, damn him, not right on the money. He manages to figure out what happened and how it came to be by pushing the right buttons, and sends Brianna back to her brother as an agent of justice. Jimmy is not sure whether it was Avon or Stringer who inked the final contract on D, but he uses a mother's grief \u2013 and deserved guilt \u2013 to beat the bushes. As he devastatingly tells Brianna: \"I kinda liked your son, and it grinded me that there was no one to speak up for him.\" And when she demands to know why he went to Donette instead of her, he cruelly replies: \"Honestly? I was looking for someone who cared about the boy.\" For Stringer, D'Angelo's death was, on the surface, simply a business decision that Avon or Brianna could not possibly make. But, as we have discussed many times before, String's innate jealousy and animosity towards D suggests his dirty little secret is also a source of mischievous pride. He knows he did what was right for the organisation. The boy was soft; he would inevitably roll. And as Stringer slowly and deliberately reveals the truth to Avon after receiving a barracking for being too soft, like the final prestige of a macabre conjuror, we are left in no doubt where his sensibilities lie. It is he, not Avon, who is strong. \"You gonna tell me blood's thicker than water? You take that shit somewhere else!\" For best friends or brothers, it takes something extraordinary to break their bond \u2013 jealousy, a woman, betrayal, or, as in this case, money. As Avon says: \"The difference between you and me? I bleed red, you bleed green.\" Their playground tussle and subsequent angry silence telegraphs what is to come later in the series: mutual betrayal resulting in one's incarceration and the other's death. Favourite quote: \"A great village of pain and you're the mayor\" - The Deacon strips away any pretensions Bunny may have had about Hamsterdam. Running totals Murders: up one to 50, as one of Avon's crew gets taken out when Chris susses the honey trap for Marlo. McNulty giving a fuck when it's not his turn: up one to 25 as he mercilessly preys on Brianna's guilt over D's death to sow discord among the Barksdales. Drunk: small tipple with Kima in a motel room aside, no change. Still 16. Dubious parenting: still six. Bunk drunk: still five. Herc fuck-ups: steady, despite his tomfoolery with the hoppers and the e-fit software. Still eight and a half. Omar stick-ups: up one to eight, though it is not actually seen \u2013 we just see them counting their takings. \"East side never saw us coming.\" Bubbles attempting to get clean: no change.
