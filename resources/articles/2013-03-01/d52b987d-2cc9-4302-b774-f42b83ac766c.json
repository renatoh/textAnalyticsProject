One Mile Away is a blow-by-blow account of their stuttering reconciliation, detailing the crossfire killings of Charlene Ellis and Letisha Shakespeare, and the surprising unifying effect of the 2011 riots. If signs look good, it's because of repentant gangsters such as Shabba (Johnsons) and Flash (Burgers), who were linked up by director Penny Woolcock, then made the peace process their own. The doc's short on context, and too forgiving of its poster boys, but as a study of their commitment to bettering themselves and the community, it's inspiring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
