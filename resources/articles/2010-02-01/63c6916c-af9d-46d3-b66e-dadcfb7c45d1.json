The opera calls itself a dramma giocosomorale, and its dramaturgy derives not so much from classical drama and philosophy as from medieval allegories and morality plays. The titular misadventures of love involve Cupid in a series of picaresque spats, first with Venus, Vulcan and a gang of unruly Cyclops, then with such types as Deceit, Flattery, Friendship and Avarice. It's like nothing else in the repertoire, though its uniqueness also renders it dramatically unwieldy. Some of its humour is laboured \u2013 a joke about Venus really being a raddled old slapper proves interminable \u2013 and it's also very apparent that Cesti was more interested in allegorical types than in discredited Roman deities. It's nicely done, with some fine playing from Auser Musici under Carlo Ipata. Male soprano Paolo Lopez is an alluring Cupid, but Gabriella Martellacci (Flattery) and Carlos Natale (Deceit) have the best music and give the finest performances."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
