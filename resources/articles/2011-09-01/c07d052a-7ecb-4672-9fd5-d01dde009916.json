Have there been any previous instances of clubs refunding fans money spent on shirts due to player transfers?\" We hear approximately 472,831 stories per year about fans being ripped off when it comes to shirts, so it's refreshing to hear about such gestures of goodwill, especially given Everton's current financial agita. In the past, such gestures have often come from the players rather than the club. In 2009, Arsenal's Nicklas Bendtner offered to refund all shirt purchases when he changed his squad number from 26 to 52. Nine years earlier, Coventry's Mustapha Hadji did something similar. Contemporary reports suggested that, had all fans with the old shirts taken up the offer, Bendtner and Hadji stood to lose \u00a310,000 and \u00a318,000 respectively. We're not sure if this reflects most of Hadji's popularity or Bendtner's lack thereof. \"I chose to move to 52 because it's a special number to me personally,\" said Bendtner, \"and I hope that it brings me good luck.\" Oh well. In that same summer of 2000, Coventry sold Robbie Keane to Internazionale for \u00a313m and offered a 50% refund to all fans who bought shirts with Keane's name and number on the back. A couple of months ago, Stoke's Jermaine Pennant decided to switch his squad number from 16 to 7, the number worn by that other legendary Stoke right-winger, Stanley Matthews. He wore No7 for the two Europa League ties against Hadjuk Split, but a number of fans complained about having the wrong number, so Pennant switched back to No16. \"Would have liked number seven but if all the fans have 16 then it's only right I stay with it. 1+6 = 7,\" he Zamoranoed on Twitter. Stoke also refunded anybody who had bought a shirt with Pennant and the No7 on the back. There is one other interesting and slightly odd precedent, the most terrifying example of a litigious child since that brat on Ally McBeal tried to sue God. Last year, a 13-year-old Middlesbrough-based Reading fan decided to sue the club when they sold Gylfi Sigurdsson, whose name he had on the back of his shirt. Reading gave McGhee \u00a372 to cover a full refund and legal costs. \"We only settled because the hearing was right up in Middlesbrough,\" said a spokesperson. \"For the time and effort, it was far more logical to settle.\" Now that's what we call goodwill. HOME, SWEET HOME \"My team Sheffield Wednesday have won all of their home games and only one of their away games this season,\" notes Matthew Kelcher. \"This made me wonder: what is the biggest dichotomy between home and away form over the course of a whole season? Has any team gone an entire season picking up points at home only?\" It depends how you define the dichotomy: is it percentage of points picked up at home or the difference between the number of points collected home and away? If it's the former, you simply need to find teams who went through the entire season without winning a single point away from home. Like Northwich Victoria in Division Two in 1893-94 and Doncaster in the same league in 1904-05. Although they collected 100% of their points at home and away, the difference between points collected at home, and away was not significant. Northwich managed only 12 points at home that season (this is working on a system of three points for a win, to allow comparison between different eras) and Doncaster just 11. Instead we have to look to the 1960s. \"Spurs in 1964-65 must be a contender,\" offers John Chapman. \"Their home record was W18 D3 L0, the best in the First Division and, you'd think, the form of champions, while away they incredibly contrived W1 D4 L16: the worst away record. Even Wolves and Birmingham, who were relegated, did better away.\" Under a system of three points for a win, Spurs would have taken 57 points at home and seven away, a mighty difference of 50 points.

ARSENAL'S WORST START SINCE \u2026 \"Five games, four points, 14 goals conceded,\" weeps Andy Rafferty. \"When did Arsenal last have such a bad start to the season?\" This is a simple one. The last time Arsenal conceded 14 or more in the first five league games was back in 1963-64, when they shipped 19, including a 7-2 defeat at Leicester. And the last time they had as few as four points was in 1982-83, when they also started with three defeats in five games. They finished 10th that season, and eighth in 1963-64. KNOWLEDGE ARCHIVE \"Why are Sunderland called the Black Cats?\" asked Tim Downer in 2008. What with the move away from Roker Park in 1997, the club no longer had any use for its previous nicknames The Rokerites and The Roker Men. Not fancying the Stadium of Light-ites, Sunderland instead decided to have a fan vote on the issue. The five options shortlisted were: the Black Cats, the Light Brigade, the Miners, the Sols and the Mackems. Over 11,000 took part in a final online vote, and the Black Cats took it by nearly 50%. This was a choice soundly in keeping with tradition. According to the club: \"The link between Sunderland AFC and the black cat stems originally from a gun battery in 1805 on the River Wear which was renamed the Black Cat battery after the men manning the station heard a mysterious miaow from a wailing black cat. A hundred years later in 1905, a black cat was pictured sitting on a football next to Chairman FW Taylor and three years later a black cat featured on a team photograph.\" We're in.

The cup also started in 1883, but (according to Wiki) Forfarshire was formally disbanded as a geographic region in 1889, yet the competition continues with the same name. Are there any other examples of competitions starting around geographic regions, but continuing after dissolution?\" Send your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
