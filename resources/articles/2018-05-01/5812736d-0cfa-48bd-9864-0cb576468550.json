The clock is ticking, and major questions about our future relationship with the EU remain unanswered. Our new customs and regulatory arrangements must reflect the needs of British businesses and protect the livelihood of UK workers. So it\u2019s no wonder that an off-the-shelf, already-tested model such as Efta/EEA (European Free Trade Association/European Economic Area) is attracting more and more supporters. The UK voted to leave the EU. All my colleagues respect that. However, the referendum did not tell us how to leave \u2013 the customs union and the single market were not mentioned on that ballot paper. The result is important, too: a 52% to 48% victory is not a mandate for the hardest of Brexits. \u201cThe tectonic plates are shifting\u201d is an oft-quoted political phrase and is apt. The notion that this will be the easiest negotiation becomes more absurd as the complexity of leaving the EU becomes apparent. Pragmatic leavers and remainers increasingly recognise that initial positions are neither sustainable nor credible, as the evidence suggests they will not work for our country or be agreed by the EU. In order to move forward and find the solutions to this most complex of tasks we need to come together, not as Brexiters or remainers, but as pragmatists working in the national interest. If there is an option outside of the EU that works for our citizens and protects our economy, we must put past allegiances aside and unite the country. That\u2019s why I believe we should pursue the Efta/EEA solution, which would protect the economy, jobs and businesses. Companies are rightly concerned about the uncertainty they face and the potential for costly non-tariff barriers to their trade with the EU. Many of these problems would be solved by remaining in the EEA, as this would continue current arrangements and there would be no need to prove regulatory compliance. By joining Efta/EEA, the UK would still be leaving the EU, but in an incremental way. If Efta/EEA was an appropriate stepping stone as the UK and others joined the EU, surely it could be the same as the UK leaves? Radical change is risky, especially with something as untested as leaving the EU. Of course, there would also need to be a frictionless customs agreement or partnership to protect our economy. The complexity of negotiating such an agreement or partnership is evident and shows the need for a period of extension to our current arrangements until new ones can be proved workable. The technology being talked about is untested and it is not clear whether it even exists. We should always aim to streamline customs procedures to cut red tape for businesses, but we must be realistic about how quickly new systems can be introduced. Politicians need to find a solution that creates certainty for industry. No one will get all they want. To my Brexiter friends I say, we are leaving the EU and let\u2019s make sure we protect the UK\u2019s economic interests as we do. To my remain colleagues I say, let\u2019s respect the referendum by ditching the political aspects of the EU so we can retain the economic benefits \u2013 going back to the common market, which was a proud achievement of the Thatcher government. It is time to recognise that a decision and a plan is required; it is time to put aside ideology and embrace pragmatism. Some have called me a rebel and a mutineer for advocating this compromise. The reality is I am an economic pragmatist and pro-business. The pro-business option must triumph if jobs and our economy are to thrive. We are leaving the EU on 29 March next year. We are leaving its political institutions but we must accept compromise to ensure UK economic interests are pre-eminent. The British political class has always had the ability to put aside ideology in a crisis, reach a consensus and act in the national interest. I believe this is possible now. The Efta/EEA option is supported by politicians as different as Anna Soubry and Daniel Hannan. But we need more supporters. Brexit is the biggest change in British politics for a generation and we must rise to the challenge.
