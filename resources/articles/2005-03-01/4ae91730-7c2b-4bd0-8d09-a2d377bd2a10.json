The Debt Arrangement Scheme (DAS), announced last November by the Scottish Executive, will be based in Citizens' Advice Bureaux or Money Advice Scotland centres, enabling them to work together under the banner of the Matrics project to arrange out of court repayment programmes. DAS comprises a single regular payment made to an approved payments distributor for as long as it takes to repay the outstanding debts - usually five to 10 years. The scheme does not compel creditors to freeze or cancel debts, but if debtors keep to their agreed payments, creditors cannot carry out enforcement action against them. Debtors may be required to sell assets, though not their house or certain goods and furniture. Their access to further credit will be restricted. A spokesman for Citizens Advice Scotland says that one factor behind the DAS launch was to combat the negative publicity surround ing repossessions. 'These are a peculiarly Scottish example of diligence, whereby a debtor's household belongings could be crudely priced and sold off to pay their debts. It tended to be the poorest, who could usually only access credit on the most expensive terms, who suffered the indignity of these sales, mainly for unpaid council tax.' All of an applicant's creditors must consent to a DAS. However they will be deemed to have done so if they do not respond within 21 days of being notified, and even if they do not agree, the DAS administrator may rule that the scheme should go ahead. Yvonne Gallagher, chief executive of Money Advice Scotland and one of the joint managers of Matrics, says there are no financial limits, but clients must have more than one debt. 'The applicant must also have surplus income to distribute,' she says. 'This is another option for those with multiple debts.' She adds that almost 200 money advisers have undertaken training for the scheme. Many of those that are approved are likely to be CAS workers. CAS chief executive Kaliani Lyle says: 'Because a debtor will make only one payment, there is a greater likelihood of success compared with existing voluntary agreements. The scheme should also stop harassment of debtors.' However, she warns that without a compulsion on creditors to freeze interest, the scheme could debar those on very low incomes. 'It will not be suitable for those who don't have enough spare cash to distribute a meaningful amount to multiple creditors. The very limited access to credit allowed under the scheme may also cause problems depending on the length of the payment programme.' Advisers at the Consumer Credit Counselling Service will also be trained in offering DAS to its clients. Spokesman Frances Walker says: 'The scheme, apart from the time limits set, is similar to ours, but we want to offer our clients the whole range of services.' The DAS is only available in Scotland, but similar moves are being made in Westminster. Last year the Department of Constitutional Affairs issued a consultation document entitled 'A Choice of Paths'. It sought views on measures such as the introduction of debt relief administered by the Insolvency Service for people who could not repay their debts, enforcement restriction orders to provide temporary relief for those who could pay but were unable to meet short- to medium-term commitments, and the strengthening of private and voluntary sector repayment schemes so that reluctant creditors would be obliged to participate if the majority were in favour. The consultation ended last October and a report is due in March. Walker adds: 'The DTI is also driving a scheme where there would be a single point of contact for those in debt. We want to ensure that people know where to turn rather than going to the fee-chargers.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
