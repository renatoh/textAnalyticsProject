Their amalgam of limited government, patriotism, rule of law and free markets is in retrograde. On the right, there are those who now yearn for a soul-filled state driven by \u201corder, continuity, and social cohesion\u201d and who demand that individual autonomy take a back seat in an ersatz Eden. On the left, socialism, political correctness and identity politics are cudgels for beating the benighted into submission, winning professorial tenure and growing the Leviathan of government. For both groupings, \u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness\u201d and the resulting right to be left alone are at best debatable propositions. Enter George Will\u2019s latest book, a bracing response to progressivism, \u201ccompassionate\u201d conservatism and neo-Caesarism. In the eyes of Will, a self-described \u201camiable atheist\u201d, rights precede government and are a bounty bestowed by the \u201cLaws of Nature and of Nature\u2019s God\u201d, to quote the Declaration of Independence. They do not emanate from the state, nor are they conferred by majorities. Will, a columnist at the Washington Post and former panelist at ABC and Fox, now regularly appears on MSNBC. That says plenty about the state of 1980s Reaganism. It is no longer the religion of the party faithful, a reality of which Will is acutely aware but which he refuses to embrace as his own. As Will recently explained, \u201cYou may notice that in my book the name Donald Trump doesn\u2019t appear \u2026 Neither does the name of Charlemagne or Doris Day or Humphrey Bogart. None of them have anything to do with conservatism.\u201d Many would beg to differ, especially the president and his minions. Will has ceased to be a member of the GOP, which he brands a personality cult. The Conservative Sensibility, a 640-page tome, focuses on America\u2019s origins and development. Will happily observes that John Locke was a muse to Thomas Jefferson\u2019s Declaration of Independence and to James Madison and his constitution. As Will frames things: \u201cThe constitution is John Locke\u2019s political philosophy translated into institutional architecture.\u201d At that moment, the Word was made marble and given the force of law. By that same measure, when it comes to the civil war Will is a unionist to his core and an ardent fan of Abraham Lincoln. It is Lincoln\u2019s fealty to America\u2019s founders and foundational documents that enshrines him in Will\u2019s pantheon. On that score, the book opens with an excerpt from a speech Lincoln delivered in 1838. In Will\u2019s words: \u201cLincoln\u2019s greatness was commensurate with that of the founders because his overarching purpose was to reconnect the nation with the founders\u201d and their \u201cnatural rights tradition\u201d. For Will, as for Lincoln, the American experiment is about a certain July day in 1776 and what came next. Will captures Lincoln weeks before he is to assume the presidency, saying: \u201cI have never had a feeling politically that did not spring from sentiments embodied by the Declaration of Independence.\u201d The bright line running from that document to Lincoln conferred a legitimacy on his decision to keep the nation together at a bloody cost. In the end, the horrors of slavery ran counter to the spirit of Jefferson\u2019s best-known work, even if Jefferson was a slaveholder. The grandson of a Lutheran minister, Will looks back at history but is not mired there. He relishes social and technical dynamism and the grenade hurled by Charles Darwin. On the other hand, he has a bone to pick with Woodrow Wilson, progressivism, utopianism and majoritarianism. Will finds Wilson\u2019s belief in the malleability of human nature to run counter to reality, his missionary zeal to be overbearing and self-defeating, and his utopianism more harmful than good. In Will\u2019s view, increased inputs do not necessarily lead to greater or better outcomes. Nor do majorities necessarily deliver wisdom. Will peruses the 20th century and observes that government\u2019s failures rival if not exceed its successes. He also recalls progressivism\u2019s early affinity for eugenics. As a matter of policy and preference, Will puts a premium on personal autonomy, and that places him directly at odds with the arc of government over the past century. According to The Conservative Sensibility, the supreme court got it right in its 1905 decision in Lochner, which struck down a New York law that set a legal maximum on the number of hours in the workplace as an unconstitutional encroachment on the right to contract. The court again reached the correct conclusion in 2003 when it ruled in Lawrence that Texas\u2019s sodomy statute violated the constitution\u2019s guarantee of due process \u2013 over a dissent by Antonin Scalia. Will argues that \u201cScalia, consistent in his majoritarianism, was as wrong about Lawrence as he was about Lochner.\u201d In light of Justice Clarence Thomas recently taking aim at contraception in Box, an unsuccessful challenge to Indiana\u2019s abortion laws, it is unlikely the debate over privacy and the reach of government will end any time before the 2020 elections. If ever. For Will, the political is not reflexively the personal. Nor is it driven by the urge to \u201cown the libs\u201d. Among other things, The Conservative Sensibility brims with admiration for the late Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a Democrat who served in the Nixon and Ford administrations and in the Senate. Will does not predict what comes next. But it is also safe to say that America, the Republican party and conservatism are all in flux. The GOP is no longer home to John Cheever\u2019s world and aspirational America. In 2018, suburban moms flipped the House. Paint Greenwich and Rye reliably blue. These days, fewer than three in 10 Republicans are white voters with a BA or better. Instead, nearly 60% of the party\u2019s support comes from whites without a four-year degree. Even after Trump leaves office, don\u2019t expect Will\u2019s brand of conservatism to find a warm welcome in what once was the Party of Lincoln. To be sure, America is poorer for that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
