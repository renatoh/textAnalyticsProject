The Brit award-winning rapper, 25, said his friends had been targeted by security at the event in Mayrhofen, Austria, on Thursday looking for someone carrying a weapon, \u201cdespite no one [in their party] fitting the description\u201d. Stormzy apologised to his fans but said he took the \u201cdrastic steps\u201d to make a point about racism and racial profiling. \u201cMy sincerest apologies to anyone who travelled all that way to watch me perform. I\u2019m genuinely upset that you\u2019ve wasted your time and money and that burns me more than you\u2019d know,\u201d he wrote on Instagram. \u201cThe last ever thing I wanna do is let down anyone who\u2019s taken time out to support me. So please hear me out, I too would be fuming if I travelled and spent money to go and watch an artist and they pull out last minute. \u201cHowever, if these are the drastic steps that I need to take to make a point against racism and racial profiling, then trust me I\u2019m taking it.\u201d He said his manager and friends who had travelled to the festival were \u201cracially profiled, targeted and aggressively handled because they (security) had \u2018reason to believe someone was carrying a weapon\u2019\u201d. He added: \u201cThe security targeted them (despite no one fitting the description), were physically aggressive when handling them and there\u2019s been no effort from the festival to actually deal and address the problem.\u201d A spokesperson for the festival said they were \u201cdeeply saddened\u201d by Stormzy\u2019s decision but their staff had acted \u201cin accordance with protocol\u201d. The spokesperson said: \u201cSnowbombing\u2019s security were alerted to the possibility that an individual at the festival was allegedly carrying a weapon. In accordance with protocol, a small number of attendees, including Stormzy\u2019s manager, were escorted to the nearest exit, searched and no weapon was found. \u201cStormzy\u2019s management were unhappy with the manner by which this took place and as a result Stormzy will no longer be performing.\u201d The festival, which combines snow sports with a mix of musical styles, features Fatboy Slim and Chase &amp; Status on its line-up this year. It is not the first time the artist, who is one of the headliners at this year\u2019s Glastonbury festival, has spoken out against instances of racism. In August 2017, he attacked the Met police for publicly linking a drugs bust in south-east London to that year\u2019s Notting Hill Carnival. The raid took place shortly before the event, although about 10 miles away. \u201cHow many drugs did you lot seize in the run-up to Glastonbury or we only doing tweets like this for black events?\u201d he wrote on Twitter, in response to Scotland Yard\u2019s tweet. That January, Stormzy complained that police officers had broken down the door of his Chelsea flat after receiving reports of a suspected burglary, only to find him sleeping in his own home. And, in an interview that March, he said he had regularly been stopped by police officers near his south London family home. \u201c[It stopped] when I stopped walking around on the streets. But now I have a nice car, so I get pulled over instead,\u201d he told Hunger."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
