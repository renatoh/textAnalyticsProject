Hayward will stop short of a formal apology since there are a number of outstanding US lawsuits relating to the blast. But the new boss is keen to make a fresh start and to build bridges in the US after the departure last week of former supremo Lord Browne, who resigned following revelations that he lied about how he met former his lover, Jeff Chevalier. Under Browne, the company was heavily criticised for failures in its safety culture and for cost cutting that could have led to the 2005 Texas explosion, which killed 15 people and injured 180. Browne who was revered earlier in his career at BP, now fears the oil giant may ditch the slogan, 'Beyond Petroleum', because of it is associated with him. He is expected to make a graceful exit from his role as a non-executive director of investment bank Goldman Sachs. His hope of becoming chairman of private equity group Apax Partners is also likely to come to nothing, although the firm is backing him to remain in a lesser position as chairman of its advisory board. On Wednesday, he is expected to give evidence to US lawyer Brent Coon, which represents BP workers involved in the Texas blast."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
