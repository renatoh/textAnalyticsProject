A keen sportswoman in her youth, Wright resolved to target the London Paralympics a few months after having a child, Oscar. \"I had my son and after that I thought I needed a competitive environment again. I had quite a high-stress job before I lost my legs and I felt I wanted to get that competitive edge back and that ambition back,\" she said. She attended a Paralympic potential day at Stoke Mandeville and tried a range of sports. Wright had an aptitude for wheelchair tennis but plumped for sitting volleyball because she \"felt like more of a team player than an individual\". There was no British sitting-volleyball team at Beijing, so the squad of players featured in an upcoming Channel 4 documentary, Best of British, were forced to start from scratch in a fast-paced and unforgiving sport. \"What's quite unique about the team is the fact we've all had established lives before, we haven't all been playing the sport since we were 13 or 14. We all have very different lives and we're all trying to balance it,\" says Wright. \"Anyone who meets us comes away saying what a tight-knit team we are. I don't think I'd be able to deal with the stresses and challenges we have now without the rest of the team.\" The squad deal with those pressures with humour that is, at times, of the blackest kind. \"I don't think I would have been able to get through the last six years if it wasn't for humour. We use it as a way of learning about each other's disabilities. Depending on your disability, you play in a very different way and move in a very different way,\" she says. Having resolved to compete credibly in London next year, they have been on a steep learning curve. But progress has been swift, says Wright: \"Just to see how much we've improved is amazing. It's all about credibility and showing we can compete.\" Training up to 25 hours a week and travelling the world to compete \u2013 she had just returned from Hungary and was about to head for Ukraine \u2013 are stresses familiar to any elite. \"I don't really see Nick, my husband, at all. I miss so many celebrations it's untrue. There are hard choices to be made. We went to the world championships last year and, bizarrely, it was on 7 July. There are lots of coincidences regarding the Olympics and losing my legs. I missed my son's first birthday, but he will have plenty more. It was tough, but it's a choice I made.\" Nor is Wright under any illusions about the scale of the task ahead, first in convincing the BPA [British Paralympic Association] that they can put up a credible performance and second in making the team. \"The main thing is for people to realise that Paralympic sport is absolutely as serious as Olympic sport. It's not about disabled people saying: 'Oh well, I'll give it a go'. It's about someone who is striving to be an elite athlete but at the same time dealing with something else in their personal lives.\" The 7 July attacks, which would have claimed Wright's life were it not for the assistance of an off-duty police officer, brought terror to London less than 24 hours after the city had won the right to host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games. One of the myriad mundane curiosities that caused Wright to be on that Circle Line train on 7 July 2005 was that she was later than usual because she had been out to a client's party the night before amid a celebratory atmosphere. \"For me as a Londoner, to go back to my hometown after leaving it on such a negative, someone is trying to tell me something, I think. If I do end up going next year \u2013 which I will \u2013 for me it will be like I've gone full circle. From wondering how I was going to get tickets for the Olympics the day before [it happened] \u2013 in a weird twist of fate I might actually be taking part. I can't not attach meaning to that. I can't ignore that. Maybe this is why I was on that Tube that day and I survived.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
