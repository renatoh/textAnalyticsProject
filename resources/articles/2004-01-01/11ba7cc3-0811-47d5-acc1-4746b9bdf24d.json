Kevin Keegan has been searching for a goalkeeper, because former England No1 David Seaman has been troubled by injuries and Nicky Weaver is on the long-term casualty list. \"David James is a tremendous acquisition,\" said Keegan. \"We have been looking to strengthen the goalkeeping position and to secure the England number one is terrific news.\" James, who attended a meeting with the Football Association in Manchester on behalf of the England players yesterday, was reportedly at City's training ground today. Tonight West Ham announced a fee has been agreed for the player, who is set for a medical tomorrow. A statement from West Ham said: \"David has been given permission to discuss personal terms with Kevin Keegan and, providing they are concluded the deal will be finalised without delay. \"The club would like to thank David for his loyalty and service.\" By way of explanation for James's departure, West Ham boss Alan Pardew had this to say: \"While you never like to see a player of David's quality leave your club this is a move which, when you look at the bigger picture, is suitable for all parties. \"From our point of view, and I feel sure our supporters will understand this, we had to bring in some revenue to reinvest in the playing staff before it was too late. I was not prepared to just shrug my shoulders and let things drift along and positive action had to be taken to move things forward.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
