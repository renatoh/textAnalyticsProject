They spent nearly every weekend together at Trump\u2019s Florida resort Mar-a-Lago, and was even present for Trump\u2019s first date with wife Melania and later attended their wedding. But the version of Trump he now sees on the campaign trail is someone Simmons no longer recognizes. Appearing on a new episode of Politics for Humans, a podcast hosted by Guardian US political reporter Sabrina Siddiqui, Simmons criticized the Republican presidential nominee as preying on ignorance to fuel a campaign \u201cof hate\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s scary \u2013 you don\u2019t want him to be president, for God\u2019s sake,\u201d Simmons said, adding that Trump was \u201ca grudge carrier\u201d and the two no longer speak. \u201cHe don\u2019t talk to me after I said I\u2019d rather Kim Kardashian be president.\u201d Simmons, a music industry mogul who has also emerged as a prominent activist, has taken particular issue with Trump\u2019s inflammatory rhetoric against Muslims. Trump has repeatedly campaigned on banning all Muslim immigration to the US, called for shutting down mosques in America and most recently picked a fight with the Muslim parents of a fallen Iraq War hero. But years ago, Simmons said Trump accompanied him to a meeting with Muslim leaders at the Islamic Cultural Center of New York, the city\u2019s largest mosque, and was amenable to engaging with the community. \u201cHe was very kind and that was the end of it,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cBut years later, this fire has come up.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s fuelled a lot of hate and a lot of people are ignorant, and he\u2019s helped to promote that ignorance.\u201d Simmons recently launched a campaign, Muslims Speaking Out, which aims to counter Islamophobia in the US by drawing a distinction between terrorists and the greater Muslim community. Simmons formed the initiative through The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding, a not-for-profit organization he chairs that seeks to improve relations between ethnic and religious communities. In the Politics for Humans podcast, which examines the Black Lives Matter movement and social justice, Simmons also reflected on his experience as a black male and encounters with law enforcement. \u201cAs a young person, I was always afraid of the police, and I have had experiences of being mistreated and yelled at and talked down to,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cI\u2019ve always been afraid when I see them coming.\u201d Even in recent years, Simmons said, he has been pulled over for routine traffic stops and was verbally abused by one police officer who did not immediately recognize him. The cop changed his demeanor when he saw Simmons\u2019 license, but the producer noted that other people of color who are not public figures lack the means to push back against discrimination. \u201cIf you\u2019re powerless and you\u2019re black, you don\u2019t mean anything,\u201d Simmons said. \u201cRight now, 60 or 70 kids [are] getting shot in Chicago this weekend, and if one little girl in Brooklyn is missing named Becky, they\u2019ll look for her for six months on TV.\u201d \u201cSo black lives don\u2019t matter. That\u2019s a reality.\u201d Listen to the podcast here:"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
