Has anything changed? Well, Strong and Prosperous Communities, last week's white paper on English local government, certainly made some encouraging noises. Ruth Kelly, the local government and communities secretary, boldly insisted that it set out \"how we intend to achieve ... rebalancing between central government, local government and local people\". It advocated reformed, but barely stronger, community and city governance. Ministers would allow town halls to set up urban and rural parish councils. On the other hand, councils would be told to choose one of three options for reform: a directly elected mayor (only 12 cities and towns outside London have one); a cabinet leader put forward for direct election; or no change from now, apart from councillors choosing a leader for a fixed, four-year term. On the bigger, strategic issues - namely, giving cities and conurbations some of the powers enjoyed by London's mayor, Ken Livingstone - the white paper fell dismally short of expectations. In the words of Birmingham city council's leader, Mike Whitby, it \"focused on sterile governance issues ... without devolving more power from London, and increasing local autonomy ... as promised.\" England's big conurbations desperately need stronger powers - particularly over transport, large-scale planning, and skills - to compete with an increasingly powerful London and to help rebalance England's lop-sided economy, still tilting ominously southwards. They need a hand up, not necessarily a hand-out. That means the government learning to let go and allowing cities and/or conurbations some of the financial freedom enjoyed by, say, mayors and civic leaders in continental Europe and in the US. But while Livingstone is being given more power, the white paper merely fudges the issue elsewhere. Kelly's department has achieved only limited buy-in from the Treasury, which has little enthusiasm for stronger conurbations. Gordon Brown has his own agenda; optimists in local government vainly hope he will unveil a radical, devolutionary agenda in his first 100 days as prime minister. So, in many respects, last week's document is only a holding exercise. Meanwhile, local government, which consumes at least a quarter of public spending and provides most of the public services used by voters, staggers on, with the white paper ignoring the fragile, and limited financial base of town and county halls because another report, from Sir Michael Lyons, is due to address this issue next month. But there could be action on at least one important front. The Department for Transport will soon propose a package of reforms for six passenger transport authorities - the public bodies that subsidise some bus services in major conurbations and run undertakings such as the Tyne and Wear Metro - to \"strengthen leadership\" and adopt a \"more coherent approach\" to transport in big cities. If that means bus re-regulation, and Transport for London-style bodies elsewhere in England, it will require legislation. We will have to await local government and transport legislation to discover whether Whitehall has learned that leadership and policy coherence can often be managed at a local level. Don't hold your breath. \u00b7 Peter Hetherington writes on regeneration and community affairs \u00b7 Any comments on this article?
