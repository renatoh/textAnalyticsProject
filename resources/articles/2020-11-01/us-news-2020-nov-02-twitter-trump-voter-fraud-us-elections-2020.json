Mere hours before election day, Trump tweeted without merit that the decision last week leaving in place, for now, a state supreme court decision allowing elections officials to count ballots that arrive up to three days after election day \u201cwill allow rampant and unchecked cheating\u201d. That decision, Trump said, \u201cwill induce violence in the streets\u201d. Twitter added a disclaimer to Trump\u2019s tweet, saying that its content was \u201cdisputed\u201d and \u201cmight be misleading\u201d. \u201cWe placed a warning on the Tweet you referenced for making a potentially misleading claim about an election,\u201d a Twitter spokesperson said. \u201cThis action is in line with our Civic Integrity Policy, and as is standard with this warning, we will significantly restrict engagements on this Tweet.\u201d The social media platform has been removing tweets that contain \u201cfalse or misleading information intended to undermine public confidence in an election or other civic process\u201d, \u201cdisputed claims\u201d that could undermine faith in the process, and \u201cmisleading claims\u201d about the outcome of an election. It also doesn\u2019t allow retweets of such posts. Users may quote-tweet some of them to add context. In September, Twitter put a \u201cpublic interest\u201d notice on another Trump tweet that shared misinformation about voting. Both Trump and Biden campaigned in Pennsylvania on Monday, indicating the pivotal role of the state in this election. Recent polls have shown Biden leading in the state by an average of about 5 points. Trump, however, has been laying the groundwork to fight election results in the courts. \u201cAs soon as that election is over, we\u2019re going in with our lawyers,\u201d Trump told supporters in North Carolina recently. \u201cBut we don\u2019t want to have Pennsylvania, where you have a political governor, a very partisan guy \u2026 We don\u2019t want to be in a position where he\u2019s allowed to, every day, watch ballots come in. \u2018Gee, if we could only find 10,000 more ballots\u2019,\u201d Trump said. The state\u2019s governor, Tom Wolf, responded on Monday to the president\u2019s comments baselessly implying that Wolf and other Democratic governors were engaged in \u201ccheating\u201d and that Trump and his supporters were \u201cwatching\u201d them. \u201cPennsylvanians will not be intimidated,\u201d Wolf said. \u201cYou can watch us count every vote and have a fair election.\u201d Voter fraud is extremely rare. It is the policy \u2013 not \u201cunchecked cheating\u201d \u2013 of several states to count ballots that arrive after election day \u2013with specific rules varying."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
