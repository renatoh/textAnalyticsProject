It's going to be a tricky year. I made an early start on my new year's resolutions. It quickly became clear there are no easy solutions. To be green or not to be green? Do we ignore global warming for a while because now that the economy has collapsed the planet is not of much use to us anyway until we can afford to live in it again? But what if the economy sorts itself out sooner than anticipated? We will feel really hard done by if we suddenly find ourselves flush with cash again and nowhere to spend it because all the stores are submerged under water. So is now a good time to actually listen to what the scientists and Al Gore have been telling us and make a concerted effort to fix both the economy and the environment simultaneously? This seems like an awful lot of hard work so it's not surprising many people are focusing on their wallets for the time being. Which brings me to the next dilemma - To spend or not to spend? Do we store the few dollars, pounds or euros we have left under our mattresses until the economy starts to function again, or do we have to take a chance and spend our remaining cash with gusto to stimulate the economy, otherwise it might never function again? If we do choose the spending option it gets more complicated. Should we be buying imports from countries like India and China so that their economies stay intact and there is somewhere for us to emigrate to if things really go downhill at home? Or do we hope for the best and just buy domestically-made goods? (That is assuming that goods are still being made domestically.) I can't help thinking that we could really use those trillions of dollars now that are being spent on the wars on terror. Which brings me to the next dilemma - To stay the course or not to stay the course? Do we - as in, the US - stay the course in Iraq, where innocent Iraqis, who did not attack us on 9/11 and who did not have weapons of mass destruction, continue to be killed? Or do we bail out now and cut our losses so no more lives are lost, including the lives of American and British soldiers? If we do bail out now we risk letting Saddam-style order be restored. Allegedly one of the reasons we invaded Iraq was to put an end to Saddam-style order. We - as in, Nato - face the same dilemma in Afghanistan where we are fighting the Taliban, who do seem pretty evil and who are not at all nice to their own people, particularly women. But it does seem wrong that innocent Afghanis are getting caught in the cross fire. They have enough problems to be getting on with and, as in Iraq, more and more American and British soldiers are getting killed in this war that we don't seem to be winning. (As if war can have a winner.) Which brings me to the biggest dilemma of all - To hold accountable or not to hold accountable? Should we instigate Hague-style tribunals to hold George Bush and Dick Cheney accountable for their myriad of sins during their eight-year reign of error, including wreaking havoc on the environment, the economy, and the military, for making torture acceptable again, and for sanctioning the slaughter of thousands of people? If we do make them stand trial then we have to relive the horrors of the last eight years for the next eight years. So should we instead just let bygones be bygones and send them off to Guantanamo Bay to enjoy their retirement? By Bush and Cheney's own accounts the living conditions at this facility are excellent and there is absolutely no chance that they will be tortured. These are all exhausting decisions. I wish it was 2000 again, when all we had to worry about was whether or not it was wrong for the US President to have a blow job in the Oval Office. I am going to sit it out till 2010, I think. Hopefully by then President Obama will have restored some order."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
