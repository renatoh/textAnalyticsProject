Kevin Andrews publicly contradicted the prime minister by claiming he promised funding for both sides, but Warren Entsch has warned funding would contribute to \u201cdivisive rhetoric\u201d on an issue on which voters had already made up their minds. Coalition proponents of same-sex marriage have said that keeping costs down is vital to achieve support for the popular vote, which looks likely to be blocked by an alliance of Labor, the Greens and Nick Xenophon Team, in part due to its cost. On Sunday, the Anglican archbishop of Sydney and the Australian Christian Lobby said the prime minister had promised both campaigns would be publicly funded, with the suggestion that $10m for each side would be in line with funding for the republic referendum. Speaking on ABC radio on Monday, Coalition senator Eric Abetz said: \u201cThis idea that somehow you can have a proper plebiscite without funding for the yes and no cases would not be the sort of plebiscite that was envisaged by the partyroom when we decided on it.\u201d Abetz said public funding was a decision for the partyroom, not cabinet alone, and urged Turnbull not to \u201csteamroll\u201d the views of the partyroom. Speaking on his way into parliament, Andrews said: \u201cIf there\u2019s a plebiscite, there ought to be the opportunity for both cases to be put fairly to the Australian people.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s how we run referenda. This is a time honoured way in which we\u2019ve conducted these sorts of public discussions in Australia for over a century now.\u201d Andrews said Turnbull had \u201cindicated that there would be some funding for the yes and no campaign\u201d. \u201cI think it is important that there is funding so that when Australians go to the ballot box, in terms of making a vote on this issue, yes or no, they are well informed about it,\u201d he said. On Monday Entsch said he was \u201cabsolutely\u201d opposed to public funding for the plebiscite. \u201cAny suggestion [public funding] was a decision or commitment made in the partyroom is absolutely wrong,\u201d he told ABC radio. He said the six-hour partyroom debate that settled on the plebiscite as a compromise without a formal vote did not even discuss public funding. Entsch noted that only the side opposed to same-sex marriage was calling for taxpayer funds. Australian Marriage Equality and other yes campaigners oppose public funds being spent to argue against the right to marry, and trust their own fundraising will be superior to the no case. Entsch said there had already been so much public debate on same-sex marriage \u201cyou\u2019d have to be living on another planet not to already [have] set up your own opinion on this\u201d. \u201cWhy do we need to continue to fund more divisive rhetoric on an issue that overwhelmingly the people have already made up their mind?\u201d Entsch said fact sheets would be distributed explaining the change, but they would not include the \u201cemotional rhetoric\u201d of either side. \u201cIf you want to continue to influence people or educate people, pass the hat around, raise your money that way.\u201d On Monday former prime minister Tony Abbott said the plebiscite was \u201cvery important because marriage is a very personal thing\u201d. \u201cIf it is going to be decided by the public \u2013 as it should \u2013 obviously there needs to be proper campaigns, and the question of funding will be dealt with by the partyroom in coming weeks.\u201d Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman told Sky News that \u201cone of the concerns that people raise with me about a plebiscite is the cost of a national ballot\u201d. \u201cI think it\u2019s important we try to do everything we can to restrain the cost of the plebiscite,\u201d he said. At a press conference on Sunday Turnbull said public funding would be a matter for cabinet and the partyroom, but if funding were provided it would be \u201cscrupulously equal and fair as between the yes case and the no case\u201d. Labor spokeswoman Terri Butler has warned the government not to publicly fund a campaign arguing \u201cthat human rights should not be extended to a minority\u201d. On Monday Labor and a separate crossbench group were due to introduce separate private members bills on same-sex marriage, but neither was likely to be debated or voted on unless the government unexpectedly lost procedural votes in the lower house."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
