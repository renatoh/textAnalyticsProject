Since learning Heinze was taken to hospital after Argentina's 4-0 defeat of Costa Rica in the Olympics on Sunday, Ferguson revealed last night he had been desperately trying to get hold of the \u00a36.9m signing, only to discover the defender has not left his mobile number with anyone at the club. Subsequent attempts to contact him via his agent and the Argentinian football authorities have also failed and an exasperated Ferguson was still in the dark about the seriousness of Heinze's injury until he switched on his television yesterday to see him back in the Argentina team. Although initially relieved, Ferguson is livid that Heinze has not contacted his new employers. \"We understand he got an injury but nobody from Argentina has even been in touch,\" said Ferguson, making little attempt to conceal his irritation ahead of tonight's Champions League qualifying tie against Dinamo Bucharest. \"We read that it's a hip injury and that he was taken to hospital, so it was obviously a concern. But we haven't been able to get hold of him.\" Kleberson, another South American who has made an inauspicious start to life at Old Trafford, will make his first appearance of the season tonight and Darren Fletcher also returns to the United midfield for a match they simply dare not lose. Ferguson warned his players against complacency yesterday but, with a 2-1 lead from the first leg in Bucharest, it would be almost unthinkable for the tie to be overturned, particularly after a week of political infighting in the Romanian camp. Dinamo's players threatened to go on strike this week after being fined a week's wages for refusing to go on a five-day training camp, citing fatigue. Manchester United (4-4-1-1, probable): Howard; G Neville, Keane, Silvestre, O'Shea; Fletcher, Djemba-Djemba, Kleberson, Giggs; Scholes; Smith. Dinamo Bucharest (3-4-1-2, probable): Gaev; Ciobotariu, Alistar, Iordache; Irimia, Tames, Margaritescu, Semeghin; Petre; Niculescu, Danciulescu. TV: ITV1, kick-off 8.10pm"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
