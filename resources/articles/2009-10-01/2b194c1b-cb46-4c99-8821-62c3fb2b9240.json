Emile Heskey was the barrier up front, with Wayne Rooney alternately drifting deeper and moving up to support the Aston Villa man. England had their first-choice team and their first-choice formation \u2013 but the best-laid plans ... 2 Tactics How do you cope with the early dismissal of your goalkeeper and the need to sacrifice an outfield player? Capello decided to withdraw Aaron Lennon, his speedy counter-attacker, placing Rooney on the right side of midfield and leaving Heskey isolated in attack. Ukraine seized the initiative and deserved their goal. Would Capello, given the same circumstances, still replace Lennon? As the game progressed Capello needed to tinker and he cleverly changed the mentality. 3 Did it succeed? Almost. The bold introduction of James Milner, for the narrow Steven Gerrard, and the positioning of the full-backs transformed the game, despite England's handicap. In possession Glen Johnson and Ashley Cole pushed into the middle third, joining Carrick and Frank Lampard. This allowed Rooney and Milner to push forward. England defended higher up the field and the nervy Ukrainians lost tempo. 4 Strengths John Terry and Rio Ferdinand coped comfortably in general play. Johnson's pace is a useful strength. The team were compact and kept the ball well in the second period. David James, underworked, made a couple of fine blocks. Most pleasing for Capello would have been the understanding of how to push forward from the back, and play the game further up the field, despite the numerical disadvantage. 5 Weaknesses England were wobbly and unsettled defensively early on. Ferdinand was caught dreaming for the penalty and Cole lacked alertness before the goal. Johnson must work to prevent forwards from drifting into space behind him when play is on the opposite wing. I felt it might have been better to sacrifice Heskey, rather than Lennon. We need more cunning and zip from our main frontman; Rooney's energy up front might have been more beneficial. Milner worked prodigiously and crosses with either foot, but lacks the change of pace of Theo Walcott, say, or Lennon to worry top-class international full-backs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
