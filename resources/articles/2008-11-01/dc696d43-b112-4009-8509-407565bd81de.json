He used his status as the first African-American with a serious chance of winning to his advantage. Yet he presented himself as technocratic, post-racial, cool and in control, always wary of stirring up the emotions and fears of white voters who might otherwise be persuaded to support him. The non-symbolic Obama, the human being, will reassert himself soon enough. The reality of the grim situation that confronts this deeply intelligent but lightly experienced leader will sink in. We've all got a rough ride ahead, and that would be true regardless of who is sworn in as president come January. Today, though, is a day to wallow in symbolism \u2013 to marvel at the fact that this race-haunted country has not just elected a black president, but has given him a mandate the likes of which no Democratic president-elect has received since Lyndon Johnson in 1964. \"My father waited 95 years to see this day happen, and when he called as results came in, I silently thanked God for allowing him to live long enough to cast his vote for the first black man to become president,\" writes Henry Louis Gates Jr for the Root, a webzine aimed at African-American readers. Gates's moving words are reflected in much of the media coverage today. Good thing the newspaper industry isn't quite dead yet; the front pages are a testament to journalism's power to freeze a moment for posterity. I especially like Obama's hometown papers. \"IT'S OBAMA\" proclaims the broadsheet Chicago Tribune, over a huge photo of excited, celebrating African-Americans at Grant Park. The tabloid Sun-Times goes with a full-page, black-and-white portrait of Obama, with a muted \"MR PRESIDENT\" in the lower right corner. Given that slavery is America's original sin, it's interesting that the first African-American to be elected president is biracial and multinational, and someone who is not the descendant of slaves. So, for me, it was just as moving to see Michelle Obama and the Obama girls waving from the podium on television last night, and to watch as members of her extended family mingled with those of her husband's and of Joe and Jill Biden's family. Remember those ridiculous criticisms early in the campaign that Barack Obama was not authentically black enough to appeal to black voters? Well, Michelle Obama's up-from-the-neighbourhoods story should resonate. I'm not a big fan of the idea that the first lady has to serve as a role model. But to the extent that that's a reality, it is both astounding and wonderful that a black woman who is \u2013 yes \u2013 the descendant of slaves has risen to such a position. Of particular poignancy today is Kevin Sack's New York Times report from Albany, Georgia, where the Rev Martin Luther King Jr was once jailed. Sack describes the Reverand Horace Boyd, the 81-year-old pastor of the Shiloh Baptist Church, as Boyd pushes his wife's wheelchair on the way to vote. \"King made the statement that he viewed the Promised Land, won't get there, but somebody will get there, and that day has dawned,\" Boyd told Sack. \"I'm glad that it has.\" John McCain delivered a gracious concession speech last night, returning to the persona we all thought we knew. It was a healing moment. But the sad truth is that McCain and Sarah Palin ran a low and mean campaign based fundamentally on falsehoods, slanderous attacks on Obama's patriotism and subtle appeals to racism. Josh Marshall of Talking Points Memo recently called out the McCain campaign for its \"moral filth\", which is not too strong a phrase. With the possible exception of the first George Bush's flag-waving defeat of Michael Dukakis in 1988, the McCain-Palin effort was the dirtiest campaign since Richard Nixon's re-election campaign in 1972. McCain has forever tarnished his image as someone who was both different from and above politics as usual. This time, though, it didn't work. \"Obama developed out of his life experiences a different understanding of the country, and he had the courage to run for president by offering this vision,\" writes William Greider at the Nation. \"For many Americans, it seemed too much to believe, yet he turned out to be right about us.\" Today is a day beyond politics. It will end soon enough. I'm savouring it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
