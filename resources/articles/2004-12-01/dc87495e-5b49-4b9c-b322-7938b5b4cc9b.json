So if the white stuff is high on your list of priorities for a proper winter walk, think about heading for the mountains. You don't have to strap skis or a board to your feet to enjoy the powder, though some of the trips listed below do entail wearing snow shoes to stop you sinking up to your knees. Fortunately, technological advances mean snowshoes no longer look like tennis racquets, and are much less cumbersome. The terrain is not too difficult to negotiate, though you may have some more energetic days. Inn-to-inn walking tends to be saved for summer, so you will usually be exploring from one base, and therefore not carrying too much gear with you. If you want a mountain backdrop to your walking, there are plenty of options throughout France and all over the Alps. For something more unusual, snowshoeing itineraries to the Rila and Rodopi mountains of Bulgaria have been introduced. In Scandinavia, Finland and Norway are particularly well geared up for winter walking with plenty of well-marked trails. Switzerland A week's snow walking in Achenkirch, Switzerland, with Ramblers' Holidays (01707 331133; ramblersholidays.co.uk), costs from \u00a3460pp including flights, transfers and two-star, half-board guesthouse accommodation.

France Spend three nights in luxury at La Ferme de Montagne (00 33 450 753 679; fermedemontagne.com) in Les Gets, Haute Savoie for \u00a3845pp, including guided snow walks in the Portes de Soleil area, five-star full-board accommodation (with four-course gourmet dinners and afternoon tea), local transfers, use of spa facilities and treatments.

From 29 January, it hosts a Snow and Ice Festival and, with more than 80km of trails, promises some excellent walking (skiers love it too: Seefeld has hosted the Winter Olympics twice).
