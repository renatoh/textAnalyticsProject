The relegation-bound champions are now guaranteed to finish bottom of the Premiership but the prop Joe Marler insists the squad\u2019s Six Nations campaign will be unaffected. Marler\u2019s club Harlequins have been among the more outspoken critics of Saracens\u2019 conduct but, while there remains plenty of banter on the subject, the mood at the team\u2019s Portuguese training base has been more conciliatory. He said: \u201cThe longer those conversations or any sort of resentment towards it goes on will detract from what we are trying to achieve here as an England team. \u201cThere are guys from my club who have been very vocal about it but they are not here and we have got eight weeks to become as close as we can. We did that in Japan and it made a huge difference to the way we performed on the field.\u201d With that objective in mind, Owen Farrell and Mako Vunipola have both invited the entire squad to air any grievances to avoid their Six Nations campaign being adversely affected. \u201cIf you don\u2019t address the elephant in the room it grows,\u201d Marler said. \u201cIt becomes even more awkward so one of the first things to do was come into camp and say: \u2018If anyone has an issue, air it.\u2019 \u201cOwen and Mako stood up and said: \u2018We will be happy to answer any questions and talk about anything that you want to discuss, about any beef you\u2019ve got. There are a couple of sets of [boxing] gloves in the gym as well if people want to go that far. Luckily it hasn\u2019t come to that and it has been parked. We are trying to win a Six Nations. We have got eight weeks to try and make memories and do something special with this team.\u201d Marler , meanwhile, has revealed that the head coach, Eddie Jones, has warned him he needs to up his game if he wishes to retain his place in the squad beyond this tournament. \u201cEddie texted me to ask what my situation was after the World Cup. He asked, \u2018Are you good to go again?\u2019 and I said, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019ll go again.\u2019 So he said: \u2018Right, well you\u2019ll have to pull your finger out then, because other boys are tearing up trees and you ain\u2019t getting any younger.\u2019\u201d He is also having to contend with a new roommate in Tom Curry, whose hyperactive manner is proving a test for the laconic front-rower. \u201cHow I have gone from the geriatric of the group to the guy who just doesn\u2019t sit down or stay still for longer than five minutes? \u201cThis is the only time I have got away from my three kids and they have given me a fourth. If it was described as babysitting I would be sacked immediately because I am not paying attention to him whatsoever. I am trying to avoid him as much as I can.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
