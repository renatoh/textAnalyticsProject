Her brow is free of sweat, her lovely floral print blouse isn't covered in meat juice, and the kitchen surfaces don't resemble a rubbish dump. Something doesn't compute. As children, my sister and I knew not to venture anywhere near the kitchen on a Sunday between 1pm and 3pm, mainly for fear of hearing our mum run through the dictionary of swear words as a hot baking tray of roast potatoes made its way to the carpet tiles. Still, Belinda has time on her hands thanks to the fact that she doesn't have to worry about pesky gravy granules or Oxo cubes \u2013 no, all she need do is eke out some paste, add boiling water and wait for a steaming, disturbingly shiny gravy cow to backflip out of her gravy boat to a soundtrack of \"I like the way you moo\", a reworking of the BodyRockers' club classic I Like The Way (which, FYI, is William and Kate's favourite song). As the cow performs the running man across the table top, however, there's a sudden realisation that the voice intoning \"I like the way you let me squeeze you/I like the way you taste so fine\" doesn't belong to the cow, but to Belinda, who, after years of Stepford Wife-level Sunday roast heroics now has the internal monologue of a gruff man and fantasises about farmyard animals doing gymnastics around her condiments. Poor Belinda. See the ad here"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
