Even Jeremy Paxman - who should know better - is prone to asking the question on University Challenge: \"How do you know that?\" The answer tends to be \"I just do\", but often the person asked scrabbles around in their memory bank and comes up with some implausible reason why they should know a particularly obscure piece of information - \"My Aunty Doris used to keep some in the cellar,\" for example. Or, \"I wrote a book on it once.\" I like to think I am above such inanities, and I was dismayed therefore to find myself asking the same question last Monday. We were at the Oval at the time, watching the England cricket team cruise to a famous and thoroughly enjoyable victory over South Africa. I am not normally in the habit of bunking off work, but since this victory was about as unlikely as a giant asteroid hitting Milton Keynes, normal rules did not apply. And besides, a crossword setter (whose \"eminence\", I discover, is a matter of some debate) had invited me. So it was that during the lunch break we had a go at the Audreus puzzle in that morning's Guardian. There were five of us in the group, and since this was a social occasion we took it in turns, with each person completing one clue and then passing the puzzle on to the next. A pattern soon emerged: everyone was doing the relatively easy stuff around the edges and avoiding the long anagram that formed the spine of the puzzle: \"You'll cap GIs anyhow by having beautiful buttocks (11).\" Well, almost everyone. The setter's girlfriend had a secretive smile as she watched us each in turn struggle with what was obviously an anagram - but without an obvious answer. Eventually, when the rest of us had given up, she filled in the solution. It was \"callipygous\". \"But how do you know that it means 'having beautiful buttocks'?\" I asked. \"Because I do,\" she replied sweetly. \"She does,\" said the setter knowledgeably. \ufffd Sandy Balfour. \u00b7 Sandy Balfour is the author of Pretty Girl in Crimson Rose (8) published by Atlantic Books"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
