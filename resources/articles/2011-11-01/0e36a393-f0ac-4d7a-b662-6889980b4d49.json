Why did you not ask to review the Goodman file? 2 Why did you not ask to see Michael Silverleaf's opinion of June 2008 which said there was \"a culture of illegal information access\" at the News of the World after you were briefed on it orally? 3 Do you believe internal evidence about phone hacking such as the Goodman letter and the Silverleaf opinion was withheld from you? And by whom? 4 Why do you maintain you were not told about the \"for Neville\" email when both Colin Myler and Tom Crone say it was the sole reason for asking you to authorise the six-figure settlement of the Gordon Taylor case? 5 Why did you not ask why Mulcaire had admitted in court to hacking people such as Elle MacPherson and Simon Hughes who would not have been of interest to Goodman who was put on trial with him? Did those targets not suggest to you that hacking may be more widespread? 6 What were you told were the reasons for reaching a \u00a31m settlement with Max Clifford in March 2010? Did you ask why it was necessary to settle that case. 7 When the Guardian first reported in July 2009 that \"thousands\" of mobile phones had been targeted, News International responded with an aggressive denial of the allegations. Why did you allow News International to make that statement? 8 Why were NI employees allowed to ask a private investigator to conduct surveillance of the lawyers bringing cases against your company? Why did you not know about a practice you say you do not condone? 9 Did you authorise the severance payment for Rebekah Brooks, which is understood to be in excess of \u00a31.7m? Why do executives who resign and are subsequently arrested deemed worthy of a severance payment? 10 Do you believe you were sufficiently curious about what was going on at the company you ran? Does this make you a fit and proper person to run a media company?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
