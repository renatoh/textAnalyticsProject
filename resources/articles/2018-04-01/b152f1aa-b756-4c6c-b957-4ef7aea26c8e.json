Alongside 15 others, including Ed Miliband, Doreen Lawrence and those from the Grenfell community, I have joined the commission and will spend the next few months hearing from social tenants about their experiences, setting out necessary changes and scrutinising the role the sector could play in easing Britain\u2019s housing crisis. I am the first to admit that I\u2019m an unlikely social housing commissioner. I have never lived in social housing. Even during my childhood, my parents turned to our wider family to support us during tough times. Social housing, meanwhile, was for people who had hit rock bottom and had nowhere to turn for help. Growing up, I was fortunate enough to seize the opportunities provided by social mobility. I was lucky that, as a young lawyer in Yorkshire, I was able to buy my first home \u2013 for around twice my salary. Yes, interest rates were high 25 years ago and I still had to work hard, but it didn\u2019t occur to me that I wouldn\u2019t be able to buy my own home. Now I meet young solicitors who, even with a promising career, know the prospect of owning their own home seems impossible. I used to assume that the market would always provide for people who worked hard, that any kinks in the housing market would iron themselves out in the end. Of course, a safety net would always be necessary for some, yet for the majority hard work would pay off and social housing would be as irrelevant as it had been to me. Housing would be a private matter, not a government concern. Now, this basic social contract is broken. Socially mobile young people find that working hard isn\u2019t enough unless they have help from the bank of mum and dad. And that safety net for people at the bottom? It\u2019s looking ever more stretched as more and more people need help. It\u2019s clear that the housing market is fundamentally broken. Tweaks by successive governments have not rectified this and even the current Conservative government has published a white paper on the \u201cbroken housing market\u201d. That\u2019s because the effects are being felt widely, from the growing numbers of people being made homeless, to young people stuck in expensive and insecure private rents, despairing of ever finding a way out. Politicians cannot look young people in the eyes and honestly tell them that everything will be OK if they just work hard. Our broken housing market has become a major barrier to social mobility. This is an intolerable situation and demands politicians of all hues respond. Shelter\u2019s commission will consider the role in which social housing, and government more generally, should provide an alternative. I start this process with a genuinely open mind. I admit that I have been innately sceptical of large-scale social housing. I\u2019ve always seen it as a safety net, but a worsening housing crisis forces us to ask whether that safety net needs to be stretched far wider. Or, with the market no longer providing a housing ladder, does a wider group of people need to use social housing as a stepping stone? Shelter has embarked on a large consultation and fact-finding exercise, which will give me and my fellow commissioners the evidence we need to answer these questions. It\u2019s a privilege to have the opportunity to debate this alongside 15 smart people from a range of backgrounds and political affiliations. We have met once and it\u2019s impossible to guess what we will conclude, but what\u2019s clear and exciting is a shared determination to set out a vision for social housing that everyone can support. \u2022 Sayeeda Warsi is a lawyer and a member of the House of Lords"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
