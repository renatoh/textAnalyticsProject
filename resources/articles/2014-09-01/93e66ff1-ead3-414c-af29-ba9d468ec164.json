Adam Cohen has the advantage of at least knowing what he\u2019s doing: his fifth album of unshowy singer-songwriter fare occupies similarly confessional territory to that marked out by his father, Leonard. Indeed, Cohenologists will find much to pore over here, as his lyrics frequently address that relationship, and at times appear to be explicitly encouraging comparisons, not least on Fall Apart (\u201cYou\u2019ll be hearing his voice, like you\u2019re hearing it now\u201d). It\u2019s a disarmingly bold move, but while We Go Home is an undeniably fine record, it\u2019s not quite good enough to escape Dad\u2019s long shadow."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
