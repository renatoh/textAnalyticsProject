Barrie Rutter, however, is unusually partial to the piece, having already produced it twice before in Northern Broadsides\u2019 25-year history. Not inappropriately, Rutter\u2019s gluttony for punishment now matches Falstaff\u2019s own: \u201cThis is the third time,\u201d he wails, having been dunked in a laundry basket, dressed as a woman and gulled into wandering round the forest with a pair of antlers on his head: \u201cI hope good luck lies in odd numbers.\u201d Over time, Rutter\u2019s Falstaff has deepened in pathos, if not self-knowledge. He shambles around in a sorrowful state; a decrepit, rheumy figure whose bloated ego perfectly answers to Mistress Ford\u2019s description of \u201ca gross, watery pumpion\u201d. But if the ebullience has slightly dimmed, perhaps it is not too fanciful to perceive Rutter\u2019s performance as the farcical flip-side of his recent King Lear as another unsparing image of elderly self-delusion. The production is given a broadly 1920s feel and, wherever we are, it\u2019s nowhere near Windsor (which has been erased from the title); with the flat caps and hard vowels suggesting northern moors rather than southern forests. The comedy arises from a salacious strain of English smut that would find its ultimate expression in the Carry On films, and at times comes a little too close for comfort. Andrew Vincent\u2019s apoplectically jealous Ford is so determined to eject Falstaff from the linen basket that the front few rows find items of soiled underwear raining down on their heads. Who knows if Rutter will play the fat knight a fourth time? If not, we\u2019ll still have pants for the memory. At the New Vic, Newcastle-under-Lyme, until 27 February. Box office: 01782 717962.
