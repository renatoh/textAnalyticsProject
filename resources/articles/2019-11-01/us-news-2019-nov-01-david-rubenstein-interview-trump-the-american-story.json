When working with Donald Trump, the billionaire philanthropist-cum-interviewer asked the secretary of state, what is the process by which decisions are made? Pompeo said there was \u201ca very robust National Security Council process\u201d, and that when meeting the president, he always brought \u201ca one-page summary, at the very least, that says, \u2018Here\u2019s the outline of what it is that I think are the priorities now.\u2019\u201d And then he said something else: Trump is \u201cvery focused on where the money is, and how we use economic leverage to achieve our diplomatic ends\u201d. The interview took place on 29 July 2019. That was four days after Pompeo and other senior aides sat in on a call between Trump and Vlodymyr Zelenskiy, the new president of Ukraine. Whether Trump asked Zelenskiy to carry out investigations of his political rivals in return for the release of nearly $400m in military aid, and whether that would constitute a serious abuse of power, is now the key issue in the impeachment inquiry. On a rainy Halloween in New York City, in a 33rd-floor conference room at the Carlyle Group, the investment giant Rubenstein co-founded, the interviewer sits down to be interviewed. At the same time, in Washington, on Capitol Hill, House Democrats are passing a vote to formalise the impeachment process. I read him Pompeo\u2019s quote. \u201cI hadn\u2019t gone back and read that transcript since I did the interview,\u201d Rubenstein says, \u201cand you just pointed out something I hadn\u2019t focused on. \u201cI guess that\u2019s revealing in the way it\u2019s put.\u201d Rubenstein is not a journalist but he spends a great deal of time interviewing politicians and leaders. He is not a historian, but he spends a great deal of time interviewing historians. Which is why we\u2019re here. Rubenstein still chairs the Carlyle Group and according to Forbes is worth $3bn and change. But for some time he has been practising what he calls \u201cpatriotic philanthropy\u201d. Most visibly, that means buying historic documents (Magna Carta, the Declaration of Independence, the Emancipation Proclamation) and restoring important sites (the Washington Monument, Monticello, the Lincoln Memorial). Two days before we meet, he announces $10m for the Jefferson Memorial in Washington. Less visibly, and in the vein of his interviews for the Economic Club and Bloomberg and PBS, Rubenstein hosts \u201ccongressional dialogues\u201d. At the Library of Congress, a bipartisan audience of representatives and senators mingles, dines and listens as Rubenstein interviews selected \u201cmaster historians\u201d. Now comes a book, The American Story, which reprints 16 such discussions and aims to raise money for the library\u2019s literacy programmes. The subjects and experts range from Washington, Jefferson and Lincoln (Jack D Warren, Jon Meacham, Doris Kearns Goodwin) to Lindbergh, King and Nixon (A Scott Berg, Taylor Branch, Bob Woodward). The title is appropriate: this is history with the emphasis on story, clubbable rather than scholarly but not overly so. The interviews are readable, revealing, even surprisingly funny. Turn one page and HW Brands is revealing to an audience at least part-Republican Ronald Reagan\u2019s lack of warmth to his children and failing memory while in the Oval Office. Turn another and Berg is detailing how Charles Lindbergh managed his solo Atlantic flight without recourse to a toilet. Turn another, and Rubenstein is asking Jay Winik about Hitler: \u201cWhat\u2019s with that moustache?\u201d As an interview technique, it\u2019s idiosyncratic and not particularly hard-hitting, but it\u2019s often productive. \u201cWhat I do when I do an interview,\u201d he says, \u201cis I always read the book or do a lot of research in advance. I write down the questions and then I kind of memorize the questions and I kind of have a logical way of doing it. And so if I have 35 questions, I\u2019ll probably remember 32 or 33 and nobody will know but me that I forgot one. \u201cBut also I think it helps with the eye contact. See, when you have a piece of paper, my theory is you look down. The second you look down, you\u2019ve lost the eye contact. It\u2019s less a conversation, more like an interview. That\u2019s why I do it that way, but everybody has their own style. That\u2019s just mine.\u201d True enough. My own research shows Rubenstein will devote the first part of any interview to interviewing his interviewer himself. Before I switch on the recorder he has established that I come from a city, Leeds, where he has ancestors thanks to an influx of Ukrainian Jews in the early 20th century. The questions keep coming. Being quizzed by a titan of business, it turns out, is an unusual experience indeed. Ask Bob Woodward. The great reporter sat down with Rubenstein to discuss Watergate, of course, but also what came after: Nixon\u2019s final days, George W Bush and 9/11, Barack Obama, Afghanistan and Iraq. They also talked about the time Woodward got a scoop on a memo written by a young aide in the Carter White House: Rubenstein. \u201cI remember it very clearly,\u201d he says. \u201cI would write a memo and I would put my boss\u2019s name on it typically, but I might have had my name on this one as well. And this is what the essence of it was \u2026 \u201cCarter went to Asia. He was going on the flight back to spend a day or two in Hawaii, recuperating. And the essence of it was [me] saying that, \u2018We got gas lines here, it\u2019s terrible. You shouldn\u2019t really spend time in Hawaii, it wouldn\u2019t look good. Just fly all the way back and you should know that the gas lines are a big problem and we need to blame the appropriate people, and let\u2019s blame Opec for it.\u2019\u201d He sent the memo to Carter, he says, \u201cand then somebody, I guess, didn\u2019t like the memo. And they leaked it to Bob Woodward. \u201cSo Woodward is going to write an article, and he asked me about it, but he was going to write the article saying, Rubenstein and Stuart Eizenstat, my boss, tell the president he should blame Opec for the problems, not blame yourself. It was embarrassing to have your memo leak, and it didn\u2019t make me popular. I didn\u2019t know if I\u2019d get fired or not. \u201cBut anyway, that was what it was. And then Bob, later I got to know him.\u201d In fact, in The American Story Woodward says the memo suggested \u201ca war on Opec\u201d \u2013 rather more than simple blame \u2013 and Rubenstein agrees. Either way, Rubenstein soon realised he didn\u2019t want to be a lawyer and went into finance instead. It worked out, and as he remained a voracious reader on \u201chistory, biography, politics and business\u201d \u2013 he aims to ingest 100 books a year \u2013 and because his extraordinary wealth gave him extraordinary proximity to power, he started interviewing anyone who was anyone in each of those fields. The American Story has attracted criticism for being a book full of white men, both its subjects and those discussing them. Kearns Goodwin on Lincoln and the late Cokie Roberts on the Founding Mothers stand out, as does Branch\u2019s great subject, Martin Luther King. But Rubenstein acknowledges the flaw. \u201cI have done another series of 18 or so dialogues,\u201d he says, \u201cand they have probably more women and more black authors. One of the authors I wanted to put in here was Annette Gordon-Reed, who wrote The Hemingses of Monticello, and it turned out the transcript didn\u2019t quite work \u2026 I have done another interview of her and I\u2019m going to put it in the next book or somewhere else.\u201d He has also interviewed Lonnie Bunch, formerly director of the National Museum of African American History and Culture, now secretary of the Smithsonian, where Rubenstein is chair of the board. \u201cBut I would say, yeah, the authors do not reflect the diversity of our country today. On the other hand, they do reflect some of the leading American historians, but you can always say I could do a better job, and I\u2019d say, probably yes.\u201d Discussing such great and flawed white men, Rubenstein marvels at how one 18th-century generation produced \u201cGeorge Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, John Adams and Alexander Hamilton\u201d. \u201cNow,\u201d he says, \u201cwe have 330 million people and \u2026 where are the great people?\u201d His theory is \u201cthey\u2019re all in private equity\u201d. Mine is they\u2019re all in journalism. He says he regrets not taking a chance to buy the Washington Post before Jeff Bezos did, and we\u2019re back in the present day. In his introduction, Rubenstein quotes a line that springs to mind as we discuss Nixon. It\u2019s George Santayana: \u201cThose who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.\u201d Every interview I\u2019ve done with a historian recently \u2013 Sarah Bakewell, Saul Friedl\u00e4nder, Sidney Blumenthal, David Blight \u2013 has turned to the present, and to what their books might tell readers about the conundrum of Trump. Rubenstein says he doesn\u2019t feel any pressure to pass judgment but \u201cfrom a historical point of view, most historians would say you can\u2019t tell how successful a president is or is not while he is in office. \u201cThink about this. When Harry Truman left the presidency, he was considered terrible, 15% approval ratings. When Jimmy Carter left, he was considered terrible. George Herbert Walker Bush, he lost re-election. In time, history has revived these people, just as John Adams has been revived. So it\u2019s hard to say. Most historians would say it takes at least 40 years after a person dies before you can read all the documents and really know. \u201cI have my views on President Trump. I do know him reasonably well and I\u2019ve spent a reasonable amount of time with him. I have my views on him, but I would say right now, it\u2019s too early to say how history will regard him and this is the reason. \u201cLet\u2019s suppose I tell you that we have an attack on the homeland tomorrow here, and he somehow does a very good job in defending the homeland. Or some other thing happens, the military does something great and the president, as commander-in-chief, gets credit for it, ie, killing a leader in the Middle East [a reference to the recent death of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi]. \u201cHe may get to be very popular, and despite some of the flaws that have become evident, you can\u2019t tell that he won\u2019t be popular or that he won\u2019t be successful. I think it\u2019s too early to say.\u201d Of course, Trump rarely feels such need for circumspection. He didn\u2019t when he spoke to Zelinskiy and he didn\u2019t, at least initially, when he sat down to talk to Rubenstein. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know him that well then,\u201d Rubenstein says. \u201cI wrote him a letter and asked him to come down [to the Economic Club in December 2014]. He said he would and he told me to ask him if he was going to run for president. I was going, \u2018What?\u2019 He said he might run for president, in the green room. I was surprised. \u201cHe called me later and told me he really liked the interview, he thought it was well done, and I\u2019ve asked him recently if I could do another one at the Economic Club with him, and he said that we would probably be able to do it if his schedule worked, but then he\u2019s gotten diverted on other stuff, I think.\u201d No doubt. Rubenstein\u2019s Trump transcript does not contain anything quite so startling as that from Pompeo. But it does contain the following: MR RUBENSTEIN: \u201cIs there any downside to being Donald Trump? MR TRUMP: \u201cWell, I have to be very careful of that answer. That can get me into a lot of trouble.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
