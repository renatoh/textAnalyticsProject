Water has dripped \u2013 poured, even \u2013 through the ceiling. It splashes onto the ground, creating great puddles. At one point an actor accidentally slips, looking as if he might hurtle to the floor, before he rights himself at the last moment. The soggy wetness is a metaphor for the state of mind of detainees at Manus Island, whose real-life stories of oppression are told verbatim in this production by Iranian playwrights Leila Hekmatnia and Keyvan Sarreshteh. It also, however, has a more literal meaning: representing how these \u201cboat people\u201d tried to reach Australia and a new life: by floating on \u2013 and sometimes drowning in \u2013 water. Such symbolism may seem heavy-handed. But the decision to let these men and women speak in their own words, and their own language (albeit by proxy through the performers; the work is told entirely in Persian with English subtitles) lends Manus a rare authenticity. Central to the production is outspoken Kurdish journalist Behrouz Boochani, who becomes a lead character, played with understated ferocity by Ehsan Bayatfar. Boochani, who has been trapped in Manus since 2013, spent months collaborating with the play\u2019s creators. With Australian politicians failing to note the urgency of human rights abuses being perpetrated in their name, art is increasingly taking its place. That includes Boochani\u2019s novel No Friend But the Mountains, which won Australia\u2019s richest literary prize at the Victorian premier\u2019s literary awards, in January; Melbourne-based Iranian artist Hoda Afshar\u2019s video work Remain; and now Manus, put together by Tehran-based Verbatim Theatre Group. Premiering in Iran, this marks its first time in Australia. The similarities between Remain and Manus are many. Like Manus, Remain recites the stories of men on Manus using their own words. As in Manus, Boochani, too, became Afshar\u2019s main contact, playing a starring role. And as in Manus water is used as a trope: as Boochani once told me: \u201cWater symbolises light and purity. It also symbolises our journey.\u201d All this runs the risk of being overly \u201cworthy\u201d; indeed Manus runs 20 minutes too long and would have packed more of a punch had it been shorter. But innovative decisions by director Nazanin Sahamizadeh, founder of Verbatim, keeps the storytelling vital. Human bodies themselves become the screens on which politicians\u2019 words are broadcast. (Malcolm Turnbull is shown revealing his ignorance as to what is really going on; news clips show another man in a suit stating that boat people will never, under any circumstances, be allowed to settle here.) Song, too, gives respite from the human suffering, with red jerry cans used as drums. Later, when Omid Masoumali, a 23-year-old refugee, pours petrol over his body and sets himself on fire, dying in hospital, they take on another meaning, too. The screams of his wife in footage shown are harrowing and stayed with me long after the curtain had set. Asylum seeker Hossein Babaahmadi, who was held on Manus but returned to Iran in 2013, once told The Guardian: \u201cEvery single moment of it was like death.\u201d Manus, however, for all its pain, hums with vital life \u2013 not least the power, good and bad, of storytelling. In the final scene, a video is shown of children playing in a puddle. They reenact drowning, crying \u201chelp, help\u201d, all the while laughing and giggling as children do. It\u2019s a powerful, and disturbing, moment, let down by the very final slide broadcast to the audience: the image of Syrian toddler Alan Kurdi washed up dead on a beach in Turkey. It is presumably an attempt by Sahamizadeh to widen the scope to include the plight of all refugees. But, in a play entirely focused on the Australian detention centre, it is out of context. The story of what is going on there is shocking enough to stand alone. Manus doesn\u2019t need anything else. \u2013 Manus is at Adelaide\u2019s AC Arts Main Threatre until 10 March"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
