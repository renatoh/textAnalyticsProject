John Charcol is recommending borrowers who wish to take advantage of this possible fall to take a discount or tracker mortgage - but one that allows the borrower to drop into a fixed rate at any time. Not only will borrowers feel the benefit of falling rates in their pocket each month, but also it will allow them to choose when they take a fixed rate and, providing they receive good advice, make that decision at a time when rates are at their lowest. We are confident fixed rates will go even lower towards the end of this year. The current crop of best buys are around the 4.5% mark, but we anticipate rates going below 4%.
