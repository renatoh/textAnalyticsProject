We started quite slowly, we lost too many duels and twice in the first half we gave away the ball in dangerous areas and allowed Lyon to score both times.\u201d Arteta claimed his side\u2019s reaction in the second half was superb, not an adjective that many Mancunians present would have selected, although he was probably correct in saying City created more chances after the interval than before it, even if that was not saying a lot. \u201cAt half-time we had to react, but that is normal, whether Pep is in the dressing room or not,\u201d Arteta said. \u201cThat happens almost every half-time, it is not a new thing, we just had to try and improve what we were doing.\u201d For a coach with managerial ambitions, this first-hand experience was a considerable disappointment. \u201cI can\u2019t really explain why we began so slowly, but sometimes in a new competition it takes a while to get on track,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were finding it hard to come up with the right pass, we couldn\u2019t build up any consistency and Lyon were able to take advantage. \u201cI don\u2019t think it was anything to do with complacency, though, and nor would I try to use the lack of atmosphere in the stadium as an excuse. We were well aware of Lyon\u2019s strengths and weaknesses and we were ready to make a fresh start in this competition, the way we went out last season [to Liverpool] really hurt. We have had a big wake-up call, a result we were not expecting, but it is early in the group stage and it is not too late to respond.\u201d The Lyon coach, Bruno G\u00e9n\u00e9sio, smiled politely when asked whether beating the early favourites for the Champions League constituted the greatest result in the club\u2019s history. \u201cWe have some history and I\u2019m not sure I would call this the greatest feat,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is an achievement and we should be proud of it. \u201cWe decided to play as high as possibly to prevent Manchester City building from the back and it seemed to work. Across the 90 minutes it was a well-deserved result.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
