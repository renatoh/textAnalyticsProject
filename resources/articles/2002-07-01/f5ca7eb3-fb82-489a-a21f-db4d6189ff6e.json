They were diminutive, dark-haired, black-eyed and conquered the Tour's mountains ahead of the heavy Europeans by spinning tiny gears with the smoothness of a delicately calibrated clock. Yesterday's stage winner here, Santiago Botero, is a Colombian in a different mould: brick outhouse rather than bird-like in build, with piercing blue eyes. He can climb mountains but he has the action of a bulldozer. Until the mid-80s the Tour awarded a daily prize for \"elegance\". Botero would not be a contender. Yesterday, having broken away from six other riders, the man from Medellin looked as comfortable as a frog in a matchbox. He was bent double, his chin virtually touching the handlebars, his head at an impossible angle as his blue eyes stared up the slope and his elbows splayed. It was not pretty but, as in 2000 when he took the great Alpine stage to Brian\u00e7on, it worked. Yesterday he became only the second Colombian after \"Lucho\" Herrera - one of the small and perfectly formed variety - to win two stages in one Tour, adding to his victory in the time-trial stage at Lorient. If that was a surprise, so too was his disastrous performance on Mont Ventoux on Sunday. That off-day had dropped him to 18th overall; yesterday he clawed back almost seven minutes on the leader Lance Armstrong and went back up to seventh. The breakaway included Axel Merckx, who is to his father Eddy, \"the cannibal\", what Jordi Cruyff is to Johan. Merckx junior was the first to attack as the septet began the climb out of the valley but he was quickly gobbled up by Botero and could finish only third. Also present was the new French hope Sandy Casar, who finished second in the Paris-Nice race in March. The French television commentators made much of the little rider from the FDJeux.com team but Botero was not there to praise Casar and duly buried him. The expected match between Laurent Jalabert and Richard Virenque for the King of the Mountains jersey was eclipsed by Botero and company, who left only crumbs on offer at the top of the day's six small climbs. Today's three super-category ascents, including the highest point in the Tour, should settle the issue. It will also provide the sternest test of the three weeks for Armstrong's US Postal Ser vice team. Yesterday they faded on the final climb, where the Once team of Joseba Beloki again tried to put the Texan under pressure, setting the pace as they had on the Ventoux. A mile from the finish Beloki attacked: this time he surprised Armstrong by launching himself from a few yards behind and the Texan took a nanosecond longer to catch up than on Sunday, with all the insouciance of a horse swatting a gnat. The last time the Tour visited this ski resort was during the 1998 \"Tour de Farce\", when the now disgraced Italian climber Marco Pantani won the race after an epic escape over the Col du Galibier. At the stage start yesterday there was another reminder of that disastrous event with the appearance of Willy Voet, soigneur at the centre of that year's drug scandals. He is persona non grata in cycling but leapt the barriers for a TV interview. Voet is now out of a job, Pantani is a shadow of his former self and the Olympic champion Jan Ullrich's long-term future is also unclear after he was banned yesterday for eight months by the German Cycling Federation after his positive test for amphetamines last month. Ullrich, out of the Tour with a knee injury, will not be able to compete until March 23. He is also now under investigation under German anti-drugs laws. Ullrich's Deutsche Telekom team manager Walter Godefroot said he was not certain his leader would ever race again. \"Jan does not know himself whether he wishes to continue being a professional cyclist. He has made promises in the past and failed to carry them through. We need to know what he really wants to do.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
