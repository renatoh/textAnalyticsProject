In a strongly worded rebuttal, Darling said plans put forward by a committee of MPs were flawed and would not deflect him from his own reforms of Britain's system of financial regulation. The chancellor admitted that changes were needed, but insisted the regulatory system introduced by Labour was not fundamentally flawed. In its report, the treasury select committee said that delays and mis-judgments by regulators over Northern Rock meant a new crack team concerned with rescuing troubled financial institutions should sit inside the Bank of England. Staff drawn from the Treasury, the Financial Services Authority (FSA) and the Bank of England, under the control of a senior figure at the central bank, should be given the job of taking swift and effective action if another institution gets into difficulties. It criticised all parties involved in the attempted rescue of the Newcastle-based bank, including Northern Rock's board, the Bank of England governor Mervyn King and Darling. But it was most scathing about the FSA, which committed a \"systematic failure of duty\" by not spotting the bank's \"reckless\" business plan. A delay in the chancellor's announcement guaranteeing customer deposits also \"prolonged\" the run on the bank by panicked customers last September, and meant more damage was \"caused to the health of the company than might otherwise have been the case\". Committee chairman John McFall said: \"The failure of Northern Rock, while primarily a failure of its directors, was also a failure of its regulator. The FSA appears to have systematically failed in its duty and this failure contributed significantly to the difficulties and risks to the public purse that have followed.\" He said the committee's proposals were the \"will of parliament\" and should be considered as part of the government's wide-ranging review of City regulation. Writing in the News of the World, the chancellor dismissed the plan and said he would set out proposals next week for bolstering the powers of the FSA, which would take the lead within a new committee chaired by the chancellor. \"These changes will mean that we can spot risks earlier and try to prevent problems like Northern Rock happening in the future.\" Darling, who has set a February 4 deadline for a private sale of the bank, insisted that his plan would \"build\" on rather than replace the system introduced when Labour took power. \"The chairman of the FSA has been quite clear in saying that there are many things that should have been done far better,\" he wrote. \"We need to tighten up the system and fill in any gaps, but the reforms I announce need to build on the reforms made 10 years ago, not reverse them. \"The model of the single regulator and an independent Bank of England is one that other countries are following.\" Yesterday, shadow chancellor George Osborne said the committee's report offered \"yet more evidence of damaging dithering\" and left Darling's reputation in \"shreds\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
