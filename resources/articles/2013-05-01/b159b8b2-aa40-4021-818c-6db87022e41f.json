Whether this means Saunders still has a future at Molineux the former Aston Villa and Liverpool striker will find out on Monday, when he meets Morgan and the chief executive, Jez Moxey, to discuss the rebuilding process that Saunders insisted began when the final whistle blew at the Amex Stadium. He has yet to convince many of the club's supporters. Losing key players including the striker Sylvan Ebanks-Blake to injury has been a factor in Wolves winning only five of his 20 games in charge, but Saunders's selections and tactics have often been hard to understand. This match was a case in point. Judging by the dismayed comments on social media, Stephen Hunt and Bjorn Sigurdarson have been among the club's best players in recent weeks, but both were on the bench, while Bakary Sako, who Saunders admitted afterwards was only \"half-fit\", started a game the outcome of which felt decided from the moment Kazenga LuaLua scored after barely five minutes. The Brighton winger's second shortly before half-time confirmed the inevitable, and the ease with which Gus Poyet's side saw the game out, husbanding their resources for the forthcoming play-off semi-final against Crystal Palace, was another embarrassment in a humiliating season for the old gold. Saunders, unsurprisingly, made the case for managerial stability. \"Look, if you had four managers in Boots the chemist and asked the staff how they feel, they wouldn't know whether they were coming or going: this manager liked what I was doing, this manager doesn't, am I doing the right thing, am I in the right place. \"The worst thing you can have at a club is uncertainty. Someone has to do the job. I'm up for it and I'm going to get on with it,\" he said. Morgan indicated money would be made available for rebuilding \"within the confines of the Football League Financial Fair Play system\", but bringing in younger players through the club's academy had to be a large part of the way forward. Wolves are also due to receive another \u00a316m parachute payment, though with a wage bill touching \u00a325m, and falling attendance and commercial revenues, there will surely be a lot more going than coming at Molineux over the summer. Saunders declined to discuss names, though Jamie O'Hara, constantly reminded by the supporters of his reputed \u00a340,000 a week wages and booed every time he touched the ball, has surely played his last game for the club. The former Spurs midfielder gestured in return and, when his team-mates shuffled awkwardly over to applaud the fans at the end of the game, marched down the tunnel without a backward glance. The contrast with what is going on at Brighton could hardly have been more marked, and Saunders cited the Seagulls, not so very long ago groundless and penniless, as an example of how crisis usually contains opportunity. \"We have been here nearly three seasons and you can see there is a plan, players understand the way we want to play,\" said Poyet. \"When you maintain a group of key players and staff, it's better, everybody knows that. We are in a great moment as a team and as a club. We finished ahead of Palace, and we need to prove we are the better team. Being Palace there is an extra edge to the games, and we need to control that.\" Man of the match Kazenga LuaLua (Brighton)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
