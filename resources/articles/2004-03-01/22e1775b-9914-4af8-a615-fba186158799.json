Rushden remained spirited opposition and City's rhythm was affected by injuries to Aaron Brown and Tommy Doherty. City made a positive start but their possession was offset by too many misplaced passes, and Christian Roberts and Brian Tinnion both ballooned over the bar and a header from Doherty was not far off. The visitors were being well marshalled at the back by Barry Hunter, who has been appointed manager until the end of the season at least. After 29 minutes Bristol were rewarded by a leaping header from the 19-year-old Leroy Lita. Louis Carey crossed from the right to Brown, whose return into the goal area was reached by the elastic Lita. Rodney Jack nearly levelled for Rushden. He moved on to a pass from Gary Mills but his shot spun off the far post. A bad miss by Marc Goodfellow, from Roberts' unselfish pass, prevented City from building their lead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
