Still obsessing over the dark side of love, it's the sound of an adolescent Marianne Faithfull spooning with an ageing Johnny Cash, the pared-down, dusty folk swooning with romantic strings and retro keyboards. Lanegan's growl is an earthy joy. Campbell's innocent whisper gilds his broken wisdom on Salvation, but, despite cooing appealingly through Seafaring Song, she is a girlish presence rather than a partner. Campbell's better when she's having fun, joining her cohort on the lusty, smoky Come on Over (Turn Me On), and shedding her delicate skin on Shotgun Blues to become not just a Tennessee Williams vixen, but Lanegan's worthy soulmate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
