There will be 10 rounds, all of them held during school holidays. Drivers must be aged 13-17 and have graduated from Ford's rally academy which was set up last year. They will all compete in the Ford Rallye Sport Trainer, a vehicle based on the Ford Ka. The championship is concentrated in Wales and starts with a round at Walter's Arena in the heart of the Glamorgan forests on March 20-21. The scheme reflects growing concern that Britain has lagged behind other countries in developing successors to Colin McRae and Richard Burns, neither of whom will contest the world championship this year. It has previously been necessary to hold a road licence to drive, putting back the chance to compete to a far older age than in other sports in which teenagers can forge ahead. \"We believe it's a fantastic opportunity for youngsters to really make it in rallying,\" the championship administrator Peter Beattie said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
