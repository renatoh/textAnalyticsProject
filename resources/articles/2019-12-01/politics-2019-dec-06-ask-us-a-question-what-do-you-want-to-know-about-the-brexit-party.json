Kate Proctor, a political correspondent for the Guardian, will be answering your questions at lunchtime. She has been following Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party around Labour heartland seats in the North of England, Wales and Midlands during the general election campaign. She has been covering politics for six years, locally and nationally, and arrived in the lobby at Westminster the day after Jeremy Corbyn became leader of the Labour party. Before joining the Guardian she worked for the Evening Standard for three years as their political reporter, and was the Yorkshire Post\u2019s political correspondent. She regularly contributes political commentary for the BBC, Sky News and national radio stations. The Brexit Party pulled out of 317 Tory-held seats to avoid splitting the leave vote but have faced continued pressure to stand down in Labour seats too. They have had a difficult campaign so far and they are trailing in the polls despite winning the most seats at the European Parliament elections in May. As well as going after a hard-Brexit their other policies include abolishing the House of Lords and voting reform. If you have any questions about The Brexit Party, campaign and policies, or how realistic the pledges are and what they might mean for you, please get in touch.
