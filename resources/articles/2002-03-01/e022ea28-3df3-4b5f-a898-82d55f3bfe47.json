The decision, taken by the game's International Federation in Sydney yesterday, was a surprising one but this time it has warned the Rugby Football League to be less ambitious and more realistic. Maurice Lindsay, the Wigan chairman who was elected to succeed Sir Rodney Walker as the Federation's vice-chairman, and the other delegates decided that Great Britain and France remain the only viable locations for the event despite Australia not staging a World Cup competition since 1967. Jason Harborow, operations director of the 2000 World Cup and now a commercial-department manager for the Commonwealth Games, feels that the finals should not be run on the same basis. \"They've got to look at the size of the tournament, the timing of the tournament and also the competitiveness of key teams.\" That means, according to Harborow, abandoning the experiment of splitting Great Britain into the four home nations and playing the bulk of matches in the north of England, the game's traditional heartland. \"Over here rugby league is only played in England so we should stick with the Great Britain team,\" he said. \"The only reason we split into four teams last time was funding, but that was putting short-term gain before the long term. We should have been looking to win it. \"They also shouldn't get preoccupied with trying to take the sport to new areas, like they did last time, and concentrate instead on established rugby league areas.\" \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
