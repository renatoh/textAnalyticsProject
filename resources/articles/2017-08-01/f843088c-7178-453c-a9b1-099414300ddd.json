The private equity owners of Learndirect Limited, which is expected to be given the lowest possible grade by the education watchdog Ofsted and to lose all its Department for Education contracts, created Learndirect Apprenticeships Limited, which has gone on to win contracts to train about 3,000 people. Learndirect Apprenticeships Ltd was created in September 2016, and its training is funded by a levy on companies rather than directly by the government. Ofsted is expected to accuse Learndirect Limited on Thursday of allowing standards to slide to a \u201cvery low\u201d level and say its management of apprenticeships is ineffective. The report, which Learndirect asked a high court judge to suppress, is understood to give the company a grade four rating, the lowest possible, for its overall effectiveness, apprenticeships and outcome for learners. Learndirect, which was privatised by David Cameron\u2019s coalition government in 2011 and is majority-owned by the private equity arm of Lloyds Bank, told the court that if it was given a grade four it could lead to the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d withdrawal of funding and it may be forced to call in the administrators. Providers given a grade four rating are prevented from being listed on the Education and Skills Funding Agency (EFSA) register of apprenticeship training providers. The DfE said Learndirect has not been granted new contracts since May, but Learndirect Apprenticeships has contracts to train about 3,000 people. Learndirect Apprenticeships applied to the EFSA register independently of Learndirect Ltd so it is not affected by the grade four rating. The DfE, Ofsted and Learndirect pointed out that the damning Ofsted report did not relate to Learndirect Apprenticeships and said the two companies were completely separate entities. An Ofsted spokesman said: \u201cOfsted inspected Learndirect Ltd under the common inspection framework 2015. All apprenticeship provision offered by Learndirect Ltd was inspected, graded and reported under apprenticeship provision type in the inspection report, which will be published tomorrow. \u201cLearndirect Apprenticeship Ltd was a separate company with no funding or apprentices at the time of the inspection so was not relevant to the inspection.\u201d A DfE spokesperson said: \u201cLearndirect Apprenticeships ltd is a separate legal entity on the register of apprenticeship training providers. Only those providers who meet our rigorous quality assurance make it on to the register to deliver quality apprenticeships.\u201d Learndirect said: \u201cLevy apprenticeships [employer-owned apprenticeships] are delivered by Learndirect Apprenticeships Limited, an independent business. This part of the business is supporting 60% of the 5,000 apprenticeships enrolled to date as part of the government\u2019s apprenticeship levy. The Ofsted report does not relate to any of this provision.\u201d According to the ESFA\u2019s register Learndirect Limited said it had subcontracted \u00a383,000 worth of work to Learndirect Apprenticeships Limited. The DfE said on Tuesday that it would withdraw all funding from Learndirect, which is responsible for almost 73,000 trainees, by July 2018. After the DfE announcement Learndirect said: \u201cThe [Education and Skills Funding Agency] issues 12-month adult education budget contracts to the sector, with the current round scheduled to end in July 2018. This is just one source of funding into Learndirect.\u201d An FT/FE Week investigation this week found that in the four years since privatisation, Learndirect\u2019s parent firm had spent 84% of its mostly taxpayer-provided cash generated by the operating business on payments to managers and financiers. \u2022 This article was amended on 17 August 2017. An earlier version referred to Learndirect\u2019s parent firm\u2019s income, when cash generated by the operating business was meant."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
