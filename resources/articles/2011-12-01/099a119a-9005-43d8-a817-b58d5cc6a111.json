After witnessing a defensive display lacking in attitude, the manager said: \"We went down to 10 men and we were still in the game so I think it'd be very harsh to suggest that.\" Demba Ba, though, was low key afterwards. The scorer of both United's goals accepted that finishing in the top four, where the club had been positioned until their recent poor run, is virtually impossible. The striker said: \"It's difficult, the top four. You see the teams there \u2026 if we can make it in the top half we'll be happy.\" As with his manager, Ba is adamant that Newcastle's season will not now fall apart. \"We're not going to let that happen. I'm pretty sure next week we're going to prepare and go on the pitch to win the game. We'll do everything to win the next game because we need a win,\" said Ba in anticipation of the encounter with Swansea City this weekend. Ba and Pardew were each justified in pointing to an injury crisis that ruled out Steven Taylor, Fabricio Coloccini, Chiek Tiot\u00e9, Danny Guthrie and Mike Williamson. This forced Pardew to select two full-backs, Danny Simpson and James Perch, in central defence, and he said: \"It's just disappointing to go into the game with so many key players missing. We've had some serious injuries this year. Steve Taylor and Marvo [Sylvain Marveaux] out for the season: two first-team players, so that's been disappointing. It's just knocked us off our heels a little bit.\" Regarding the lax defending of his side against a muscular Norwich team that peppered Simpson and Perch with high balls, Pardew said: \"You're going to be under pressure and you're going to concede set plays. I think we just had to do better, and we certainly should have been more competitive when that ball was delivered regardless of not having a centre-half.\" Pardew was clear that Paul Lambert's side wanted it more, especially their front-line of Grant Holt and Steve Morison, who with Wesley Hoolahan scored Norwich's goals. \"Of course when a team is missing centre-halves you're going to [encourage] your team to put in deliveries and attack it [as Lambert did], and there was perhaps a little bit more venom from them at set-plays.\" Hoolahan's opener came from a poorly defended corner from which Andrew Crofts could too easily unload a header at Tim Krul \u2013 his save rebounded in off the midfielder. This was after 38 minutes. Holt's 50th league goal for Norwich City and Morison's strike (in the 59th and 63rd minutes, each were headers) were, again, not dealt with as they should have been by Newcastle's rearguard. When Dan Gosling was sent off for a dangerous tackle on Russell Martin, Ba's killer left foot strike \u2013 his 40th-minute equaliser was also an impressive finish - gave the visitors unlikely hope. But Holt sealed the win on 82 minutes with yet another header and he said: \"If you get balls in the box we have got players who don't mind putting their head in where it hurts. I think the way we set up [4-4-2] we always go positive. You've got to be careful how you do it \u2013 we have got to be careful we are not sucker-punched.\" Regarding his side's clutch of headers, he said: \"If you get balls in the box we have got players who don't mind putting their head in where it hurts.\" Lambert said of his captain who was starting for the first time since 5 November: \"He's 30 years old, he's not a young kid I can teach anything different to. He plays the game. All I ask for is endeavour and enthusiasm for the game. But he's never let his head [go] down, he's always kept on going. I think he understands that we'll need everybody, not just the 18 lads \u2013 it's the ones outside of that, or on the bench, that we need for this football team to survive. We'll need everybody to go in the same direction.\" Norwich are now ninth with 19 points on their return to the top flight. \"I just think about the next [game] now,\" added Lambert. \"That's the same if I win, lose or draw \u2013 let it go. Not dwell on it, just look to Everton and another match.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
