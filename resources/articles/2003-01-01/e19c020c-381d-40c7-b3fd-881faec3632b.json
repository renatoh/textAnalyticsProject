Sums are sexy. They can disappear into the furthest reaches of the universe and caress life out of a formula. I never really believed them. Now I do. I was given a bit of paper before this match that said in plain old black-and-white that Munster had to score four tries more than Gloucester and beat, to boot, the runaway leaders of the English Premiership by 27 points to have any chance of making it through to the quarter-finals of the Heineken Cup. How we laughed. The maths at that time was a joke. This was underpowered Munster against the meanest outfit in the land. Eighty minutes later, plus a little extra, the scoreboard revealed that Munster had won neatly by 27 points and, to boot, scored four tries. I swear it was one of those moments that will have me taking up astrology. Or astronomy. Or astrophysics, even. The sums were so spooky they were scary. And sexy, of course. Unless you're from Gloucester. At one stage in the second half they were awarded a penalty in front of the sticks. Three points - three measly points - were on offer. Three points that would be the difference between the sums working for them or the whole equation going wonky. Ludovic Mercier had the ball in his hands. A kicker with as trustworthy a left peg as any in the business. And he took it quickly by himself, trying to make three points into five, or seven. I don't know in the world of pure maths if you can talk of greed, but it led to nought. Perhaps it was the very unscientific pressure of the occasion that this was a game as absorbing as any seen in Europe. And the Heineken Cup has produced more than its fair share of little thrillers. Perhaps Ludo, as he's known to the Shed back home at Kingsholm, was swallowed up by the board game Limerick. He rolled his dice and lost the pot. Others were carried away by the occasion. Gloucester lost Peter Buxton and Olivier Azam to the sin bin. Now that was simple maths. Giving Munster a one-man advantage when they were already on a roll that was more expertly controlled than Mercier's was always going to be a problem. In a strange way - and this was a day for strangeness - Gloucester coped well with being twice down to 14 men. But it takes its toll in the long run. The Munster line-out, with Mick O'Driscoll and Alan Quinlan towering, had already meant they could attack Gloucester in one of the very areas where the English club like to rule. The catch and drive. But it was not all about the grind of the hard yards up-front. The first try was a set-piece beauty from that other source - the scrum. Gloucester wheeled the beast the way they wanted, away from the touchline, but the exit of the ball was quick enough for Peter Stringer to gain a yard on Buxton. Thinus Delport had to step off his wing to cut off the scrum-half but this opened up a route to the line for John Kelly. It was the simplest of operations, simple enough to be majestic in its own right. Mike Mullins tore into another bulwark of Gloucester's defence, the midfield. Not much gets through Robert Todd or Terry Fanolua, but Mullins targeted Mercier, smaller and more delicate. Poor Ludo. It was one of those days for him. Jason Holland provided a little variety to his co-centre's directness by putting in two measured kicks that led to tries. One for Mossie Lawlor, squat and bustling on his wing. And the other for O'Driscoll, lurking luridly at two metres high on the wide outside. That was the third try. One to go. Even I could do that maths. It came from a line-out. The clock was running down. Ronan O'Gara had been deliberate in his punt to the corner. No rush. This was going to be the last chance. Line-out plus drive. Set-up in midfield plus drive. One crash for the line by Jeremy Staunton. A second by Kelly. Try, just far enough out to make O'Gara's conversion one to test his cool. He took his time again. If this went over, he didn't want to give Gloucester the chance to restart and have a conversion chance of their own. Hell, he took his time because he knew the maths of the moment. And as the conversion sailed over and as Thomond Park exploded as only it can on these days of sublime sums, he knew that arithmetic can truly be joy unconfined, multiplied by two and squared for good measure.
