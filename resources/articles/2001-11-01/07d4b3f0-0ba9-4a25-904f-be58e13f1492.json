Are there are any other sports stars with a literary connection (i.e. William Faulkner) in their names out there?\" asks Mark MacLachan. Who would have believed it? After a pathetic effort in a previous knowledge we at last have some decent literary footballers. Of course there's still some trash. Several of you offer surnames only, allowing suggestions like Ian St John. \"After all, St John wrote a gospel, didn't he?\" says one wag. Moving swiftly on, David Wright remembers that the 1983 Brendan Behan memorial prize for best new Irish Writing was awarded to a certain Niall Quinn. \"His collection of short stories 'Voyovic Brigitte' contains bleakly realist tales of sex and drug abuse among Irish migrant workers in Europe. In terms of spare yet evocative prose he has a lovely touch (for a big man),\" he adds. We've also had letters (OK, a letter) from Harvard, with Steven Niven pointing out that the black author Richard Wright, who wrote the classic novel Native Son, \"is, I assume, no relation to Arsenal goalie of the same name.\" Even better, Steven also mentions a Canadian slam poet/performance artist named Alex Ferguson, a founder of group of artists known as AWOL Love Vibe. To see some of his work, click here. Steven adds: \"He may have been discussing Jaap Stam when he wrote: 'So much shame, and confusion when you commit your breath to print. In who's honour? For what craving ego puppy? Stuff it back in the closet. You have given suck to the sell-out. Right? What business do you have adding to the, meaningless cacophony of the bookseller's shelf?'\" And there are more literary footballers out there. Paul Graniewitz suggests West Brom's goalie of the 60's and early 70's John Osborne. \"Remembering their glory days of that time, I'm sure he's looking back in anger today,\" he adds before apologising \"for the very bad joke\". Meanwhile, JF Syme points out that Puerto Montt of the Chilean Primera A have a player named Carlos Fuentes, \"who didn't write the Mexican masterpiece 'The Death of Artemio Cruz', despite appearances to the contrary.\" Finally, as several of you have spotted, there was a certain Algerian goalkeeper named Albert Camus, who did, in fact, write The Fall and The Outsider. MOST TEAM-ENDINGS IN THE TOP FLIGHT EVER! \"If you take a look at the teams playing in the Premeirship for the 2001/02 season, you see nine different endings on twelve teams with more than one word in their name (Villa, Rovers, Wanderers, Athletic, County, Town, United (4), City, Hotspur). Has the Premiership or First Division ever had a more diverse field of two-word teams?\" asks Eric Jonathan Martin. \"Pah!\" is Andy Marsh's unnecessary response to Eric's innocent inquiry. \"In 1892-3 there were 11 different endings in the First Division, and in those days there were only 16 teams in the top division.\" And to show what a know-all he is, he names them: Villa, Albion, Wednesday, Forest, Stanley, County, Wanderers, North End, City, Rovers and Heath. Well \"pah\" yourself Andy, because Graham Lawton has trumped you. \"In 1920-21 there were 12 different endings in a 22-team division,\" he writes. \"Three United's , two City's and a Wanderers, Hotspur, Villa, Rovers, Albion, North End, Town, Athletic, County, Park Avenue.\" Diversity indeed. Can anyone beat that? DIFFERENT GOALSCORERS \"During Blackburn's recent 7-1 thrashing of West Ham, I noticed that all of Blackburn's goals were scored by different players. Has this happened before?\" asks Mark Thomas. It certainly has, Mark. Eddie Taylor says the first time it ever happened was in 1967, when Leeds beat Chelsea 7-0 at Elland Road. Incidentally, the English League record now stands at eight different scorers, achieved - as Rob White and several others point out - by Liverpool when they beat Crystal Palace 9-0 in Division One on 12 September 1989. \"Those scorers were Steve Nicol (2), Steve McMahon, Ian Rush, Kevin Gillespie, Peter Beardsley, John Aldridge (pen.), John Barnes and Glen Hysen,\" says Rob. \"Fifteen years before that (September 1974) Liverpool had nine different scorers when they won 11-0 at home to Stromsgodset (Norway) in the Cup Winners' Cup first round, first leg,\" he adds. RANDOM KEEPERS \"Fabien Barthez's recent comical goalkeeping stirred some half-forgotten memory of the Peruvian goalie in the 1978 World Cup finals. I seem to remember him straying so far out of his goal that he managed to get booked for a foul in the opponents' half of the field. Is my memory playing tricks or was he really the most random goalkeeper of all time?\" asks Jonathan Key. Jonathon, your memory serves you well. The player you're looking for is the infamous Ramon 'El Loco' Quiroga, who was booked for fouling Poland's Lato. As Gareth Price remembers: \"Lato received the ball on the left hand side just inside his own half, he turned to advance upfield only to find El Loco in his face! The goalie retreated, with head bowed in contrition, as the ref showed him the yellow card. \"Quiroga's infamy was furthered after he played in the famous 6-0 defeat to the Argentine tournament hosts later in the group. That emphatic victory ensured that the team going through to the final was Argentina - the land of Quiroga's birth!\" Meanwhile Eduardo Villanueva Mansilla remembers: \"Currently he's a second string manager in the Peruvian league team Deportivo Wanka (that's a region of Peru by the way).\" As if we didn't know... Can you help? \"Please help with a bet I foolishly made in the pub which subsequently got out of hand,\" entreats Richard Freeland. \"I heard that Diego Maradona once had a trial with Ipswich Town, and for some reason gave credence to this story. Does anyone have more details?\" \"Who was the first player to miss a penalty in a shootout in a football match in Britain?\" asks Albert Lippett. \"Somebody told me that Buenos Aires has 15 clubs in the top division of the Argentinian league,\" writes Tim Pearse. \"Is this true, and does anybody know which city has had the most clubs in the top division of their respective league? London must be one of them.\" \"I've heard that before Kevin Keagan resigned, only 12 players with surnames of four letters - Owen, Butt, Ince etc... - had ever appeared in an England shirt,\" says Nick Lewis. \"Despite three of us fretting for hours we could only come up with 11. Is this true, and is so, who are the 12?\" \"Did Pele and Di Stefano ever play in the same match, either on the same or opposing sides?\" asks Alan Sheridan? \"Since a recent refurbishment, The Freemason Arms in Long Acre, Covent Garden, London has, painted on one wall, 'Football League founded here in 1868\", says Gerard Morgan. \"Every mention I have ever seen states that the FA was founded in a tavern in Great Queen Street, a hundred yards or so further down towards Holborn. So, is there any basis to the pub's claim?\" Send your questions and answers to the.boss@theguardian.com and we'll do our best to help.
