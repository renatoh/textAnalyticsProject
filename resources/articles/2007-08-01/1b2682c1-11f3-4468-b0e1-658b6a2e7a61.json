How many times does a woman need to read that pencil skirts are in? Geoffrey Cockburn, by email To quote the tuneless Bob Dylan (goodness, did I just say that? By golly, yes I did!), how many roads must a man walk down, before you can call him a man? Yes, and how many articles on heels can a gal read before her eyes start to bleed? The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind, and also on the shelves of WH Smith. First, you are misunderstanding the subtle nature of the fashion magazine. Not all women are the same, you know. We like different things, yes? But within our focus-group-conceived, walking-cliche demographics, hell yeah, we all definitely like the same things! So if you're a sloaney pony who lives in daddy's castle in Surrey that has been in the family since some relative pillaged the formerly incumbent earl, or possibly the product of a union between a 70s rock star and a comedically named groupie who goes to Ibiza with Freddie Windsor, you buy Tatler. If, however, you're a sloaney pony who grew up in daddy's castle in Oxfordshire and you like nothing better than a summer in Formentera with Flavio Briatore, you buy Harper's Bazaar. You see the subtle difference? Crucial, even? And whereas a Tatler girl wants to see pictures of beaded Matthew Williamson tunic dresses, the Harper's Bazaar woman will only tolerate photos of unbeaded Matthew Williamson floor-length gowns. Like I said, crucial. Sometimes I think my best friend dresses trashily. She says I'm being old-fashioned. Who's right? Mel O'Connell, London It's a toughie of an issue, I'll grant you that one, Mel. As I have not borne witness to your friend's appearance myself, I find it difficult to fulfil my given role as an independent adjudicator. But let us, in fine journalist-with-space-to-fill style, Look at The Wider Issue And What It Says About Life Itself. Now, I'd be the first to argue that wearing a pink boob tube and a mini rah-rah skirt probably doesn't do much for the feminist cause. Just this summer I briefly considered a sex change after being stuck across the aisle on a plane from a definitely \"old enough to know better\" woman with pigtails, wearing denim hot pants and a cropped top and brandishing an inflatable hammer with the hilarious slogan \"Bonk! Bonk!\" written across the head. Oh females across the land, weep with collective shame! But before we heap vitriol upon your friend's pigtailed head, consider her mentality, deluded though it is. I can't really be bothered to get in to an \"Oh, the terrible example set by Paris Hilton and her ilk. God strike down the celebrity press for giving them fame and exacerbating their contaminating influence on the impressionable young yadda yadda yadda\" rant, mainly because there are far more malign influences in the world than Hilton, shocking as that may be. What are the most important movies in the average young woman's life? Grease, Dirty Dancing and Pretty Woman, of course. Yes, you see what I'm getting at. Despite the totally brilliant moment when Julia Roberts orders pizza while shopping, even that cannot distract this column's dutiful eye from noticing the obviously objectionable message of Pretty Woman, namely that getting into prostitution is a great career move, even if you do risk ending up with Richard Gere and getting sexually harassed by George from Seinfeld. Then there's Grease, telling all young girls that the sure route to a man's undying love is to ditch your pretty dresses in favour of weird shiny leggings, drag-queen makeup and smoking. And as for Dirty Dancing, on the one hand, we have whingy Baby having sex with her dance instructor up and down the land while her (if memory serves) virginal sister ends up singing the Kellerman's song in a hula skirt. So can you blame your friend's misguided mentality? I, for one, feel merely a sharp pang of sympathy, if not empathy. You've spoken cuttingly about cropped trousers on men but what about for women? Carla Johnson, by email I've said it once, I'll probably say it again: cropped trousers on a woman - jaunty; cropped trousers on a man - overenthusiastic children's TV presenter. And boys? I wouldn't whinge too much or I'll have to wheel out the ol' childbirth and periods argument and that's never pretty."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
