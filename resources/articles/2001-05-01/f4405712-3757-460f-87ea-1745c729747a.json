As our lead feature points out this week, lower returns are not necessarily bad news at a time of low inflation. But much depends on which account you choose. The best still pay as much as 6 per cent, but the worst pay as little as 0.1 per cent. The Banking Code aims to protect savers from being fleeced through sharp marketing practices. But it has not proved strong enough to prevent some banks and building societies from paying derisory amounts on older accounts. Another trend is to pay special one-off bonuses. These bump up headline rates and earn places in best buy tables, but customers who forget to review the accounts after the bonuses are paid may find they are no longer competitive. Pending further changes to the code - which are in the pipeline - the only way for customers to protect themselves fully is by checking rates regularly. And don't forget that one of the best ways to boost returns on cash is to shelter the maximum possible in an Isa, where interest is tax-free."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
