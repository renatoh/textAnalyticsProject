But once Donald Trump began taking questions, the tranquillity was shattered. Yamiche Alcindor of PBS NewsHour put the US president\u2019s own words to him. \u201cYou\u2019ve said repeatedly that you think that some of the equipment that governors are requesting, they don\u2019t actually need. You said New York might need \u2013\u201d Trump interrupted twice: \u201cI didn\u2019t say that.\u201d Alcindor stood her ground: \u201cYou said it on Sean Hannity\u2019s, Fox News.\u201d Then Trump lied: \u201cI didn\u2019t say \u2013 come on. Come on.\u201d And so it went on last Sunday. Trump denied Alcindor a second question, only for a CNN reporter to pass the microphone back to her. Later, when the CNN reporter also quoted Trump\u2019s past remarks, the president resorted to an old epithet: \u201cFake news.\u201d America and the world have been transformed unimaginably by the coronavirus pandemic but Trump\u2019s war on the media has remained a constant and possibly even intensified. The intemperate outbursts might be interpreted as signs of a leader cracking under the pressure of his greatest crisis, for which his previous career offered no preparation. But they are also striking in their echo of authoritarianism. While Trump has visibly delighted in fawning questions from the rightwing One America News Network, he has also implied that dissenting questions from other reporters signal disloyalty when the nation should be pulling together. \u201cBut just so you know, we\u2019re all \u2013 you, me, everybody \u2013 we\u2019re all on the same team,\u201d he told Alcindor on Sunday. A day later, when Alcindor asked why the US still lagged behind countries such as South Korea on testing per capita, he admonished: \u201cYou should be saying congratulations instead of asking a really snarky question.\u201d That alerted Maggie Haberman, White House correspondent of the New York Times, who commented on Twitter: \u201cHave never in 24 years in newspapers had anyone tell me reporters should be \u201ccelebrating\u201d or \u201capplauding\u201d someone until the last two years. It is how the president frames his view of coverage, and his supporters and allies have adopted that posture.\u201d Railing against the media has been a defining feature of Trump\u2019s political identity, a punchline at campaign rallies, deploying barbs such as \u201cthe enemy of the people\u201d. But when, after weeks of denial, he was finally forced to accept the scale of the coronavirus pandemic, he initially tried a more sombre and conciliatory tone. Even now he continues to offer an olive branch. \u201cI mean, even the media is much more fair,\u201d he said on Sunday, before quickly qualifying: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say all of it, but that\u2019s OK. They should be fair because they should want this to end. This is \u2013 this is about death.\u201d Yet once tough questions start landing like arrows, the president reverts to type: belligerent, indignant, pugnacious, affronted by anyone with the temerity to dig up past statements or query his administration\u2019s failure to prepare. On 20 March, Peter Alexander of NBC News asked a seemingly innocuous question: \u201cWhat do you say to Americans who are watching you right now who are scared?\u201d But Trump lashed out: \u201cI say that you\u2019re a terrible reporter. That\u2019s what I say.\u201d Then Jon Karl, ABC News chief White House correspondent , pressed: \u201cAnd everybody who needs one will be able to get a ventilator?\u201d Trump retorted: \u201cLook, don\u2019t be a cutie pie. OK? \u2026 We had a bad testing system. We had a bad stockpile system. We had nothing in the stockpile system. So I wouldn\u2019t tell me what you\u2019re telling \u2013 you know, like being a wise guy.\u201d Then came Sunday\u2019s exchange with Alcindor, querying Trump\u2019s remarks on Fox News when he suggested that New York state was exaggerating how many ventilators it will need. Trump: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you act in a little more positive? It\u2019s always trying to \u2018get you, get you, get you\u2019. And you know what? That\u2019s why nobody trusts the media any more. That\u2019s why people \u2013\u201d Alcindor persisted: \u201cMy question to you is: How is that going to impact \u2013\u201d Trump barked: \u201cExcuse me. You didn\u2019t hear me. That\u2019s why you used to work for the Times and now you work for somebody else. Look, let me tell you something: be nice. Don\u2019t be threatening.\u201d It was loaded language. Later, Alcindor tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m not the first human being, woman, black person or journalist to be told that while doing a job. My take: Be steady. Stay focused. Remember your purpose. And, always press forward.\u201d And it was not the first such incident. On 13 March, when Alcindor asked why Trump had scrapped the White House\u2019s national security council pandemic team two years earlier, he snapped: \u201cWell, I just think it\u2019s a nasty question.\u201d On Monday, it was the turn of another thorn in Trump\u2019s side, Jim Acosta of CNN, to read back to him his past statements downplaying the threat of the virus and ask: \u201cWhat do you say to Americans who believe that you got this wrong?\u201d The president predictably erupted. \u201cIt\u2019s why people just don\u2019t want to listen to CNN any more,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026 Instead of asking a nasty, snarky question like that, you should ask a real question.\u201d The briefings have been compared to rallies and make frustrating viewing. Some observers want the media to take a more combative approach. Chris Whipple, a writer, documentary maker and author of The Gatekeepers: How the White House Chiefs of Staff Define Every Presidency, said: \u201cGod bless Yamiche Alcindor but I think the rest of the press corps need to be more aggressive, not less aggressive. \u201cWhen you\u2019re confronted with a bully, you have to punch back. The press corps need to be more aggressive in holding the president\u2019s feet to the fire or just stop showing up.\u201d Whipple added: \u201cThe president\u2019s coronavirus briefings have been a disgrace. He is a fountain of misinformation, partisanship and point scoring that is the last thing you need in a time of crisis, especially in a pandemic when there is a premium on truth.\u201d Joe Lockhart, a former White House press secretary, argues the briefings are aimed at two audiences, with the first part, when Trump reads general remarks, aimed at all Americans, and the second, in which he spars with reporters, aimed at his hardline supporters. \u201cIt appeals to his base because they are suspicious of the media and it undermines the people who are telling the story straight,\u201d he said. \u201cHis base love it when he\u2019s obnoxious and when he talks down to reporters. But the one place he\u2019s had trouble is when reporters read his own words back to him.\u201d Lockhart, who hosts the Words Matter podcast and tweets a \u201cDaily White House Shadow briefing\u201d, added: \u201cTrump\u2019s entire strategy from day one has been to divide people. It\u2019s not a surprise that when everyone says he should help us to unify as a nation, he looks at it and says \u2018let\u2019s divide\u2019.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
