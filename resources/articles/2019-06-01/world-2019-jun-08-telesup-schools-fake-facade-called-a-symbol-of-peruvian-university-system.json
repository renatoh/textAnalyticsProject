Inside, however, students were surprised to find the stairs only reached the fourth floor. Drone photos published this week revealed that the top three floors were just a fa\u00e7ade supported by metal struts, in an episode which has cast an unflattering spotlight on Peru\u2019s booming private university industry \u2013 widely seen to be rife with sub-standard education and profiteering. Education inspectors released the pictures as they announced the university had failed to get accreditation for falling short of basic academic requirements. \u201cIt\u2019s a symbol of the facade that is the Peruvian university system,\u201d says Ricardo Cuenca, director of the Institute of Peruvian Studies. \u201cIt was presenting an image with nothing behind it.\u201d M\u00e1ximo Estupi\u00f1an, a spokesman for the university, has denied the trompe l\u2019oeil effect was a \u201cfalse facade.\u201d He described it as a \u201ccurtain wall, an architectural category and concept which was implemented for purely aesthetic reasons\u201d. Speaking to journalists on Thursday, Estupi\u00f1an said the fake three floors were a temporary construction while work on the building continued. Such arguments may be purely academic, as Sunedu, the state body which regulates higher education standards, blocked fresh student enrollments and gave Telesup two years to shut down for good. Meanwhile, most of Telesup\u2019s 20,000-odd students will complete their studies at licensed educational institutions, according to Sunedu\u2019s chief, Martin Benavides. \u201cWe evaluate the essential conditions for a university service. The infrastructure is one of them and [the facade] is part of the reality of this university,\u201d Benavides told local media. Over recent decades, Peru\u2019s tertiary education sector has grown dramatically, and the country currently has more than 140 universities \u2013 more than four times more than in the 1980s. Most are fee-paying private institutions which do not offer degrees which would be recognized outside the country, education officials admit. During the 1980s public universities were often used as recruiting grounds by the Shining Path, a violent Maoist guerrilla group. Then in the late 1990s, the now jailed former president Alberto Fujimori passed a law promoting for-profit private universities with deregulation and tax breaks. The subsequent boom meant what was on offer for students was \u201cdisorderly, of poor quality and very fragmented\u201d, Cuenca said. \u201cPoor higher education means poor quality professionals,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible sign that a country can grow economically but fail educationally.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
