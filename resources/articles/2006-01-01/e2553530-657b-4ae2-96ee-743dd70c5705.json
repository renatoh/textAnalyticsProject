We've got a corking meeting between arguably the two hottest groups in Britain at the moment; the incredible story of Britain's first band of black musicians; and an investigation into the resurgence of what we might call 'Nazi hate rock'. More to come as we cook it up... Then there is a handful of exciting new elements, as we're resizing the mag and fiddling around with a few bits and pieces. One thing we'd like to know the answer to is: what is the most depressing song ever written? Any thoughts on that posted here should make their way into our spruced-up Reviews section, so do let us know. Early contenders include 'Black Dog' by Nick Drake and 'The Winner Takes It All' by Abba. Any advances on that? Tomorrow evening sees the launch of this February's Brit awards, with an industry shindig in west London. These sort of events can be a living-death, or actually quite a laugh... There'll be a couple of acts playing, including the Kaiser Chiefs, who I suspect will be big winners on the night itself next month. More on this once we've popped along to the thing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
