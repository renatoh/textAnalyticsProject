The report found that toxic air is reducing life expectancy in the region by an average six months and, over the next century, estimates \u201c1.6 million life years\u201d will be lost unless action is taken. The report by IPPR North comes ahead of a national air pollution conference being held in Salford on Thursday. The thinktank\u2019s director, Sarah Longlands, said the \u201chuman cost of the air pollution crisis\u201d in the city could not be overstated. \u201cPeople\u2019s lives are being cut short, our children\u2019s health is being put at risk and this is before you even consider the \u00a31bn annual economic burden that poor quality air places on the local economy. \u201cFor too long, the debate on air pollution has been focused on London. But now for the first time, we understand the full extent of the problem in Greater Manchester. We simply cannot allow this to continue.\u201d The study says the Manchester region faces a similar air pollution challenge \u2013 caused principally by transport emissions \u2013 to London where the mayor Sadiq Khan recently outlined plans for an extended ultra low emissions zone. But it concludes Manchester has neither the powers nor the strategy to tackle the issue. The report found: Central Manchester has the highest rate of emergency hospital admissions for asthma in England, more than double the national average. North Manchester comes in second place. Manchester council ranks as the second worst in England for PM10 particulate pollution, which is linked to conditions such as lung cancer and asthma. Hotspots for dangerous air quality include Manchester\u2019s Oxford Road, which exceeded legal limits 90 times during 2016. It also found that the region has one of the worst polluting bus fleets in the UK, with 20% of the fleet made up of the most polluting vehicles, compared with just 10% in London. Only 15 buses are entirely electric, compared with more than 500 in London. The report calls on Greater Manchester\u2019s mayor, Andy Burnham \u2013 who will address Thursday\u2019s conference, to take urgent action and for the national government to give the city the powers and funds necessary to tackle air pollution. Alison Cook, policy director at the British Lung Foundation, said the report showed Manchester was one of the most polluted places in the UK. \u201cThis report provides more detail on the health impact of air pollution on the city than we\u2019ve had before,\u201d she said. \u201cAmbitious and concrete measures from the mayor and central government must now follow, such as rolling out charging zones in the most polluted areas.\u201d ClientEarth, which has successfully taken the government to court three times over its lack of action on air pollution said the study would make \u201cworrying reading\u201d for people in the city. \u201cWhile the UK government continues to drag its feet over its legal and moral duty to meet legal limits of air pollution in the shortest time possible, it is essential that local and regional leaders, including the mayor of Greater Manchester, do everything they can to protect people\u2019s right to breathe clean air.\u201d Burnham said the report set out in \u201cstark terms\u201d the level of threat air pollution poses to health in Greater Manchester. He said a range of measures were already in place or being planned, but added: \u201cWe also need a comprehensive national strategy to support our local work \u2013 backed by substantial, up-front investment from the government \u2013 so that we can all work together to tackle this serious problem that is affecting us all.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
