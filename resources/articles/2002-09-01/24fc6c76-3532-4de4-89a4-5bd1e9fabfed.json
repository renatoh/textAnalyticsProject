However, think hard before going it alone without the help of an estate agent. In reality, buying privately will mean months of chasing people and worrying that you haven't done everything you should. But if you do want to buy privately, read up about it first at property advice websites (see Primary resources, far right) or in books such as Adam Walker's Buying a House or Joseph Bradshaw's House Buying, Selling and Conveyancing. If you are looking for property online, begin by making your initial searches as broad as possible. The nature of having to type in your preferred budget and number of bedrooms, for example, means that you can often inadvertently rule out appropriate property by accident. You can narrow your searches later."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
