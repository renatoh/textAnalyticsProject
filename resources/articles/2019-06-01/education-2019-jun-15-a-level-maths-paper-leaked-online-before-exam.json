Images of the test paper by Edexcel appeared on social media on Thursday afternoon. The exam board\u2019s parent company, Pearson, said the images \u201cwere circulated in a very limited way\u201d before students sat the exam on Friday. \u201cHaving visited a small group of centres within scope of the investigation, we have identified one centre in serious breach of correct practice,\u201d the firm said. \u201cAll students should be reassured we have well-established processes in place to ensure no one will be advantaged or disadvantaged, and this paper will not have to be resat.\u201d Two questions from the paper first appeared on Twitter in a since-deleted post which offered students the whole paper for \u00a370. It is not the first time Pearson has had maths papers leaked. Last year, an A-level maths paper apparently appeared for sale online the night before thousands of students sat the exam. The company was also forced to make last-minute changes to two A-level papers in 2017 after receiving reports that some students had gained access to them in advance. Both leaks were investigated by the police, with evidence passed to the Crown Prosecution Service for consideration over whether criminal charges should be brought. In April, it was revealed that Pearson would pilot a scheme in which exam papers would be microchipped to track the date, time and location of each bundle. An online petition calling for the exam board to take the leak into consideration when it set grade boundaries has been signed by hundreds of students. The petition\u2019s creator, Jenny Li, described the situation as \u201cvery unfair\u201d for students who had not seen the paper before the exam. A student who sat the exam told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme he was \u201cfrustrated\u201d by the leak. \u201cI\u2019m not frustrated because I feel like I absolutely failed the paper; it wasn\u2019t that kind of frustration,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s more the frustration that I\u2019ve spent two years studying maths A-level only to realise that some students through some sort of opportunity could have not learned anything for two years \u2013 and just spent \u00a370 and got an A-level.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
