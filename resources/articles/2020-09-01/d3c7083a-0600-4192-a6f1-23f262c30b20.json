It was the result most would have predicted when Mitchell Starc knocked over Jason Roy and Joe Root with the first two deliveries of the day, and Eoin Morgan strolled out to the middle to face a hat-trick ball so soon after winning the toss. Yet with England rallying to 302 for seven thanks to Jonny Bairstow\u2019s 10th ODI century, and Australia slipping to 73 for five in reply, it needed Maxwell\u2019s 108 from 90 balls, allied with a 114-ball 106 from Carey, to inflict a first home series defeat in five years for the 50-over world champions. Justin Langer and Aaron Finch, coach and captain, will draw huge satisfaction from this win. Their side didn\u2019t just deliver without Steve Smith \u2013 absent again after his blow to the head six days ago \u2013 but also overcame a mental barrier that had seen two previous chases go awry on this six-match white-ball tour. It came after a rocky start to their pursuit under lights too as Chris Woakes capped off a fine individual summer across the Test and one-day formats by following his unbeaten 53 with the removals of Finch and Marcus Stoinis in the first five overs. And things then got worse for the tourists when the part-time spin of Root wiped out David Warner and Mitch Marsh in the space of six balls \u2013 the former bowled by a beauty \u2013 and Sam Billings ran out Marnus Labuschagne from cover in the 17th over. But over the course of the next 31 overs a sixth-wicket stand of 212 between Maxwell and Carey drove England to distraction, the former clearing a mere 66-yard boundary seven times in his second ODI century, the latter doing so twice en route to his first. England were left to rue handing both men a life \u2013 Carey was caught off a no-ball on nine when Jofra Archer overstepped, while Maxwell was dropped by Jos Buttler on 44 after Adil Rashid teased a thin edge \u2013 and their late dismissals weren\u2019t enough. Maxwell top-edged a sweep off Rashid with 18 still required off 15 balls, then Carey fell to a tumbling catch from Mark Wood that left Starc needing 10 from the final over. There was no wobble this time, however, with the fast bowler bookending an eventful day by cracking six and four off Rashid to win it with two balls to spare and send Australian roars echoing around Old Trafford. \u201cPlaying against Australia you are never home and dry,\u201c said Morgan afterwards. \u201c[But] it\u2019s been extremely positive on all fronts from where we were five months ago. To have a full set of [men\u2019s] international fixtures is huge for the game.\u201d This defeat, one that means England\u2019s men finish this bizarre international season with four series wins, one draw and a defeat, came despite the flashing blade of Bairstow delivering 112 from 126 deliveries, with 12 fours and two sixes. Like Maxwell later on, Bairstow enjoyed the short square boundary to one side that, allied with an unusual north-easterly blowing across Old Trafford, made bowling from the James Anderson End in particular a challenge all day. That said, Starc did not seem to mind these conditions \u2013 initially at least \u2013 when he inflicted England\u2019s worst start to an innings in their 752 ODIs by having Roy caught at backward point and trapping Root with a masterful inswinger. Morgan responded in typical fashion by going on the offensive, denying Starc his hat-trick before crunching a four through cover to kickstart a counterattacking partnership of 67 with Bairstow during the powerplay. Adam Zampa\u2019s introduction helped stem the bleeding as both Morgan (23) and Jos Buttler (eight) picked out catchers in the ring. But a sprightly 57 from Billings \u2013 including one pulled six off Pat Cummins that nearly left the bubble entirely \u2013 provided ideal support for Bairstow in a 114\u2011run partnership. Bairstow has slightly struggled for rhythm this summer but on the truest surface of the series he was back to his bullying best, needing 48 balls for his half-century and easing down a touch to reach three-figures off 116 when, with a whip of the wrists, he lifted a 90mph delivery from Cummins over the short side for six. Zampa eventually removed Billings via a top-edged sweep, becoming the first Australian spinner to take 10 wickets in an ODI series, and when an off-cutter from Cummins bowled Bairstow at the start of the 41st over, England sat 220 for six. Woakes stepped up, ensuring a record chase on the ground would be required with some inventive shots \u2013 including one remarkable deft four through the vacant slip area \u2013 that added 82 in the final 10 overs of England\u2019s innings. Starc in particular took some punishment during this late salvo but come the end of this epic match, his was a frown turned upside down."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
