Ex-Arsenal goalkeeper and sports commentator Bob Wilson said nobody had a bad word to say about him. \"I am just very privileged to have known him the way I got to know him,\" he told ITV. \"I think that if I had to give a tribute to Brian as a commentator it would be that I don't think there is anyone in the world of football, and football is a big world, who had a bad word to say about him.\" Moore joined ITV in 1968 and commentated on its flagship Midweek Sports Special from 1978 until 1986. He returned to commentating in 1999 at Sky Sports where he conducted a series of interviews with footballers of the past."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
