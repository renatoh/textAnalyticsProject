Hassan Rouhani was welcomed by Fran\u00e7ois Hollande at the French presidential residence earlier on Thursday during the first official visit by an Iranian president to the French capital in 17 years. \u201cLet us forget the resentment,\u201d the Iranian president said at the press conference with Hollande. \u201cWe are ready to turn the page.\u201d Hollande responded: \u201cIt\u2019s a new chapter of our relationship. I want that relationship to be useful, useful to both countries, useful to the region [Middle East] affected by wars, crises and tragedies.\u201d The two-hour meeting at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e finished with the announcement of the signing of a set of lucrative contracts between Iranian officials and French companies, worth billions of euros. Among them was a deal struck with Airbus for the purchase of 118 new commercial passenger planes. The car manufacturer Peugeot also signed a contract with the Iranian car company Iran Khodro for a joint venture worth \u20ac400m. French oil company Total also signed a contract with the national Iranian oil company to buy crude oil. Iran is adding an extra 500,000 barrels per day to its exports following the lifting of sanctions. The construction firm Vinci also signed a contract to develop Tehran\u2019s main international airport. Both leaders said the fight against terrorism was a priority but responded diplomatically on the issue of Syria, over which they have strong disagreements. \u201cWe must fight terrorism \u2026 We must help the Syrian people so that the Syrian people can build a sustainable future for the country,\u201d Rouhani said. \u201cThe main problem in Syria is not such and such person, the main issue is terrorism and Daesh,\u201d he added, regarding the fate of Bashar al-Assad, whom Tehran strongly supports. Hollande said: \u201cTerrorism is our sole enemy.\u201d In the morning, Rouhani delivered a major speech at Medef, France\u2019s main pro-business confederation in the presence of the French prime minister, Manuel Valls, and top French CEOs. The Iranian president said there was a clear sign that French companies were welcome to Tehran. \u201cFrance has announced that it is ready to once again enter Iran with a new energy and a new will. We have also come here today to welcome French entrepreneurs, investors to begin economic activities in Iran,\u201d Rouhani told the business leaders. Valls replied that Iran could count on France. Since Rouhani\u2019s arrival in Paris on Wednesday afternoon, Iranian officials held a series of closed-doors meetings in the hotel where he was staying. He was accompanied at the Medef gathering by a large number of his cabinet members, including the oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh. Valls said the French government was encouraging the business sector to take up opportunities in Iran. \u201cWe can open a new chapter,\u201d he said at Medef, addressing Rouhani. \u201cFrance is ready to mobilise its business sector \u2026 for modernisation of your country. I want to put it in a few simple but strong words: Iran can count on France.\u201d Rouhani said the lifting of sanctions with the implementation of the nuclear deal two weeks ago had paved the way for an improvement in economic ties. \u201cWhat we experienced under sanctions was a lose-lose situation that was the result of a wrong policy, a wrong policy that hurt everyone \u2026 but today we should seize the opportunity of the era after sanctions,\u201d he said. \u201cFrance doesn\u2019t need any permission from any other country [to enter business with Iran] and it\u2019s not receiving orders from above and that\u2019s very important for us.\u201d Medef\u2019s president, Pierre Gattaz, said French businesses had been impressed by the quality of the relations with their Iranian interlocutors. \u201cThis new era is already under way. The Iranian door has always been open to French companies.\u201d Also on the stage at Medef was Mohsen Jalalpour, the head of Iran\u2019s chamber of commerce, industries, mines and agriculture. In an interview with the Guardian on Wednesday, Jalalpour said Rouhani\u2019s administration had prioritised the private sector. \u201cSanctions were a bitter experience for Iran,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThe lesson was that we can\u2019t only rely on having relations with half of the world and not care about the other half. For over eight decades, Iran has been heavily dependent on oil and the government has played a big role in the economy but this administration is pursuing a new approach.\u201d Alstom, the French electricity generation and rail transport firm, is seeking contracts to work on an expansion of the metro in Tehran and to build two more lines in the city of Mashhad and participate in the electrification of the 600-mile Tehran-Mashhad railway. The French industrial group Bouygues and A\u00e9roports de Paris are in talks with Iran to construct the country\u2019s largest transport project, the second terminal at Tehran\u2019s Imam Khomeini international airport. \u201cAlstom is mobilised to participate in the development of transport infrastructure in Iran thanks to our long successful history with this country and its new focus on railway activities,\u201d Philippe Delleur, senior vice-president at Alstom, told the Guardian. \u201cIt covers both urban transport and mainlines.\u201d Alisher Ali, chairman of Silk Road Finance, an investment group focused on Iran and Eurasian countries, said: \u201cPresident Rouhani\u2019s visit to Europe and signing numerous multibillion-euro deals with leading European companies was a strong testimony to Iran\u2019s keen desire to boost its economy with massive modernisation and technological upgrade of its key industries including oil and gas, transportation and infrastructure.\u201d He added: \u201cI believe Iran with its huge pent-up demand and investment requirements represents a unique growth opportunity for many European and international companies. I reckon there will be a wave of European companies actively entering the Iranian market starting from this year.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
