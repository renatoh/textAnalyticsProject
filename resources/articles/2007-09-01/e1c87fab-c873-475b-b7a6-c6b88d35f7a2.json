The environmental-policy report released yesterday was not only the last of the pack; it lived up to expectations that it would be the most radical. In some Tories' eyes it is also the most marginal. \"I haven't read it,\" one official at Central Office said last week. \"And, frankly, I'm not going to.\" That from someone responsible for whipping up media interest in the thing. One feels his pain. Weighing in at 547 pages, and drawing on the evidence of nearly 500 people, the report is big enough to be intimidating. Size is part of the point, of course: whatever he makes of the recommendations, party leader David Cameron now has paperback proof that he takes environmental issues seriously. At yesterday's launch the journalists were far outnumbered by environmentalists, all of whom apparently felt duty-bound to thank the authors publicly for taking the issues seriously. This was less a press conference than a love-in; amusing at first, but also saddening as it highlighted the government's long-standing neglect of environmental policy. Not that the report is mere tummy-tickling. It is both serious and - not always the case with other reviews - coherent. Compare it, for instance, with the collected thoughts of John Redwood on economic policy. Mr Redwood is less two brains than three thinktanks, all apparently in overdrive. Expand the airports! Put cycle lanes on pavements! Get rid of horse passports! These pressing ideas and so many more were in last month's review, in what amounted to the mother of all brain-dumps. John Gummer and Zac Goldsmith's report, by contrast, hangs together well. It seeks to answer a question posed explicitly in the report: \"What would a low-carbon British economy look like, and how do we get there?\" Many of the answers it comes up with are good ones - and so simple they should embarrass the Labour government. Lower council taxes and stamp duty for energy-efficient homes; reducing business rates for green offices and sharply raising taxes on landfill. Some of this has been caricatured as taxing the poor, by attacking plasma televisions or putting VAT on domestic flights. Inevitable perhaps, but also unfair; as Mr Gummer noted yesterday, the rightwing press have harped on about higher taxes on gas-guzzling cars, while ignoring the offsetting proposal to make greener ones cheaper. Indeed the authors have worked hard to make their proposals serviceable to their party. Not only is there much emphasis on not raising the overall tax burden, but the report also tries to integrate its green agenda with Tory concerns. What the party terms the \"broken society\" is partly blamed on industrial sprawl - which also happens to be environmentally unfriendly. But this marriage of conservatism with environmentalism can be a strained one. The report has a lot to say about things that individuals and organisations can do to mitigate climate change. Uncontroversial enough, especially when every glossy magazine has its top 10 tips for reducing your carbon footprint. On bigger questions the answers are less convincing. There is huge emphasis on using the market but, in his review last year, Sir Nicholas Stern called climate change \"the biggest market failure the world has ever seen\". The market and the environment often require very different things. Even if one skews it to reward greener behaviour, the market relies on selling goods - and consumption is often damaging to the environment. The authors have no real answer to this conundrum: attempting to do so would leave Mr Cameron with a real political challenge. Still, this is a thoughtful report - and far more radical on environmental policy than anything produced by Labour's high command."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
