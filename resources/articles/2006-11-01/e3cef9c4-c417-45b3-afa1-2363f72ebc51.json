It doesn't represent anything meaningful these days, is dominated by two or three industries and says nothing about the state of UK plc. Few of the institutional investors who were invited to comment on the make-up of our supposedly blue-chip index have gone this far, but they should. This is a good moment to give the Footsie a proper shake-up. Once upon a time, pure size - the basis of the current weightings - might have been a sensible way to compile a index. The old way of doing things, the FT30, in which companies were selected to reflect the composition of British industry, was inflexible. When whole industries, such as textiles, virtually disappeared, the FT30 couldn't keep up. But the age of the multinational has arguably created something worse. Four companies - BP, Shell, HSBC and Glaxo - now represent 29% of the Footsie. The top 10 account for 49%, and the bulk of their earnings are made outside Britain. The rush among mining companies to list in London has created another oddity. The Footsie has eight miners, though they barely have a mine in Britain between them. And, while banking and financial services is certainly big in Britain, surely 22.5% of the Footsie is overdoing it. The institutions' concerns centre on standards of corporate governance among some of the new arrivals. The likes of Kazakhmys, where the chairman is also the new chief executive and he and his chums own two-thirds of the stock, would fail most tests of best boardroom practice. As for online gambler PartyGaming, now ejected, it was the best possible advert for a quality threshold; apart from the fact that US authorities considered its activities illegal, Party's trading record was too short. The make-up of the Footsie matters because so much \"widows and orphans\" cash tracks it. It is also the benchmark against which most fund managers measure themselves. Not many, for example, dare to ignore both BP and Shell, together 16% of the index: get that call wrong, and a manager will struggle to make up the ground elsewhere. That has bred \"passive\" tracking - fund managers charging fees for active management but exercising little true judgment. The result is a poor deal for small investors and inefficient allocation of capital, a gift for hedge fund managers prepared to back their opinions. Should there be a cap on weightings for individual stocks, or industries? Should there be a separate index for companies registered in Britain? These are questions to be asked, but the debate surely goes deeper than which companies fit today's corporate governance fashions. A smoking formula Buy asset-rich companies and run them better. This was the old Hanson formula and it is still working for the successor companies, a decade after the empire built by Lords Hanson and White was split into four pieces. Two parts - the Energy Group, containing Eastern Electricity, and US-based Millennium Chemicals - attracted bids soon after the great de-merger. The two that survived are doing splendidly. Imperial Tobacco reminded us yesterday that \u00a3100 invested in it at independence is now worth \u00a3800. For rump Hanson, the building materials business, the figure is a more modest \u00a3334, but still compares favourably with \u00a3209 returned by the All-Share index. Could it have been done within the old conglomerate structure? Almost certainly not. Imperial Tobacco was the cash-cow then and would not have been given freedom to pursue acquisitions in Germany and eastern Europe. Yet the day-to-day management disciplines haven't changed a jot. The Imperial story is still about generating cash and concentrating on returns on capital. It is precisely what private equity strives to do, often with the kicker of financial engineering. You might not like tobacco, but it's harder to argue with the broad investment philosophy. Discontent in store Ah, the generosity of millionaires. The top folk at Debenhams, and the private equity bosses, did very well for themselves by transforming the department store group and bringing it back to the stock market. A bonus for the staff seemed a nice gesture, and \u00a315m sounded a tidy sum - it worked out at \u00a3700 a head on average. Except the cheques have now arrived, and part-timers at the bottom of the corporate pile are discovering the meaning of averages. Some are getting just \u00a325, and, for them, it's not even a cheque but a gift voucher to be spent at Debenhams. As a way to breed discontent in the ranks, this could hardly be bettered.
