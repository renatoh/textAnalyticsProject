It had been hoped that, following his half-time introduction in the 7-0 rout of Everton last Wednesday after a six-week absence with a groin problem, Henry would be fit to play in Saturday's showpiece against Manchester United. However, the France international's achilles injury again flared up after that match and he was unable to recover in time for Sunday's trip to Birmingham, prompting his manager Ars\u00e8ne Wenger to rule him out of the Cup final. While Manchester United have only minor injury problems, Paul Scholes yesterday reported to be struggling with a groin strain, Arsenal could face a striker crisis. Jose Antonio Reyes also failed to feature against Birmingham, meaning that Dennis Bergkamp and Robin van Persie can currently expect to start. At least Wenger can again count on Fredrik Ljungberg, another who has been suffering with a long-term injury, to his hip, this season. \"I think I will be available,\" said Ljungberg. \"It is still swollen but it felt good in the [Birmingham] game. I can play with it.\" Arsenal's equanimity has been further disturbed, with the Premier League's independent commission into allegations of an illegal approach by Chelsea to Ashley Cole set to take place in London's Bryanston Place today and tomorrow. Reports yesterday suggested that Cole's agent Jonathan Barnett had made unscrupulous demands in the course of contract negotiations with Arsenal. The suggestion was met with Barnett's and Cole's indignation. \"Ashley is furious,\" said Barnett. \"If anyone had asked him if it was true, he would have told them it isn't. For me to have a fee would have required that I take a percentage of his salary. Since no contract was negotiated, there cannot have been a fee.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
