In the event, Ravel's evocation of Austro-Hungarian implosion wasn't quite the cataclysmic experience one anticipated, largely because Gergiev didn't always take it to the requisite extremes. The orchestral sound, with its deliberately clotted colours and ironic exaggeration, was breathtaking. Yet there were occasional slips in momentum and pressure, the mix of sleaze and apocalypse was understated, and the final climax was consequently not as annihilating as it could have been. Gergiev followed it with a pair of late-20th-century works in which texture is all important. Ligeti's Atmosph\u00e8res, with its constantly shifting blobs of sound, generated an eerie sense of voids and spaces. Henri Dutilleux's Myst\u00e8re de l'Instant proved more problematic: in place of the original score for 24 solo strings, Gergiev used a version for full string orchestra, its opaque sound detracting from a delicate work that aspires to convey the fragility of individual impressions glimpsed in the here and now. After the interval, however, came Stravinsky's Petrushka, a great performance for which Gergiev and the LSO were in their element. The balance between emotional narrative, urban clamour and modernist abstraction was immaculately sustained. Unlike many interpreters, Gergiev has conducted the work many times in the theatre, and every tempo, point of emphasis and shift in mood seemed unerringly right. He has become variable of late, but when he strikes this sort of form, Gergiev has few equals \u2013 in Stravinsky, at any rate.
