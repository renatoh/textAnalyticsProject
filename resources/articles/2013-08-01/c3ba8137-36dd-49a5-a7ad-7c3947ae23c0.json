To applaud at the end of the movement or not? The music's frenzy demands applause. Concert convention says not until after the finale. Sunday's much-praised performance at the Edinburgh festival reignited the usual argument. Many applauded after the third movement \u2013 some even cheered. Others remained stubbornly silent. The Guardian's line on this issue is predictably liberal \u2013 in favour of applauding (or even booing) if it seems right. But the big etiquette talking-point in the Usher Hall on Sunday was not about applause. It was whether it is right \u2013 as happened \u2013 to admit latecomers after the first movement. On this, liberal instinct falters. Let audiences cheer or catcall as they prefer. But, please, don't allow latecomers in until the interval."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
