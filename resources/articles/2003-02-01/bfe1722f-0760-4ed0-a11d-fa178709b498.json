But whoa, you're probably thinking - isn't that yesterday's news? Sure, the dot.com boom has all but faded away and yes, it is easier to pull in a monastery than get a job in IT at the moment, but things will only get better. Almost every major company - and certainly every retailer - now has a web presence allowing shoppers to buy online. And as last Christmas' sales figures showed, the percentage of goods bought online looks set to grow. A recent survey in the US by Forrester Research predicted that business-to-business trading over the internet in the US will grow from $43m in 1999 to $1.3trn in 2003, an annual growth of 99%. That doesn't sound like a sector that's dying; it's just a bit quiet at the moment, that's all. Postgraduate courses in this area generally divide into two neat groups - the setting up and running of e-commerce, and the physical creation of e-commerce systems (computer programming). Most of the former tend to be run by business schools, while the latter are more usually allied to computer/technology departments. In both cases there is a large choice of institutions offering courses. The MSc offered by Aston Business School is a good example. It is open to holders of any degree and very much concentrates on the business of e-commerce. Core modules include accounting, developing business systems, e-business research and strategy, along with e-commerce law and ethics and the om nipresent marketing. There is a technical element to the course - but it's more a case of understanding what the technology is capable of doing, rather than creating the systems themselves. Which brings us neatly on to the specialist e-commerce technology courses. These are open only to students with a first degree in computing, and significant previous experience of computer programming is required. They provide advanced skills in internet database technology, internet software development and e-commerce network considerations. According to Dick Williams, a senior fellow and lecturer on the University of Essex's MSc: \"When we started offering these courses three years ago all 18 students walked straight into jobs - now it's really quite difficult, but it can get better. \"After all, this is an age in which the technology is changing very quickly and systems will have to be updated. So e-commerce is not going to go away. There's no doubt that the demand for programmers will pick up again.\" If you share his optimism and this is your chosen field, now's the time to train. If things start picking up again, who's to say the job market for qualified graduates won't go as bananas as it did last time? milesbrignall@blueyonder.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
