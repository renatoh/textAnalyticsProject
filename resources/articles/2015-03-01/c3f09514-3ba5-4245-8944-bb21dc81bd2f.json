Downing Street is studying detailed proposals, from a consortium of the Guardian, the Telegraph and YouTube, to hold a debate between five of Britain\u2019s political leaders on 26 or 27 March. The debate, which would be made available to the broadcasters, would involve David Cameron, Ed Miliband, Nick Clegg, the Ukip leader Nigel Farage and the Green party leader Natalie Bennett. Farage has accepted an invitation to the debate, which would be held in a city outside London and would be jointly chaired by the Guardian\u2019s Jonathan Freedland and the Telegraph\u2019s Emma Barnett. Shapps described the proposal as an interesting idea after the consortium suggested moving forward the date of its event to accommodate the wishes of Cameron. In a letter to party leaders, the media organisations say they are now offering to move forward the date of its proposed debate by a few days \u2013 to before the so-called short campaign \u2013 again inviting the five main UK-wide parties. The nationalist parties from Scotland and Wales would be excluded, as well as the Democratic Unionists. Shapps told BBC2\u2019s Daily Politics programme: \u201cI still think it would be preferable to have it on the main TV channels. But if the broadcasters can\u2019t sort it out then yes this seems like a plausible way forward to me.\u201d A senior Tory said: \u201cWe are prepared to look at the proposal.\u201d It is understood that No 10 welcomed an offer by the consortium to send over more details after the revised offer was sent to the five parties early on Wednesday. Labour is responding cautiously because it is determined to ensure the terrestrial debates go ahead. Lord Grade, the former chair of the BBC board of governors and a Tory peer, has accused the broadcasters of bullying the prime minister by threatening to use an empty chair in his place if he declines to take part in a head-to-head debate with Miliband. But Lord Hall, director general of the BBC, told the Commons European scrutiny committee last night: \u201cWe are not bullies. I think it is important to keep our eyes on the key thing here. We want the debates to take place because the public wants the debates to take place \u2026 let us see if, with a little bit of goodwill, we can make something happen.\u201d There would be no time constraints for an online debate, and the leaders would face 10 questions \u2013 one more than Cameron, Clegg and Gordon Brown faced in the terrestrial TV debates before the 2010 election. The questions would be submitted by Guardian and Telegraph readers and would be selected by a panel consisting of a representative from each organisation plus an independent figure. The questions would be asked by Freedland and Barnett and by YouTube viewers, who would prerecord them. Farage told the Telegraph: \u201cScrutiny is an important part of democracy, and for this reason I am delighted to accept the Telegraph, Guardian and YouTube\u2019s invitation to this debate \u2013 so that I can make the case to the British electorate on why they should vote Ukip. I hope that the prime minister will muster up the courage to stand by his own words, and show up to try and defend his record in government.\u201d The renewed focus on the online format came after Miliband accused the prime minister of resorting to \u201cpathetic, feeble excuses\u201d in response to Downing Street\u2019s announcement that Cameron would refuse to take part in a head-to-head televised debate with him. Miliband mocked the prime minister for \u201closing his nerve\u201d after No 10 rejected the format and timetable for debates proposed by the broadcasters that would be held after the dissolution of parliament on 30 March. The broadcasters have proposed two debates among the seven main party leaders in early- and mid-April and one head-to-head debate between Miliband and Cameron on 30 April. The prime minister has agreed to take part in one debate with six other party leaders which must take place in the week beginning 23 March \u2013 before the formal start of the \u201cshort\u201d election campaign."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
