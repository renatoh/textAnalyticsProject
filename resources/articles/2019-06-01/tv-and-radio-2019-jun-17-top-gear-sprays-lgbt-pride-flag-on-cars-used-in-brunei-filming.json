Thought to be the first time the BBC Two motoring programme has shown solidarity with the LGBT community, the move appears to back the claim made by the new lineup of Freddie Flintoff, Paddy McGuinness and Chris Harris that they would bring a \u201cdifferent vibe\u201d to the revamped show \u2013 which returned on Sunday night. Flintoff told the Guardian he and his colleagues were horrified after hearing the announcement about the imposition of the death penalty by the south-east Asian country just after they filmed a segment there at the end of March. \u201cWe would never have filmed in Brunei had the law been announced beforehand. Like millions of other people around the world, I utterly condemn Brunei\u2019s actions. No one deserves to be stoned to death, whoever they love. Love is love,\u201d said Flintoff. In the segment he and McGuinness drive two rare cars across Borneo with the aid of Gurkha soldiers to the palace of the Sultan of Brunei, a car collector, where guards give them a lukewarm reception. As the Top Gear team landed in the UK after the filming they heard Brunei had just announced it planned to impose death by stoning as a punishment for gay sex and adultery, as part of the country\u2019s implementation of sharia law. Following international outcry led by celebrities including George Clooney and Elton John, last month Brunei\u2019s Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah extended a moratorium on the death penalty, saying that it would not be enforced. However, writing in the Guardian, Flintoff said: \u201cEven though it has since been claimed that the laws will not be enforced, the threat still stands, and even the threat is an appalling abuse of human rights.\u201d The Top Gear team considered dropping the segment but, instead, in an unusual move for the show \u2013 which has a history of culturally insensitive jokes under former presenters Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond \u2013 they decided to spray the cars used in the film in the colours of the rainbow flag and display them on air later in the series. \u201cIn the last couple of months we have thought very hard about dropping the film entirely but we shot it before the change in the law, and both the Gurkhas and other Bruneians worked incredibly hard to make it happen. We don\u2019t want all their efforts to be for nothing. So we\u2019ve decided to go ahead and show it [and] we\u2019ve given the cars a little makeover,\u201d explained Flintoff. The message of tolerance contrasts with Amazon\u2019s car show The Grand Tour, presented by Clarkson, May and Hammond, which the singer Will Young criticised in January for its \u201cshaming homophobic narratives\u201d. Top Gear\u2019s new presenting team is aiming to modernise the BBC\u2019s multimillion-pound brand by showing \u201cemotional depth\u201d, with hugs amid the competitive physicality, car reviews and boyish banter. With the third new lineup in as many years \u2013 after Clarkson was sacked for punching a producer \u2013 BBC Studios is gambling that the chemistry of the new trio can halt a ratings decline and get its series back on track. As Harris, who was in the two previous iterations of Top Gear, explained: \u201cWe live in a different world. The new Top Gear will embrace all sorts of emotions.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
