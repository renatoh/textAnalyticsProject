The board, which finished its interim meeting in Dublin this week, is also speeding up decision-making by setting up an executive committee. \"This was our most important meeting since the game turned professional nine years ago,\" said the IRB chairman Syd Millar. \"The new funding will drive the growth of the game and ensure that World Cups become more competitive.\" The eight foundation unions will be represented on the 10-strong executive committee, along with Argentina, while the IRB has delayed making a decision on whether there should be a global season pending a financial review. Gloucester's France hooker Olivier Azam is out for three months after having a shoulder operation and his compatriot S\u00e9bastien Chabal will next Tuesday appear before a disciplinary committee after being accused of stamping during Sale's defeat at Bath last weekend. Scotland's coach Matt Williams has kept faith with the side that scored 100 points against Japan last weekend for the second of two Tests against Australia in Glasgow tomorrow.
