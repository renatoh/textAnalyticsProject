Here we were personally under attack.\u201d The artist, who has a mohican, is now instantly recognisable to most Brazilians. In March, he featured in a sexually explicit video that was tweeted by Jair Bolsonaro, the country\u2019s far-right president. The 40-second clip, filmed at a gay street party during the S\u00e3o Paulo carnival, showed Castello standing on a taxi shelter, exposing his backside and being urinated on. \u201cI don\u2019t feel comfortable showing it,\u201d Bolsonaro told his 3.5 million followers, \u201cbut we have to expose the truth so the population are aware of their priorities. This is what Brazilian carnival street parties have turned into.\u201d The next day, the far-right leader stayed on the offensive, tweeting: \u201cWhat is a golden shower?\u201d In their first interview since Bolsonaro\u2019s attack, Castello and Jeffe, the other man in the video, say their actions \u2013 which were captured on a mobile phone and posted to Twitter by an anonymous user \u2013 were actually part of a three-hour guerrilla performance by a six-person art collective. They take the name Ediy, which means \u201carse\u201d in Pajub\u00e1, Brazilian Portuguese gay slang. \u201cWe want to perform in public places,\u201d Jeffe says. \u201cPlaces where this sort of thing is not expected. We refer to it as \u2018hacking the imagination\u2019. But there is a context to the performance that the president\u2019s video removed.\u201d Walking through the crowds, they would intermittently stop to interact with each other, their gestures alternating between sensual dance and sexual acts. In the video, Castello twerks for the crowd with his finger in his anus. Urination features heavily in the rest of the work. Luiza Rolla, an actor who works with the collective, explains: \u201cWe had the idea to form a pornography collective in January. We had already started shooting videos. Art and pornography are so related \u2013 pornography has long been used in the production of art. Both express the desires of a society.\u201d Bolsonaro\u2019s reactionary rhetoric has plunged the country into a culture war. Numerous art exhibitions and theatre performances, many with queer themes, have been forced to close, either through direct political interference or from concerns about the safety of performers. Most recently, a show featuring nudity \u2013 by the Rio de Janeiro collective \u00c9s Uma Maluca \u2013 was cancelled after an intervention from the Rio state governor, Wilson Witzel, a close ally of the president. Carnival is one of Brazil\u2019s biggest tourist draws. In April, however, the president said the country should not welcome gay visitors. \u201cIf you want to come here and have sex with a woman, go for your life,\u201d he told journalists. \u201cBut we can\u2019t let this place become known as a gay tourism paradise. Brazil can\u2019t be a country of the gay world, of gay tourism. We have families.\u201d \u201cIt has been hard,\u201d says Castello, of life since Bolsonaro\u2019s tweet. \u201cWe were afraid of reprisals. We left the city to protect ourselves.\u201d Nor were their fears misplaced. In the three months leading up to Bolsonaro\u2019s election, homophobic hate crimes rose by 75%. According to the charity Grupo Gay de Bahia, 141 gay and trans people have been killed in Brazil this year. Yet, despite the dangers, the artists have returned to performance. Last month, the group \u2013 some naked, some dressed as animals or in PVC \u2013 performed at Esponja, an arts space in central S\u00e3o Paulo before an audience of 70 people. One person battered a naked man with a dildo strapped to their knee. Two other members of the collective tore off a man\u2019s clothes with their teeth. Much of the event was broadcast live via a pornography website. Their work is certainly provocative but it is also steeped in theory: they cite Judith Butler\u2019s gender studies and the Spanish philosopher Paul B Preciado\u2019s writing on identity as inspiration. On sale were DIY publications with such titles as The Cis Gender Does Not Exist and Hate Towards Straights. They want their work to be considered social commentary as much as titillation, they explain. Castello\u2019s solo work includes a 2017 short sci-fi film set in a post-apocalyptic future inhabited by sexually liberated cyborgs. The group is formed, they claim, of \u201cdissident bodies\u201d and their work constitutes art because it is against pornography, which \u201ccolonises and shrinks our sexuality\u201d. In the immediate aftermath of Bolsonaro\u2019s post, the pair issued a legal letter saying that as artistic acts, performed during a cultural event, their actions were protected under Brazilian law. But given that so much of the far-rightwing criticism of the arts frames it as depraved, do Ediy\u2019s works not play into the president\u2019s hands? Jeffe says their work addresses bigger issues than just Brazil\u2019s current political climate. \u201cIt\u2019s about undermining the social structure that we live under and confronting the language of morality.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not about left wing or right wing,\u201d says Castello. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of criticism from the left too, even from gay people; people who have said that what we do is too much and that it will cause problems. \u201cPushing ahead with more performances, despite the risks, is a way of showing who we really are and what our work is actually about. We want to mimic pornography, but what we do is more than porn.\u201d \u201cWe want to remove sex from being a subject shrouded in privacy,\u201d adds Rollo. \u201cWe should all be open about our sexuality.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
