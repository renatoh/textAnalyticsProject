As we approach the centre, the roads are virtually gridlocked. The inevitable sound of blaring car horns is equalled by the utterly ineffectual, chirruping chorus of bicycle bells. Eventually, with a lot of shouting and three-wheeled brinkmanship, the throng manages to disentangle itself and make some movement towards the next intersection. Rush hour in Dhaka may be costly in time, but it is great theatre. The mention of Bangladesh is more likely to conjure up images of cyclones, flooding and famine than that of an appealing holiday destination. Lying at the mouth of the delta of the Indian subcontinent's largest river system, the country is more vulnerable than most to natural disasters. However, Bangladesh is also home to fantastic scenery, abundant wildlife, a rich culture, friendly people - and the longest beach in the world. The human warmth extended to visitors is genuine; eclipsed by the varied splendours of India, Bangladesh sees far fewer tourists than it deserves. In the old part of Dhaka, south of the centre, huge, rusty ships dock at Sadar Ghat. The action is frenetic as cargo is loaded and unloaded by ranks of alarmingly thin men in tartan sarongs and turbans. Their loads are enormous - get under their feet at your own peril. We took a boat out on to the river, which teems with crafts large and small, like a constantly changing floating village. Apart from the absorbing atmosphere of winding streets and the busy waterfront, the old part of Dhaka is also home to some important historical sites. In particular, the 17th century Moghul Lalbagh Fort, and the fascinating Ahsan Manzil Palace Museum, built in 1872, partially destroyed by a tornado in 1888, abandoned, then squatted by homeless people until its restoration almost 100 years later. From Dhaka we go to Chittagong, the second-largest city and jumping off point for a trip to the Chittagong hill tracts. Chittagong itself gives testimony to the past occupation of the area by European invaders. Firstly the Portuguese, leaving behind them a substantial Christian population, and subsequently the British. There are also a number of impressive mosques in the old town. Most notably the Shahi Jama-e-Mashid, which looks more military than religious, and the Quadam Mubarak, which predates the 17th century. Before visiting the hill tracts, it is a good idea to pay a visit to the Ethnological Museum, which gives a comprehensive insight into the tribal people of Bangladesh and their history. An hour's drive south, on the main road to Cox's Bazaar, we take a turn towards the hills. Soon the rice paddies give way to low but steep jungle hills, cut through with streams and ravines. It looks like a tropical Devon. Culturally, this area looks to south-east Asia rather than Bengal. Orange-clad Buddhist monks walk past stupas - shrines - and the faces of the villagers could just as easily be from Burma or even the northern hills of Thailand. Although incredibly scenic, the area is poor and there is friction between the Bengali settlers brought in by the government, who work the land for crops, and the indigenous people, who live only on what the jungle provides. Continuing due south, a three-hour drive brings us to Cox's Bazaar, a resort boasting the longest beach in the world and a number of excellent hotels. The main shore is thronged with domestic tourists riding horses, throwing hoops at sticks, flinging Frisbees, eating every kind of snack imaginable and paddling ankle-deep in the warm surf. They are tailed by armies of pushy-but-friendly kids selling inventive trinkets fashioned from seashells. More like a fair than a beach, it is gloriously tacky. A short walk away, I discover a beach shared only with those who make their living from the sea. Whole villages are built at the edge of the shore and at sunset the fishermen bring in their nets to sort through the catch. You can walk for miles at your own pace, but it is probably a bad idea to be anywhere too remote after dark since. At night, the beaches are not to be considered completely safe. Bangladesh may be the world's most crowded country, it may also be one most renowned for drama and disaster. But, conversely, it is not tragedy that leaves an abiding impression on the visitor. It is precisely the lack of drama that makes Bangladesh such a pleasant place. It is the charm of the towns and the slow, friendly pace of the countryside that make their marks on the senses. Way to go Getting there A number of carriers fly to Bangladesh. Both Dhaka and Chittagong have international airports. Although Biman Bangladesh Airlines, the national carrier, may seem like the natural option to go for, it is probably worth thinking twice before using them. They are cursed with horrendous delays and questionable standards of service. It is necessary to get a visa before you go to Bangladesh. These cost \u00a340 and are processed in a day. Where to stay There is a reasonable selection of good accommodation in the major cities in Bangladesh. Cox's Bazaar has some excellent hotels because it is a thriving domestic resort. Getting around There is a reliable, if slightly creaky, rail network. It is best to travel first class as second-class carriages tend to be crowded. Roads are often good, but drivers tend to take serious risks and there are an enormous number of traffic accidents. It is relatively cheap to hire a car with a driver. For short distances in towns, cycle rickshaws are ubiquitous. They cost between five taka and ten taka (6-12p), depending on the length of the journey. Biman runs internal flights to all the major destinations, although delays are frequent. Rival, private company GMG runs a more efficient alternative service. Bangladesh's extensive river network affords the opportunity to see the heart and soul of the country, but they it is a leisurely means of transport. The misnamed 'Rocket' paddle steamer provides a great, if slow, way to get from Dhaka to Khulna if you are planning a trip to the Sundarbans. Where to go and what to do The best time to visit Bangladesh is between October and February when the weather is dry and not too hot. In April and May the heat is uncomfortable and after that the rains come, making travel difficult. We visited Dhaka and the south of the country, but Bangladesh has a great deal else to offer. North of the capital is the hilly area of Sylhet, often called the land of \"two leaves and a bud\" because it is dominated by tea gardens. If you want to see the largest mangrove swamp in the world, full of an amazing amount of wildlife including the Royal Bengal Tiger, head to the Sundarbans National Park south of Khulna. You will need a permit and a guide to take a boat into the park. Warning Bangladesh is generally a safe and friendly country. However, in the Chittagong hill tracts separatist extremists have been known to kidnap foreigners for ransom and publicity. It is a good idea to seek out up to date local knowledge before going to this area."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
