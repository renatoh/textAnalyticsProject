Darren Campbell, who ran the second leg when the team won gold in Athens last summer, is suffering from tonsillitis while Christian Malcolm, his immediate replacement, has delayed his flight to the team camp in Finland because he has not recovered from a pelvic injury. Chris Lambert, the former AAA 200m champion, earmarked as another potential replacement, may not even run at all. When he arrives, he faces a fitness test to see if he will play any part in the championships. It could mean an instant promotion for the 18-year-old Craig Pickering who won the 100m at the European Junior Championships in Lithuania last month - and who is only in the team to gain experience. The 4x100m relay team hold Britain's best hope of a men's gold medal as they look to repeat their Athens triumph at a world championships that is slowly becoming devalued by the absence of many leading names. Britain will be without the triple jumper Phillips Idowu, the Commonwealth Games silver medallist who has withdrawn with injury. The Jamaican Asafa Powell, the 100m world record holder, is missing after failing to recover from the injury he sustained at last week's Norwich Union London Grand Prix at Crystal Palace, while yesterday Jan Zelezny, the 39-year-old three-times Olympic and world javelin champion, also pulled out after injuring his achilles tendon in Oslo last week. \"My main problem is the foot that was operated on.\" said Zelezny It doesn't hurt that much but the qualification is followed immediately with the finals the next day. This is what I am most worried about. It's going to be an odd feeling to watch an event that theoretically I could be in.\" The loss of Campbell, Malcolm and Lambert would be a a serious blow to the British team. \"It is unfortunate because all the athletes in the relay team are committed to coming here [to Turku],\" said Dave Collins, UK Athletics' national performance director and team manager. \"We have done relay practices with three of the four from Athens out on the track and you'll be looking at the possibility of the insertion of one athlete into what is a well-drilled outfit.\" Campbell is the team captain but he failed to make either the 100m or 200m events. He will be here, if well enough, as much as a mentor to the younger members of the squad. He ran the second leg in Britain's victory in Athens but Malcolm, who is in the individual 200m, proved an able replacement for Campbell at the European Cup in Florence in June where the quartet were also triumphant."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
