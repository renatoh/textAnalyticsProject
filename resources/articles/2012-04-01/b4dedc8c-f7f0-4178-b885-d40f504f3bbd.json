The reclusive 77-year-old twins, owners of the Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph, have been named at the top of the Sunday Times Rich List with assets valued at \u00a32.25bn. The brothers, who also own the Ritz Hotel and Littlewoods mail order business, increased their wealth by \u00a350m over last year's rich list. Northern &amp; Shell owner Richard Desmond also increased his wealth, cracking the \u00a31bn mark despite ordering sweeping cuts at Express Newspapers \u2013 home to the Daily Express, Sunday Express, Daily Star and Daily Star Sunday \u2013 to save cash. Viscount Rothermere and family, controlling shareholder of Daily Mail publisher DMGT, increased their wealth by \u00a330m to \u00a3760m to cement third spot. The 20-strong list also includes Sir Martin Sorrell, the founder of the world's largest advertising group WPP, who saw his estimated wealth rise almost 18% year-on-year to \u00a3174m to rank 12th. Alan Parker, the founder and chairman of Brunswick group, waved the flag for the PR industry with a \u00a395m fortune to rank 19th.
