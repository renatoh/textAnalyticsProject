A woman spending the summer in a remote log-cabin is gang-raped and then weeks later takes violent revenge on her assailants. How, though? Well, there just happens to be a second, deserted cabin near hers, crammed with handy stuff like power tools, rope, saws, etc. Convenient! But wait. We saw her dive naked into the river after her ordeal. Where did she get food, clothes? How did she get that car we see in one shot? Is it supposed to be supernatural? It's difficult to escape the feeling that the \"rape\" and the \"revenge\" halves of this movie are in false opposition. Audiences who like the spectacle of men being tortured and women being raped may well be the same audiences. For them, this film offers a two-for-one deal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
