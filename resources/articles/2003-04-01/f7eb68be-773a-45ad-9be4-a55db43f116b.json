Victory over Iceland at Hampden Park combined with the unlikely point plucked by Lithuania in Nuremberg on Saturday to hoist the Scots to the head of Group Five, but Berti Vogts sees another bumpy ride ahead. \"That draw was the worst possible result for us because Lithuania will be on a high and thinking they can make the play-off places,\" said Vogts, his options limited by groin injur ies to Rangers' Barry Ferguson and Steven Thompson. \"As for Germany, they'll focus now. \"I know the German mentality well. The failure to beat Lithuania will have hurt them and only means they'll concentrate more on beating Scotland when they visit in June. They played well for the first 20 minutes against Lithuania but then seemed to think the game was over when they were only one up. This will make them harder to beat, not easier. \"I saw the reaction in the German media and you'd expect the same sort of thing if we threw away a lead against Lithuania. But they are still the favourites in the group. Don't forget, only nine months ago they were in the World Cup final.\" Scottish minds are focused on the immediate threat posed by Lithuania here tomorrow. The gritty win over Iceland may have encouraged them - \"There's a real belief that we can emulate what Wales are doing and make an impact,\" said Preston's Graham Alexander - but the team's deficiencies were clear even against such mediocre opponents. Vogts may resist the chance to inject pace into the team courtesy of Birmingham's Paul Devlin and send out a rugged line-up to seek a point where three may yet be gleaned. \"We need at least a draw,\" the manager said. \"Please, let's keep our heads.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
