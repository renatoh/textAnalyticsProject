The move, by the House of Commons health select committee, will reopen the debate around a measure which the BMA and the chief medical officer support but the prime minister, Gordon Brown, opposes. Imposing a minimum price of 50p a unit of alcohol wherever it is sold could save 3,000 lives a year, curb binge drinking and make drink harder to obtain for those on lower incomes, the MPs say. The prime minister has ruled out minimum pricing on the grounds that it would be unfair on the large majority of drinkers whose consumption poses no problem to themselves or others. But Sir Liam Donaldson, the chief medical officer for England, advocates the change, as do some Labour MPs, the BMA, Royal College of Physicians and others in the medical establishment. The MPs' strongly worded report on alcohol also accuses the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) of \"extraordinary naivety\" over the introduction of 24-hour drinking. Their report is particularly critical of the DCMS, which sponsored the Licensing Act 2003 that allowed licensed premises to open around the clock from late 2005, and its claim that extended licensing hours would lead to more laid back, European-style drinking patterns in the UK. The 120-page report, which was finalised last week and is out on 7 January, says: \"The department has shown extraordinary naivety in believing that the Licensing Act 2003 would bring about a civilised cafe culture.\" The MPs are highly critical of those who produce and sell alcohol. Their efforts to minimise drink-related harm and propose a series of tough new measures will alarm the drinks industry, some of whose concerns may be echoed by the DCMS and Peter Mandelson's business department. The report calls for a clampdown on alcohol advertising and sponsorship. They suggest bringing in a new rule, to be included in advertising codes of conduct, which would stop a drinks company from advertising in the media or sponsoring events involving sport or music, for example, if the audience is likely to contain at least 10% of people who are too young to legally buy alcohol \u2013 under-18s. In the report the MPs: \u2022 claim that the drinks industry has not been properly reined in for its promotion of alcohol and demand new regulations and monitoring to deter \"irresponsible\" promotions, such as happy hours; \u2022 criticise supermarkets for contributing to alcohol-related harm by selling drink at less than cost price as a loss leader to encourage customers to shop with them, and condemn the sale of alcohol in some places for just 10p a unit; \u2022 highlight young people's vulnerability to excess alcohol by saying that drink is involved in 25% of deaths involving young men aged 16 to 24, through car crashes, accidents and violence, for example; \u2022 suggest greater rights for local councils and residents affected by drink-related anti-social behaviour to challenge the right of premises with poor records to hold a licence; \u2022 urge the Treasury to reduce the duty on drinks which contain less than 2.8% alcohol by volume, to encourage greater consumption of lower-strength wines and beers; \u2022 and endorse the use of other forms of action on pricing as well as minimum unit pricing. The report also raises fresh concern about the impact of alcohol, with evidence that a woman who drinks as little as a bottle of wine over the course of a week is increasing her chance of developing breast cancer. The committee's three Conservative members disagreed with the call for minimum pricing. Their party leadership is opposed, although it backs tax rises on alcopops, strong beer and cider, a tougher licensing regime and a ban on below cost-price selling by supermarkets. Don Shenker, chief executive of Alcohol Concern, said: \"If the committee backs a minimum price for alcohol, it will add further weight to calls already made by most of the medical establishment to stop alcohol being sold at irresponsible prices. We'll all enjoy a festive drink over the coming weeks but there is no longer any doubt that far too many people are drinking at dangerous levels.\" Dr Alan Maryon-Davis, president of the Faculty of Public Health, said its members \u2013 public health experts working in the NHS and local government \u2013 backed minimum pricing. \"We think there should be a price barrier to deter excessive drinking. Minimum pricing is selective; it selects those who drink more and won't hit the great majority of responsible drinkers.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
