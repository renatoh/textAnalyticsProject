But heaven knows I\u2019m miserable now", "bodyText": "Dear Morrissey, I\u2019m writing this to say, in a gentle way, thank you but no. As beautiful as your words once were, your vocal support for bigots such as Tommy Robinson and the For Britain party is hideously ugly. As a mixed-race, British-Jamaican boy raised by a white, working class, reggae-loving, northern mother, your music somehow became the most important thing in my young life. It was a delicious, rebellious pleasure, a refuge through difficult teenage years. As an adult, I\u2019m furious at your betrayal and your rejection of modern, diverse Britain. I\u2019ve defended you against accusations of racism in the past. I\u2019ve supported your right as an artist to write about issues few are brave enough to \u2013 like parents lamenting their \u201clost boy\u201d on The National Front Disco, the depressing thug-glamour of England football hooligans on We\u2019ll Let You Know, and the racially motivated killing of a school boy on Asian Rut. But supporting far-right parties has nothing to do with art and everything to do with bigotry. You once mocked David Bowie for being past his sell-by date, but Bowie stayed progressive and experimental and never became what you are, the pop version of Nigel Farage \u2013 the kind of person your younger self would have despised. I can\u2019t take back the letter I wrote to you and threw onstage at the Kentish Town Forum, nor the kiss I planted in the nape of your sweaty neck when you pulled me out of the crowd. I can\u2019t stop loving your music. I played Ask at my wedding last year straight after our first dance \u2013 Bob Marley\u2019s Is This Love, incidentally (you see, it is possible to like the Smiths and reggae). But as one of very few black Smiths fans, what I can do is tell you how damaging your words and actions are, not just to me but to a younger generation \u2013 perhaps, like you, the children of migrants \u2013 who might fall in love with your music only to discover that you oppose immigration, scorn integration, insult entire races and champion hate speech. I grew up in Finsbury Park and Wood Green, north London, where the Smiths recorded Ask and Panic, two of my all-time favourite singles. You\u2019d be horrified to see how wonderfully multicultural those parts of north London are today. You can\u2019t walk down the road without hearing languages from all over the world. While most of Britain is still almost exclusively white, it\u2019s marvellous that some parts are different and that identities \u2013 including white British people \u2013 mingle together. It saddens me that you don\u2019t feel the same and instead tread that familiar racist path about cultural erasure. Your music once evoked the very nature of being British. It was exhilarating to hear somebody proudly outspoken about solitude and awkwardness delivering words with a poetic blend of sarcasm, empathy, bookishness, sincerity and disdain. Britishness is an integral part of my identity too, as it is to most black and Asian Brits \u2013 including Muslims, who you clearly fear and loathe, partly because they eat differently butchered meat, partly because you think they\u2019re terrorists and partly because \u2013 like the For Britain founder, Anne Marie Waters \u2013 they don\u2019t fit your ideal of what Britishness should look like. When you sang \u201cThere\u2019s a country, you don\u2019t live there; but one day you would like to\u201d, you were talking about a man dreaming of an \u201cEngland for the English\u201d. You\u2019ve become that man. There is a culture of barefaced denial these days. People think they can simply say \u201cI\u2019m not racist\u201d while saying and doing racist things. It\u2019s an alt-right tactic \u2013 accusing others of hatemongering for calling out bigotry. In challenging your detractors, you\u2019ve accused the Guardian of a \u201chate campaign\u201d and called the Merseyrail train company \u201cvery Third Reich\u201d for taking down your album posters. You claim to \u201cdespise racism\u201d while urging Brits to vote for a party that fields ex-BNP candidates and is supported by neo-Nazis. You might feel well-equipped to shrug off criticism from white journalists in the liberal press, but shrugging off your ethnic minority fans isn\u2019t so easy: those I\u2019ve spoken to aren\u2019t fooled by you putting a picture of James Baldwin on the homepage of your website. The film curator and writer Jonathan Ali, who grew up in Trinidad, told me: \u201cThat [Morrissey] was a musical genius was beyond doubt. When I began to understand his views, and let\u2019s not kid ourselves, he probably always held these views, it was odd to think of them as the beliefs of the same person who sang I Know It\u2019s Over.\u201d Debbie Smith, former Echobelly lead guitarist and daughter of Jamaican parents, didn\u2019t hold back. \u201cThe man\u2019s a dick. He has never really been honest with his fans, nor to himself. At least he is now, I suppose. I\u2019ve no time for him but still a fan of the Smiths.\u201d These strange times have taught me a harsh lesson about my choice of heroes. Another, John Lydon, recently spoke in support of Trump and Brexit. In contrast, fellow Smiths member Johnny Marr, who I interviewed a few years ago, appears to have retained his progressive values. That\u2019s a relief for Smiths fans \u2013 and proof that, unlike his songwriting pal, we don\u2019t all have to become more rightwing as we get older. \u2022 Joshua Surtees is a journalist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
