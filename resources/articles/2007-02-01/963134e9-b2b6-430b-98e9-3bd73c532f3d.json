Users can join an online community to publicise upcoming events, collect donations and then blog about their experiences. While collecting money online is well established, the new site allows users to swap tips on successes and disasters. Fundraisers can upload blogs and pictures, swap ideas and discuss their sponsored sing along, marathon run or coffee morning with like-minded people. One area of the site offers users the chance to share tips on getting in shape for sponsored runs. My ActionAid, which goes live tomorrow, aims to be easy to understand and lets users create their own colourful fundraising page \"in a matter of minutes\". Simon Molloy, head of community fundraising at ActionAid, said: \"ActionAid's fundraisers ride bikes across Malawi, kayak through the Brazilian jungle and throw themselves out of planes to help fight poverty. \"We wanted to create an online community that would give everyone who raises money for ActionAid the chance to show the world what they're planning and make it easy for them to raise as much money as possible.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
