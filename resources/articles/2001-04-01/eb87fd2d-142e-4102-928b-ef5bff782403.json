But it seems that the Welsh are definitely the weakest link when it comes to savings, according to a new survey from online broker Halifax Share Dealing. Researchers quizzed 2,000 people on their money habits. And those that didn't simply reject the interviewer's questions with a Robinson-style goodbye owned up to an average \u00a37,030 savings nest-egg. But in Wales the figure was much lower. The savings shirkers from Cardiff to Colwyn Bay have just \u00a34,320 a head stashed away in the savings bank, according to the survey. And just over one in three has up to \u00a35,000 squirreled away. Yet just across the border in the West Midlands, Britain's best savers sit in splendour. Birmingham folk claim to have average savings of \u00a310,830 - more than twice the Welsh average. The south-east is traditionally the home of stockbrokers and the better-off. But the Halifax probe presumably found very few of them at home - the average savings for this area came out at a surprising \u00a38,900. Mancunians and the north-west - including all that legendary Cheshire wealth - and East Midlanders came next with \u00a38,530 and \u00a37,710 respectively. Londoners fell below average - perhaps because they have the most expensive housing in the UK with mortgage bills to match - with a below-average \u00a36,890. And if the Scots do have as many bawbees locked away as legend claims, then they are also keeping the traditionally Caledonian attitude of never discussing their wealth with strangers - let alone their family or friends. They admit to savings per head of just \u00a35,010. Overall, just one in five of those questioned confessed to being \"savings free\". And one in 11 owned up to a rainy day nest-egg topping \u00a320,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
