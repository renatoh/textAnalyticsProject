A new ReachTel survey of 1,277 residents across the federal electorate of Longman taken on Thursday night has the LNP polling ahead of Labor on two party preferred terms 53% to 47%. But the research, funded by The Australia Institute, also suggests the Turnbull government\u2019s proposal to cut tax for Australia\u2019s biggest businesses is unpopular, with only 17% endorsement. Sign up to receive the top stories in Australia every day at noon A majority of respondents (53.7%) believe the third phase of the income tax cuts proposed by the Turnbull government, to flatten the tax rate on incomes between $41,000 and $200,000, is unfair. Voters were asked whether they supported or opposed tax cuts delivering an average of $530 a year extra for low and middle income earners in the first four years, and tax cuts for high income earners in seven years time. More Longman voters opposed the measure (47.3%) than supported it (38.3%). Consistent with a Guardian Essential poll published the day before the budget, more people supported funding for service delivery (43.5%) than tax cuts (19.2%), with 28.8% saying revenue should be used to decrease debt and pay back the deficit. Only 1.9% of the sample nominate tax cuts for corporations as a priority. The Labor incumbent in Longman Susan Lamb resigned on Wednesday following the high court\u2019s ruling in the Katy Gallagher case. The ruling triggered a super Saturday of byelections which is looming as a mini-election and has been called a referendum on the tax policies of the major parties. It would be a significant upset if the LNP snatched back the seat because a government has not taken a seat from the opposition at a byelection for a century. The resignations this week have triggered contests in Longman, the Tasmanian seat of Braddon, the South Australian seat of Mayo and the Western Australian seat of Fremantle. There will also be a byelection in the seat of Perth, because of the resignation of the Labor MP Tim Hammond for family reasons. Given the contests will stretch party resources in the run up to a federal election, the Liberals are highly unlikely to run in Fremantle, which will be a Labor/Green contest, and may not run in the seat of Perth either. The Liberals are in the process of preselecting candidates for Longman, Braddon and Mayo. The Labor incumbents will defend their seats, as will the Centre Alliance MP Rebekha Sharkie, who resigned on Friday. Sharkie is the most likely casualty from the upcoming super Saturday of byelections triggered by the latest wave of dual citizenship resignations, analysts have said. Sharkie won the formerly safe Liberal seat in the Adelaide Hills on preferences in 2016, with the help of an unpopular opponent in former MP Jamie Briggs and the once-powerful campaign clout of then senator Nick Xenophon. This time, she is likely to face a well-known name in Georgina Downer, daughter of former foreign minister Alexander Downer who held the seat from 1984 to 2008. While Sharkie is regarded as a very attentive local member, Xenophon\u2019s political cachet has dwindled since the colossal loss of SA Best at the March state election. Sharkie\u2019s party has been rebadged from the Nick Xenophon Team to the Centre Alliance, but Flinders University associate professor of politics, Haydon Manning, whose wife ran for SA Best in the state election, said volunteers and donors felt burnt by the recent loss. \u201c[Sharkie] doesn\u2019t have the money, she doesn\u2019t have the database,\u201d Manning said. \u201cBut she has been the incumbent for two odd years, she has worked tirelessly, she has got good demeanor, and she is a person that this seat has not had, in that she is focused on the community.\u201d Internal Liberal party polling in Tasmania suggested the Coalition was in front in Braddon 53-47, but Tasmanian election analyst Kevin Bonham said it was based on an \u201cutterly woeful\u201d sample size and should be dismissed. Braddon has a history of swapping sides and has not been held for more than two consecutive terms since 1998. Labor\u2019s Justine Keay won it in 2016 and has a 2.2% margin. Bonham said he expected Labor would retain all four of its seats, failing a catastrophic campaign mistake on behalf of one of its candidates, or a superstar candidate from the Liberal Party. \u201cIf they lose any of them it will be too embarrassing for words,\u201d he said. He said Longman, which Lamb won from the LNP\u2019s Wyatt Roy in 2016 on an 0.8% margin, was the most at-risk Labor seat. Bonham added that Lamb was the most likely to get a sympathy vote over her inability to revoke her UK citizenship. One Nation has named controversial former state candidate Matthew Stephen as its pick for the electorate, and has said it will not preference Labor. \u201cIn the state election, Labor put me last and that\u2019s exactly where I\u2019d like to see them on my ballot paper,\u201d Stephen told the Australian. ALP resources in Western Australia are expected to focus on Perth. Preselection is likely to go to WA Labor state secretary Patrick Gorman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
