Since his appointment as performance director in 2002, Brailsford has steered the country's cyclists to 30 Olympic medals in Athens, Beijing and London, 49 Paralympic medals and over 100 World Championship medals, almost half of which have been gold. Since 2010, he has combined his duties with his position overseeing Team Sky, for whom Sir Bradley Wiggins and Chris Froome have won the last two Tour de France titles. Hodgson is hoping his input might boost conviction within his senior squad ahead of the tournament in Brazil and has arranged for Brailsford to speak to his players, most likely at St George's Park, in the build-up to the Wembley send-off friendly against Peru on 30 May. England will fly to Miami the following day for two final warm-up matches, against Honduras and Ecuador, before their campaign begins against Italy in Manaus on 14 June. \"We hope Dave Brailsford is going to come and speak to us and we're looking forward to that,\" said Hodgson, who hopes the coach will be able to offer an insight on how best his players can fulfil their potential and seize the moment. \"He's made a commitment that he's going to come and speak to us about his experiences in that period of time before we play Peru in May. He's prepared a team of British cyclists to win gold medals and he may be able to give the players a feel for how he's done that. \"These are fantastic occasions, World Cup finals, and sometimes we forget how important they are. You don't get that many shots at it and you have a lot of time to regret if you don't put your best shot at it. I bet the world's full of players who reflect back on tournaments they've had thinking they wish they had given a bit more, or concentrated a bit more. I wish I'd known then what I know now. That's maybe what Brailsford will speak about before we play Peru at Wembley.\" Hodgson, who may also seek to have Sebastian Coe address the squad ahead of the finals, will take Dave Reddin, the former World Cup winning rugby union coach whose impact was felt most keenly by Jonny Wilkinson, to Brazil as part of his backroom staff and will tap into his expertise in sport psychology. Reddin is the Football Association's new head of performance services, based at St George's Park and reporting to the director of elite development, Dan Ashworth, with his input likely to be utilised when England address the long-standing issue of penalty shoot-outs. The nation have won only one shoot-out since 1990\u201a against Spain in the quarter-finals of Euro 96\u201a and have exited six major tournaments on penalties in that time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
