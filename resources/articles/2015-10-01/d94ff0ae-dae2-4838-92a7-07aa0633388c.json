As he settled into the Dutchman\u2019s recently vacated seat Sunderland\u2019s new manager acknowledged he must deconstruct his predecessor\u2019s theory that the club\u2019s players are simply \u201cnot good enough\u201d for Premier League survival. It was a damning verdict from the former Holland coach, who resigned nine days ago, and served to emphasise the scale of the task confronting Allardyce. His latest team are without a Premier League win this season and have conceded 18 goals in eight games. \u201cDick\u2019s a very experienced man and he has worked with the players,\u201d Allardyce said. \u201cThat\u2019s his opinion and I have to prove that wrong, don\u2019t I? I have got to be the man who comes in and, at some point down the line, is able to say: \u2018Dick, you were wrong\u2019. \u201cI hope I\u2019m not saying: \u2018Dick, you were right,\u2019 that\u2019s for sure. If that happens, I have made a bad decision, haven\u2019t I?\u201d Confounding Advocaat will require the former West Ham United, Blackburn Rovers, Newcastle United and Bolton Wanderers manager to receive help from his players. With a clear challenge issued, it seems the time has come for certain individuals to accept increased responsibility. \u201cI have to draw on my experience,\u201d said Allardyce who has not discounted the possibility of recruiting his former Bolton and West Ham captain, Kevin Nolan, who is a free agent. \u201cBut there\u2019s a lot of Premier League experience in this squad and I have also to draw on the experience of the players who have played in this league. \u201cIt\u2019s their responsibility to step up to the mark now. They have done all of this before. They know what the Premier League is about. They have to deliver. I can guide them along the way but ultimately we send them out on to the field to make fewer mistakes than the opposition. \u201cIf they do that, then we will have a better chance of winning. There\u2019s enough experience here for the players not to be making the sort of mistakes they have been all season. Everyone has to perform better than they have done. We\u2019re second bottom in the league and for this club that isn\u2019t good enough.\u201d Although he has signed an 18-month contract at the Stadium of Light, for the moment at least Allardyce is thinking purely short-term. He has arrived in Red Adair mode with all thoughts of longer-term \u201cbuilding projects\u201d an extravagance he knows he cannot afford to indulge in. \u201cI\u2019m here to save them,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m the troubleshooter. I\u2019ve got to get the club out of trouble and then rebuild it. The only priority I\u2019ve got is to focus on saving it. The job\u2019s not to focus on the academy or what happens in two years\u2019 time. It\u2019s got to be about now. \u201cIt\u2019s about protecting Premier League status because, if the club wants to move forward, it can\u2019t have the financial devastation relegation will bring. It needs the pot of money the new television deal will bring in the summer.\u201d After spending four years at Upton Park Allardyce accepts his stay on Wearside could be shorter. \u201cI don\u2019t know how long I\u2019ll be here just yet,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a risk business. I\u2019ve got an 18-month contract. It may be extended but that will only happen if I\u2019m successful.\u201d Appointing the right support staff is likely to be crucial for the eighth manager to have worked with Ellis Short, Sunderland\u2019s owner, in the past seven years. While he expects to announce an assistant \u2013 possibly Steve Round or Blackpool\u2019s manager, Neil McDonald \u2013 soon, Allardyce also made it plain he is very much the main man. Enjoying a wide sphere of autonomy, he has ensured Short\u2019s recent dalliance with a director of football is over. \u201cI am the manager,\u201d he said. \u201cI wear a suit on match day. I organise the entire football structure at first-team level. I will make a lot of decisions on a daily basis. I have to make a lot of decisions very quickly and I have to make sure the vast majority of those decisions are the right ones.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
