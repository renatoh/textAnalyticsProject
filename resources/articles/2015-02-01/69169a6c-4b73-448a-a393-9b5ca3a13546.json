Costa, who was suspended for a stamp on Liverpool\u2019s Emre Can, has not featured for three weeks, with that enforced lay-off prompting Mourinho to organise a practice game behind closed doors at the end of last week aimed at granting the 26-year-old a semi-competitive run-out. The striker is the club\u2019s top scorer this season with 17 goals in 19 Premier League games and, despite rustiness, will make an immediate return to the side. \u201cHe will start but a long rest is not good for him,\u201d said Mourinho who, like Costa, vehemently contested the suspension. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for a player to be three weeks, or three matches, without starting a game. So I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll be in the best condition. A little rest is welcome for everyone; a big rest isn\u2019t good for the players. So we are not going to see the best Diego. I hope I\u2019m wrong, but probably he will need this game to try to get back to his best. \u201cWe organised a game three or four days ago with the kids for him to compete in. We tried to replicate competition for him but it\u2019s different. I know he has hunger to play, a big appetite to play, and the Champions League scenario is a scenario that every player enjoys. And, at the same time, [Lo\u00efc] R\u00e9my and [Didier] Drogba have played in the last three matches. Obviously it\u2019s important for them to have had minutes and confidence and I know that I have them both ready for the game, too.\u201d Costa\u2019s last goal in European competition was for Atl\u00e9tico Madrid against Chelsea. Mourinho had hoped his \u00a332m summer signing would prove the significant difference between his team and PSG. Last season\u2019s 3-1 defeat at Parc des Princes in the first leg of the quarter-final had prompted him to bemoan the lack of attacking options at his disposal at the time, with Samuel Eto\u2019o absent injured and Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle having been preferred to Fernando Torres or Demba Ba from the start. That quartet have since moved on. Mourinho will hope his revamped frontline wounds PSG, whose preparations had been severely undermined by a flurry of injuries sustained during Saturday\u2019s wasteful 2-2 draw with Caen. Serge Aurier, Yohan Cabaye and Lucas Moura will miss the game, though Laurent Blanc ended Monday night\u2019s training session encouraged that Marquinhos, Blaise Matuidi and Thiago Motta would be fit having taken part in the session. The French champions\u2019 manager has warned his players Mourinho will seek to \u201craise the temperature on the pitch\u201d and urged them to remain calm and not react to any provocation in what will be a keenly contested occasion. Blanc was asked specifically about his young Italy midfielder Marco Verratti, whose temperament has proved suspect. \u201cWith him, it\u2019s about how he controls his temper,\u201d he said. \u201cHe has to show he has improved on that level. I know Jos\u00e9 Mourinho a bit and I know he\u2019ll raise the temperature on the pitch. So my players need to be cold, they need to be calm and they mustn\u2019t react even when it is hot out there on the turf. They must stay calm and cold. We can\u2019t afford any more yellow cards. It\u2019s a real test for Marco, but I think he has matured and will cope with it.\u201d Mourinho, who will hand Cesc F\u00e0bregas a first start since the midfielder\u2019s recovery from a hamstring injury, declined to comment on Blanc\u2019s remarks."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
