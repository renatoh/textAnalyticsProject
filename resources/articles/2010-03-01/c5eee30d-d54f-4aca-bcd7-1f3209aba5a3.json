However, the worst thing about his first\u2011hurdle fall in the Masters Series against Mardy Fish on Saturday was its insight into his state of mind and his longer\u2011term problems. Murray has admitted there is something wrong inside his head and that he does not know what it is. The British No1 spent a lot of time looking across at his team during his 6-4, 6-4 defeat by the increasingly encouraged American and his body language was contorted and odd. Even the way he walked looked different. Murray's game was unrecognisable from that of the player who so inventively and tenaciously reached the Australian Open final. His movement was laboured by his high standards, his second serve was often vulnerable and even his brilliantly reliable ground strokes failed sometimes on important points. Murray now has only four wins in eight weeks and when he starts his clay\u2011court campaign, probably in Monte Carlo in two weeks' time, he will have gone a worryingly long time without a high\u2011calibre victory. \"Mentally for the last few weeks I have been really poor. It's unacceptable. In Australia that was my biggest asset. Since then it's not been good. I don't know why,\" said Murray, looking puzzled, inert and crestfallen, his eyes without the flashes of fire which suggest he is ready for daft or difficult questions. \"It's something I have to go away and sort out. I am not worried about my game and how I hit the ball and my shots. But I have the tactics worked out and then don't use the tactics. I don't know why \u2013 it could be a lot of things. I have been very happy off court but not on it.\" Despite these words a few people may wonder whether his relationship with Kim Sears \u2013 apparently he has been seen with her again \u2013 has any connection with all this, while others will speculate that the loss to a super Federer in Melbourne has really shaken him up. This seems possible. Murray was clearly not ready either physically or mentally when he restarted in February in Dubai, where there was a change of emphasis in his tactical vision. When Murray admitted that he had been experimenting with that during the tournament, it brought an emotional fall-out which included public criticism from the sponsor. This is coupled with a stronger sense than ever that it is the four grand slam championships which matter now, mingling maybe with a feeling that Federer has an overdrive he had not seen before. His biggest task of the coming clay\u2011court season will be rehabilitation. With both Murray and Novak Djokovic beaten early, hopes for a Federer\u2011Nadal final became more intense. But these were almost denied too when Nadal, outplayed early on by the flatter, more accurate groundstrokes of David Nalbandian, survived with difficulty, coming through 6-7, 6-2, 6-2 against the Argentinian wild card. Federer progressed more reassuringly during his 6-3, 6-3 win over Nicolas Lapentti \u2013 only to add to the unease with his words. \"It sure worries me being top seed, seeing high seeds fall out,\" he said. \"You know, I have hardly even started playing yet and there's big names out. It's a bit worrying at times.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
