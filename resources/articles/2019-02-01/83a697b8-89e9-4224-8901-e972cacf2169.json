With tension mounting among anti-Brexit Labour MPs and grassroots members, several junior shadow ministers have told the Guardian they are prepared to resign their posts if Corbyn doesn\u2019t whip his MPs to vote for a pro-referendum amendment at the end of the month. Corbyn has been struggling to balance the conflicting forces in his party over Brexit, as the clock ticks down towards exit day on 29 March.. Many party members and MPs would like him to take a lead in seeking to block Brexit before time runs out \u2013 but some frontbenchers are equally adamant they could never support a referendum. Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the Unite union and a close ally of Corbyn, risked stoking the conflict in the party on Wednesday when he argued that stopping Brexit was \u201cnot the best option for our nation\u201d. \u201cMy view is that, having had a 2016 referendum where the people have voted to come out of the EU, to try and deflect away from that threatens the whole democratic fabric on which we operate,\u201d he told Peston on ITV. \u201cI\u2019m saying that in reality it is not the best option for our nation.\u201d The party\u2019s conference policy, thrashed out in a late-night meeting chaired by the shadow Brexit secretary, Keir Starmer, suggests that if it has failed to secure a general election \u201cLabour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote\u201d. And it includes the line: \u201cIf the government is confident in negotiating a deal that working people, our economy and communities will benefit from they should not be afraid to put that deal to the public.\u201d Since the prime minister\u2019s deal was overwhelmingly rejected by parliament last month, Labour has continued to engage with the government after Corbyn initially declined a meeting with May. The pair exchanged letters last week setting out their respective Brexit positions, and senior Labour figures met ministers on Tuesday. Starmer and the shadow Cabinet Office minister, Jon Trickett, were accompanied by Corbyn\u2019s close advisers Seumas Milne and Andrew Fisher as they met the Brexit secretary, Steve Barclay, and May\u2019s de facto deputy, David Lidington. A Labour party spokesperson said: \u201cKeir Starmer and Jon Trickett had a frank and serious exchange with Stephen Barclay and David Lidington following Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s five-demands letter to Theresa May. \u201cStarmer and Trickett set out Labour\u2019s five demands and pushed the government to change its red lines.\u201d Senior Labour sources said they believed the meeting had gone well, and expect a follow-up session to be held next week. But anti-Brexit MPs believe it is time to shift the policy towards supporting a referendum, as May has rejected Labour\u2019s advances by continuing to rule out a customs union. Some see Starmer as the most likely champion for their cause inside the shadow cabinet. Other key figures, including Trickett and the Labour chair, Ian Lavery, are more sceptical. Attention is focusing on plans made by the Labour MPs Phil Wilson and Peter Kyle, under which parliament\u2019s endorsement of a deal would be made subject to the public\u2019s approval, echoing the model pursued for the Good Friday agreement. \u201cThat\u2019s where the action is,\u201d said one backbencher. There could also be a straightforward \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d amendment when May brings an amendable vote to MPs on 27 February. Several frontbenchers, including the shadow Treasury minister, Clive Lewis, and the shadow business minister, Chi Onwurah, will speak at a Love Socialism, Hate Brexit rally at parliament before the vote on Thursday. The rally is being promoted by the pro-referendum group Another Europe is Possible. Lewis previously quit as shadow defence secretary in order to rebel against the triggering of article 50, but has since returned to the Labour frontbench. He said last week: \u201cI\u2019m on the frontbench because I live in hope that the party will get to the bit of our conference policy where it supports a people\u2019s vote.\u201d Even some shadow frontbenchers opposed to a second referendum are coming to the view that the party needs a \u201ccathartic moment\u201d to whip for a new referendum and prove that the plan has no parliamentary majority, with more than 20 Labour MPs likely to oppose. One sceptical shadow minister said the February deadline would be the time for \u201cpeak agitation\u201d. Tensions over the party\u2019s Brexit policy have been simmering since Corbyn made his offer of a Brexit compromise in a letter to May last week, prompting former leadership candidate Owen Smith to suggest he could quit the party if Labour eventually backed a Brexit deal. Anger spilled into the open on Wednesday. The MP Neil Coyle claimed the party was losing members and councillors, and could yet lose MPs over its Brexit policy. One Labour MP, Geraint Davies, tabled an amendment attempting to bring forward the crunch point for the Labour leadership by calling for a referendum on May\u2019s deal but it was not directly connected with that of Kyle and Wilson. \u201cIt\u2019s very premature,\u201d one MP said. Davies\u2019 amendment, which he submitted on Wednesday, will be attached to a government motion laying out the next stage of Brexit negotiations. MPs are due to vote on the motion on Thursday. Davies said his amendment would help build support for another legally binding amendment on a second referendum at the next opportunity. \u201cThere is a hidden majority in the house that want to support this position, but they are all waiting around for some guiding north star for them to follow before they take action, but we are running out of time,\u201d he said. \u201cMPs are in danger of being complicit if they do not take action now.\u201d But Kyle said he was not behind Davies\u2019 amendment and had hoped to wait until there was more momentum behind the move. \u201cThe main push for this will be the meaningful vote. Clearly the landscape changes but this vote tomorrow is not binding and this amendment should not be interpreted as the main bid for support,\u201d he said. Corbyn was criticised for failing to take tougher action against MPs who declined to back Yvette Cooper\u2019s amendment aimed at averting a no-deal Brexit; but chief whip Nick Brown has made clear to MPs he would deal with all Brexit votes in the round, at the end of the process."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
