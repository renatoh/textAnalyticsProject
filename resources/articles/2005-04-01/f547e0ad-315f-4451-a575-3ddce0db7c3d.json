Alan Milburn, the party's election coordinator, said the aim was to bring the campaign closer to the people by using better ways of communicating than \"traditional press conferences and media scrums\". The prime minister, in his attempt to be accessible within the confines of security, is also hoping to hold public meetings in which the audiences will not be made up of hand-picked Labour supporters. He will take part in webchats and phone-ins and respond to emails while on the bus he will use for some of his travels. He will also hold \"five minutes with Tony\" sessions, calling or visiting people who have written to him for a chat about the issue they have raised. There are also plans for national surgeries in shopping centres. He will use a personal video diary on Labour's website to discuss the day's campaigning, including the highs and lows. The whole approach will help the party to build up its database of email addresses, which can be used to encourage Labour voters to turn out . \"At the last election many people thought that direct contact with the public was confined to Sharon Storer's meeting with Tony Blair and John Prescott's encounter with with an egg thrower,\" Mr Milburn said. \"This time we want direct communication every single day. It is a myth that people are not interested in politics. They are turned off by the way it is done. Our strategy is to move beyond the soundbite culture to using modern technology to go more direct.\" Mr Blair will hold a number of joint events with the chancellor, Gordon Brown, in an attempt to keep the economy high up the agenda. Labour's private polls have shown its lead cut from nine to six points since the weekend. Its strategists believe it may have been hit by the inability to campaign owing to the Pope's death, but it is not clear why this should have affected Labour the most."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
