I pleaded: \u201cThey smell heavenly. You will be picking them all summer long, little posies of ruffled blossoms all over your kitchen.\u201d But that failed to move her. I should have qualified the difference between a carnation \u2013 the unscented, unloved flower of forecourts, top heavy and not great for the garden (and a species of dianthus) \u2013 and a pink, which is a darling, compact, scented variety that is easy to grow. (The name comes not from the colour, but the frilly edges, as in pinking shears.) Get the basics right with pinks and they will flower non-stop from July to September, not minding a dry summer, which makes them perfect for pots. The Alpine sort will hunker down on windy balconies and window ledges. Pinks do require good amounts of light: they won\u2019t grow in shade and they won\u2019t tolerate wet roots. If you garden on clay, add lots of grit and then add some more, then a little more on top of that. To keep them flowering, deadhead regularly. Pinch out the whole flowering stem so that the plant bushes out from the base. This will keep it neat. If the weather is dry, or the plants are pot-grown, water as necessary and feed them every two weeks with comfrey or phosphate-rich organic tomato feed to promote flowering. By the end of the September, they will need to be trimmed into a compact mound; this will keep them tidy over winter. All pinks are descended from Dianthus plumarius, which is sweetly scented with fringed petals that range from pink to almost white. It grows up to 20cm tall and 60cm wide. Dianthus superbus has stronger, spicier perfume and wispy pink flowers. Dianthus superbus var. longicalycinus \u2018Alba\u2019 is perfection: spidery white, sweetly scented flowers on mounds of narrow foliage, happy in sun or part shade, as long as the drainage is good. Dianthus alpinus is a mat-forming Alpine that grows to 10cm high and is perfect for windswept window boxes. There are thousands of cultivars, but I have a soft spot for \u2018Pheasant Eye\u2019 from 1690, with a deep-red centre, fringed white petals and red tips; \u2018Gran\u2019s Favourite\u2019, which is a semi-white double with astounding scent; and \u2018Dad\u2019s Favourite\u2019, which is said to have been bred by the weavers of Paisley in Scotland in the mid-19th century and has white petals, each edged in a broad, red line \u2013 good for cutting for the vase."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
