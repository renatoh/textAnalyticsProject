His humblebrag about a \"vodka-shot competition\" during a flight on the 1996 Bob Dole campaign is what makes him, according to Yahoo! News, \"not your grandfather's Republican\". On Tuesday night, following delivery of the Republican party's response to President Obama's state of the union speech, his self-deprecating reaction to the Big Gulp showed a similar facility with modern messaging largely absent from the GOP leadership and his most obvious departure from it: #GOPResponse #SOTU #gop #tcot twitter.com/marcorubio/sta\u2026 \u2014 Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) February 13, 2013 The Swig-Heard-'Round-the-World was really yet another example Rubio's slipping through criticism by virtue of a slick surface, albeit one that started out as flop sweat. And isn't that just it? Were it not for his remembering Poland Spring (Never forget! Pace George Bush), what we would remember from his response would be, you know, his response. It is also true that the speech wasn't designed to be a scene-stealer. The most important aspect of the appearance was his selection. That is obviously the case, because the speech itself was less than a blank canvas; it was a vacuum, a recitation of familiar GOP talking points so bland one could hardly be sure whether it had been written so much as generated. The rhetoric was so mechanical one wonders if Rubio took a drink just to prove he wasn't the one actually speaking \u2013 a twist on the ventriloquist stunt, but this time, as an intentional fail. Rand Paul was not so lucky: he didn't make a splash, he just fell flat. Another rising star, Paul gave a response on behalf of the Tea Party Express. His even more unremarkable address only gave reporters a chance to ask if the Tea Party was even A Thing anymore, and if so, What Sort of Thing? Alex Seitz-Wald at Salon put a spotlight on the organization claiming to speak for the rudderless movement. It turns out that the Tea Party Express is a sort of ideological Ponzi scheme. The group promises investors electoral and legislative returns on the strength of self-perpetuated hype, while the donations themselves line the pockets of an inner circle. To be fair, this is capitalism at its finest, though not even the GOP itself operates this way. In Washington, it's both politically beneficial and the cultural norm for political donations to be distributed in a way more familiar to Marxists than markets: from each according to his ability, to each according to his need. The \"leadership PACS\" of national figures collect donations on the strength of their name recognition and dole them out to lesser-known candidates. This builds relationships, the party's bench, and \u2013 those concerned hope \u2013 the party's electoral advantage, a system of such obvious utility it doesn't vary by party. On average, among both Republicans and Democrats during the 2012 cycle, leadership PACs give out 46% of what they take in to other candidates. You know who does not participate in this bath of communal funds? Water hog Marco Rubio, whose leadership PAC gave out just 4.6% of the $1.6m it raised to other candidates. The presumably more cut-throat Tea Partier to his right on the television, Paul, gave out over twice that, 10%, and also dropped hundreds of thousands on ads attacking Democrats in general \u2013 a kind of electoral cover fire that's also a widespread practice. Other up-and-coming Republicans were even more generous: Paul Ryan put up 26% of his total PAC donations; Eric Cantor gave out 37%. Heck, Sarah Palin managed to pony up almost 6% and she's not even trying to be nice. This self-preservation (or selfishness, whatever) is not a knock on Rubio, necessarily. It is, however, the only substantive policy difference that distinguishes him from the old-school Republicans who hold him up as the future of the party. Not your grandfather's Republican, indeed. So much for family values."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
