A series of three scientific papers in a leading medical journal spell out the consequences of poor diet and lifestyles for the next generation. They urge schools, GPs and nurses to talk to young people and those who may be planning a family about how to be fitter and healthier before they embark on pregnancy. What happens in the \u201cpre-conception\u201d period can have a profound impact on the growth, development and long-term health of children, they say. Some of the interventions that exist to help pregnant women be healthier are taken up too late. Folic acid helps prevent neural defects, but most women do not start to take it until they have seen a GP to confirm their pregnancy, which can be after a month or two. The crucial time is in the early days and weeks. Lead author Prof Judith Stephenson of University College London said: \u201cThe key message is to act earlier, before conception. The idea that there are things you can do before the pregnancy that will affect the health of the baby is not always grasped. \u201cThe general view of most women is, \u2018Once I\u2019m pregnant I will go and see the GP and things will get going from there.\u2019\u201d But she said the scientists did not want to distress parents who might have been overweight when they had their children. \u201cAll the evidence points to early events being very influential in later life, but you are not doomed at that stage,\u201d she said. \u201cThings you do throughout childhood and adolescence also have a powerful influence on future health.\u201d The global series of three papers in the Lancet also highlights the risks of undernourished girls in the developing world having stunted babies with poor cognitive development. It is a very serious problem that needs to be better tackled, but obesity is now more widespread. \u201cIn many low, middle, and high-income countries, up to 50% of women are overweight or obese when they become pregnant,\u201d say the experts. \u201cIn high-income countries, adolescents have the poorest diets of any age group \u2026 it is a crucial period for establishing long-term health risk.\u201d Obesity, they say, is associated with increased risk of most major adverse outcomes for pregnant women and their babies. It can make it hard to conceive and complicate pregnancy \u2013 women are at risk of high blood pressure, called pre-eclampsia, for instance. It increases the chances of birth defects, stillbirth, low-weight babies, unsuccessful breastfeeding and even the death of the mother. The issues are not just with the weight of the mother. Obesity in the father has been linked to impaired fertility and an increased risk of chronic disease in the child. Couples are already advised to stop smoking and drinking when a woman is pregnant. Now they should be counselled about their nutrition and losing weight as well. One of the best opportunities to intervene is when a woman visits a nurse or a family planning clinic to have a contraceptive implant or coil removed. But GPs could also ask whether couples are considering having a family during any other routine visit. There is a window of opportunity to get the healthy message across when couples are thinking of having a child, said Stephenson. \u201cCouples are very motivated around this time,\u201d she said. In one pilot study, a researcher suggested to obese women planning to get pregnant that they lose a lot of weight first. \u201cTwo-thirds gave it a go and a third completed it,\u201d she said. Couples need support, however. \u201cIt is usually not enough to simply educate or give advice, as knowing something is good for you is rarely sufficient to change behaviour,\u201d says one of the papers. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said it was very concerned that 96% of women of reproductive age had low levels of iron and folic acid. \u201cThis is yet another piece of evidence adding to the overwhelming need for the government to add folic acid to flour,\u201d said Prof Janice Rymer, vice-president. \u201cThis simple measure will reach women most at risk in our society who have poor dietary and socioeconomic status, as well as those women who may not have planned their pregnancy.\u201d The college also supported the call for education about health and fitness prior to having children. \u201cEducation from an early age \u2013 ideally from adolescence \u2013 about the need to maintain a healthy diet and weight will not only improve the health of individuals, but also the health and quality of life of future generations,\u201d Rymer said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
