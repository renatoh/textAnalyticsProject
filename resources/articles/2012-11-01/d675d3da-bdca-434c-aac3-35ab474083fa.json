Four, tier-two nations on Friday night played a double-header at Parc Eirias in Colwyn Bay, where USA beat Russia 40-26 and Samoa defeated Canada 42-12. The exercise will be repeated next Saturday, when Tonga will replace Samoa. The teams are being looked after by clubs in north Wales and the initiative is being funded by the International Rugby Board, which is screening all the matches live and for free on its website, irb.com, and Conway County borough council. The aim is to provide countries outside those who take part in the Six Nations and the Rugby Championship with regular matches in between World Cups with the aim of making them more competitive in the tournament. It is one reason why the IRB is clamping down on clubs who are reluctant to release players for tier-two countries. \"These matches are crucial to ensuring that there is increased competitiveness on the global stage and at the World Cup in 2015,\" said the IRB's chairman, Bernard Lapasset. \"There will be an unprecedented number of international matches across Europe this month which will give sports fans a taste of what to expect in three years when England host the World Cup. \"The IRB is committed to facilitating an annual international competition schedule for our tier-two unions which will meet their strategic high performance needs and deliver opportunities to climb up the world rankings.\" As well as the five countries in north Wales and Fiji, who are at Twickenham on Saturday afternoon, Romania, Japan, Uruguay, Portugal, Georgia and Chile are also in action this month. The programme for the tier-two nations complements the overhaul of the way pool matches are arranged during a World Cup. No longer will the smaller nations have to play their three games in little more than a week: fixtures are being arranged to give all countries, regardless of ranking, broadly the same rest period. The general manager of Gogledd Cymru (north Wales), Rupert Moon, said: \"This is a fantastic opportunity for north Wales to grab the rugby spotlight and showcase the depth of feeling and support there is in the area for Wales's national game. \"What the WRU and IRB have be able to do in bringing Russia, USA, Samoa, Tonga and Canada to play up here in north Wales is simply fantastic. \"What we aim to do is put on a show to prove beyond all doubt that there is a home for international rugby in north Wales.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
