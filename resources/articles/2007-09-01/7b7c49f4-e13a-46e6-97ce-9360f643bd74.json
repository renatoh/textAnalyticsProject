The production line continues unabated and yesterday Russia was assured of a women's finalist when Svetlana Kuznetsova, the 2004 US Open champion, and Anna Chakvetadze won their respective quarter-finals, while Nikolay Davydenko defeated Germany's Tommy Haas 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 to also reach the last four. American network television did its level best to remain interested and focused but it was never easy. Maria Sharapova, now three-quarters American and the epitome of glam-wham tennis, failed to survive the first week, leaving the bottom half of the women's draw as attractive to TV as an out-of-date credit card on a Fifth Avenue spree. And Davydenko's bald pate is simply no substitute for Andre Agassi's shaven head. This lack of interest was potently illustrated by the fact that both women's quarter-finals involving the Williams sisters, even though they were in the same half of the draw, were selected as the night matches on consecutive evenings, something that may ultimately benefit Justine Henin, the world No1, who after beating Serena Williams consequently received an extra day's rest before tomorrow's semi-finals. Brutality and lack of grace were the themes of the dramatic session which saw Spain's Rafael Nadal, the world No2, beaten 6-7, 6-4, 7-6, 6-2 in the fourth round by his fellow Spaniard David Ferrer, the 15th seed, while Henin, for the third successive quarter-final in a grand slam, defeated Williams, who afterwards suggested that the little Belgian, who won 7-6, 6-1, had \"made a lot of lucky shots\", which was by any judgment a crass remark. Williams had not played since Wimbledon, where she damaged her thumb before losing to Henin, and clearly ran out of gas. When asked about her fitness she retorted: \"I'm very fit. I can run for hours.\" The Williamses have always been a law to themselves, with a seemingly endless capacity to ignore the rigours of the WTA tour and parachute into the slams with instant winning form. Serena may have regarded Henin's winners as \"lucky\" but this was certainly not the view of those inside the Arthur Ashe stadium, no matter how partisan. The intensity was a far cry from the altogether more sedate second and third quarter-finals, in which the 20-year-old Chakvetadze, the No6 seed, reached the last four of a slam for the first time with a 6-4, 6-1 win over Shahar Peer of Israel, and Kuznetsova beat the Hungarian teenager Agnes Szavay 6-1, 6-4. Unlike Serena Williams, Nadal made no excuses. \"David played very well. For me this isn't a surprise. He's having an unbelievable season,\" he said. Nadal now knows his chances of overtaking Federer as the world No1 by the end of the year have substantially decreased."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
