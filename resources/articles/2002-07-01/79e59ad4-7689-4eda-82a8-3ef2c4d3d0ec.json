After the feverish atmosphere in the saleroom forced the price up to the record, Sotheby's chief executive Robin Whitehead abandoned the elegant rhetoric of high art and said: \"We are absolutely thrilled to bits.\" Its world record status rests on a tortuous calculation of exchange rates. In 1991 Christie's sold Van Gogh's Portrait of Doctor Gachet in New York for $82.5m. That would now be worth more, but at the time translated as just \u00a349.005m, \u00a3500,000 less. Rubens' Massacre of the Innocents, painted between 1609 and 1611, and depicting the moment when King Herod ordered the slaughter of all newborn boys to get rid of the Messiah, was the rarest of art world fairy tales: the genuinely lost masterpiece of dazzling quality. Sotheby's had put a modest estimate of up to \u00a36m, but when bidding opened at \u00a33m the price shot up. Within a century of being completed, the painting was wrongly catalogued as the work of a minor artist, Jan van den Hoecke. Its gruesome subject matter also kept it out of the public gaze and the picture was hung in dimly lit and unimportant rooms. It resurfaced when a relation of the owner brought some landscapes into Sotheby's in Amsterdam, and then remarked that they might possibly be interested in another painting, producing a snapshot of the Rubens. The result has become art history."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
