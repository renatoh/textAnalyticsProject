Writing in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Rudolf Valenta and colleagues at the Medical University of Vienna describe how they made a vaccine against tree pollen using a genetically modified version of the same type of pollen. When they injected the GM pollen in a clinical trial of 124 allergic patients, the researchers found it stimulated a set of antibodies that fought allergens and alleviated symptoms. Volunteers were tested for allergic reactions with a skin test and by blowing pollen into their noses. \"These results could lead to the development of more effective vaccines for the treatment of the most common forms of allergy,\" the scientists conclude. It could even be used as a preventative vaccination, they add, to stop children developing the allergies in the first place. The team used GM pollen because they could make it hypoallergenic. Work to develop vaccines using normal pollen can make the condition worse in some patients. The pollen vaccine poses no threat to the environment because the process leaves it unable to cross-pollinate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
