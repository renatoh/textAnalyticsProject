Mourinho, who was sacked by Chelsea in December, has been tipped as a potential replacement for the Dutchman after a difficult season for the 20-time champions. On Friday, the BBC claimed that negotiations with 53-year-old\u2019s representatives have begun, although the report stated that \u201cno agreement has been reached, and the club have made no comment\u201d. \u201cDutchman Van Gaal, 64, is expected to leave United at the end of the season - one year earlier than scheduled,\u201d it added. \u201cThat would leave the way clear for Mourinho, who is known to be excited by the prospect of taking over at Old Trafford. \u201cThe United hierarchy are thought to be keen to respond after Manchester City secured the services of coveted former Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola earlier this week.\u201d The report also states that Ryan Giggs, who took over as manager on an interim basis in April 2014 following the sacking of David Moyes and has been working as assistant to Van Gaal, would be unlikely to be as willing to work with the former Chelsea manager. If appointed, Mourinho would resume his often fractious rivalry with Guardiola, who Manchester City this week confirmed will succeed Manuel Pellegrini at the Etihad Stadium in the summer. The former Barcelona coach frequently clashed with the Portuguese when he was in charge of Real Madrid. Last month, Mourinho\u2019s agent Jorge Mendes branded a report claiming the Portuguese wrote to United regarding his credentials to be the next manager as \u201cridiculous and absurd\u201d. Mourinho was said to have sent United a six-page letter in which he outlined why he would be a suitable fit for the position. \u201cIt does not occur to anyone that a coach like Jos\u00e9 Mourinho can write letters to clubs offering their services. It is absolutely ridiculous and totally absurd,\u201d read his statement. Van Gaal\u2019s position came under increased scrutiny after defeats by Stoke on Boxing Day and then again after the 1-0 home defeat against Southampton on 23 January, which marked an 11th Premier League game in succession that United had failed to score at home in the first half. However, a comprehensive victory over Derby in the FA Cup was followed by a 3-0 win over Stoke last week that kept United in contention for a top-four finish. Yet with his side due to face champions Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Sunday, it appears the pressure will once again be on Van Gaal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
