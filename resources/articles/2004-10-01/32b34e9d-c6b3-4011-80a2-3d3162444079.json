That sort of betting experience is so last century. Now when the bookmaking industry gathers to buy into the future they are faced with enough electronic gimmickry to fill a Dixons warehouse. I have seen the future of betting, and it is touch-sensitive. That, at any rate, is what the great majority of the firms with stands at this year's Betting Show firmly believe. And if they get their way, the average British punter will soon believe it too. There were dozens of companies plying for trade in the Pavilion at the NEC in Birmingham, pushing everything from racing calendars to air fresheners, but it seemed as though at least half were selling the Fixed Odds Betting Terminals (or FOBTs) that have boosted bookies' profit margins so handsomely over the last couple of years. There was even a firm that helps bookmakers to defend their precious FOBTs from fraud and theft. There were companies urging bookies to add poker to their online business, and another that will enable punters to place bets with a website via their mobile. There were fruit machines, numbers games, even virtual Spoof. Will punters really bet on how many coins there are in a virtual hand? Someone clearly thinks that they will. So where, you had to wonder, as the lights flashed and the electronic roulette wheel span around, do horses - the genuine, breathing, non-pixellated ones - fit in to this vision of the betting industry's future? On the surface, it seems as though the favourite in the first at Market Rasen has no place in the betting shop of the future. Yet if you root around beneath all the flashy electronics, racing is still there. Indeed, it was hard to find anyone who did not expect it to remain the sound foundation on which most betting businesses are constructed. Rather, some argued, it is traditional bookmakers and not horseracing who should worry about what the future might hold. Consider, for instance, the compact betting terminals supplied by A Bet A Technology which can process a bet on anything, racing included, at the touch of three or four buttons. \"During the 1980s and early 1990s, there was a lot of consolidation in the off-course betting industry,\" Chris Latter, A Bet A's managing director, says. \"Big chains bought up smaller ones, and that effectively created a barrier to entry for new firms. Now, that barrier doesn't exist. For terminals like these you don't even need a shop, a kiosk will do the job. And if you have, say, 10 of those arranged in the area around a big betting shop, then the margins in that shop will be eroded to the point where they are unviable. \"In the longer term, with more deregulation, there's no reason why you couldn't separate off and license a part of an arcade, or a pub or a sports bar, and install terminals like these to process bets. I have people who come to me and say I own a club and have 500 people in for big football matches and they can't place a bet. Products like these can change that.\" There was a strong presence from the betting exchanges, with the three major sites - Betfair, Sporting Options and Betdaq - all taking stands to promote their hedging and odds-setting services for small bookmakers. From the independents' point of view, at least, it seems that exchanges are far from the sworn enemies of bookmaking that Ladbrokes and William Hill would have you believe. But perhaps the most reassuring sight of all at the show was the small stand where Polytime International were greeting customers old and new. They make pens for betting shops, the ones that fit snugly behind your ear, and never seem to go out of fashion. The incongruity of pushing such low-tech wares amid so much state-of-the-art was not lost on the man behind Polytime's desk. But nor was he too worried about going out of business. \"Last year we sold 100,000,000 pens to British betting shops,\" he said. \"People will always need pens.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
