What gives the movie a certain originality is that the setting is a touristic London. All the characters, however, are French and the only English we hear is sung on the soundtrack by Bryan Ferry, spoken by a cockney cabdriver (the single sentence: 'This is a taxi, not an 'orse'), and some lines from It's a Wonderful Life in a cinema."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
