A dog behaves normally in its own home; if you take it out of its normal environment it doesn't necessarily behave the same. Training can be as simple as getting a dog to walk properly. People like to take their dog out for a walk but don't necessarily like being pulled down the street. At the other end of the scale, we deal with aggression or constant barking. Our training concentrates on getting the owner to do the work and to be able to communicate with the dog in a way that it understands. People often try to have an arrangement with their dog where \"neither of us is the boss, we both live here together and we just love each other\". Unfortunately, dogs don't think that way. Dogs need leaders and it's important in a domestic situation that the owner is leader. For example, as humans we're usually very polite and let our children go out of a door first and we tend to do the same with our dogs. However, with your dog you should always go through the door first - because you're the leader. Amy Hatcher Dog trainer The best way to train is using positive methods, such as food rewards or stroking, to encourage the dog. If a dog is aggressive it's often because it's fearful, and what you should do is immediately turn round and walk the other way: ignoring the dog is actually punishment. You might also use noise aversion therapy; there's such thing as a pet corrector which sounds a bit like a foghorn and a load of cold air shoots out - that's really as negative a method as a dog trainer needs to use. Commonly, people seek help with dogs that don't like being left alone, and may bark or howl and destroy things. All you do is train the dog that it's OK to be bored and lonely, just like humans have to learn this. But you need to build up gradually the amount of time a dog is left alone. Training a dog is like baking a cake - you must have all the right ingredients. You need to make sure all the basics are there with a dog, too. So, you first train them to sit, lie down and stay. And after this, you can start to train an aggressive dog and re-socialise them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
