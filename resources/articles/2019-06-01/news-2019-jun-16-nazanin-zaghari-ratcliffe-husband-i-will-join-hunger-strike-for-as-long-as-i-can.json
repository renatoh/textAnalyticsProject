But Ratcliffe said it was important the action did not go \u201cto the bitter end\u201d because of their five-year-old daughter, Gabriella, who is also unable to leave Iran and return to the UK. Asked what he realistically expected from the Iranians in response, Ratcliffe said from outside the Iranian embassy in London, where he is maintaining a fast and vigil: \u201cThe message from Nazanin is: enough is enough. I think she wanted to make it clear to the authorities in prison that this can\u2019t go on. \u201cMy job in campaigning is always to amplify her message and to make it visible. That\u2019s partly why I\u2019m here, making it really clear.\u201d Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a dual British-Iranian national, was arrested during a holiday in the country, and later convicted on spying charges, which she has always robustly denied. The allegations have been criticised as a means for the country to pursue a policy of hostage diplomacy, particularly since the Iranian foreign minister mooted the possibility of a hostage swap, but soon appeared to retract the proposal. \u201cI spoke to her yesterday. She was calm, she said she had started doing it and we\u2019ll see how long it lasts. I think my job is to keep on going as long as she goes, if I can,\u201d Ratcliffe told the BBC on Sunday. \u201cWe are both parents to Gabriella and obviously it\u2019s important that this doesn\u2019t go to the bitter end.\u201d Asked by Andrew Marr how he was feeling, Ratcliffe said: \u201cCold and hungry, and a bit wet at the moment. It\u2019s given me a new insight into what it\u2019s like to sleep on the pavements.\u201d On whether the response from the British political class had been satisfactory, Ratcliffe said: \u201cLook, I\u2019ve been pretty rude about a number of politicians over my time. She\u2019s still in prison. My job is to keep campaigning, which means to keep complaining about the government and the ministers that are in charge. \u201cAt different points things have happened that have not gone perfectly, and she still remains in prison so its our job to keep going.\u201d The Conservative leadership frontrunner, Boris Johnson, was criticised after \u201cmistakenly\u201d claiming that Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who works for the Thompson-Reuters Foundation, was \u201ctraining journalists\u201d in Iran, and Ratcliffe said he had at times resented the former foreign secretary as a result. \u201cHe clearly made a mistake and clearly tried to correct it, and made a promise that he wasn\u2019t able to deliver on,\u201d he said. \u201cAt times I have resented him for it and there are bits I did resent him for. But yes, I think he probably got over-criticised for some things and under-criticised for some things, and the job is now with Jeremy Hunt and we look to him to solve it.\u201d Later in the programme, Hunt, the foreign secretary, was questioned over the \u201cmixed signals\u201d he was said to have conveyed to Ratcliffe about his wife\u2019s plight. \u201cI was being very honest when I spoke to Richard yesterday,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes, you hear signals from the Iranian regime that they want to resolve this issue, and sometimes they seem to go hard line. \u201cWhat I say to the Iranian government is that whatever the disputes that we have between us as countries \u2026 there is an innocent woman at the heart of this. Don\u2019t drag her into it. She must be allowed to come home.\u201d Last month, the UK advised British-Iranian dual nationals against all travel to Iran for the first time, following the sentencing of Aras Amiri, an Iranian national who worked for the British Council in London to 10 years in jail on spying charges."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
