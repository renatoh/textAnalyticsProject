Already one bowler light due to a broken toe suffered by their leading wicket-taker, Steven Patterson, Yorkshire lost another on the final morning when their former England left-armer Ryan Sidebottom woke with stiffness in his back. It wiped out any thoughts of the Division One leaders dangling a carrot to winless opposition. With Surrey's attack unable to run through a team of distinguished resolve \u2013 they have lost once in 27 County Championship matches \u2013 Pietersen was left to graze in the field for two and a half sessions. Only when the left-arm spinner Gary Keedy claimed his fifth wicket on his way to figures of seven for 99 \u2013 his best since August 2010 \u2013 did Yorkshire appear vulnerable. Adil Rashid's departure left Yorkshire 240 runs ahead with four wickets intact and 63 overs remaining of the match. The door was ajar but Liam Plunkett stood alongside it like a nightclub bouncer, to keep Surrey out, on his way to his second half-century of the match. This time he made 68 before being last man out, stumped off the Wakefield-born Keedy. That left two overs for Surrey to negotiate before a handshake that got KP his wish. In jovial mood the England batsman had told supporters the only reason he was still on the field was because they had forked out to watch. Yorkshire's captain, Andrew Gale, was in pragmatic mood. \"Coming to the ground this morning I was quite excited,\" he said. \"Unfortunately when I got here, Ryan Sidebottom had a stiff back. He said that when he woke up, he couldn't get his boxer shorts on. I am sure people know that Jason Gillespie and I try to promote positive cricket but we couldn't try to bowl Surrey out with just two seamers.\" It is anticipated the three-week hiatus until their next four-day assignment \u2013 against Derbyshire at Chesterfield \u2013 affords Patterson and the 35-year-old Sidebottom sufficient recovery time. But the lack of championship cricket for Yorkshire in that period is not so good for another member of the Headingley playing staff. Although likely to be an Ashes starter, the batsman Jonny Bairstow has not played a competitive innings since May's second Test win over New Zealand here, prompting the England management to discuss the possibility of him guesting for Somerset against the Australians this week. It is not clear why the idea was kiboshed, although it would have meant eight days of solid cricket \u2013 as the Taunton fixture is followed by England's contest with Essex in Chelmsford. While there may be concerns about a lack of time in the middle for Bairstow, Pietersen displayed no ill effects from his three-month injury lay-off. \"It was the best innings I have seen live on a cricket field,\" Gale said, of Pietersen's unbeaten 177. \"The way he went about his business it didn't matter where we put the fielders. He was going to hit it where they weren't. The guy is a genius. What can you say?\" The stand-in Surrey captain, Vikram Solanki, also praised Pietersen's influence and that of the Australian veteran Ricky Ponting, who opted to stay in Leeds for the entire match despite being ruled out with a hand injury. \"It has been great to have him around the Surrey environment,\" Solanki said of Pietersen. \"He seems very comfortable and very happy. Having people like Kevin and Ricky Ponting in the dressing room can only benefit the rest of the team. \"Ricky has worked with the entire batting group, he has a clear enthusiasm, a real love for the game and he has been keen to pass his experience and skill of batsmanship on to his team-mates.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
