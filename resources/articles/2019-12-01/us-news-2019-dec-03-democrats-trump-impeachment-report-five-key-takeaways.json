The report contends that Trump \u201cabused the power of his office for personal and political gain, at the expense of [US] national security\u201d. Here are five key findings: 1) \u2018The evidence of the president\u2019s misconduct is overwhelming\u2019 In reply to Trump and the Republicans\u2019 insistence that the investigation has gathered no evidence of wrongdoing, the 300-page report brandishes 100 hours of testimony from 17 witnesses and 30 hours of public hearings. The report also presents never-before-seen call records showing that Rudy Giuliani was in direct contact with the White House and the Office of Management and Budget after military aid to Ukraine was suspended. \u201cThe evidence of the president\u2019s misconduct is overwhelming, and so too is the evidence of his obstruction of Congress. Indeed, it would be hard to imagine a stronger or more complete case of obstruction than that demonstrated by the president since the inquiry began,\u201d the report says. 2) The report lays the groundwork for articles of impeachment The report is split into two main sections, one on \u201cthe president\u2019s misconduct\u201d and the other \u201cthe president\u2019s obstruction of the House of Representatives\u2019 impeachment inquiry\u201d. The sections seem easily adaptable to two articles of impeachment against Trump, one for abuse of power and one for obstruction of justice. There could be further articles. \u201cThe president engaged in this course of conduct for the benefit of his own presidential reelection, to harm the election prospects of a political rival, and to influence our nation\u2019s upcoming presidential election to his advantage,\u201d the report says. \u201cIn doing so, the president placed his own personal and political interests above the national interests of the United States, sought to undermine the integrity of the US presidential election process, and endangered US national security.\u201d 3) The report bakes in rebuttals of Republican arguments Cooked into the report are multiple rebuttals to arguments Republicans have made against the impeachment process. Republicans have said that Trump has had no mechanism for defending himself; that impeachment would amount to overturning the 2016 election; that Democrats have long pursued impeachment per se; and that impeachment requires a criminal act. As it summons evidence of Trump\u2019s misconduct, the report responds to those arguments, pointing out that witnesses requested by Republicans testified in public hearings and expressing the consensus of scholars that no statutory crime is necessary for impeachment (though Democrats have alleged campaign finance and other violations). As for the question of \u201coverturning the election\u201d, the report says: \u201cThe president and his allies are making a comprehensive attack on the very idea of fact and truth. How can a democracy survive without acceptance of a common set of experiences?\u201d 4) It implicates others around Trump The report blasts Trump administration officials who bowed to the White House demand that no one speak with the committees in a \u201csweeping effort to stonewall the House of Representatives\u201d. The months-long Ukraine scheme, the report says, was \u201cdriven by\u201d Trump. But \u201csenior US officials, including the vice-resident, the secretary of state, the acting chief of staff, the secretary of energy, and others were either knowledgeable of or active participants in an effort to extract from a foreign nation the personal political benefits sought by the president\u201d. 5) Unanswered questions \u2013 and two warnings With the inclusion of recently obtained phone records and other material, the report reveals that behind-the-scenes work on the case continues. \u201cThere remain unanswered questions, and our investigation must continue, even as we transmit our report to the judiciary committee,\u201d the report says. Then it delivers distinct warnings about what Trump might do next if he is not impeached \u2013 and what future presidents might do if Trump is not challenged on his obstruction of Congress. \u201cGiven the proximate threat of further presidential attempts to solicit foreign interference in our next election, we cannot wait to make a referral until our efforts to obtain additional testimony and documents wind their way through the courts,\u201d the report says. \u201cThe damage to our system of checks and balances, and to the balance of power within our three branches of government, will be long-lasting and potentially irrevocable if the president\u2019s ability to stonewall Congress goes unchecked. Any future president will feel empowered to resist an investigation into their own wrongdoing, malfeasance, or corruption, and the result will be a nation at far greater risk of all three.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
