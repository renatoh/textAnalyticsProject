Everything hinges on whether Newcastle United take a significant stride back towards the Premier League by beating Leeds United at St James\u2019 Park and leaving themselves within touching distance of automatic promotion. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you after Friday whether I can celebrate my birthday,\u201d says Rafael Ben\u00edtez. \u201cIf we win, I can enjoy it.\u201d Should victory against Leeds be followed by a combination of another three points at Ipswich Town on Monday and an Easter defeat for Huddersfield Town, Tyneside will be in party mode by Monday tea time but that finely calibrated promotion equation contains too many ifs for the Spaniard\u2019s comfort. \u201cThis club, this city, these fans, they deserve to be in the Premier League,\u201d Ben\u00edtez says. \u201cBut first we have to get promoted. We have to actually do it.\u201d Newcastle are two points behind Brighton, the leaders, who have been inspired by Anthony Knockaert\u2019s mesmerising wing play and can also be promoted on Monday if results go in their favour. The 10 points that separate Ben\u00edtez\u2019s team from third-placed Huddersfield may suggest Newcastle have cantered through the Championship but in recent weeks injuries to Dwight Gayle, their key striker, and Ciaran Clark, the side\u2019s best defender, have led to a wobble. There have been games in which the Champions League-winning former Liverpool manager has really had to earn his \u00a35m-a-year salary, matches when Ben\u00edtez\u2019s subtle tactical tweaks have camouflaged the team\u2019s flaws. Even so, there is a sense that the former Real Madrid manager \u2013 by consensus among the world\u2019s top 10 coaches \u2013 is perhaps not receiving the credit he deserves. Those critics who assume Newcastle should already be promoted with more than 100 points underestimate the difficulties of the second tier for a club which, despite spending almost \u00a355m on new players last summer, also raised \u00a385m from outgoing transfers. Ben\u00edtez, after narrowly failing to keep Newcastle in the Premier League following Steve McClaren\u2019s sacking last March, agreed to drop down a division \u201cbecause of the fans and the stature of this club\u201d but knew he was risking his reputation. He regularly points out that only four of the 15 sides relegated from the top flight in the five seasons spanning 2011-2016 returned at the first attempt. \u201cThe stats show how difficult this division is and how difficult it is to be where we are,\u201d he says. If fears that Newcastle might emulate the struggles endured by Leeds \u2013 play-off-bound courtesy of Garry Monk\u2019s coaching and Chris Wood\u2019s goals but experiencing a 13th season of top-flight exile \u2013 were overblown, their manager never underestimated the trickiness of his task. \u201cYou see where Norwich and Aston Villa are?\u201d Ben\u00edtez says, issuing a reminder that the two sides who came down with the Tyneside club will be staying put. \u201cThere\u2019s a massive difference between having to change half your squad like we did and having your team ready like Brighton or Sheffield Wednesday [sixth with six points collected against Newcastle] were. \u201cTo put everything together so quickly and still perform at this level, it\u2019s not easy but we made a profit in the summer and we\u2019re in a good financial position. Now we have to finish the job.\u201d The notion that Newcastle simply bought a guaranteed return passage to football\u2019s promised land irks Ben\u00edtez. \u201cIn some cases we maybe had to pay more for players we needed than their real value,\u201d he says. \u201cBut other Championship teams were spending too, one [Villa] more than us. And we had sold really well and made a profit so everything was perfect. Hopefully it can be perfect again.\u201d His words are underscored by a certain subtext containing a clear message for Mike Ashley, Newcastle\u2019s owner, who refused Ben\u00edtez permission in effect to rubber-stamp promotion by reinforcing Newcastle\u2019s squad in January. While real fears Ben\u00edtez could quit this summer have since been assuaged, his lack of direct communication with Ashley \u2013 incredibly, they have rarely spoken \u2013 remains a concern. Although the possibility a club ripe for a takeover could shortly be under new ownership cannot be discounted, there are worries Ashley and his manager may struggle to reach a compromise over the size of the next, all-important, transfer budget. Accordingly there is a distinct, slightly Machiavellian suspicion it may suit Ben\u00edtez to finish second behind Brighton, thereby highlighting the limitations of a squad in which Jonjo Shelvey ranks as the only creative central midfielder and too much invariably rests on Matt Ritchie\u2019s skill down the flanks. \u201cWe\u2019re going the right way but it\u2019s clear we still have plenty of room for improvement,\u201d the manager says, somewhat pointedly. \u201cWe can improve a lot of things. If Chris Hughton, a man fully conversant with the sometimes very peculiar politics of St James\u2019 Park, would rather enjoy finishing just above the side he guided to the 2010 Championship title, he is, publicly, playing the straightest of bats. \u201cPromotion would mean everything to everybody here,\u201d says Brighton\u2019s manager before Friday\u2019s trip to Wolves and Wigan\u2019s visit to the Amex on Monday. \u201cBut we can\u2019t think about it yet. We\u2019ve got five tough games ahead.\u201d Unfortunately for Hughton, his board do not seem quite on message and have taken the fate-tempting step of cautioning fans against invading the pitch should their long-awaited departure from the Championship be confirmed against Wigan. The top two are privately giving thanks that David Wagner\u2019s Huddersfield team \u2013 at home to Preston on Friday and at Derby on Monday \u2013 have lost three of their past four games. \u201cFrom one month ago I\u2019ve been talking about the pressure on Huddersfield,\u201d says Ben\u00edtez, with a knowing smile. \u201cBut now everyone\u2019s feeling the pressure. It\u2019s important we manage it. \u201cPromotion\u2019s the priority \u2026 then, afterwards, we will have plenty of time to talk about the future \u2026\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
