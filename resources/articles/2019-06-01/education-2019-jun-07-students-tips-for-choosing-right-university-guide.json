We asked 11 current students what they wish they\u2019d known before making their choices. Keep an open mind \u201cDon\u2019t feel obliged to go the conventional route. You don\u2019t have to go to university at 18. You don\u2019t have to just study one subject \u2013 multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary options are great.\u201d Explore your options \u201cI wish I\u2019d known that there were more options available than university. That not wanting to go to university didn\u2019t make me less intelligent. Despite not going to university, I\u2019m still in a better position than some of my peers who did go to one.\u201d It\u2019s not just about lectures \u201cLook at the things the university does to support students, what services there are, and what the student union is like. The stuff outside the classroom is as important as what happens in it, and is the stuff that keeps you going when things gets tough.\u201d Don\u2019t be blinded by reputation \u201cDon\u2019t focus on prestige. (Prestige is no guarantee of teaching quality!) Talk to existing students.\u201d Take a good look around \u201cVisit on a non-open day. As someone coming from overseas, I wasn\u2019t able to make open days. But I felt I had a better read on the unis I visited than those who went on the official open days.\u201d Research every detail \u201cLook into the content of the course. It may seem obvious, but one psychology degree is not the same as another ... looking at the research topics of the lecturers is often a good indicator. Oh, and think about how you will afford to get home if you are going to choose a uni in the deepest depths of north Wales ...\u201d Money isn\u2019t everything \u201cTry to look beyond the potential pay cheque at the end of it. Chemical engineers can get paid an absolute mint, but if you aren\u2019t passionate about the subject, you will hate every minute of your degree and you will not want a job in that field.\u201d You don\u2019t have to live in halls \u201cLiving away from home is not a choice for some and I was worried I would miss out on the university experience, only getting the \u2018boring\u2019 bits. And it\u2019s true, I never lived the student life. But I got to stay at home with a proper clean kitchen, have the students\u2019 night out when I wanted to, and have the break when needed.\u201d Put your passions first \u201cEnsure you choose a course you are genuinely interested in \u2013 and a career that requires you to have a degree in the field of your choice, otherwise it is a rather expensive piece of paper. Choose the course, rather than the city with the best nightlife. Beer tastes the same anywhere.\u201d Weigh up your costs \u201cThe cost of living can be extortionate in some cities. There\u2019s a huge difference in cost to live in halls at different universities and standards can be grim at the popular unis. I think students get swayed by popularity and where is considered cool to go, but it doesn\u2019t equate to value for money.\u201d Take your time \u201cDo not stress out and do not pick last-minute or in a hurry. There is time. Uni has been one of the best experiences of my life. I waited four extra years to go and I think I gained more from it. You will not enjoy it if you\u2019re not ready or have not made an informed decision. Have fun, and look forward to September!\u201d Get your Guardian University Guide 2020 print supplement free with Saturday\u2019s Guardian 8 June"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
