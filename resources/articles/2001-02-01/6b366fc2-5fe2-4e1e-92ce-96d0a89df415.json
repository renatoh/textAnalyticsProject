Carbone will play for the reserves against Liverpool tomorrow, provided he shakes off a groin injury picked up in training, and then may be earmarked for a return against Southampton on Saturday. \"Beni has set his heart on going back to Italy, but that window closed on Wednesday with the transfer deadline there,\" Jefferies said. \"He has no interest in going anywhere else and that means nothing can happen until the summer. But we've had a wee chat and he is now looking to get back into it. He is training very hard and there is a chance for him. \"Beni is a different case to Stan Collymore and Dan Petrescu, and it is better to persevere with him. The opportunity to go to Italy will open up again in the summer. It is a case of keeping his head up and getting him involved.\" There was no doubting the perseverance that has gone into Bradford City's construction: a dutiful manager has produced an industrious team which in a decent world would deserve a chance of survival. Their midfield now comprises five hard-running professionals, as respectful of each other's dedication as they were suspicious of the flashier souls such as Collymore, Petrescu and Carbone. But to summon up the form they now need to escape relegation, City need an inspirational goalscorer blessed by amazing talent and fortune. Instead they have Dean Windass. It was Windass, hefty, wholehearted and sponsored by a local pub, whose spurned open goal at Sunderland a fortnight earlier had hinted that relegation was inevitable. He remains desperate to make amends. Whether it was a close-in header sailing narrowly wide, or a slithering run on goal ended by Steve Staunton's saving tackle, he was a picture of plucky self-admonishment. Villa's manager John Gregory presented their escape from a losing run as proof that European qualification is still a realistic aim but they will require more creative wit. Until Bradford errors gifted them two goals early in the second half they relied entirely on the invention and touch of the admirable Paul Merson. Darius Vassell was the beneficiary of Bradford's errors, twice scoring expertly after poor clearances, firstly from Robert Molenaar and then from the goalkeeper Gary Walsh, who must forever dream of those far-off days when goalkeepers could pick up the ball whenever they wanted to. Julian Joachim, racing on to Lee Hendrie's pass, added a third late on as Bradford's desperate attacking response caused defensive chaos. Vassell should have finished with a hat-trick. One Villa striker failed to benefit. Juan Pablo Angel, Gregory's \u00a39.5m Colombian, might well be a master of the three-yard tap-in but on Saturday he was forever victim of the 30-yard offside trap. Mystified also by several debatable refereeing decisions in favour of his marker Peter Atherton, Angel was substituted 15 minutes from time, an expensive purchase still adrift in a bewildering land. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
