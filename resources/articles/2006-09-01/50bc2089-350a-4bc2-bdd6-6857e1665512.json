This mixture of a cappella choral and instrumental works from the 1950s and 1960s is a timely and beautifully performed tribute. It ranges from the Motet of 1953, in which Lutyens sets a text from Wittgenstein's Tractatus, to Verses of Love from 1970, whose settings of poems by Ben Jonson show her moving away from the 12-note technique that she had so single-mindedly employed since the second world war. If none of the pieces here ranks among Lutyens's very greatest - CD reissues of some of those are badly needed - they are all fine examples of her powerfully concentrated style, from a period in which her language was at its most pungent and highly-wrought, whether in the keening monodies of the solo oboe Pr\u00e9sages, or the patchworks and mosaics of the Webernesque String Trio and the Fantasie Trio, for flute, clarinet and piano."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
