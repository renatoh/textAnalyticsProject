The prime minister said he had talked with Barack Obama about the case of McKinnon, 43, who is accused of hacking into US government computer systems for which he faces extradition and up to 60 years in jail. Cameron said McKinnon was accused of a \"very important and significant crime\" but hoped that \"a way through\" could be found. Cameron and Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, have publicly criticised plans to extradite McKinnon. Last year Cameron said that there was \"a clear argument to be made that he should answer [any questions] in a British court\". But Cameron took a more diplomatic tack last night. Speaking at a joint press conference with Obama, he said: \"Clearly there is a discussion going on between the British and the Americans about this, but I don't want to prejudice those discussions. We completely understand that Gary McKinnon stands accused of a very important and significant crime in terms of hacking into vital databases, and nobody denies that is an important crime that has to be considered. I have had conversations with the US ambassador as well as raising it with the president, and I hope a way through can be found.\" Previously an outspoken critic of plans to extradite McKinnon, Cameron's comments are the first he has made since becoming prime minister. McKinnon claims he only hacked into US systems in 2001-2 to search for evidence of UFOs. Campaigners for McKinnon, who suffers from Asperger's syndrome, an autism spectrum disorder, said they were \"overjoyed\" and hoped Cameron's comments signalled a resolution to their eight-year campaign. Janis Sharp, McKinnon's mother, said the discussion was a landmark moment: \"I'm very proud that David Cameron has the guts to stand up for a British citizen \u2013 it's wonderful. Our hopes are that a trail will happen in the UK and there's much more chance of that now ... It's not over yet but it has given us hope,.\" His lawyer, Karen Todner, said: \"We're very pleased that David Cameron has raised this and had a face-to-face discussion about Gary. Obama has used the term an appropriate solution and the appropriate solution is that he stands trial in the UK. \" Last year Alan Johnson, the former home secretary and Theresa May's predecessor, ruled that McKinnon could face extradition and trial in the US but his lawyers were granted permission for a judicial review into whether the decision breached human rights. The case took another turn when May stepped in to adjourn the review days before it was due to start to consider whether McKinnon is fit to stand trial in the US. The home secretary is still considering the issue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
