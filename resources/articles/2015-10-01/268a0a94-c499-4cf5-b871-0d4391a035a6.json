While many of the candidates inside the wire fencing and security cordon have roused their supporters with fierce anti-immigration rhetoric, a group of campaigners on the other side of campus are holding a rally to protest what they see as an alarmingly xenophobic tone to the Republican primary. At the heart of the dispute is, of course, the controversial figure of Donald Trump, whose characterisation of Mexican immigrants in particular as \u201crapists and criminals\u201d, along with images of immigration protesters being dragged from his campaign events, has incensed many Americans, on the right and the left. But activists representing the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the US believe Trump\u2019s influence has also weakened support for their cause among previously sympathetic Republicans such as Marco Rubio and claim Trump is only marginally more extreme than other frontrunners such as Ben Carson. \u201cOn this issue, Donald Trump is the face of the Republican party,\u201d says Dolores Huerta, co-founder of the United Farm Workers Union and a civil rights activist who is one of 20 speakers at Wednesday\u2019s rally. \u201cHis anti-immigrant rhetoric and anti-Mexican rhetoric specifically has dragged the other candidates to the right,\u201d she adds. \u201cEven Ben Carson says he would like people to stay here as guest workers, so they would not have rights or a path to citizenship. It\u2019s really just a step up from slavery.\u201d It would be tempting to dismiss the event \u2013 complete with banners proclaiming \u201cstand up to anti-immigrant politicians\u201d \u2013 as an entirely partisan affair, designed to shore up support for Democrats and paint Republicans in the most extreme light possible. But the debate\u2019s presence in Colorado, a so-called \u201cpurple\u201d state with a tradition of teetering between Republicans and Democrats and a fast-growing Latino population, points to a demographic reality that the party of Lincoln arguably cannot afford to ignore. Soon after the last presidential election in 2012, when Barack Obama trounced Mitt Romney among non-white voters, Republican strategists commissioned a report to seek ways of appealing to Latino communities. Even at the midterm elections in 2014, the failure of sympathetic Republicans to drive immigration reform through Congress did not stop successful Senate candidates such as Cory Gardner in Colorado from seeking to distance themselves from more extreme views in their party. But many in the state are surprised at the extent to which what they say is \u201cvile and hateful rhetoric\u201d has been allowed to taint the Republican brand in recent months. \u201cLatinos in Colorado are a key swing vote in close elections,\u201d says Federico Pe\u00f1a, a former Democratic mayor of Denver. \u201cI believe you can\u2019t win a presidential election without at least 35 to 40% of Latino voters nationwide, and I think many serious Republicans know that too.\u201d Not of all the presidential candidates have distanced themselves from immigration reform. Jeb Bush, for example, has used his support for a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants who came to the US as children as a way to distance himself from Trump. And not all activists see the other party as an automatic friend of immigration reform, either. \u201cEven among Democrats, there have been times in the past when they haven\u2019t been good to us, so we have a message for both parties,\u201d says Lynn Tramonte, deputy director of the advocacy group America\u2019s Voice and an organiser of the Boulder rally. \u201cEvery four years, the Latino population grows and it\u2019s horrifically damaging for Republicans,\u201d she adds. \u201cThey have got their heads in the sand thinking they can somehow pull off a miracle, insult groups of voters, talk badly about their family members and friends and somehow win elections.\u201d But increasingly, the tone of the debate within the Republican party is providing a clarifying moment for the immigration campaigners and a rallying point for Democrats. Organisers of the event outside Wednesday\u2019s debate say it now has two purposes: one is to \u201cspeak out against misrepresentation of the Latino community\u201d and the other is to provide an outlet for people to do something about it. \u201cWe are going to harness the anger and encourage people to register to vote,\u201d says Pe\u00f1a."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
