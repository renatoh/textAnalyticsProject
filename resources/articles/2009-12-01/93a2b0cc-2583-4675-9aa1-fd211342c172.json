Wobbling by one of the customary members of the top four has intensified the demands on others to take advantage and infiltrate the Champions League places. The fact Martin O'Neill's Aston Villa currently seem the most capable of exploiting the opportunity places even more strain on the men in charge of the other most vaunted contenders, Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur. Consecutive away victories over Manchester United and Sunderland, which followed wins over Liverpool and Chelsea, have propelled Villa into the Premier League's most exalted group and confronted Mark Hughes and Harry Redknapp with a complication that, if not altogether unforeseen in the summer, certainly seemed improbable after O'Neill's men began the season with a 2-0 home defeat by Wigan. Villa have atoned for that early flop in impressive fashion, while the form of City and Spurs has fluctuated in a way that frustrates their supporters. City's best result of the season - the 2-1 triumph over Chelsea - was sandwiched between eight draws, including decried ones at home to Hull and Burnley, while Spurs have mixed impressive wins - such as the opening day defeat of Liverpool and the 9-1 massacre of Wigan - with losses at home to Stoke and Wolves. Hughes and Redknapp must find a cure to their inconsistency quickly. In terms of team-building, O'Neill has had a head-start on both Hughes and Redknapp. The Irishman has been in his current post since the summer of 2006, whereas Redknapp arrived at White Hart Lane in November 2008 and City hired Hughes in the summer of that year. But time is counted faster for Hughes, in particular, what with City's Abu Dhabi owners having bankrolled net transfer expenditure of \u00a3160m since the Welshman's arrival. Eyebrow-raising fees have not yet translated into enough eye-catching performances. The defence, which conceded three goals at Bolton at the weekend, has looked especially suspect, and it has not escaped the attention of City fans that while the \u00a322m Joleon Lescott and \u00a314m Kolo Tour\u00e9 have struggled to solidify the centre of their defence, a prominent figure in Villa's rise this season has been Richard Dunne, who was jettisoned by City in August for the relatively paltry sum of \u00a36m. The fact Lescott underwent minor knee surgery before tonight's trip to Tottenham offers a reason for judging some of his performances leniently, and also provided Hughes with a chance to change the composition of his defence without losing face. Lescott's young deputy, Nedum Onuoha, has previously shown promise but last night he and Tour\u00e9 were run ragged by Tottenham, who also constantly exposed the weakness of City's full-backs, Micah Richards and Sylvinho, in one-on-one duels. Tottenham appear to have better options in the centre of defence, where Michael Dawson and S\u00e9bastien Bassong have performed well in the absences of Ledley King and Jonathan Woodgate. Ominously, however, Bassong will join up with his Cameroon team-mates for the African Cup of Nations - Redknapp has said Tom Huddlestone and Vedran Corluka could fill in central defence if required, but would no doubt prefer to buy a replacement. His problem is that he has been told by his club's moneymen that he must sell players to fund any recruits, and City may be after the same target as him. Hughes may have a mighty budget in January. But if the state of his defence does not prove that lavish recruitment is an automatic solution, the spluttering nature of his attack may do so. City failed to trouble Tottenham's defence last night. That is a recurring theme this season. Shaun Wright-Phillips and Craig Bellamy were significant absentees last night, but they have been present during similarly impotent displays against different opponents this season. With the abundance of attacking options at his disposal, Hughes is expected to find a formula to regularly outscore opponents. Spurs have a clear way of playing; the loss of playmaker Luka Modric earlier in this season has not been as ruinous as previously supposed because his fellow Croatian, Niko Kranjcar, has simply stepped in to his well-defined role. Villa are a similarly fluid unit going forward and are more diligent than both City and Spurs when they do not have the ball - a telling statistic is that they have performed more tackles than any other team in the Premier League this season. City, by contrast, do not yet have a coherent identity. The wealth of the club's backers means Hughes will have the advantage of bringing in more personnel in January, but more faces do not necessarily make a stronger personality."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
