I think people are captivated by the childhood they've left behind. The Railway Children captures that feeling in such a particular way. Roberta's opened a lot of doors for me because people like her so much. Los Angeles is very beguiling. I moved there when I was 21 and I lived there for 16 years. There's a real sense of freedom, it's entirely what you make of it. Taxi drivers have all seen Walkabout. They all say, \"Oh, you were in that Australian film.\" They're really into it. You never really know somebody. My husband is full of surprises. Breaking out of being a child actor was easy. It's much harder to stop playing the ingenue or the girlfriend. I really like rap music. I'd love to do a version of Romeo and Juliet set in Trinidad, so you could use hip hop, calypso and Soca music. Eminem would make a wonderful Mercutio. Work is more fun for me than parties. I'm good one on one, but no use at small talk. Alex in An American Werewolf in London was a great role. She was a real individual, she just had an unfortunate boyfriend. A lot of women get into a situation where they think someone is one thing and they're actually another. I carry the gene for cystic fibrosis, it's very much in my family. I'd love to see a cure. Getting old is when you start complaining about the next generation. We should be making changes to be like the new generation, instead of moaning. When I met Fred Astaire I was gobsmacked. He was absolutely \u2013 in a way that I don't think people are today \u2013 a star. It's easy to take on the appearance of being older without actually growing up. I went to boarding school and then worked as an actor. Both make you grow up in the way that's expected of you, but your emotional development is slow.
