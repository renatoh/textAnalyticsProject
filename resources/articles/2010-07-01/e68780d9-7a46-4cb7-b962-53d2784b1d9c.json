Launched in 2007, it seeks to improve education, health, livelihoods, sanitation and community empowerment for 25,000 people in Katine, an area of north-eastern Uganda which has suffered civil war, drought and extreme poverty. \"The power of this partnership \u2026 is impressive,\" the citation said. \"It is easy to see that the work being done in Katine, Uganda has great potential for being scaled up and replicated. Bringing together inclusive financial products and the power of the media with the expertise of an NGO is very exciting.\" Supported by the Department for International Development, the Coffey international award recognises company programmes that can demonstrate a positive impact in one or more of the UN Millennium Development Goals, which include the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger. Coffey, a consultancy company, sponsored the prize as part of the Business in the Community awards for excellence in corporate responsibility."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
