Mexico registered 2,585 homicides in March \u2013 the highest monthly figure since records began in 1997 \u2013 putting 2020 on track to break last year\u2019s record total for murders. The surge in killings comes as federal and state officials put resources into containing the Covid-19 crisis and confront the prospect of an already sluggish economy falling even further \u2013 potentially deepening the misery for the more than 40% of the population living in poverty. \u201cIt\u2019s business as usual [for drug cartels] with a risk of further escalation, especially if at some point the armed forces are called away for pandemic control,\u201d said Falko Ernst, senior Mexico analyst at the International Crisis Group. Violence has flared throughout the country, but it has been especially intense in the central state of Guanajuato, where criminal groups have battled over lucrative territories rife with theft from pipelines. The bloodshed has hit shocking levels in the city of Ceyala \u2013 home to a major automotive manufacturing plant \u2013 with gunmen engaging security forces in shootouts, blockading streets and torching businesses. Francisco Rivas, director of the National Citizen Observatory, which monitors security issues, attributed the increasing violence in Guanajuato to the fallout of the federal government trying to stamp out petrol theft. The crackdown weakened the local Santa Rosa de Lima cartel, Rivas said, prompting the rival Jalisco New Generation cartel (CJNG) to move in and attempt to take its territory. Other causes for rising violence, Rivas said, include growing pains with a new militarised police known as the national guard, the lack of a federal strategy and cutting the security budget to its lowest level in 20 years. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing violence hitting its peak and we\u2019re left asking, \u2018who\u2019s going to stop it?\u2019\u201d Rivas said. President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador said on Friday that a drop in violence had been expected towards the end of March when coronavirus cases had started increasing in Mexico, \u201cbut it didn\u2019t turn out like that.\u201d L\u00f3pez Obrador came to power promising to solve Mexico\u2019s security woes by tacking what he considered the root causes of crime: poverty and corruption. But the strategy has so far failed to rein in the violence. \u201cThe [anti-crime] strategy isn\u2019t a strategy,\u201d said Rivas. \u201cThe national guard isn\u2019t pulling its weight because building an institution is difficult and expensive. Budget cuts to public security have been brutal. These all have serious effects.\u201d The president stirred further outrage during a visit to Sinaloa state on Sunday, when he stopped to greet the mother of convicted cartel kingpin Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n \u2013 breaking with social-distancing protocols to shake her hand. L\u00f3pez Obrador downplayed the greeting as little more than a courtesy to a mother who hadn\u2019t seen her son in five years, but his comments prompted outrage from families of victims of violence, who say he has failed to extend the same courtesy to them. \u201cFor society and victims, who have been having a hard time meeting or being listened to by the president,\u201d Ernst said, \u201cit\u2019s a heavy slap in the face.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
