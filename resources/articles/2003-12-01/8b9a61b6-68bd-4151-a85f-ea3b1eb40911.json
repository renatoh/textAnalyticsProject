Yesterday the time was right and without Andrew Flintoff they would have wasted it. A first-day score of 259 for eight was far from disastrous on a dry pitch that was already showing signs of breaking up. But after England won the toss in Sri Lanka for the first time in six Tests, they missed a glorious chance to put the final Test - and the series - beyond reach. Flintoff was England's saviour with a tub-thumping 77 from 109 balls, including 10 fours and four sixes - an innings entirely unencumbered by apprehension that England were about to waste a month of hard graft with a few hours' indiscretions. Muttiah Muralitharan's wiles were treated with utmost respect; the rest of the Sri Lankan attack felt the power. For a batsman previously so enfeebled by the sub-continent, as if the slow pitches, constant clamour and clammy air drained the life from him, Flintoff was a revelation. Upul Chandana's leg-spin was assailed so powerfully that he might have considered bowling in one of the Sri Lankan devil masks that are produced in their hundreds for his uncle's gift shop close to the ancient ruins of Polonnaruwa. Failing that, he could have bowled in a Murali mask, which for England amounts to pretty much the same thing. Flintoff thundered Chandana for two straight sixes and swept him for another over midwicket. There was technically a caught-and-bowled chance while he was on 68, when Chandana was fortunate not to damage his left hand, and another bludgeoning straight drive that caused the umpire Aleem Dar to perform a backward roll for safety; David Shepherd would not have stood a chance. But Murali was a different proposition. This was the Murali who was supposed to be exhausted after his heavy workload in the first two Tests, a man whose shoulder was said to be creaking like a haunted- house door and who was never more than a few yards from an ice pack. Murali's day's work was 37-20-38-3 and one of the three was Flintoff, who had defended with slightly more delicacy than normal until he drove forcefully at a short wrong 'un for the bowler to hold a tumbling low catch that was confirmed by a television replay. While the Sri Lankan team were grateful for the conclusive proof offered by the cameras there were those outside the ground who denounced their presence as about 30 Buddhist monks protested against showing the match live on television while the country mourns the death of a prominent cleric. England had started the day at a canter with 49 on the board after seven new-ball overs from Chaminda Vaas and Dilhara Fernando as if Marcus Trescothick, in particular, had heeded the psychological assault from Sri Lanka's Australian coach, John Dyson, that they were the defensive dinosaurs of the cricketing world. Trescothick, with 70 from 98 balls, matched Flintoff for scoring rate and general bulk but his was a much gentler destruction, with several tucks off his legs and easeful drives. His half-century came in only 39 balls, with his 11th boundary a cut against the off-spin of Thilan Samaraweera. Michael Vaughan fell to Chandana, pushing cagily forward to be caught at slip and, when Trescothick followed in similar fashion to Murali on the stroke of lunch, it devalued much of England's good work. But it was the first hour of the afternoon that was most disturbing for the tourists: Mark Butcher, Nasser Hussain and Graham Thorpe were all dismissed, the last two in successive overs. Butcher got one that left him from Fernando, Thorpe was trapped on the crease by Murali's wrong 'un but it was Hussain's departure between them that was most exasperating - an innings full of angst ended by a marginal lbw decision when Vaas shaded a ball back into him. In light of this, for Flintoff to play so freely from 139 for five was a redoubtable effort. Gareth Batty supported him unobtrusively until he pulled a long hop to midwicket and Chris Read continued in similar vein until Flintoff's demise. Read, demoted below Batty to No8, lost Ashley Giles as a partner to a poor run-out in the penultimate over of the day but had enlivened his own defence with one straight six against Chandana that outdid even the best of Freddie.
