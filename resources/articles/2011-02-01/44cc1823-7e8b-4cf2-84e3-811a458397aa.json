Image: Dan Logen, 22 January 2010 [velociraptorize]. Nikon D300, 200-400 lens at 400, ISO 500, f/5.6, 1/60 sec Question: This lovely African mystery bird closely resembles two other African species. It has a large range and those populations that breed in Europe and Asia are migratory, whilst those that breed in Africa mostly are not migratory. Can you identify this bird's genus and species? Response: This is an adult red-rumped swallow, Cecropis daurica. Unfortunately, the characteristic pale-coloured rump, pale \"collar\" and black undertail coverts are obscured in this photograph, but the pale throat, creamy-white belly and the blue colouring that extends below the eye are distinguishing field marks that are visible in this photograph. You are invited to review all of the daily mystery birds by going to their dedicated graphic index page. If you have bird images, video or mp3 files that you'd like to share with a large and (mostly) appreciative audience, feel free to email them to me for consideration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
