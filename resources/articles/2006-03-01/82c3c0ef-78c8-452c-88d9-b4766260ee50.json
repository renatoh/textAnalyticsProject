She said she started exercising after being shamed into it by husband George's athleticism. The TV appearance follows that of US secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, in which she detailed a gruelling daily workout. Mrs Bush said her efforts paled in comparison. She said she sometimes works out in the White House gym with her husband, and liked walking with friends or her dog. \"I was never an athlete.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
