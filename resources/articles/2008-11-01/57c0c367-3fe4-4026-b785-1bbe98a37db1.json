Tuncay Sanli's winner with just two minutes remaining secured all three points for Gareth Southgate on his return as manager to the club where he spent six years as a player. For O'Neill it was a desperately disappointing end to an afternoon where a win would have seen them move ahead of Manchester United and into fourth place in the Premier League table. Villa had enough chances to secure victory, but were caught out in the end when Tuncay latched onto a dreadful Steve Sidwell backpass to slot past Brad Friedel in the Villa goal. It was a disastrous end to the game for Sidwell, who was making his first league start for Villa following his \u00a35m summer move from Chelsea. The midfielder had earlier equalised Tuncay's opener with a back post header from a James Milner cross in the 37th minute. That goal came just three minutes after Middlesbrough had taken a surprise lead when Villa full-back Nicky Shorey deflected a Stewart Downing cross into the path of Tuncay, who placed a low shot past Friedel from eight yards. Villa were dominant in the second-half, and Sidwell could have put them ahead but his header went over the bar. Middlesbrough goalkeeper Ross Turnbull then saved well from Gabriel Agbonlahor, Milner and Luke Young as the home side went in search of the winner, but in the end they were outdone by Tuncay in the dying minutes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
