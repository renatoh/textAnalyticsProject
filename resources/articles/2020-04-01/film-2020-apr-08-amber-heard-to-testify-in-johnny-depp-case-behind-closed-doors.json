Heard is a key witness in a libel case in which Depp is suing the Sun newspaper and its associate editor, Dan Wootton, over an article that referred to the Pirates of the Caribbean star as a \u201cwife-beater\u201d. Depp\u2019s lawyers claimed Heard has been using \u201csalacious\u201d claims to draw attention to the case and questioned her desire to give parts of her evidence without journalists in the room. \u201cShe hasn\u2019t sought anonymity, quite the opposite,\u201d argued David Sherborne, acting for Depp. He said Heard\u2019s accusations would be proved to be \u201coutright lies\u201d and said they would need to be scrutinised \u201cvery carefully\u201d. He argued Heard\u2019s decision to identify as a prominent supporter of the #MeToo movement and publicly take part in United Nations events about sexual violence meant she could not later request privacy when giving evidence. \u201cIs it really the case that she is so distressed that it is necessary for the principle of open justice to be overturned?\u201d asked Sherborne. He later added: \u201cHe [Depp] is in the worst of all worlds, where it is said very publicly that he committed acts of sexual violence but the details of them will be heard behind closed doors.\u201d Mr Justice Nicol, having heard the arguments from Depp\u2019s legal team and Adam Wolanski QC for NGN, who made the case on Heard\u2019s behalf, ruled the nature of the \u201csexual violence\u201d claims being made by Heard meant she should be allowed to give evidence behind closed doors. \u201cThe matters which will be dealt with in private are of a different order to what has been made public so far. I am satisfied that there is good reason to treat them differently.\u201d Heard previously obtained a domestic violence restraining order against Depp in 2016, shortly after she filed for divorce. In a separate case, Depp is personally suing Heard for libel in the US over an opinion piece she wrote for the Washington Post in 2018 about being a public survivor of abuse, which did not specifically mention Depp. The British libel trial had been expected to start at the end of March and was expected to feature a string of celebrity witnesses. However, it was adjourned two weeks ago after the judge concluded it was impossible to call on witnesses to travel from around the world due to the coronavirus pandemic. One key issue is the circumstances in which Depp lost the tip of one of his fingers while filming the fifth Pirates of the Caribbean film, around the same time the duo were at the centre of a storm over bringing their dogs to Australia. Depp says Heard inflicted the injury on him, while Heard claims Depp did it to himself while on a three-day booze and drugs bender. The hearing on Wednesday morning took place on a Skype conference call, with the judge, journalists and lawyers dialling from as far afield as Australia to watch a sometimes unusual hearing, which was occasionally interrupted by patchy internet connections. Leading lawyers made impassioned pleas over their webcams, while the spare bedrooms of leading legal figures were on display for all to see. When the hearing entered a private session, the judge ordered journalists covering the case to hang up the Skype call, with a clerk checking that no reporters remained on the conference call. A spokesperson for Heard welcomed the ruling: \u201cWe welcome Mr Justice Nicol\u2019s decision to allow evidence relating to \u2018sexual violence\u2019 to be heard in closed court. There is simply no reason for such sensitive evidence to be exposed to the world\u2019s press. \u201cWe are pleased that the court made this order despite Depp\u2019s troubling argument that Amber should not benefit from the right to privacy in relation to sexual violence, because of her public association with the #MeToo movement and her advocacy for victims of sexual violence at the United Nations.\u201d The trial is scheduled to take place in July. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 April 2020 to remove references to David Sherborne being a Queen\u2019s Counsel. He has not been appointed to this position."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
