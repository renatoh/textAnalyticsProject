The World of Warcraft expansion \u2013 only the second since the game launched in Europe in 2005 \u2013 adds in a pile of new features but clearly the most exciting addition is a whole new landmass to explore/bash gnomes in. Hurrah. There's other stuff too but for me it's that journey into the unknown which is most appealing, especially as I've never had the time or patience to get really bogged down in endgame. To celebrate/hype Lich King's release publisher Blizzard has just announced that subscriptions have reached 11 million. Impressive then, although a combination of player fatigue and big name competitors like Warhammer Online are likely to have slowed growth. Chance are, of course, that Lich King will see a surge in new and re-subscriptions. But how does Blizzard define a subscriber? The press release tells us: World of Warcraft subscribers include individuals who have paid a subscription fee or have an active prepaid card to play World of Warcraft, as well as those who have purchased the game and are within their free month of access. Internet Game Room players who have accessed the game over the last thirty days are also counted as subscribers. The above definition excludes all players under free promotional subscriptions, expired or cancelled subscriptions, and expired prepaid cards. Subscribers in licensees' territories are defined along the same rules. So, never played WoW but tempted by Lich King? Or is this expansion one for fans only?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
