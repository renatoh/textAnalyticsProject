Details of the prime minister's approach emerged as a leaked independent report into safety on the rail network accused Railtrack of gross incompetence and negligence. The report, which Railtrack refuses to publish at present, gives a damning insight into the failure of the company and its sub-contractors to deal with gauge corner cracking, the track disintegration which caused last year's Hatfield crash in which four people died. The investigation, commissioned by Railtrack, draws attention to the poor relationship that exists between Railtrack and contractors appointed by the company to maintain the track. With a general election approaching, the government is keen to be seen to taking a firm line with Railtrack in a bid to win back the confidence - and votes - of disgruntled passengers. Railtrack's chairman, Sir Philip Beck, is retiring in the summer and the early appointment of a tough and respected successor would send the message that improvements were on the way. Mr James, who calls himself a \"crisis manager\", has made it clear that he is interested in the role, but would accept the job only as a fulltime executive chairman with the backing of Railtrack's directors. But Railtrack is making it equally clear that it wants only a non-executive, part-time chairman so that the day-to-day running of the network remains with new chief executive, Steven Marshall. Before Christmas the company circulated a letter to ministers pointing out that Railtrack's directors would decide who took over as chairman and that they would not tolerate intervention in the selection procedure. The leaked report, undertaken by rail experts from Britain and abroad, was astonished to find that Railtrack had insufficient ultrasonic testing equipment for track inspection. It also blames some of the problems on fragmentation of the industry, which was broken up into more than 100 different parts when British Rail was hurriedly privatised by John Major. Later this month the Health and Safety Executive is expected to recommend to the British transport police that criminal manslaughter charges be brought against up to six officials of Railtrack and Balfour Beatty, its main contractor at Hatfield, responsible for the maintenance of the track. Criminal prosecutions would follow, which the Government hopes would prevent calls for a public inquiry into the events surrounding the Hatfield tragedy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
