It can be a frustrating business at times, as Leighton Baines is willing to admit. In another era Baines might have had legitimate aspirations of playing 50 or 60 times for England. As it is, he has been restricted to nine caps. He has been an excellent and consistent performer for Everton but his place in Roy Hodgson's team for Friday's game in Moldova boils down to one thing: Ashley Cole, the first-choice left-back, is injured. A different player might be filled with insecurity or sulk or maybe start to resent the man ahead of him. Baines could have a stormer in Chisinau and the same again when Ukraine play at Wembley on Tuesday. It would make no difference. Cole, fitness permitting, will come back into the team for the World Cup qualifiers against San Marino and Poland next month, winning his 99th and 100th caps in the process, while Baines will slip back to the fringes and the same cycle of waiting for his next turn. Yet there was no trace of bitterness as Baines reflected this week on the pecking order. \"I guess it could be [frustrating] but it helps that I have the release of playing for my club every week, your bread and butter, what you're doing week in week out. More than anything, you have appreciation of the guy ahead of you. Ash is a good player and you have to respect that. \"I can't get too frustrated when the guy in front of me is such a good player. I have so much respect for him, so you just bide your time. If I had been doing it since I was 20 and eight years down the line I'd got only eight caps, then maybe the frustration would build a bit more. But I came into it later, I'm still keen to get involved and get games. Along the way you pick up caps and that keeps you going.\" The Moldova game will be Baines's first competitive start, two and a half years since making his debut. Baines, 27, was one of only five outfield players in Hodgson's Euro 2012 squad not to get a single minute of action. Yet Cole, he knows, will not be around for ever. The Chelsea player is four years older, turning 32 in December, with no guarantees that he will carry on after the 2014 World Cup. Until then Baines is realistic about his chances of challenging Cole. \"Hopefully if I get the chance to play [against Moldova] I can do well enough for that to be a possibility. But it's difficult because of what Ash brings to the table. For me it's just going to be one or two games really. It's difficult but my mentality has always been to do as well as I can for Everton first. I've done well enough now to be the second-choice left-back for England for a while but not been able to push on to that next level. Ash is just so good and there are other things that play a part, like not playing at the top level \u2013 in terms of the Champions League.\" That last point raises the question as to whether Baines might ever be tempted to leave Everton, having been the subject of speculation about a possible move to Manchester United this summer. \"I pretty much ignored it [the transfer talk] but it was getting to the point where people were asking me and yet I didn't know anything. It was getting mentioned so often I was getting puzzled by it. As far as I know, there was not a great deal in it, so there was no point worrying about it. \"I've never been one to rock the boat, I appreciate the position I'm in in life and I love what I do. At the same time you do need to have that ambition because your career doesn't last long and, before you know it, it will be over. The ambition for Everton is to finish as high as we can and, if we can build on what we've done so far, we have a chance of getting European football. We know it's not beyond us and, if we can do that, it would strengthen my chances at international level.\" Whatever happens, Baines will not be complaining either behind the scenes or publicly. He also points out that he and Cole get on well. \"When we train [at London Colney, Arsenal's practice ground] the changing room isn't huge, so to make it more spacious the smaller ones change next door,\" Baines explains. \"We get put in the separate one because we wear smaller kits, so I guess it's easier for the kit-man, and I've got to know Ash really well, just being in his company, chatting with him.\" Cole, in the words of his understudy, is probably the best left-back England have ever had. Fortunately for England the second-best is not that bad either."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
