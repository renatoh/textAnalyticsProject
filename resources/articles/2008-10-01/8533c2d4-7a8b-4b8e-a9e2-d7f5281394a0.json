Whether Ars\u00e8ne Wenger agrees remains to be seen, with Arsenal's manager expected to push for Walcott to be rested after a campaign during which the 19-year-old is likely to have featured regularly for club and country. Pearce, who said he had cheekily asked Fabio Capello after Walcott's sensational hat-trick in Zagreb last month if he could name him in his side for the upcoming play-off matches against Wales - \"He didn't really answer my question, he just burst out laughing,\" recalled the England Under-21 manager - believes the experience of taking part in a major tournament would enhance the former Southampton trainee's development as well as improve his team's chances. \"I want Theo to represent the Under-21s again next summer in the finals, if we are good enough to get past the Welsh,\" said Pearce, who has picked a strong squad, including Joe Hart, Micah Richards and Gabriel Agbonlahor, for the games against Wales. \"He will want to come and play for me. He has played a big part in us getting here. The experience would benefit him and might just tip the scales in us winning this tournament. That's what it is all about, England winning things.\" With that in mind, Capello has resisted the temptation to dip into the England Under-21 squad for the senior side's qualifiers with Kazakhstan and Belarus. \"Fabio is aware of how important these two Under-21 games are and how important it is for this team to get to the finals next summer and to supply me with the strongest squad possible,\" said Pearce, before adding: \"Playing with the Under-21s is far more important than sitting on the bench at Wembley or Minsk.\" Pearce, who will fly to Belarus to join up with the senior squad after the Under-21s second leg against Wales at Villa Park on Tuesday week, believes Walcott's success - as well as Capello's decision to pick players on form and not reputation - will serve as a major incentive to those hoping to make the step up. He knows, however, that overcoming Wales is crucial to their progress. \"I want to give experience to players in these big tournaments. Utopia would be taking a trophy back.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
