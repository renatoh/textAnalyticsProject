Which makes the fact that he produced precisely that all the more praiseworthy. Poulter\u2019s three-year-old son, Joshua, was admitted to an Orlando hospital on Wednesday evening with dangerously low oxygen levels. He was soon diagnosed with pneumonia. Poulter Jnr was home and showing signs of improvement by the time his father left for work the next morning, but the stress attached to such a scenario cannot be underplayed, regardless of profile or profession. In his father\u2019s words, there had been a \u201cbig concern.\u201d Poulter added: \u201cHe then had a full nebuliser, which made him pretty sick.\u201d Poulter\u2019s role was to give the young lad something to smile about. A flawless opening round of 67, five under par, maintained the impressive start to the Englishman\u2019s 2015 and left him just one stroke off the lead with 54 holes to play here. Given the backdrop, this has to be the finest performance Poulter has produced in some time. \u201cHe was OK this morning, his oxygen was up again, which was good,\u201d Poulter said. \u201cSo hopefully the IV and the drugs will start to kick in and he makes a speedy recovery. The late tee off time today was a blessing. I can come out, focus on my job and get back home and see how he is. It was good to see the improvement from midnight last night until this morning so he\u2019s definitely on the mend.\u201d Two things were in Poulter\u2019s favour. His wife, Katie, is a nurse. And this is the one tournament each year that he can easily commute to from home. The bigger picture relates to a Poulter renaissance, triggered by an equipment change and return to full fitness after the injuries that blighted his 2014. After this event, the 39-year-old will take a fortnight\u2019s break before the Masters; he probably wishes the first major of the season could come around even quicker. \u201cI am playing great,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is a course I play very well. I\u2019ve had quite a few top 25s, and a third place a couple of years ago. I know the good is really good and the mistakes have been costly over the last few weeks. If I eliminate the mistakes I\u2019m definitely going to be in with a chance to win.\u201d Rory McIlroy\u2019s recent and hastily-arranged work with his coach, Michael Bannon, looks to have paid immediate dividends. McIlroy hit 17 of 18 greens in regulation on Thursday en route to his 70, a run only broken by an errant shot into water on the par five 16th. Had he made it 18 from 18, the 25-year-old would have been the first player to achieve such a feat on this course during tournament play since 1995. McIlroy was frustrated that he took 34 putts but even that is hardly a cause for deep-rooted concern. The Bay Hill greens are in a poor state and will be ripped up and replaced in the aftermath of this tournament. Putting brilliantly on these surfaces from the outset would be something of an oddity. \u201cI was hitting a lot of shots I really liked and was turning the ball over a lot easier,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cSo there\u2019s a lot of the game that\u2019s right there. I\u2019m pleased that there are a lot of positives. I\u2019m just trying to clean up a few areas that I didn\u2019t do so well in today and it could be a really good week.\u201d After his round, McIlroy departed for a random doping test before an eagerly-anticipated dinner with Arnold Palmer. \u201cI\u2019m excited about it,\u201d he said of the meal. \u201cI\u2019ve been looking forward to it for a few weeks, from the moment I knew I was going to be able to spend a little bit of time in his company.\u201d Morgan Hoffman, from New Jersey, who is in his sixth year on the PGA Tour, claimed the first round lead at six under. He revealed he will compete this weekend in tribute to his grandmother, who died at the age of 97 on Thursday morning. Padraig Harrington, Henrik Stenson and Adam Scott were among a group of 11 players to open with a 68."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
