No problem, you think - find a machine. And then you see the problem. One machine is broken. The other has a queue. The woman at the front of the queue wants to pay with a \u00a320 note. The machine spits it back at her without so much as a word of thanks. She tries it again; it does the same again. She looks in her wallet for a card, but before she has time, the machine decides with a \"click\" that she's taken too long. She starts all over again. The next customer wants a ticket to a destination that isn't listed on the machine. He spends five minutes trying to find it because the letter J doesn't work on the touchscreen. The following customer wants to buy a saver ticket but, after fiddling about for a few minutes, realises that the machine is trying to sell him the most expensive ticket for the journey and gives up. The customer after that is you. But guess what? You've missed your train. Fellow commuters, believe me: it need not be this way. In this World Cup month, all we need to do is follow the example of the Germans. As England fans travel by train between World Cup cities in Germany, they can't fail to compare the comfort and efficiency of Deutsche Bahn, the German national train network, with what passes for a train service back home. And because Germans know that all journeys start with purchasing the ticket, the machines they use are like their high-speed bullet trains in contrast to our slow and unreliable counterparts. Want to buy a Deutsche Bahn ticket for a journey starting at a station other than the one you're at? No problem, sir. Want to print out timetable information for a journey you are making in a few weeks' time, so you can make a decision about it later? Of course, step this way. Want to reserve a seat in a no-smoking carriage on a specific train on a specific day? Be my guest. We'll even put signs on the platforms so you know where to stand. Want to do any of that at a ticket machine in Britain? You might as well get the bus. The philosophy behind ticket machines in Britain seems to be: limit the number of things people can do on a machine and they won't take as long using it. Wrong. The more flexibility you give people, the more likely they are to have their needs met first time. It's only six years until the London Olympics, when our infrastructure will be on show to the world. By that time, is there a chance that we'll we have learned the lessons of German design ourselves? \u00b7 If you'd like to comment on any aspect of Technology Guardian, send your emails to tech@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
