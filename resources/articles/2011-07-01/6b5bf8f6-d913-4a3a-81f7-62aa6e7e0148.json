The survey found that people held largely negative views on the general economic situation and their own personal finances in July, adding to a renewed sense of gloom. Figures from the last six months show consumers are much more pessimistic about their own prospects and the economy than last year. Nick Moon of GfK NOP said: \"It's becoming clear that May's positive surge was the exception rather than the norm, as we return to -30, wiping out almost all of May's rise. Before this year, the index has only twice been lower in its 37-year history: during the recessions of early 1990 and mid-2008. The survey chimed with figures from the CBI showing retailers were hit by a bigger-than-expected drop in sales this month. Retail sales fell at their fastest pace for a year in July and stores expect a further deterioration next month as hard-hit consumers clamp down on spending. The figures will add to concerns that the economy is struggling to grow and that high streets could see further shop closures and cuts in workers during the summer. The survey of high-street spending sparked further calls for ministers to reverse tough economic policies. Angela Eagle, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the treasury, said cutting the deficit \"further and faster than any other major country\" was undermining confidence in the British economy. \"Consumer confidence has been on a downward path since the Tory-led government came to power and last year's recovery has been choked off, which will make it harder to get the deficit down. She argued January's VAT rise to 20% is costing families with children \u00a3450 per year and should be reversed to boost confidence and spending. \"After the global recession every country has to get their deficits down, but it's increasingly clear that Britain needs a more balanced deficit plan which puts jobs and growth first,\" she said. The balance of reported sales in the CBI distributive trades survey fell to -5 in July from -2 in June, the lowest reading since June 2010. It confounded hopes that an early start to summer discounting would drive sales higher. Analysts had expected an improvement in the balance to zero, which would have indicated that sales were at the level they were this time last year. The expected sales balance for August fell to -12 from +2 in July, also the lowest in a year. The British Retail Consortium said in a recent report that retailers had spent the last three months cutting staff and reducing their hours to save costs. \"Given the importance of consumer spending, this immediately fuels concerns over growth prospects in the third quarter,\" said IHS Global Insight economist Howard Archer. \"Indeed, following on from the markedly weaker CBI industrial trends survey for July, the economy seems to have started off the third quarter on the back foot.\" The British economy grew by a meagre 0.2% between April and June after stagnating over the previous six months, increasing the pressure on the government to boost growth. But chancellor George Osborne's room for manoeuvre is limited under his plan to slash the budget deficit. Some ministers have suggested the Bank of England's monetary policy committee should engage in a fresh round of monetary stimulus should the economy stay weak. MPC member David Miles said yesterday that there was a risk the country could fall back into recession, following similar comments by fellow committee member Martin Weale. There was no explicit mention of the possibility of more quantitative easing in the minutes of this month's policy discussion at the Bank, though it was made clear that monetary policy could change in either direction. Financial markets expect the Bank to hold interest rates at their record low level of 0.5% well into next year, and debate about a fresh round of quantitative easing may intensify if the economy falters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
