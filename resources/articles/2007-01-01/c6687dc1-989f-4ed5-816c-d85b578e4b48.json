It says: \"Critical security alert - software removal\". The only buttons offered are Delete all, Remind me later and Install now. It first appeared as an alleged update for Adobe Reader 7.0. Iain Main Jack Schofield replies: This appears to be legitimate. Adobe is trying to get users to update Adobe Reader because \"critical vulnerabilities have been identified in Adobe Reader and Acrobat 7.0 through 7.0.8 ... although Adobe is not aware of any specific code exploits at this time\". For details of fixes, see Adobe's security bulletin at adobe.com/ support. Adobe recommends upgrading to Adobe Reader 8. This is a somewhat hefty download - 20.8MB from adobe.com/products/acrobat - so you might want to consider an alternative way to read PDF files. Foxit Reader 2.0 is much smaller (about 1.5MB), simpler and faster, can convert PDF files to text, and is also free for non-commercial use. However, it only works with Windows. Download it from foxitsoftware.com. Attacking Apaches I have Norton Internet Security 2007, and when I look in the History section, I can see a few \"medium risk\" intrusion attempts coming from the same computer (named as Daniel) with the same IP address. Norton calls them \"HTTP Apache Redundant Slashes DoS\". Daniel Whelan JS: This is a denial of service (DoS) attack on very old versions of the Apache web server. You're not running Apache 1.24 or older so it won't affect your PC. However, you could search a Whois service such as DNS Stuff (dnsstuff.com) for the IP address, find out who registered it, and report it to the abuse mailbox. Keystroke logger Is there a reliable, and preferably free, keystroke logger for Windows XP? Michael Javis JS: Yes, KMint21 Software offers Home Keylogger, which \"is intended for interception and recording in a file of everything that is entered from the keyboard. The program is able to work in the hidden mode and to emerge on pressing a combination of keys\" (kmint21.com/keylogger). It is simple and free. Limewire question I have been misled by LimewireUK.com, after putting Limewire into the Google search engine. I assumed this was Limewire and thought I was paying for downloads. Is there anything I can do to get my \u00a340 back? Andrew Hall JS: LimewireUK.com was set up on December 8 and is hiding behind a US-based proxy company, DomainsByProxy.com, in Arizona, so you should complain to abuse@domainsbyproxy.com. If you paid by credit card (not by debit card), you can probably dispute the payment and get the credit card company to revoke the charge. Either way, LimewireUK.com does say, at the bottom: \"This website has no affiliation whatsoever with the owner of this software program, and provides ONLY a link to the software program.\" You could therefore consider the \u00a340 as a reminder that \"buyer beware\" still applies, especially on the web. Limewire is a free peer-to-peer file sharing program, and does not offer any downloads: only users do. Also, if files are copyright, no website can make sharing them legal by providing a link to a copy of Limewire. Backchat \u00b7 Mike Whittaker asked about using HomePlug plugs to network an Xbox 360 via the electricity mains cable. On the Ask Jack blog, two readers said they had done it, and FrogStar said it was simpler than setting up Wi-Fi. Dave Shoare raised the possible problem of HomePlug devices interfering with radio reception, as suggested in a BBC report (tinyurl.com/rpnbb). But other readers said that they detected no interference."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
