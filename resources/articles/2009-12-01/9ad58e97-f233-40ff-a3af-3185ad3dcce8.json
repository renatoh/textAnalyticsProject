Some visibly jump and take cover whenever they hear a car engine backfire; others cannot stand 4 July fireworks; some spend all day playing computer war games. Her friends are all serving military personnel who have been on active duty in Afghanistan. Leitz herself is married to David Dufault, a pilot on board the USS Nimitz who is now flying missions over Afghanistan. As a result of the increased pace of deployments, her husband has spent more than two of the past three years away, and the strain on their five-year-old marriage is punishing. \"We are a military family \u2013 we knew there would be deployments. But this is incredibly hard,\" she says. \"On top of the separation there's the fear that something will happen to my husband \u2013 every unexpected knock on the door makes me feel I've aged two years.\" Leitz has followed the progress of the Afghan war closely and has concluded that it is unwinnable and should be brought to an end. She now sits on the board of a national group, Military Families Speak Out, and sees it as her duty to her family and to those of her military friends to talk publicly about what she sees as the futility of the conflict. \"We are kidding ourselves if we think 35,000 more troops will be enough to subdue a nation. We are kidding ourselves if we think that as a nation we can afford the $35bn it will cost to send those troops into theatre, just for one year.\" She adds: \"I don't want my husband to have more lives on his conscience with no good reason.\" Cass, whose husband is an officer serving in Afghanistan with the marine corps and did not want to use her surname, is just as passionately opposed to her loved one being put at risk without a purpose. But in her view the answer is not to pull out of Afghanistan but to step up the war effort with real commitment. \"I'm very concerned we've been playing a middle game here,\" she says. \"I'm having to deal with the uncertainty of never knowing whether my husband is about to be blown up, and the least that I need to know is that there's a set goal and we are in this to win.\" Cass was brought up in a military family \u2013 her father was in Vietnam \u2013 so she is used to her loved ones being in danger. \"What frustrates me more as a military wife is that my husband might be taking that risk for nothing \u2013 that is difficult to accept.\" Sarah's husband is in special operations in Afghanistan: his job is so secret she has no idea what he is doing. \"I think he works in rural areas, but that's all,\" she says. She is nervous of talk about exit strategies, as she thinks that merely emboldens the enemy. Rather than an end to the war, she wants to see a clear military goal emerge from the president's announcement. Like Cass, she is used to the stress of separation and to living with fear. But she says the hiatus of the past three months, waiting for Obama to make his decision, has been additionally painful. \"People have started to wonder whether Obama cares more about health reform than about our loved ones in Afghanistan. It's a relief that the waiting's over, just to know the path we're now taking.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
