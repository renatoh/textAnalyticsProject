We hope for it and yet we fear it, too. It's a final stage on a one-way journey that ends in darkness. We're all on our way to old age and yet we shield ourselves from the fact. We turn away from those who are old because they remind us of where it is we are going. Nothing more certain. What name do we use? The old. The aged. The elderly. The greying population. Them. Not us - even when we become old ourselves, we still say 'them', because though the hair may fade, the body stoop, the face line, the joints ache, inside we're the same as we always were. If you turn the pages of a glossy magazine or switch on the television, it can seem that the old are erased and only the gleaming young are present. The old are there simply to represent their age: the sweet ancient woman, the obstreperous man; cameos of the final leg of the journey. What about all the other things they are and have always been - jealous, desirous, hopeful, ambitious, eager, melancholy, angry, clever, diligent, political, interested, interesting? Lord Eric Roll, whose entry in Who's Who takes about 20 minutes to read (educator, author, administrator, banker, economist; his autobiography is appropriately entitled Crowded Hours), and who works every day at UBS Warburg, stands up when I come in and strides across the airy room to meet me. He is upright, his handshake is firm, his eyes bright. Today is his birthday: he is 95. 'Sometimes,' he says, quoting his beloved Shakespeare, 'I do feel the heartache and the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to. Some days I feel 150, but some days I feel 50. You can't escape the effects of age entirely, you know. But what is important is to keep busy - not just busy in action, which I still am, though I know how fantastically privileged I am in that respect, but also mentally busy. Old soldiers never die; old bankers never die, they only lose interest. You mustn't lose interest. You have to keep on changing, thinking of new ideas. You mustn't be constantly nostalgic. Look behind and you get left behind. You have to be interested in other people, not yourself - genuinely interested. Well, all these things I'd say about life in general, not just old age.' He wakes at seven to the radio news ('You have to keep a sense of outrage at things - that's the other side of keeping engaged; gripped by the world'), gets up, takes a bath, goes to the office for nine. In the afternoon, he may go to the House of Lords. He says his social life is not crowded - but then tells me that yesterday evening he was at a reception for the new German ambassador, and the evening before he was at a dinner with Japanese clients. He cooks ('Nothing exotic, I leave that to my daughter'), walks, sometimes he still swims. He goes once a year, at least, to Japan, New York, Washington. He travels in Europe - next week, he will go to Paris, where he is hoping to go to the opera. His eyesight isn't what it used to be. Every six months, he goes to his doctor, who sends him away again. When he is depressed, he recites poetry to himself, especially Shakespeare (he knows Shakespeare in English and German; he admires the German translation tremendously). He adores literature - as we talk he breaks enthusiastically into quotes from Voltaire, Goethe's Faust, George Orwell and 'the memory hole', Dante losing himself in the middle of the wood. He tells stories about de Gaulle, gossips about fellow peers, giggles. His parents died long, long ago. His wife died four years ago. Many of his good friends have disappeared. 'Quite often I find myself thinking, \"I must ask so-and-so that,\" and then I remember they are no longer here. Strange. But I don't think about the past a great deal. There is a terrible danger of becoming too inward-looking. I do have a great terror of not being busy and I am exceptionally lucky not to have been forcibly retired, like almost everyone is. If I thought about death for any length of time, I'd be very scared.I keep going. I am continuity. A bridge across the ages.' He walks me through the doors and out into the wide corridors, past people who brighten when they see him. He's a marvel. He is a fortunate man. But he is not singular - not just an exception to a rule. Elliot Carter has just written his first opera and at 94 is at the height of his powers. JK Galbraith, in his nineties, is as sharp as ever. Saul Bellow is writing novels that exceed his earlier ones. Why not? Why should we be surprised when the old are wiser and sharper and angrier and more passionate and more creative than the young? Reardon Court is a social services-run home in a cul-de-sac off a busy north London road. In the early afternoon, I park my car, lift out my overnight bag and sleeping bag, and make my way to the door marked 'Reception'. Everything is very quiet. Although I know that there are 25 tenants in the sheltered flats, 36 'residents', and additional respite and rehabilitation wards, the place seems deserted. Chairs stand empty in the large living room. There is no one in the well-tended garden that I can see through the window, though a bench waits in the cool sunlight. It's after the day-care elderly have gone home, before the evening begins; a waiting time of day. I've come to stay, and for a moment I am gripped by a powerful sense of homesickness - as if this was my first day at school. Even the nicest residential home - Reardon Court seems kindly and imaginatively run; its staff thoughtful, warm and unpatronising; its tenets ones of respect and individual care - is not home. Instead, people have left home to come here, their belongings stripped down to a few pieces of furniture, the beloved knick-knacks and carefully chosen pictures that crowd the window ledge and shelves - children and grandchildren, and alongside these the sepia photographs that show, say, a smiling young woman 70 years ago, hanging off the arm of a handsome man. Both of them gaze into their future. I am staying in a small room among the sheltered flats. The sofa folds out to a narrow bed and there's a kettle and a sink, a clock on the wall that ticks loudly. In a way, Reardon Court shows the remorseless stages of ageing - some of the tenants in these flats will one day have to move to the residential area, because they can no longer take care of themselves. And yet they cling to their independence. The flats themselves are clean, warm and pleasant. The tenant is in charge of their own life, and is given privacy. There are few activities organised for them - no bingo - because that's not the point. 'Guess how old I am. Go on, guess.' 'Eighty?' I say cautiously. But Janet will be 95 at Christmas. She's the height of my nine-year-old daughter, and has a triumphant smile. 'I'm young in heart and mind and I like being with people, especially young people.' She used to be a children's nanny, before she married. She has been a widow for 30 years, but she's recently fallen in love with another tenant, Robin, who is 10 years younger than her. Robin has lived alone since 1947, when his parents died. Meeting Janet two years ago, he says, was an 'unexpected gift'. They beam at me. Both of them were unhappy when they first arrived at Reardon Court. Janet says it was like being on 'another planet; nothing like home to me. I'm happy now, Robin's made my life so different. He's a gentleman. My family thought it was a bit odd, but my daughter said: \"Mum, grab it. Take happiness. Age doesn't count.\" We'll not get married, though. He's never been married before and doesn't want to. I want him to propose to me so I can say no. And we go back to our own rooms at night. That part of life is over. Though...' and she brightens, 'we've lain on the bed together, haven't we?' 'We're opposites,' says Robin. 'I'm quiet and shy and she's - well, she's a fighter. I don't think back much, but I don't hope for much, either. It's day to day, but we're together.' 'When I'm on my own I think of the past,' says Janet. 'I can't help it. I lost a son, you know, in the Blitz. He was seven.' She shows me a photo in a silver frame of a bright-faced boy with a lick of hair over his forehead. 'Keith,' she says. 'I talk to him every night, my little boy.' 'I don't worry about dying,' says Robin. 'I was alone for a long time. I worked and slept. I was a gardener, but I can't remember the names of all the flowers now.' 'I don't think of death, either. Just the way I go - I don't want to be murdered or stabbed.' Janet pauses, considering. 'Or drowned.' 'Oh,' she says, 'it's a funny old world. But we're hanging on to our own little bit of it.' Gladys is washing up in her kitchen. She's just eaten supper (ham and egg), and peels off her gloves when I enter. She is 89 in two days' time, and is planning a birthday celebration for the 'old people' here; cake and wine, nothing fancy. She has been here for seven years, when she came with her husband, who died three years ago. 'We were married for 64 years and he was a nice man, gentle and good,' she says. 'He didn't have any legs at the end, but he wasn't miserable.' She shows me a picture of her and her husband, arm in arm, and she's smiling at the camera but he is smiling at her. 'I was 20 then,' she says, regarding her young and radiant face fondly. 'It doesn't seem so very long ago. A place like this,' she says, 'is what you make it.' And then she says that old age is what you make it as well. 'You have to make the effort. Sometimes I don't feel very well, but I don't lie down. I keep going. I get out. I mix with people. Sometimes I let myself think of the past - the days when I was young and I had all of my children around me. But you can't look back too much. You have to look forward and I know I'll die before too long. I'm not scared. I wonder where we go. I look up at the sky and I say, \"Now then George, where are you?\" I've arranged my funeral. I think I'd like that song, \"Now the day is dawning\".' It's evening. I drink a cup of milky orange-coloured tea downstairs and then go and visit Jim, who's in the rehabilitation ward because in June he fell and broke his leg in two places. He is 75. 'Not old, you know. I'm a youngster. Look at the others. I was still working till I was 74, but then they told me I had to go.' He was a hospital porter and loved the job, because he had lived alone since his parents died 40 years ago, and work was his social life. That and the pub - he doesn't have many friends, he says. We watch football on the television together - he's the only one in there, and although it's not yet eight o'clock, people are sleeping in their rooms. 'I miss work terribly,' he says. 'I miss the company. I miss getting up in the morning and knowing I've somewhere to go. I miss being needed. If I could go back again tomorrow, I'd be there. First thing.' He knows he has to keep going out - 'otherwise I'd go round the bend; I'd go mad inside four walls all day.' He has an allotment, which he has tended for 30 years. 'Potatoes,' he says. 'Leeks, tomatoes, cabbage, runner beans, broad beans, courgettes.' He hasn't been there for months, and he fears that everything will be neglected. He fears that with his leg, he will have to give it up. 'But what will I do then?' he says. 'What then?' John isn't watching the football. He is sitting in his room, with a tube in his stomach to feed him. He has had a stroke and his speech is at first hard to understand. He tells me his wife died 11 years ago. He has a mentally handicapped son. He ran a pub. He isn't scared of death but he dreads being disabled. He doesn't know if he can stand being on his own any longer. He doesn't want to be a burden, he doesn't want to complain, but he is very scared. On Margaret Ash's wall are paintings she did when younger - beautiful slabs and swirls of colour on the institutional cream paint. She grew up in New Zealand. She trained as a zoologist and worked as a filmmaker - one of the first female producers, making public information documentaries. ('The importance of clean milk,' she says suddenly. And, 'I expect I was a feminist, wasn't I? I was always for the underdog.') Her father was a naturalist and curator of the Wellington museum. Her grandfather a politician. On her table is a book that one of the staff is reading to her, and I look at a blurred photograph in which four-year-old Margaret is sitting on her grandpa's knee, hair in waves over her slim shoulders. Now she lives in Reardon Court's residential home. She is 92. She tells me about New Zealand, about her husband, whom she met when she was over 40. She says she has never stopped working - she wants to make a film of life in Reardon Court. She's on the look-out. In the meantime, she makes collages. She likes it here, and doesn't mind not looking after herself. In fact, she says, giggling, 'I rather like it.' It's late now. When I leave her she asks if I will come again. I don't know what to reply. I don't want to say no, but although she will forget what I tell her, forget that I was ever here, I do not want to lie. So I just hold her hand and smile. People, says the manager of Reardon Court as we drink coffee together, are not any different in old age than they were in the rest of their life. If they were gloomy when young, they'll be gloomy now. If they were cheerful, or stoical, or purposeful, that's how they'll be now. You have to look at life in the round. You have to see them in the context of their entire lives and have respect. You have to see whole lives. At 10.30pm it is very quiet again, even quieter than before. I eat a salad in my square little room and listen to the leaves blowing against my window. When I lie on the sofa in the darkness I can hear the sound of my own heart beating. Somewhere, someone calls out. I think of all the memories stored up in this home; all the dreams here. I leave early. No one stirs. In the geriatric wards at Whittington Hospital in north London, machines bleep, urine bags hang off stands. Nurses click along the floors, pushing trolleys. James Malpone-Lee is professor of medicine at the Whittington and has worked all his life with the elderly. He says it is absolutely no longer possible to call someone old in their sixties or early seventies. Drugs for the elderly are tested on a meridian age of 82, by which time it is fairly safe to assume that most of the physiological changes of ageing will have set in. Before then, he says, age is a moveable definition. And though it is his job to care for those who become ill in old age, among them those suffering from arthritis, respiratory illnesses, and, increasingly he fears, those with illnesses caused by obesity, he says that when it comes to improving the lot of the elderly 'medicine has got almost nothing to do with it; it's a mere trifle'. Most people who come under his care will get better again - they're not on a downward spiral. Only a small per cent of the elderly are significantly disabled. Of course, a huge proportion of the NHS budget goes on the old - about 60 per cent - but be careful, he admonishes me, these are almost all people who have been young and fit most of their lives, who will mostly get better again, who are simply at the more vulnerable stage that we are, of course, all hoping to reach ourselves. Professor Malpone-Lee hates the sentimentality about the old that is the other side of our blindness. He loathes medicine's 'kitsch caring' that he feels is an odious modern development. 'In my clinic, the atmosphere is merry and affectionate and full of laughter. If I approached my patients like a Swedish undertaker, then it would be depressing. There's a danger of doctors taking on the mantle of sanctity - so fetid and boring. The need to respond to suffering by suffering oneself is not sustainable. It's bonkers.' They are individuals, he says, and that is how to treat them. 'You have to live right up to the end. Right until the moment you die.' Optimism, he says, is absolutely essential; so too is friendship and integration into a community, which women tend to do better than men. And he worries greatly that succeeding generations - those of us born into a therapeutic culture, those of us for whom it is part of the norm to express discontent - will not do well in old age. 'I blame Freud,' he says. 'You'd think that existentialism never happened. Everything is everyone else's fault; people are dying in a hypertensive apoplexy, ranting at life's injustice.' He also loathes the idea of retirement (he is himself planning to stop work at 60 and become a London tour guide). To be unoccupied, isolated, not needed, socially excluded - that, he says, is a kind of death. Because if you are old, he says, you don't have to be frail. You don't have to be in intellectual decline. You don't have to be in physical decline. You can have an active sex life. You can go on parenting till the day you die. You can have full and happy days. 'A whole new life can start with the bus pass.' In a way, he is saying what everyone has been saying to me - something that is both obvious and ignored. If you are one of the lucky ones, blessed by comfort and health, then you may be old, but you do not need to feel old, and the journey can be an adventure right up to the end. And if you are not one of the lucky ones, then it is society's scandal and all of our shame."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
