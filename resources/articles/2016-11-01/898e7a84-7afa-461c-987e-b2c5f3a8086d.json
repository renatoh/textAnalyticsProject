Thanks as always for following along with us and be sure to check back shortly for a full match report. Here\u2019s a look at the final stats. Celtic, who had struggled to keep the ball for most of the opening hour, winds up with a 53/47 advantage in possession, boosted no doubt by the hosts playing the final quarter hour with 10 men after Korb was sent off. And there\u2019s the final whistle and 10-man Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach hang on for a point against Celtic, who pushed for a winner right up until the end but were unable to end a winless run away from home in European play that\u2019s now extended to 10 matches. 90 min+1: We\u2019re into stoppage time as Celtic\u2019s hopes of making it out of the group hang in the balance with Gladbach down a man. Can they push through for a chance here? 88 min: Kramer is shown yellow for a high boot on Henderson. He\u2019ll miss the next match as a result. 87 min: Roberts ... to McGregor ... he\u2019s onside with only the keeper to beat ... and McGregor bottles it! Oh dear. That was Celtic\u2019s chance and it was misfired by McGregor, missing the far post by the slimmest of margins. How costly that may prove. 86 min: Henderson doesn\u2019t wait long to make his presence felt, ripping a shot when ceded a bit of real estate along the edge of the area. But it fails to curve as much as needed to pose a serious threat and instead skids well wide of the far post for a goal kick. 83 min: Now Rodgers makes his final swap as Gamboa exits to make way for Liam Handerson. 81 min: Gladbach make their final switch as Raffael comes on for the goal-scorer Stindl, who cedes the captain\u2019s armband as he walks off. And Rafael makes an immediate impact! He\u2019s taken a free kick that pins Celtic onto the back foot and moments later has a goal on goal that misses the target but doesn\u2019t keep him from raising his arms in an effort to stoke the home supporters, who are already in full throat. 78 min: Some extracurriculars between Herrmann and Izaguirre near the touchline and both men are shown yellow for their trouble. 77 min: An immediate change for M\u00f6nchengladbach as Jantschke comes on for Strobl. Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 calmly deposits the penalty and they\u2019re back on level terms at Borussia-Park! 75 min: Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 is pulled down by Julian Korb as he sprints onto Roberts\u2019 pass and the Portuguese referee Manuel de Sousa has given a penalty. And he\u2019s sent off Korb with a straight red! What a development! 70 min: Twenty minutes from full time and the possession is 50/50, though the stats would indicate Gladbach have made more of their spells with the ball. 69 min: A second substitution for Celtic as McGregor comes in for Rogic. Gladbach answer immediately with their first switch as Hazard exits to make way for Patrick Herrmann. 68 min: Now a breakaway for Celtic against the run of play as Sinclair finds Roberts, who gives to Demb\u00e9l\u00e9. But the Frenchman\u2019s shot is parried away by Sommer. 67 min: Raffael appears to be readying to come on. 66 min: Hahn receives the perfectly played pass from Stindl and rattles the woodwork with a curling effort that so nearly doubles Gladbach\u2019s advantage! 64 min: Some miscommunication near the back for the hosts as Roberts very nearly pounces on a lackadaisical back pass by Wendt, but Sommer arrives in the nick of time to wipe out the threat. 62 min: The end-to-end action has picked up over the past several minutes with a series of threats from both sides. Hazard blasts a chance from a tight angle that\u2019s redirected over the frame by Gordon. That gives another corner to Gladbach, but it\u2019s easily cleared. 60 min: Rodgers makes his first chance as Patrick Roberts enters for Forrest at the hour mark. 57 min: A couple more corners for Gladbach but neither of Hazard\u2019s efforts create much trouble for Gordon. Then a bad giveaway by Celtic leads to an immediate chance for Fabian Johnson, but the American\u2019s shot toward the far post that beats the keeper trickles just wide right. 53 min: A ball is played through to Stindl and the crowd swells, but he can\u2019t put enough on the shot and it\u2019s easily corralled by Gordon. 50 min: Hazard races up the right side with the ball and his cross toward the far post is misjudged by the keeper and curves dangerous close toward the goal, but instead veers out for a goal kick. 48 min: Celtic with the first half-chance of the half as Armstrong attempts to play a cross into Sinclair, but it\u2019s cleared from danger. 46 min: We\u2019re off and running in the second half. The referee blows the whistle for half-time. Celtic will need something over the remaining 45 minutes to sustain their flickering hopes of advancing. Here\u2019s a look at the stats so far. 43 min: Celtic win their first corner after a quick attack up the right side is broken up by a Gladbach defender inside the area. Sinclair\u2019s effort sails a bit too far and is easily cleared past the halfway line, but Celtic have possession and will try to build up from the rear once more. They\u2019d really been doing better right up until the Gladbach goal. 39 min: A rapid Celtic counter-attack is broken up with a timely challenge and just as quickly Gladbach are back down the pitch and threatening again. Now Vestergaard has a go on goal but misses the target. 36 min: Borussia-Park is rollicking now as the hosts win another corner. They\u2019ve had eight attempts on goal to Celtic\u2019s one, with six corners to the visitors\u2019 zero. A good spell of possession as the Gladbach players probe the Celtic defense before an entry pass from the right flank finds an onrushing Stindl, whose volley overcomes a slight deflection to beat Gordon for the opening goal. A fourth goal for the captain this year including two in the group, both against Celtic. 29 min: As we approach the half-hour mark, Gladbach have had the better chances but are no doubt itching to break through for a goal amid a drought that\u2019s seen them go scoreless over their last four league matches. 24 min: A ripping shot by Scott Sinclair from inside the area and he\u2019s denied by the far post! How close Celtic were to an opener there! 20 min: Another positive build-up for Celtic but they\u2019re dispossessed and Gladbach are quick to counter, demanding a save from Gordon on a Stindl shot. Hahn misses on the follow-up. Best chance of the match for either side so far. 17 min: Hazard, who\u2019s been excellent today so far, sends a shot soaring over the crossbar off the Gladbach corner. Celtic will look to build it up from the back off the goal kick. 16 min: Another corner for the hosts as a marauding Hahn\u2019s cross into the area is cleared behind the Celtic defense. 13 min: Celtic enjoying a sustained spell of possession here, but they\u2019re dispossessed and Gladbach continue to dominate possession without necessarily creating many chances. 9 min: Celtic have been active in the attack with Sinclair and Forrest up top, but it\u2019s Gladbach who have had the run of play and the early chances. 7 min: Hazard\u2019s first corner is cleared past the goal line and Gladbach have another corner. This one is overcooked a bit and cleared down the pitch from the far post. 6 min: Patient, controlled build-up for Gladbach from the back. It\u2019s worked up the left flank before it\u2019s swung over Hazard, who tries to break down his defender. Instead it goes out for a corner. 4 min: M\u00f6nchengladbach win the first corner of the match, but Hazard\u2019s effort is easily cleared. 3 min: The first chance of the game is Gladbach\u2019s as a player is fouled outside the area. The ball falls to Wendt after the initial free kick but his offering is wide left of the target. 1 min: And they\u2019re off! The hosts wearing their all-black third kits attacking from left to right while Celtic are in their traditional home strips going from right to left. Celtic fans are making themselves heard with an old standard. Kickoff only a few minutes away. Here are a look a today\u2019s teams. Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach XI: Sommer; Korb, Vestergaard, Elvedi, Wendt; Strobl, Kramer; Hahn, Hazard, Johnson; Stindl Subs: Sippel, Herrman, Dahoud, Raffael, Schulz, Hofmann, Jantschke Celtic XI: Gordon; Gamboa, Lustig, Sviatchenko, Izaguirre; Brown, Armstrong, Forrest, Rogic; Sinclair, Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 Subs: De Vries, Bitton, \u00c7ift\u00e7i, Boyata, Roberts, McGregor, Henderson Hello and welcome to the Champions League group-stage clash between Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach and Celtic. Tonight represents a moment of truth for Brendan Rodgers\u2019 side if they hope to see through any European dreams. They\u2019re currently bottom of Group C with one point through three matches and desperately need a victory away from home to climb past Gladbach (on four points) into third. On a lighter note, the Bundesliga side have posted this on their official Twitter feed in response to the now famous sign outside a Glasgow pub last week. Plenty more to come ahead of kickoff, which is roughly a half hour from now. Bryan will be here shortly. In the meantime, here\u2019s why Celtic are missing some key players for the game in Germany: Rodgers acknowledged the difficulty of keeping a squad together for any length of time. \u201cIt\u2019s also the job within the club that we can have this pipeline of players, if we lose one or two, that we\u2019re ahead of the game and ensuring we can replace them. \u201cIt\u2019ll always be the nature that, no matter how great Celtic is as a club and the great support and playing for Celtic being the great privilege it is, there are other factors in football that will sometimes take players away and you can\u2019t blame a player. I think you have to be realistic, but the idea is to keep that pipeline of players coming in.\u201d Celtic were beaten 2-0 by M\u00f6nchengladbach a fortnight ago with the visitors more than worth their win. \u201cThey reinforced that they are a very good side even with players missing. The level they are developing over the last couple of years is a level we are trying to get to over time,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI experienced it in the Champions League when I was in England. It is a step up even from that, the intensity, the quality, the speed. \u201cWe are taking a couple of jumps up to that level. At this level there are very few opportunities and you have to take them but while remaining very solid and super competitive.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
