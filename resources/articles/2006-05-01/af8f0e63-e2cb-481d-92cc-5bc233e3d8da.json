With the combined Conservative and Lib Dem opposition stepping up their demands for Mr Clarke to resign, he insisted that he was the right man to push through the necessary prisoner reforms. Mr Clarke is refusing calls from his Tory shadow, David Davis, to make an \"urgent statement\" to the Commons today on how many of the 1,023 foreign prisoners released without being deported have been re-arrested and sent home. \"It's not good enough for Charles to say some time this week, perhaps after the local elections, I'll come back and tell you,\" Mr Davis said. \"I want to see an urgent statement in the House of Commons tomorrow so the public can know that these people who are putting them at risk are being brought in.\" But the Home Office says there is still too much data to be collected about the status of hundreds of cases and the - potentially crucial - reoffending rate. The information is promised \"as soon as possible\". But Labour MPs admit it is inconceivable that Mr Clarke would try to lie low until after Thursday's poll. Pressure on Mr Clarke to quit intensified after it emerged that he took three weeks to inform the prime minister of the fiasco. Officials told Mr Clarke on March 30 that individuals convicted of serious offences had been allowed back into the community. But he did not pass the information on to Downing Street until April 21, the Home Office confirmed. A spokeswoman said the delay occurred while officials were \"working hard to clarify the situation\". \"The prime minister was told as soon as the full extent of the problem was known,\" she said. Yesterday Downing Street continued to back the home secretary and repeated that Mr Clarke did offer to resign last week, contradicting newspaper claims that he had not. Mr Clarke told the East Anglian Daily Times in his Norwich constituency that the past week's pressure \"doesn't remotely compare to the pressures of 7/7\" and that his future depends on three things: \"My own strength of character dealing with the points that are raised, on the support of my own political colleagues, and mostly importantly on the decisions of the prime minister.\" As Labour braced itself for grim results on Thursday fellow ministers are still uncertain whether either Mr Clarke or the deputy prime minister, John Prescott, whose turbulent love life has been almost as damaging to the government's standing, will survive the week in office. \"The Labour government cannot last another year like this,\" one senior minister said last night. Sir Menzies Campbell, the Liberal Democrats' leader, said authority was \"draining away\" from Mr Blair. Another test of Labour's resolve will come today when officials decide whether to deploy John Prescott in the last days of the election campaign or leave him in a backroom role. The deputy prime minister emerged from his constituency home in Hull for the first time in days yesterday after lying low for most of the bank holiday weekend. The local government minister, Phil Woolas, said Mr Prescott would be playing \"a full and active part\" in campaigning for this Thursday's poll. \"We are certainly not hiding him,\" Mr Woolas told reporters in Westminster. \"We are fighting for every seat.\" Mr Prescott has not spoken in public since the affair with Ms Temple broke last Wednesday. If the two embattled ministers survive neither is likely to be moved in the expected reshuffle, though some colleagues believe that Mr Prescott will no longer see through the transfer of power that they want Mr Blair to agree soon with Mr Brown. He would instead retire when Mr Blair steps down. David Cameron, the Conservative leader, said what the country now needs is \"a replacement, not a reshuffle\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
