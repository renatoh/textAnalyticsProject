Today was national offer day, when parents discovered which school their 10- or 11-year-old would be attending from September. This year, with applications coming from 540,000 children, competition for places is thought to have been even tougher than usual. Some parents hit by redundancy and the recession will have decided against sending their children to private school and applied for a state secondary. The dwindling number of secondary schools will have exacerbated the problem \u2013 at least 85 comprehensives have closed in the past two years. About a sixth of all applicants \u2013 90,000 children \u2013 are thought to have missed out on their first-choice school, a Guardian survey of 70 local authorities has revealed. On average across England, 83% of parents were allocated their top-preference school. Last year 92,000 children were refused their top choice. In London and its suburbs overall this year, more than a third of parents \u2013 34.3% \u2013 were rejected by their top-choice school, a slightly higher percentage than last year. In the City of London and the borough of Wandsworth, fewer than half of families got their first choice. A lower proportion of parents living in the West Midlands got their first preference than last year, the Guardian's survey shows. In Birmingham, the figure was 66.5% , against 67.9% last year. Parents in Buckinghamshire were among the least likely to be celebrating with just over half \u2013 54% \u2013 granted their first preference. Parents in Doncaster were among the most likely to be happy with 95.5% getting their first choice. But in other parts of northern England, such as Middlesbrough, almost a quarter were turned away. Those living in the countryside were more likely to be allocated their favoured school than last year. In Dorset, Shropshire and Devon, the proportions were 93%, 95.7% and 91% respectively. All applicants for a place at a state secondary this year will get one. Mary Bousted, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said parents should realise that \"almost all secondary schools provide a good education\". Chris Keates, general secretary of the NASUWT teaching union, said: \"The standards of education in all secondary schools across the country have never been higher and are continually improving.\" Diana Johnson, the schools minister, said: \"Parents now have more choice because there are undeniably more good schools and standards have gone up across the board.\" The Conservatives said their proposals to allow parents to establish their own schools would enable more children to get places at their preferred school."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
