Thirty years ago, Vale de Almeida, 63, was a young spokesman for the European commission catering to a press corps in Brussels of which Boris Johnson of the Daily Telegraph was a preeminent member. \u201cHe was one of the leading journalists and I don\u2019t think anyone disputes that \u2026 so the likelihood of me replying to his questions was high.\u201d Tall tales about EU condom regulations, and Jacques Delors\u2019 plans to \u201crule Europe\u201d and build the world\u2019s tallest building to house the European commission would fuel Johnson\u2019s journalistic career and feather-bed the Euroscepticism that would eventually take the UK out of the EU and put him in Downing Street. Vale de Almeida, whose career includes spells as chief-of-staff to a European commission president and ambassadorial roles to the US and the UN, can perhaps thank Johnson for his new posting. There has never been an EU ambassador to the UK, because there was no need. Vale de Almeida\u2019s new embassy is at 32 Smith Square in Westminster, previously the site of the commission\u2019s UK delegation. Before that it had been the Conservative party\u2019s headquarters, from where Margaret Thatcher would wave down to the crowds to celebrate her election victories. \u201cIt was from one of them,\u201d he says, gesturing across his as-yet bare office to the windows looking out on to the square. \u201cI think she would not object, because she believed in the relationship between the UK and European Union, and she contributed a lot,\u201d said Vale de Almeida, who transitioned from journalism himself shortly after the fall of Portugal\u2019s dictatorship. He joined the European commission in the early 1980s as his country acceded to what was then the European Economic Community. Among his tasks is to ensure the UK implements the withdrawal agreement, particularly the provisions on EU citizens\u2019 rights and the compromise reached on avoiding a border on the island of Ireland. The UK is committed to establishing an independent monitoring group by 1 January 2021 for protection of the rights of EU citizens in the UK, for whom there is no certain figure, but they are likely to number around 3.8 million. Vale de Almeida, however, says Brussels also needs to take responsibility. He says the settled status scheme the Home Office has established is digital and requires \u201ca computer to get there\u201d, creating potential difficulties for \u201ceveryone that is for some reason outside of the mainstream\u201d, be they from the Roma community, elderly or in prison or pre-trial detention. The deadline for applications is June 2021. \u201cWe have a few lawyers working with us but other entities as well. But I think we need to step up our action. We have to go deeper into the British society to try and reach out to all these citizens,\u201d Vale de Almeida said in an interview to mark the launch of a new Guardian series on Europe. On the Irish border, the EU\u2019s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, expressed his frustration last week at suggestions from the Northern Ireland secretary, Brandon Lewis, and others that the UK will not check goods crossing the Irish Sea, as stipulated in the compromise found for avoiding such checks on the island of Ireland. \u201cWe will have to follow that very closely,\u201d Vale de Almeida said. His other main role will be to keep the 27 member states\u2019 unity, which he says is in the UK\u2019s interest to maintain, and gather intelligence and insight for the EU\u2019s negotiators as they engage in talks this month with Britain over the future relationship. Both sides are in posturing mode. Barnier felt the need to bash his lectern at a press conference in Brussels last week when discussing Britain\u2019s opening position. Johnson\u2019s government says it wants a \u201czero tariff, zero quota\u201d deal with regulatory alignment no more onerous than that of countries such as Canada. It counters Barnier\u2019s insistence that the intensity of the UK\u2019s trade with the EU and its proximity requires a greater obligation to stick close to the EU rulebook by evoking Britain\u2019s need to regain its economic and political sovereignty by the end of the transition period, when the UK leaves the single market and customs union. The narrative has not gone down well with the EU. \u201cI think, in today\u2019s world, the concept of sovereignty has evolved to a large extent, but it goes without saying that national sovereignty should be respected,\u201d Vale de Almeida said. \u201cWe believe here it\u2019s not about black and white \u2018are we sovereign or not sovereign\u2019. It\u2019s about, in full respect of sovereignty, how much can we do together.\u201d Vale de Almeida played a role negotiating the ill-fated trade deal with the US known as the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), which Donald Trump ultimately killed off. It was, he says, the first trade negotiation to become highly politicised based largely on \u201cmisinformation and on manipulation\u201d of facts by its critics. \u201cAnd it is never going to change\u201d, he said. \u201cWe will never go back to a situation where a trade deal between the EU and the US would be out of the front pages or a trade deal between the EU and the UK will be out of the front pages.\u201d He predicts a busy year at 32 Smith Square. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 March 2020. Jo\u00e3o Vale de Almeida joined the European commission in the 1980s rather than in the 1970s, and Portugal acceded to the European Economic Community in 1986 rather than in the 1970s, as an earlier version had said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
