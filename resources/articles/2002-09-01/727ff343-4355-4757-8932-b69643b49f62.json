Now they can add handing the Scottish team the odd humiliation to their achievements. It happened in a 1-1 draw three years ago and again at the weekend when a shambolic performance from Berti Vogts's side saw them escape from the cliff-top Svangaskard Stadium with a point they scarcely deserved. For 45 minutes the Scots produced a display of incompetence that left their manager bewildered. It was not a ringing endorsement of Vogts's coaching ability, either, to hear him say: \"I don't know what went wrong. I can't give you any answers.\" The Scotland manager is under increasing fire after five defeats and a draw and following his pre-match plea for the pressure to be piled on him rather than his players he has been granted his wish. Against the Faroes he took bewildering decisions. Playing Paul Dickov on the right of midfield left the Leicester City star looking like a fish out of water. Later, with Scotland having clawed their way back into the match at 2-1 after losing two ridiculous goals in the first 12 minutes, he needlessly replaced one right-back (Maurice Ross) with another (Graham Alexander). Those kind of decisions, coupled with a lack of pattern generally, have made it open season on the German. \"I was surprised how bad Scotland were,\" said the Faroes' two-goal star John Petersen, a primary school teacher. \"I'm only sorry I didn't make it 3-0 with an easy chance.\" Vogts's former German team-mate Gunter Netzer, in Toftir for German television, said: \"I can't see what Berti is attempting to do. Where are the tactics? Where is the discipline?\" Perhaps most damning of all was Scotland's influential midfield man Barry Ferguson who said: \"Time's running out. We can't keep saying give Berti time. That's six games and we've yet to win.\" However, the Scottish Football Association chief executive David Taylor said that he supported Vogts, adding: \"Berti is here for the long term.\" The manager, meanwhile, is struggling to defend himself. He confessed: \"You cannot play like that, with no emotion, speed or fight, at international level but I can't explain why we started so badly. The players couldn't tell me either. It's my job to put it right before we meet Iceland next month.\" Those players, of course, also deserve to accept blame. The Premiership defenders David Weir and Christian Dailly were all over the place and Celtic's Stephen Crainey struggled so badly and was left so exposed against the pacy Jakup a Borg on Scotland's left that he must have wished he was somewhere - anywhere - else. Dickov was a mistake, Ferguson and Paul Lambert struggled through the first half, Allan Johnston was anonymous and all that left Kevin Kyle and Scott Dobie with nothing to work on. Lambert read the riot act to his team-mates during the interval. He has never been as frustrated and angry about a performance. Ferguson was equally vociferous during the break. Captain and vice-captain, though, were doing what Vogts should have done. Scotland started the first half badly and faded. Petersen headed the first goal from a cross by Borg after only six minutes and six minutes later the pair repeated the exercise with the teacher volleying the second. In the second half Lambert's half-hit shot was going wide until it did a pinball routine off Weir and the Faroes defender Jon Jacobsen and ricocheted in. Ferguson equalised after 83 minutes.
