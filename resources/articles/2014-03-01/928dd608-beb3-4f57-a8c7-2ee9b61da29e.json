On the fifth anniversary of base rates falling to their current historic low, these trends could play a crucial role in the Bank of England's debate over the cost of borrowing and when to raise it. Threadneedle Street is reluctant to push up interest rates until at least next year. But analysis of employment trends by the Office for National Statistics shows that the labour market is tightening. Older workers, and especially women over the age of 50, have returned to the workforce in greater numbers than at any time in a generation, taking the participation rate back to levels last seen in the early 1990s. While the over-50s may be going back to work, younger people have withdrawn from the workforce in greater numbers than for several decades \u2013 in what many would regard as a sensible move back into education. Some employers have begun to talk about skills shortages, and manufacturing wages have been rising for some time at double the national rate of 1.1%. Recruitment agencies have produced analysis showing that a lack of candidates in key areas, such as accountancy, is already driving wages rises above the inflation rate, which has fallen to 1.9%. But while falling unemployment and a higher participation rate indicate a low level of slack in the economy, the increased use of part-time workers in the service industries, with many likely to be on flexible or zero-hour contracts, has kept productivity lower than in previous recoveries. Britain's largest business sector, accounting for three-quarters of activity, is under-employing its staff and has plenty of scope to increase output without triggering inflation-busting wage rises. So, far from being clear, the ONS report sends Bank of England governor Mark Carney a mixed message. The Bank has put forward a thesis that the UK's output gap is around 1.5%, which is more conservative than some consultancies, which pitch it nearer 5%, but higher than the 0%-0.5% some believe nearer the mark. Economists try to estimate the extent of the output gap because it gives a guide as to how near the economy is to full capacity. They estimate how near businesses are to buying new equipment and how near workers are to regaining the power to push up wages, both of which could increase pressure on prices. Under this regime, the only way to cool prices is to raise rates. The City expects the Bank to start raising rates next year, but the ONS gives Carney plenty of scope to argue that Britain is underperforming, with plenty of scope for most, if not all, employers to increase output without affecting inflation. And an increase in economic activity over the next couple of years could be sustained should younger people return to the workforce, migrants keep arriving and the unemployed find a way to retrain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
