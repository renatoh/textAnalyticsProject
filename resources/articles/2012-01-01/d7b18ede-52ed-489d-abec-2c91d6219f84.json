This disc attempts a reappraisal of the rest of his extensive stage output, but doesn't quite succeed on a number of counts. Though the baroque revival has done much to revise our opinions of his work, this, in contrast, tends to reinforce the stereotypical view of Telemann as an overly prolific composer who wrote much that was decent but little that was great. His melodic sense, in particular, isn't as fine on this recording as you might expect: its opening track, Komm O Schlaf from Germanicus, for instance, starts ravishingly, but then turns four-square. It's a problem encountered too frequently on the disc as a whole. These performances, meanwhile, desperately need an injection of emotion. Catalan soprano Nuria Rial sings with breathtaking accuracy but glacial dispassion, while the Kammerorchester Basel, directed by its leader Julia Schr\u00f6der, sounds scrupulous throughout, rather than committed. Their performance is well-intentioned, but CPO's imminent complete recording of Germanicus will probably tell us much more about Telemann's achievement as an opera composer than this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
