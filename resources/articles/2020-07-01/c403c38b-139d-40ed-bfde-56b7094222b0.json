The \u201clockdown tache\u201d has been seen on a wide variety of famous top lips including Armie Hammer, Tyler, the Creator, Dele Alli and Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan. Since lockdown measures began in March, searches for the term \u201chow to grow a moustache\u201d have increased by 63.4%, while global sales of moustache oil have increased by 67.6%, according to Cosmetify.com. It is a trend that has been mirrored in fashion. Last week\u2019s Gucci\u2019s SS21 Epilogue show featured models with handlebar moustaches and Clark Gable styles. And John Waters was unveiled this week as the new face of Saint Laurent\u2019s AW20 campaign, where his ubiquitous pencil tache took centre stage. \u201cLockdown finally gave men the opportunity to experiment and have some unfettered fun with their facial hair without fear or criticism,\u201d said Lee Kynaston, a grooming expert. \u201cWe saw a lot of men sharing their successes, and failures, on social media too [which] helped normalise the \u2018lockdown tache\u2019 as a thing.\u201d Dominick Murray, an author, started growing his in mid-March as part of a beard, then shaved it down to a moustache: \u201cI started growing it partly because I didn\u2019t need to attend face-to-face meetings,\u201d he said, citing Wyatt Earp and Kurt Russell in Bone Tomahawk as his wild west inspirations. \u201cI\u2019m aiming to keep it until mid-September,\u201d Murray said, adding: \u201cSociety is very inflexible when it comes to lip hair.\u201d Pre-lockdown, celebrities such as Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, The Weeknd and Bruno Mars were met with snorts of derision on social media for growing a moustache. Kynaston said Movember \u2013 the charity event where men grow moustaches to raise awareness of male-specific health issues \u2013 had not helped: \u201cIt took the moustache as a style statement and made it a bit of a gimmick, a novelty that you only grow for a few weeks of the year for charity.\u201d It is in keeping with the last time the moustache was big: during the hipster era in the mid-2000s. Here the tache was worn twizzled at the ends and with a deep sense of kitsch. \u201cMoustaches in 2020 can\u2019t be anything but ironic due to the bad rap the poor old tache has had since its last \u2018unironic\u2019 resurgence,\u201d said Phil Ashton, the brand manager of the men\u2019s skincare brand Triumph &amp; Disaster. \u201cBeing the facial hair of choice among dictators isn\u2019t great PR either,\u201d said Kynaston. He added that a moustache was harder to wear well than a beard, \u201cbecause they\u2019re a rarer sight it takes more attitude, conviction and confidence to carry one off\u201d. But surely if anyone can bring it back it is Styles? Not only did the former One Direction singer make the word \u201cmoustache\u201d trend on Twitter, fans were vocal about its merits: \u201cHarry Styles may be the only person who could wear a moustache like this and still look good,\u201d wrote one. But Dion Nash, Triumph &amp; Disaster\u2019s founder, thinks its charms are fleeting and will not last beyond lockdown: \u201cLike white jeans and turtlenecks, by the time you realise they are in they are actually out again,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
