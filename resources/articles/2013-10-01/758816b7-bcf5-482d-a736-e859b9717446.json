Hiram Maxim perfected his machine gun there; Sebastian de Ferranti his dynamos and Guglielmo Marconi his electric telegraph. Clerkenwell's people were cabinet makers, brass workers and glass shade and globe makers. Elsewhere in the city, new industries flourished, as did the docks and retail. Ladies shopped in \"the emporium of the world!\". \"Made in London\" was a badge of pride. Today, the fattest profits come not from the fruits of questing minds and hard graft but from the new gold, what American writer Michael Goldfarb, in a scathing essay in today's Observer, calls \"the global reserve currency\" that is property. \"The property market is no longer about people making long-term investment in owning their shelter,\" he writes, \"but a place for the world's richest people to park their money at an annualised rate of return of around 10%.\" In 2012, an extraordinary \u00a383 bn-worth of properties were purchased mortgage-free in London with no financing. What attracts foreign (and domestic) millionaires and billionaires is not just the rate of return but the coalition's tax regime. Britain, for instance, has a base corporate tax rate of 23% (due to drop to 20% in 2015). In Germany, it is 29%. Again, while the majority of London's citizens rightly pay up to 40% or more of their incomes to maintain the hospitals, schools, roads and civic services of the city, the rich are taxed in small change. The impact of London's property market becoming another global reserve currency where the super rich stash their billions and evade tax will soon be felt in the changing nature of the city's social and cultural ecology. What price to the capital if, increasingly, teachers, artists, students and civil servants can no longer live, work and contribute to an eclectic social mix? The threat is not just cultural, but economic too. Already some senior business leaders have voiced fears that the capital is likely to lose out to cities such as Berlin in the race to become Europe's major digital hub since London is simply unaffordable for many young enterprising tech workers. Historically, the cultural industries have been major players in the British economy, but they also play a crucial role in helping create a flourishing, diverse city. That is now under serious threat and there are few, if any, senior political leaders who seem to have an oversight of what is happening. The city needs a strong advocate, one who argues vociferously that the cities that work best are ones that work for everyone. London is no longer that type of city. The capital needs to address the real cost of its current trajectory on those still struggling to survive in its less affluent boroughs. London is in danger of becoming a \"doughnut\" city, middle- and lower-income residents exiting because they have little choice, with an immediate impact on the city's rich diversity. The pace of change is alarming. As Stephen Boatright, headteacher of an Earl's Court primary school writes in these pages, in 2011, 63% of children coming into reception were eligible for free school meals; this year, the figure is 23%. The drop is proof that many of London's citizens are becoming involuntary exiles. Crumbs for Londoners, an excellent report by Darren Johnson, Green party member of the London Assembly, strongly criticises Boris Johnson for his \"2020 vision\" of the city. According to one estimate, there will be a shortfall of 750,000 houses in England by 2025. Johnson points out that for those on an average income, house prices should be no higher than \u00a3140,0000 for a single earner and \u00a3170,000 for a couple, with rents at between \u00a379 and \u00a3147 per week. Instead, investors' voracious appetite for \"off plan\" is further stoking a dysfunctional market. Boris's second term in office is quickly becoming a huge disappointment \u2013 he needs to do more to protect not just the city's wallet, but also its soul. Agents are marketing flats in an Elephant and Castle development in south London to overseas buyers in the Asian markets. Prices start at \u00a3310,000 for a one-bedroom flat. Seventy per cent of tenants in the Elephant and Castle area are social tenants. Their numbers will eventually be reduced to 8%. Add to that the impact of the coalition's other measures, such as the bedroom tax and the 40% increase in property prices in the last few years, and it's obvious why middle- and lower-income dwellers are being forced out of the city. As the proportion of affordable homes shrinks, a two-hour bus ride to a job that pays less than the living wage will make no financial sense. Even voices on the right are now saying that the hollowing out of London has to stop. What would make a difference is a mansion tax, levied on properties worth more than \u00a32m, a policy already adopted by Labour; an overhaul of council tax; a tax on those who own properties in the city but say they reside elsewhere and for wealth-dazzled Boris to make clear, as Martin Vander Weyer suggests in the Observer, that the rich are welcome but only if they are \"ready to be a real citizen of London\". The capital may be the economic, cultural and financial centre of the UK but a solution also has to be found to the drag it has on the underperformance of much of the rest of Britain. The thinktank IPPR North recently launched the Adonis Growth Review. Lord Adonis is examining the infrastructure, skills, transport and employment patterns of Britain. Ed Cox, the astute director of IPPR North, says Adonis's mission does not have an anti-London bias but a rebalance has to have a high priority. Currently, for instance, it consistently receives twice the amount of government spending per capita than any other region excluding Scotland. Cox argues that there is international evidence that the fastest growth comes from medium-sized cities, not large conurbations. A new economic understanding in areas such as Manchester and Newcastle values supporting not one sector such as finance, but interlinked hubs of connected industries, offering a range of skills and pooling budgets. As last year's Northern Economic Futures Commission argued, Whitehall must decentralise transport, innovation, skills, welfare, housing and, crucially, fiscal powers and incentives. Michael Goldfarb's dissection of the capital's ongoing hijacking by the rich concludes thus: \"How this story will end doesn't bear thinking about.\" But think about it we must."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
