It isn't so, but say it often enough ...", "bodyText": "I wouldn't get too agitated about it. The Home Office minister Gerry Sutcliffe will enjoy a pleasant trip to California, where he will be told by supporters of Megan's law that it works because parents can protect their children by finding out if there's a nearby paedophile. Opponents will no doubt inform him that, as a result of Megan's law, at least five paedophiles have been murdered. Many others have gone underground, a consequence that will certainly apply here if a similar law were to be introduced. On his return, the minister will be apprised of the inevitability of vigilantism, with its peculiarly British slant of beating up the wrong people. Someone will point out that the majority of sexually abused children have been taken advantage of, not by some passing pervert, but by someone they know, often a member of their household. In a few months, we will be told that Megan's, or Sarah's, law is not appropriate for this country. It is, quite obviously, wholly unnecessary to send Sutcliffe to the US except to show that the home secretary is doing something. That reaction, according to the chief constable of Dyfed-Powys the other day, is typical of a government that has abandoned any strategic design in the management of sex offenders \"in favour of trying to find out what one particular tabloid newspaper wants and then complying with their wishes\". The tabloid in question is the News of the World, but the accusation is part of a far wider debate. Is this government unhealthily in thrall to the Daily Mail and other tabloids? To an extent, undoubtedly. But I'm not too worried that it seems occasionally, or even quite often, to be responding slavishly to media reports of this or that purported scandal, chaos or crisis. If there is a genuine issue, fine. If not, the government's Pavlovian reaction looks a little absurd, but no great harm is done, even if it takes some time to return to sanity after the hysteria created wears off. My concern is, in the longer term, the effect on the reader of the accumulation of news, all of it selected and presented in a certain way, to serve a paper's distorted vision of Britain. A Martian reading the Daily Mail would imagine a bleak country, teeming with dangerous paedophiles, murderers and rapists roaming loose and waiting to strike again, a youth generation dedicated to drink, noise and impoliteness to their elders, crime ever rising, an impotent police and ineffective courts. It isn't so, but say it often enough and people start to believe it. That does greater damage to society than a tabloid's misguided campaign. If Charles Taylor, ex-president of Liberia and alleged major war criminal, is convicted of the charges against him, he will serve his prison sentence in Britain. We have agreed to take him because every other country that was asked refused with alacrity. Why then have we jumped at the chance of providing, at taxpayers' expense, lengthy hospitality for someone who could be proven to be one of Africa's most bloodstained tyrants? Margaret Beckett had two answers. \"First, that Taylor's presence in Sierra Leone [where he is currently held] remains a threat to peace in that region. Secondly, that we are demonstrating through concrete action the UK's commitment to international justice.\" Before Taylor joins us he first has to be found guilty by the International Criminal Court, and our parliament will have to agree. Given the current state of our prisons, MPs may need persuading that what we lack is a murderous African dictator to make up the numbers. The cynical (dominant) part of me sees Britain's kind offer as a device for currying favour with the African nations. But - I don't often say this - I am tempted to take Beckett's moral motives at face value.I find it strange and alarming, though, that the government should show such obeisance to the tenets of international justice while, at home, it is busy dismantling so many basic and valued principles of our own justice system. This is neither a restaurant review nor a tale of gastronomic disaster. It is a modest story, but raises an issue deserving mild attention and discussion. The Arbutus, a new restaurant in London's Soho, has in the past few weeks attracted many excellent reviews attesting to its imaginative cuisine and reasonable prices. We went, and this is what happened. My wife had ordered sea bream for her main course. It arrived, severely undercooked and bloody. Apologies were tendered and the waiter removed the offending fish. I was left with my dish in front of me. It would have been unfair to have demanded that the kitchen cook a new one. Asking for it to be re-heated was out of the question, on taste grounds. So I started eating. The bream that eventually arrived for my wife was perfect. But the rhythm had gone out of the meal. I finished my rabbit while she patiently sipped her wine; I drank more of mine as she started on her fish. That essential ingredient, the comfortable chat as we enjoyed the meal - together - was lost. I wouldn't go as far as saying that the evening was thoroughly spoiled, but its enjoyment was certainly diminished as a result of the chef's error. I'm getting to the point. No restaurant is perfect. Even the best cooks occasionally falter, the most efficient service goes awry. How a restaurant deals with victims of its mishaps says a lot about it. Arbutus handled us by doing absolutely nothing. I have had the luck to have eaten at many good restaurants over the years and my wife has been to even more. Neither of us could recollect a botched meal which has not been followed by some gesture of regret by the restaurant. For a truly awful experience, the whole bill has been waived; a lesser fiasco has brought an invitation to return with a promise of wine on the house. For an inconvenience that has tainted the evening but not totally ruined it (the category we fell into), some small token is the norm - not charging for the pudding or coffee, perhaps, or offering a complimentary digestif. Arbutus did not even have the grace to do that. When we left, my wife, surprised at this inelegant behaviour, quietly and tactfully mentioned it to the person in charge. I take your point, he responded stiffly. Question: were we unreasonable in our expectations? \u00b7 This week Marcel read and marked \"190 examination papers written by my students; I noted that their spelling was more accurate than that of last year's batch, and that no one had written liable instead of libel.\" Marcel managed to find time to watch \"a cricket team calling itself England be outplayed by Sri Lanka ...\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
