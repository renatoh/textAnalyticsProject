Rangers and Celtic moving towards professional setups for their women\u2019s teams, amid a raft of publicity and investment, in theory represents bad news for Glasgow City, who have been champions 14 times including the last 13 seasons in succession. Such a scenario would of course be sad given Glasgow City have been trailblazers for the women\u2019s game in Scotland \u2013 essentially while receiving no external support \u2013 and retain an academy which houses 200 girls. A conversation with Booth, the head coach, suggests however that any concern that Glasgow City\u2019s demise is impending as the Old Firm swat aside all before them might be as simplistic as it is needless. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for people to see what the competition has actually been like,\u201d he explains. \u201cWe have won the league for the five years I have been here but many of those have been on the final day; by a point, by three points. It was nine points the last time but in the men\u2019s game, that\u2019s visible regularly. Hibs have won trophies, Celtic have been there or thereabouts. \u201cI just know my players. One of them has won the league 13 times and is as hungry as ever. The ones who have won it eight times are hungry to win it again. You could be even hungrier because the depth of competition will make the league even stronger. \u201cWe haven\u2019t gone into a season yet thinking it was a gimme. We have constantly needed our international players to dictate standards to the rest. I never panic, I never think a challenge is insurmountable. We are a club that are constantly looking to progress.\u201d The p-word is emphasised by Glasgow City\u2019s run to the last eight of the Champions League for the first time since 2015, where Wolfsburg lie in wait. \u201cThat\u2019s 100% punching above our weight,\u201d says Booth. \u201cAll the other teams there have a men\u2019s club behind them, they are all richer than Glasgow City. This is a unique club, championing girls and women.\u201d Before Europe resumes, and in what will be viewed by many as an indicator of things to come domestically, Glasgow City face Celtic in the Premier League\u2019s opening fixture. Booth acknowledges Celtic and Rangers don\u2019t take kindly to playing the supporting act. \u201cNo they don\u2019t but when I was at Aberdeen [as a player] they didn\u2019t want to be second best either,\u201d he adds. \u201cThey proved, as a smaller club, they could compete. We understand the game is progressing and we want to stay ahead of the game. We can\u2019t worry too much about what anyone else does. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say it will be really competitive but I think it\u2019s also fair to say it\u2019s a bit of an unknown quantity. If you are spending a lot of money and signing a lot of players, you have to want to win the title. We want that every year. For me, nothing has changed. Who are the favourites? Who knows but I think we have great players who can handle whatever comes at them.\u201d Fran Alonso, newly installed as Celtic\u2019s head coach, insists his team are \u201cready and capable\u201d of being champions. Their latest signing, Anita Marcos, arrived from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Early indications are that Rangers \u2013 who have India\u2019s first female professional, Ngangom Bala Devi, in their ranks \u2013 have spent the most heavily. Yet, and curiously to those of us looking from the outside, neither Old Firm club have plundered Glasgow City\u2019s all-conquering squad. Had they done, and in a nod to Booth\u2019s coaching talent, it wouldn\u2019t be an altogether new phenomenon; Glasgow City have lost top talent year on year, either to England or abroad. That they have recovered from that, plus the annually expensive quest for adequate facilities as they juggle morning and evening training sessions, demonstrates how impressively this club is structured. Glasgow City\u2019s squad is a hybrid model. Some players are paid and some retain amateur status. The notion of a one size fits all, entirely professional scene in Scotland has never flown with many players content to retain work away from football. And, of course, a lack of finance has influenced decision making. Booth would like to see a move towards full professionalism but in stages. \u201cI\u2019ve always said the women\u2019s game needs more help,\u201d Booth says. \u201cThere is a small pool of players in Scotland but it\u2019s growing. I feel like the infrastructure in Scotland needs to improve, we need more money in the game without a doubt and not just in terms of signing players.\u201d It would be a pity if Glasgow City aren\u2019t central to such growth. Without them, women\u2019s football in Scotland would have no broader resonance at all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
