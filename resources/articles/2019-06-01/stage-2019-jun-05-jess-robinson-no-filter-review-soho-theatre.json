Big voice, big smile, big on pop culture: it couldn\u2019t be more mainstream. And not for the want of trying. The show is called No Filter, and purports to introduce us to the real, no-holds-barred Robinson, emerging from behind the vocal impressions with which she made her name on Dead Ringers, Britain\u2019s Got Talent and elsewhere. One song, in the louche mockney style of Lily Allen, sends up Robinson\u2019s eagerness to please. Another envies Nicki Minaj her sexual candour. But withdraw Robinson\u2019s filter and \u2013 no spoiler this \u2013 she remains slick, smiley and squeaky clean. Yes, there\u2019s a routine about teenage sexual initiation, but it couldn\u2019t be more chaste and ends, delightfully, in a four-piece recorder version of Like a Virgin. That was the show\u2019s highlight and, not coincidentally, its most idiosyncratic moment. Elsewhere, Robinson and her perky band devise inventive new formats \u2013 Celebrity Phone Hack; the Wheel of Fortune-ish Celebrity Volleyball \u2013 to accommodate impersonations of everyone from Adele to Kim Kardashian, Janis Joplin (or is it Marge Simpson?) to Billie Holiday. They\u2019re often tenuous \u2013 her Six Degrees of Theresa May game reveals more about Robinson\u2019s voice than the PM\u2019s \u2013 but often impressive, as with the closing song, each line sung by a different, instantly recognisable celeb. Robinson\u2019s talent for singing and mimicry, if less so for jokes, fills the room fit to burst. What the supposed removal of her filter achieves isn\u2019t quite so clear. \u2022 At Soho theatre, London, until 8 June; then at Assembly Rooms, Edinburgh, 1-24 August."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
