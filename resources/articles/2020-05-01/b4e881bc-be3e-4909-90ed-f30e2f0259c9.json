Below is an edited transcript. How would you describe the current situation and your feelings about it? There\u2019s a lot of work still to be done. I was in Switzerland last week for the first time in two months and had meetings from 9am to 11pm. There is so much information [to take in] and so many calendar issues \u2013 and so many millions and millions, dozens of millions of dollars, that we will lose. It is then hard to fall asleep at night. You would be quite irresponsible if you could fall asleep immediately after a day like that. The situation for Uefa is not that alarming, we\u2019re not in a dangerous situation, but we still care about the clubs and the leagues and the stakeholders so it is a lot of work. How and when did you decide to postpone Euro 2020? In these kinds of situations do you wake up in the middle of the night thinking about it? It\u2019s even worse, I couldn\u2019t even fall asleep until 4am. At that time [in the morning] I made the decision [about Euro 2020] and then fell asleep for a couple of hours. Would you bet a million dollars that Euro 2020 will be played in 2021? Yes, I would. I don\u2019t think that this virus will last for ever. I think it will [change] sooner than many think. What gives you that impression? It\u2019s a serious situation but it is going down now and we are being more cautious. We know more about the virus. I don\u2019t like this apocalyptic view that we have to wait for the second and third waves or even a fifth wave \u2026 people you know are likely to die one day, but do we have to be worried today? I don\u2019t think so. We are ready and we will follow the recommendations of the authorities but I\u2019m absolutely sure, personally, that good old football with fans will come back very soon. Is this going to change football for ever? I don\u2019t think that anything will change for ever. It\u2019s a new experience and when we get rid of this bloody virus things will go back to normal. Football didn\u2019t change after the second world war, or first world war, and it will not change because of a virus either. People have said many times that the world will not be the same after \u2026 this might be true, but why not think that the world will be better after this virus? Why not think that we will be smarter, or finally understand how fragile we are, how unprotected we are towards nature? So, there are always lessons to be learned. What are your thoughts about the suggested new 24-team Club World Cup? You said earlier this year that this could mean the death of football. It was presented as if a fund would buy the competition and that the whole competition would be sold. We didn\u2019t have any more information than that and even now I don\u2019t have much more information, but as far as I know the fund is gone and to be honest I don\u2019t know in which direction this idea is going for now. Do you still want to launch this third European competition, the Uefa Europa Conference League, or has this situation made you think twice about it? We will do it, absolutely. In 2021 or will you delay it? We will not postpone it. What about financial fair play ? Are you still committed to the current rules? And how important is it that clubs get sanctioned if they disobey the rules? If they don\u2019t follow the rules they will always be sanctioned but of course we are [always] thinking about how we can improve our regulations and, if necessary, adapt. This will not happen very soon but we are thinking of improving [FFP]; modernising it and doing something more about the competitive balance. We are also considering some sort of \u201cluxury tax\u201d, if it is possible. Before the Covid-19 crisis there was the case and sanction of Manchester City. Is Uefa still supporting the chamber\u2019s findings? Are you still fully behind the guilty verdict and the two-year ban? Look, the decision was made and now the case is at the court of arbitration for sport and Cas will decide. That\u2019s absolutely all I can say, for two reasons. Firstly, the independent bodies made the decision, I didn\u2019t, and secondly, I really don\u2019t know the case [well enough]. Let\u2019s switch to women\u2019s football. How close are we to equal pay? This is the million-dollar question. I think it is hard because there is a big difference in the revenue . Uefa is investing a lot into women\u2019s football and we\u2019re very happy with it . Women\u2019s football is increasingly popular\u2026 but with equal pay it\u2019s really very hard to say something now. At the start of the coronavirus crisis the Fifa president, Gianni Infantino, said this was a chance to reorganise and reduce [the amount of] football being played. Do you agree? I don\u2019t know. I tried to understand what he meant with that but for sure it\u2019s strange that on the one hand you say you [want to] reduce football and on the other hand you propose a new competition called the Club World Cup. A lot has been made about players\u2019 salaries. Do you think that players should be a bit more humble and bit less greedy and that clubs should be a little bit wiser with their spending? I don\u2019t think players are greedy. The market decides the prices and if you or I would get an offer to be paid $20m per season I don\u2019t think you or I would say: \u2018No, give me $200,000.\u2019 But let\u2019s see if the market response to this crisis. It\u2019s possible that prices will go down but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to say that the players are greedy. They also bring a lot of revenue and football is a big industry that pays a huge amount of taxes. The player is also paying huge taxes, so I don\u2019t think that the right word is greediness, or that the clubs should be wiser, because it\u2019s simply the market that decides how the prices are moving.
