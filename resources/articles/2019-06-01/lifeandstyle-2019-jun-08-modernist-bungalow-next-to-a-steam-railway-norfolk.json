Fashion designers Will Brown and Marie Willey, who are behind the utilitarian clothing label Old Town, are the real deal. After living in Cromer for more than 10 years, the couple happened upon a post-war bungalow in Sheringham two years ago, next to the railway lines where North Norfolk Railway steam trains are parked before day trips along the coast. The simple, single-storey building was \u201ca total state\u201d, Willey says. The pair reconfigured the interior, turning a small living room into a bedroom for Brown, creating a monastic loft bedroom where Willey sleeps (\u201cI snore, Will doesn\u2019t\u201d), and building a large bolt-on extension to the back and side \u2013 accessed from the original hallway \u2013 that doubled the floor space. It has a bright vaulted ceiling, large Crittall doors and a grey-and-white checkered floor that unites the old and new parts. They added a studio, complete with cutting table, sewing bench, steam iron, coal stove and a red-and-white checkered floor that mirrors the one in the house, as well as a gravel garden punctuated with gorse, metal sculpture and totems, inspired by the garden at the late artist and filmmaker Derek Jarman\u2019s cottage in Dungeness. \u201cI think Jarman was about showing the beauty in something that a lot of people would think of as ugly,\u201d Brown says. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t think of anything worse than mowing a lawn,\u201d Willey adds. The couple took down a large hedge that was shielding the back garden from the steam trains. \u201cThe sound of them slowing down as they pull into the station makes me think of a scene from a film set in Connecticut in the 1950s,\u201d Willey says. The Old Town workwear aesthetic sits somewhere between the romance of rural New England, fed through the filter of a dozen Sissy Spacek movies and the mid-century chic of slam-door British Railway carriages. At their last house, the couple worked from an old railway carriage they had craned into their back garden. For a while Brown presented his menswear with descriptions he called \u201cfictitious provenance \u2013 an aid to the imagination.\u201d A jacket wasn\u2019t just a jacket, it was \u201can unfaithful copy of one found in a tool locker during the demolition of Stratford locomotive works\u201d, even though there had never been a tool locker, nor a jacket. While Brown and Willey have a main studio at their store in Holt, the workspace here is perfect for bringing pieces home, altering them as and when necessary. \u201cWe tend to work here one day a week,\u201d Marie says. \u201cAs the shop is close by, we can have a three-day weekend.\u201d Inspiration for the interior of the bungalow came about after leafing through books on modernist architecture on Cape Cod, and afternoons spent lunching at Rochelle Canteen, Margot Henderson\u2019s restaurant in east London. They have copied its open-plan whitewashed look and high-beamed ceilings in the extension, where they spend most of their time. There\u2019s a clearly defined aesthetic in this house of clean graphics, architectural salvage, plywood, and a sense of industrial sturdiness. Creating a large extension to the original bungalow has other benefits. \u201cOur last house was a Victorian terrace on five floors,\u201d Brown says, \u201cand all we did was run up and down the stairs. Now we have this big lovely room, warm and bright.\u201d In a further homage to Rochelle Canteen, they have the same vintage Ercol stackable dining chairs. In Brown\u2019s bedroom is a mood board of images, from Italian futurist uniforms to Bauhaus photographs and typography by Margaret Calvert, who created the signage for Britain\u2019s roads in the 1960s. Brown has channelled a lot of those influences into DIY murals \u2013 overlapping rectangles of different colours, with stencil numbering over the top. \u201cI wanted this to feel more like a studio, not a bedroom,\u201d he says. Brown has been an insider name in fashion since the 1970s; David Bowie wore a Brown-designed pink jumpsuit and beige duster coat in the 1979 video for DJ. Today, Old Town\u2019s entire fashion output \u2013 which began in 1994 \u2013 is produced piecemeal by nine experienced sewists who live near the Old Town store and Holt studio. \u201cWe don\u2019t like factories,\u201d Brown says. \u201cYou just end up with that factory style \u2013 everything looks the same. It takes us months to show someone how we want things done, but it\u2019s worth it.\u201d It\u2019s telling that the couple have chosen to base their lives in Norfolk, creating slow fashion that is somehow out of time, rather than running between the trade shows of London, Paris and New York. Their seaside home is a place of reflection and an incubator for them to live and create in peace, Willey says: \u201cWhen the steam trains aren\u2019t parked here, you can be in the back garden and look out across the cliffs to the sea.\u201d oldtown.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
