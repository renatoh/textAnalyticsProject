With eight matches left, three teams are squabbling over the scudetto . Everyone expected last year's winners and runners-up, Roma and Juventus respectively, to be involved, but the same cannot be said for Internazionale. It is 13 years since Inter last won the title. Since then the club president Massimo Moratti has changed his coach almost every season, pumping millions into the squad with little return. This season, however, despite long periods without their leading strikers Ronaldo and Christian Vieri, Inter have their noses in front. The blue-and-black half of Milan desperately hopes they can stay there, but on the evidence of Saturday night's 169th \"Derby of Italy\" - so called because it is the only ever-present fixture in the history of Serie A - they should not count their chickens. Inter lacked ideas and a willingness to commit anything in attack. It took an injury-time wonder goal from Clarence Seedorf, his second of the game, to earn them a little-deserved draw. Inter had begun confidently enough, going ahead after six minutes with a brilliant 25-yard Seedorf half-volley. But Marcello Lippi's side came back and equalised six minutes later when David Trezeguet headed low past Francesco Toldo. The stage was set for a classic, but the match fizzled out. The sullen Vieri had no support and, even though Inter's coach Hector Cuper constantly urged his team forward, they were hindered by his negative 4-4-1-1 formation. Gradually Juventus took control and, in a second half almost entirely without incident, were rewarded 10 minutes from time when Pavel Nedved's free-kick was met by Igor Tudor. The Croatian planted his header in the bottom corner, removed his shirt and set off on an 80-yard run down the touchline before collapsing on the edge of his own box. Such superfluous exertion was ill advised: deep into injury-time, Tudor did not have the legs to get close to Seedorf, who, from 30 yards, hit a swerving left-footed shot high into the top corner to send San Siro wild. \"I played well, but so did the team,\" said Seedorf. \"I've been on the substitutes' bench for several months but I never lost my enthusiasm. I'm glad I got the opportunity to show what I can do.\" Lippi was understandably disappointed. \"We proved we are title candidates and we definitely should have won,\" he said. \"But it was a very good match between two excellent teams.\" La Stampa's headline proclaimed: \"Juventus are spectacular, Seedorf is magic\". But in reality, both sides were poor. Arsenal, who play Juventus a week on Wednesday, should not fear their trip to Turin. As for who will win the scudetto , the wily national team coach Giovanni Trappatoni - the last man to lead Inter to the title, in 1989 - believes his old side can do it. \"They're looking like my Inter,\" he says. \"We played in the same way, winning every game 1-0 in the last minute, always struggling.\" Man of the match: Clarence Seedorf (Internazionale). Internazionale (4-4-1-1): Toldo, Gresko, Materazzi, Cordoba, J Zanetti; Seedorf, Di Biagio (Ventola, 80), Conceicao, C Zanetti; Recoba (Kallon, 72); Vieri. Juventus (4-3-1-2): Buffon; Birindelli, Thuram (Tudor, 21), Iuliano, Pessotto; Zambrotta, Conte, Davids (Tacchinardi, 76); Nedved; Trezeguet (Amoruso, 66), Del Piero.
