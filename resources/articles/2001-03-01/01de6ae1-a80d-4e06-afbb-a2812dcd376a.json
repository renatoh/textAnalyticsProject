Tranmere, who threw away a two-goal lead, remain bottom of the First Division and despite their FA Cup run, Aldridge decided the time was right to go. His assistant, Kevin Sheedy, will take charge for tomorrow's trip to Gillingham. Preston moved up to fifth place after Sean Gregan's amazing winner at Norwich . The captain spotted Andy Marshall off his line and chipped the goalkeeper from almost 50 yards. Huddersfield leapt above QPR after the two sides had contrasting home games. Lou Macari's Terriers beat play-off chasing Sheffield United 2-1, while Rangers were beaten 1-0 at home thanks to Paul Groves' winner for Grimsby . However, both sides remain in the bottom three. Rotherham closed the gap on Millwall , who lost on Friday, to a single point at the summit of the Second Division after a 3-0 home victory against Bristol Rovers . Ronnie Moore's side can go top if they win their game in hand at Wycombe tomorrow night. Rovers remain in deep relegation trouble. The play-off positions remain unaltered. Only Reading could manage victory, Martin Butler's two goals seeing off Wrexham. Lee Trundle's reply was his seventh goal in just five starts for the north Wales side. At the bottom of the section, Oxford's clash with Luton was postponed, leaving only Swansea of the bottom four to gain. However, their 1-1 draw at Swindon , themselves just above the danger zone, still leaves the Welsh club 11 points from safety. At the top of the Third Division, Chesterfield needed a late equaliser from Jon Howard to take a point from their game at Saltergate against Rochdale , for whom their record signing Paul Connor scored. Cardiff moved second after beating Carlisle 4-1, with Jason Bowen scoring a hat-trick. Brighton have the same number of points as Sam Hammam's club and both are 10 ahead of fourth-placed Hartlepool , where the Seagulls drew 2-2 . A 4-2 defeat at Cheltenham means Halifax stay 92nd in the league, with the Conference looming."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
