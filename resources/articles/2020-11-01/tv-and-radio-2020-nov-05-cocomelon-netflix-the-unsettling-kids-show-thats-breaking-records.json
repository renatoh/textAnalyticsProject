And yet one of the biggest Netflix shows, possibly ever, is a show you might not even be aware of. Ladies and gentlemen, that show is Cocomelon. According to Forbes, Cocomelon recently broke a record by remaining in Netflix\u2019s top 10 most-watched shows for 62 days. That\u2019s longer than Avatar: The Last Airbender. It\u2019s longer than Ozark. It\u2019s longer than Tiger King, The Umbrella Academy and Love is Blind. So what is this Cocomelon? A prestigious drama that offers an authentic look at an important social issue? A deliberately trashy reality show about a shopping mall concession kiosk? A true crime documentary about a monster known only as The Cocomelon Killer? Well, no. It\u2019s a kid\u2019s show. And if anything that\u2019s putting it loosely. In fact, Cocomelon is a just series of three hour-long nursery rhyme compilations. The first episode \u2013 Cocomelon Sing-Alongs: Playdate With JJ \u2013 begins with a song called First Day at School. Over a melody pitched nebulously between Twinkle Twinkle Little Star and This Old Man He Played One, a CGI toddler (think Pixar by way of a debilitating radiation leak) expresses nerves about starting school. His family prepares him by endlessly drilling him on what he needs to take, what he needs to do and the precise level of emotion he should be experiencing. He goes to school. It\u2019s fine. The song ends. Three minutes have passed. Another 57 remain. Look, Cocomelon is not the sort of thing that holds up to scrutiny well. It\u2019s cloying and simplistic and repetitive and, unless you happen to be suffering from a very specific type of hangover, not designed to be watched by adults at all. Some songs \u2013 like Father and Sons Day, where the toddler does sit-ups with a sort of formaldehyde Rob Lowe figure \u2013 are genuinely unbearable to endure. But guess what? They\u2019re not for you. If you\u2019re a preschool child, though, this stuff is like crack. The Cocomelon you see on Netflix is actually an edited highlights reel of its YouTube channel; the second most viewed channel on Earth, with 82bn views and a $120m annual ad revenue. And YouTube is where I first came to know Cocomelon. Between the ages of one and three, my children absolutely wolfed this stuff down. It didn\u2019t matter that the characters floated around weightlessly, as if they\u2019d been shot in the rear with a tranquilliser dart. It didn\u2019t matter that many of the songs followed the same fractured dream logic of a David Lynch movie. It didn\u2019t matter that every second of every song was pitched with the sort of relentless unblinking surface-level joy that appeared to overcompensate for some deep-set irreparable psychological trauma. The key to Cocomelon\u2019s success isn\u2019t that it\u2019s good, because no entity this determined to pump an endless stream of Johnny Johnny Yes Papa variations into an already anxious world can ever be thought of as good. No, the key to its success is that it\u2019s just about reliable enough. YouTube, especially kid\u2019s YouTube, is a terrifying wilderness. Unless you tread very, very carefully, you can end up watching hideous text-to-speech abominations or Numberblocks compilations where the Numberblocks all swear or \u2013 and this one is from personal experience \u2013 a thankfully now-deleted Paw Patrol tribute cartoon where Chase was electrocuted and tortured But with Cocomelon, you know what you\u2019re getting; a series of inoffensive, if slightly unsettling, songs that go on and on and on for long enough to let you sneak off and cook dinner. It\u2019s the preschool equivalent of a mindfulness app, or a white noise machine, or a fairground hypnotist who seems just about friendly enough to look after your children while you nip away to the toilet. And that\u2019s why Cocomelon is doing so well on Netflix. It isn\u2019t because people like it. It\u2019s because it\u2019s a reliable enough stand-in when a parent just wants to go and do a poo alone for once in their godforsaken life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
