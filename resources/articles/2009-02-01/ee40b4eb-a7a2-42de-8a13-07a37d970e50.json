Luiz Felipe Scolari has followed Avram Grant in being removed from office. Neither could compare to the Portuguese. Mourinho's presence at Stamford Bridge is stronger than ever, even though he departed 17 months ago. The parting of the ways occurred at a time when the club seemed to believe that football, in every particular, must be as they decreed. It rankled with the owner, Roman Abramovich, that Chelsea had just endured consecutive draws at home with Blackburn Rovers and Rosenborg Trondheim over the span of four September days in 2007. Results were not the only vexatious factor. There had been fewer than 25,000 people in the ground for the Champions League fixture. Abramovich, who had paid \u00a330m for Andriy Shevchenko when the striker was nearing his 30th birthday, craved glamour. The aim was to see a Chelsea as admired and successful as, say, Barcelona. It would be sentimental to think that Abramovich merely wanted his club to be loved. An endearing Chelsea would have been more marketable across the globe. That was not Mourinho's priority. While his sides can be breathtaking, that usually happens when there is no alternative. The Portuguese feeds on confrontation, but the endless disputes, furores and seeming feuds must have been unpalatable to Abramovich. Parting company with Mourinho, though, was a terrible miscalculation. Those who followed were sure to look pallid by comparison. It is no help to Avram Grant that his tenure is now starting to appear impressive. The contest for the Premier League title went to the last afternoon and the loss of the penalty shoot-out in the 2008 Champions League final was as far beyond the manager's control as Didier Drogba's unpardonable folly in collecting a red card earlier that night in Moscow. The key matches would not quite bend to Grant's will as they commonly had to Mourinho. Scolari's mission was tougher still. The Brazilian had a lopsided squad. His only strikers of note were Nicolas Anelka and a Drogba who seemed to have retreated into himself. The Ivorian's contribution in the 3\u20130 trouncing at Old Trafford last month was so wretched that he virtually detached himself from the action, if not the ignominy of the result. Chelsea's trouble is that any such problem makes people wonder how Mourinho would have handled it, assuming he had ever permitted such a situation to emerge. The image of absolute control was a piece of artifice and the manager could certainly go wrong, but his touch had been sure over his own stretch of Chelsea's 86-game unbeaten sequence at home in the league. The chain snapped against Liverpool this season, on Scolari's watch. Chelsea's next undefeated run at Stamford Bridge in the competition lasted two matches. The Brazilian's feats proved superficial. A dependence on the overlapping full-backs was soon rumbled and Deco, after initial flourishes, soon demonstrated why Barcelona had been ready to part with him. As in the case of Grant, Mourinho was the true nemesis of Scolari. There is a gross injustice to that. The Portuguese, after all, had Ricardo Carvalho before the nagging injuries, Drogba before an apparent alienation and Abramovich himself for three seasons before misgivings sidled into the relationship. The economics may also have curdled after Mourinho. Those financial matters continue to be obscure. Abramovich authorised the \u00a315m purchase of Nicolas Anelka in January 2008 and Jose Bosingwa, an excellent recruit, arrived for \u00a316m last summer. It may be that the proprietor has less money now that the global economy has lost its footing, but the extent of his remaining funds could be considerable. Chelsea were near to acquiring the very costly Robinho, before Manchester City felt moved to confirm their apparently endless means. The Brazilian embodies the promise of exhilaration and maybe he would have brought stylishness to Stamford Bridge. Abramovich surely still seeks more for his club than a struggle for the last of the Champions League slots. Disruptive and demanding as Mourinho can be, he delivers a sense of occasion to any event in which he is embroiled. Were he and Abramovich ever to be reconciled it might need the sort of transfer budget the Russian will no longer countenance. Nonetheless, the next Chelsea manager's hardest task will be to show that life can be more than the dreary aftermath of the Mourinho era."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
