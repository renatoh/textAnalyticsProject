We must be told Ever since the incorporation of further education colleges in 1993, Natfhe and other FE unions have called for action on the collection and analysis of accurate workforce data. So we are very pleased to finally see a comprehensive analysis of the Staff Individualised Record (Sir) (Who works in colleges? We may never know again, December 6). The Foster FE review bemoaned the absence of a workforce development strategy and has called for one to be drawn up over the next year. The workforce data, now finally collected and analysed, has to be the starting point. The monitoring and evaluation of any strategy will be dependent on maintaining the flow of data. In the light of this, Natfhe is very concerned over fears that the LSC may not collect a detailed Sir again, and that the responsibility for data collection may be transferred to Lifelong Learning UK. By its own admission, LLUK is not equipped to carry out such a massive task. If a workforce development strategy is to become a reality, the LSC must maintain the collection of data, or LLUK be given resources to do it. Dan Taubman Natfhe, London White paper: priorities and powers We at the Advisory Centre for Education (Ace) were pleased but puzzled to see that in her article (Labour's vision: helping the poorest kids to achieve, November 29), Ruth Kelly asserted that \" ... we will guarantee that looked-after children will have priority in terms of school admission, as those with statements of special educational needs already do. No school will be able to evade their wider responsibilities.\" Is a change in the law planned? Currently, maintained schools have to accept a child if they are named on the statement, but academies are free to refuse to do so. As with independent schools, the SEN and Disability Tribunal cannot order that a child should attend an academy without the academy's consent. A legal obligation to ensure that \"no school will be able to evade their wider responsibilities\" to children with special educational needs would be fairer on all children, parents, schools and communities. Alison Murdoch Ace, London \u00b7 Despite Ruth Kelly's valiant efforts to pretend otherwise, the future role of LEAs under her proposals is little short of pathetic. Kelly envisages five jobs for LEAs: promoting good practice, objecting to the schools adjudicator over admissions, intervening more easily in failing schools, proposing SEN units in any type of school and arranging transport. Not a word about strategic planning, financing or school provision, which are all cornerstones of the historic 1945 settlement defining the partnership between central and local government in the provision of state education. There is nothing in the government's aspirations that cannot be delivered effectively through this partnership. Self-respecting local authorities should not consider signing up to such a feeble offering. All power to the elbows of those who aim to have these proposals changed. Robin Wendt Former secretary, Association of County Councils, Chester Teaching assistants need teachers' support Most teaching assistants don't want to be teachers, or do teachers' jobs at half the pay or less (All trained up and nowhere to go, November 22). But they do want their contribution to be recognised. They are often the most long-serving members of school staff, and have the advantage over supply teachers of knowing the children, the work being done and the absent teacher. Teachers who are worried about being priced out of jobs will hopefully be supporting teaching assistants' efforts to get a decent national pay scale.
