A force of 25 Abrams tanks and 12 Bradley fighting vehicles rumbled through the suburb of Dawra. The vehicles came under some small arms fire before swinging west and linking up with troops at the city's main airport, which was captured on Friday. American Major-General Victor Renuart said the incursion had been a 'clear statement of the ability of the coalition forces to move into Baghdad at times and places of their choosing'. But he also told a news conference at the allied control centre in neighbouring Qatar: 'This fight is far from over.' The Iraqis denied yesterday that any American forces were in Baghdad and said its troops had driven the invaders from the international airport - a claim that a US military spokesman described as groundless. However, a Reuters correspondent who drove round the sprawling Iraqi capital yesterday reported that he saw no sign of American forces in the areas he visited. In a message read on television by Information Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahaf, Saddam Hussein urged his people to step up their attacks on the US and British invasion forces. 'The criminals will be humiliated,' he said. Elsewhere, American units launched ground and air assaults on the Shia Muslim shrine city of Kerbala, 70 miles south-west of Baghdad in a bid to protect the rear of American divisions in the capital, while in the north of Iraq, US forces moved from Kurdish-held territory towards the oil city of Mosul. Four American soldiers were wounded in yesterday's action, one of them shot in the head, while rocket-propelled grenades damaged a US tank. A second tank had to be abandoned in Baghdad because of mechanical failure, the coalition said. An Iraqi military spokesman claimed hundreds of American troops had been killed in the airport fighting, while the Red Cross said several hundred wounded Iraqis had been admitted to Baghdad hospitals after fighting with US forces erupted in the city. Thousand of local people were reported to being fleeing in cars packed with blankets and belongings. 'We're confronting the mightiest army in the world,' said Nour Khaled, 48, a mother of two. 'What can we do? Where can we go?' Hundreds of men, women and children were seen trudging south from Baghdad on a main road 15 miles outside the city. Most were empty-handed or were carrying children too young to walk in midday heat through open fields and marshlands. Further south, around Kerbala, helicopter-borne troops of the 101st Airborne Division landed on the western edge of town and moved in beside a tank battalion with Apache attack helicopters overhead. Iraqi paramilitary forces fired assault rifles and rocket-propelled grenades from city rooftops. US forces hit back using helicopters, artillery and heavy weapons. 'It's freaky in there. Lots of bullets flying around. It's pretty scary,' said one US soldier who was among half a dozen troops wounded in the fierce street fighting. US officers said fighter jets had hit a Republican Guard facility, the ruling Baath Party headquarters and an ammunitions depot with 2,000 pound bombs shortly before midday. Three huge plumes of smoke rose above Kerbala and secondary explosions were heard after the air strikes. South of Baghdad, a US officer said first tests of a white powder found in thousands of boxes showed it was not a chemical weapon. Colonel John Peabody told Reuters most of it appeared to be the nerve gas antidote atropine, and another chemical."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
