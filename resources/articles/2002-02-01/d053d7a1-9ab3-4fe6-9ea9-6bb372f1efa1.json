The Japanese and Korean organising committees have cut out the public sniping and every day appears to bring a fresh story of heart-warming cultural collaboration between the countries - although, on the evidence of December's opening ceremony, the feel good factor is likely to evaporate fairly shortly after the performances begin. Football-wise, there has been some teeth-gnashing over Hidetoshi Nakata's alarming dip in form at Parma. But at least the star midfielder will be well rested come June. All in all, everything seems in order, which is just as well, because beyond the round-balled frippery, Japan's economic slide shows no signs of stopping. But this is the world's second biggest economy, after all. How bad can it be? Well, when economists predict that within five years Japan might resemble Argentina, they aren't suggesting that the team from Asia will assume an attacking 3-4-2-1 formation. It remains difficult to imagine looting on the streets of Tokyo, but the mood is bleak. When you hear discussions on the potential boost that hooligans on the rampage could give local glass replacement industries - the well-known 'hooligan as Keynesian stimulus theory?' - then things are definitely not right. But the World Cup offers glimmers of hope. The media has been discussing research which reveals that, since Spain in 1982, host nations have benefited on average from a 0.3% increase in GDP. Can the World Cup resuscitate the economy? Where Prime Minister Koizumi and the Bank of Japan have failed, will Figo, Veron and Owen succeed? Send in the cavalry Herr Blatter, the global economy needs you. The great cappucinno rip-off? Naturally, more tourism will help. But the early estimates of tourist numbers now look a little optimistic. Yasuhiko Endo, General Secretary of the Japanese Organising Committee recently admitted that whilst tickets for the domestic market are sold out, overseas ticket sales \" are not going quite as well\" Is Japan just too expensive for football fans? There is little sense denying that Japan is a very expensive country - especially among readers of British newspapers. Everybody has seen the figures. \u00a310 for a Guinness and \u00a3600 for a meal in Tokyo's top restaurants scream the headlines. Cheap noodles and \u00a32.50 lagers lie quietly further down the page, if they make it at all. But this is a once in a lifetime opportunity and those attention-grabbing prices are often misleading, exaggerated or plain irrelevant. If you want to go to an extravagantly expensive Japanese restaurant, try to book a table at Nobu in London. But if you fancy a game of football with a Japanese flavour - and don't fancy a trip to Arsenal reserves to watch Junichi Inamoto tread on the Ball - then you should seriously consider Japan in the summer. It offers a unique football experience against some breathtaking backdrops. The resourceful fan will find it not much more expensive, possibly cheaper, than the South-east of England. Sounds good, doesn't it? And I haven't even mentioned the outdoor beer vending machines yet. Is the trip being undersold? A steady stream of football, police and government officials have returned from fact-finding missions to Japan. All have said suitably complimentary things about the stadiums and Japanese hospitality. Then towards the end of the radio interview or newspaper article we learn about the \u00a39 coffee experience. Amazingly all of these officials have ended up getting ripped off buying a cappuccino. There is no need to spend \u00a39 on a coffee in Japan. I never have. It is actually pretty hard to do. So why do all these officials feel compelled to relate this sorry anecdote? Is the desperation for one tournament which is 100% trouble free so pressing that eveybody concerned is ready to put off quite a few legitimate fans to achieve it? Ultimately, a trip to Japan will be beyond the means of a lot of supporters. Many may choose to wait for Portugal 2004 or Germany 2006. But quit with the tales of the great coffee robbery. It just ain't true. Safety first With hindsight, competing in the Great Stadium Building Race of the1990s against South Korea was probably not the best use of Japan's resources. For a while, neither nation seemed capable of passing an undeveloped field without laying down a pitch and erecting a couple of cantilever stands. When FIFA eventually blew the final whistle, we had a thrilling 10-all draw. The result left Japan with a load of spanking stadiums, the smallest of which has a capacity of 41,800 more than twice the average J-League attendance. With most stadiums only hosting 3 matches this summer, other uses have had to be found to justify the largess. Ingeniously, a number of arena have now been designated as official evacuation centres following a natural disaster. Two warehouses, stocked with emergency supplies, lie beneath the stands of Saitama stadium, the venue for England's opening match against Sweden on June 2nd. The stadium also comes with its own water purifying system, with machines capable of processing 3000 litres of water in one hour. It is claimed that enough fresh water can be provided to keep 3000 people alive for a month. Leaving aside the fact that the stadium's fairly inaccessible location means survivors of a natural disaster will be doing very well to get there, it will surely be of some comfort to English supporters that even if Larsson and Ljungberg expose deep fault-lines in the English defence, those in the stands are very well protected. Perhaps a lusty chant of \"No surrender to Mother Nature\" would be appropriate. Mistaken identity For those brave earthquake-defying millionaires who do plan to go to Japan this summer, the Foreign Office has helpfully provided some factsheets. Amid the eminently sensible advice on ATMs and rail passes lies the section \"Behaviour while in Japan\". Travelling fans are advised that \"exposed upper bodies may cause offence\". There is no doubt that the flabby midriffs exhibited by some England supporters have offended many over the years but there is no evidence that the average Japanese aesthetic sense is any more vulnerable than that of other nationalities. But the men from the ministry go on to warn of the further risks if the exposed upper body is adorned with tattoos, which are \"associated with criminals\". The FCO must have been consulting a fairly elderly focus group from a remote province on this one. Whilst it is true that tattoos traditionally are a symbol denoting membership of the Yakuza (Japanese organised crime network), they have also been quite popular among young Japanese for some years now. A tattooed arm, if accompanied by a clenched fist or two fingers raised in anger, may well provoke concern amongst the people of Osaka and Sapporo. But I confidently predict that no English fan will be mistaken for Kenji 'killer whale' Watanabe from Shizuoka this summer. Just for the record, if any English fan does want to indulge in a bit of oriental gangster chic, then some oversized sunglasses, a pair of immense sideburns, excessive jewellery, a missing finger and a late 80s shell suit will complete the Yakuza look. Any Beat Takeshi crime film or Gazza's Fog on the Tyne video would be a good point of reference.
