From then on, this debut is an amalgam of synth-funk on a spin cycle and new romantic pop played with neu-rave impatience. At first, it's surreal, dance-floor filling fun, with singer Malthe Fischer taking euro politics to task while channeling David Bowie on The Shock of the Real and sneering \"It is time to decide why trees are making fun of me\" on The Only Undead. But too often, Oh No Ono sound like Bis and novelty dance act Aqua competing in cartoon caper Wacky Races. The colourful melodies, addictive choruses and soft harmonies show promise, but the relentless slap bass and sugar-coated insanity scream Just Say No."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
