Each day, a different collection on Art UK will set the questions. Today, our questions are set by the Ulster Museum, Belfast, Northern Ireland. The Ulster Museum has some of the finest Irish art found anywhere in the world. During the 1920s, the museum\u2019s collecting practice expanded its focus to the contemporary British school. Since then, the collection has grown to encompass not just the work of Irish painters but also British, European and American artists, both historical and contemporary. You can see art from the Ulster Museum on Art UK here. Find out more on the Ulster Museum website here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
