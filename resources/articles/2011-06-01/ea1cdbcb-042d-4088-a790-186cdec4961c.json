The idea soon appealed to guitarists rendered almost inaudible in big swing bands, but six years passed before a jazz guitarist, George Barnes, first recorded on a Spanish instrument with magnetic pick-ups in 1938. The next year 23-year-old guitarist Charlie Christian joined Benny Goodman's hit-making big band playing the ground-breaking Gibson ES-150. Christian's stunning solos were phrased like sax lines, making the guitar a front-line jazz instrument. In 1940, Christian joined the coterie that created bebop, but he died of TB aged only 25."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
