The Europe minister, Denis MacShane, was forced to tone down a speech in his Rotherham constituency last week, in which he had been planning to urge British Muslims to choose between the \"British way\" of democratic dialogue and the way of Islamic terrorism. The speech, which was distributed by his office in advance, sparked outrage and Mr MacShane amended the offending passage before delivering it last Friday evening, adding remarks to welcome the condemnation of terrorism by British Muslim leaders. But Rotherham councillor Jahangir Akhtar today said the changes were not enough for some Muslims in the constituency, who wanted action against the MP. And a member of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee said he would use the body's next meeting to raise concerns about the minister's comments, which he said would give comfort to racist groups like the British National party. Mr MacShane today issued a statement insisting he had meant no offence and regretted any \"misunderstandings\". Coun Akhtar told BBC Radio 4's World at One: \"People are very much offended that their patriotism has been called into question. The most devastating thing, we feel, that is implied is that in some way we should choose between the British democratic system of dialogue and the terrorism perpetrated by so-called Muslim groups. \"There are over 170 British Muslim councillors who believe in our democratic system that we have in Britain. \"We want the NEC to investigate these comments that our MP has made and if there is any action to be taken they should take it, because in this current climate of Islamophobia throughout the world, we think it is very unhealthy that a minister in such a senior position should make these comments.\" NEC member Shahid Malik told the programme: \"It is certainly something I will be raising with the NEC and my NEC colleagues would expect me to do so. \"Undoubtedly, British Muslims have felt frustrated, angry, irritated and very upset by the comments, because clearly they are not terrorists and they don't subscribe to terrorism. \"At the same time, I have no doubt that far right-wing groups such as the BNP and National Front will draw much comfort from this and use it in their future rhetoric.\" Mr Malik said that Mr MacShane would have to seek to put the record straight with his constituents but added that he did not believe the incident put his position in question. In a statement, Mr MacShane said: \"I regret any misunderstandings that may have arisen following a speech I made at a Rotherham Labour Party meeting. I meant no offence and I regret any wrong impression made by press reports. \"Labour party members including Muslim councillors supported my remarks, which welcomed condemnation of terrorism by Muslim leaders locally and nationally. I work hard for Muslim families and friends in Rotherham and I am happy to discuss the need for a united front on terrorism with any of my constituents or colleagues in the Labour party.\" Mr MacShane also writes a regular online diary for Guardian Unlimited. In the speech he delivered last Friday, Mr MacShane said elected and community leaders of British Muslims had to make a choice. \"It is the democratic, rule-of-law, if you like the British, American or Turkish way, based on political dialogue and non-violent protest like the one in London yesterday. Or it is the way of the terrorist against which the whole democratic world is uniting,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
