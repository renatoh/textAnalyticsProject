Greenwood and Phil Foden were left out of last month\u2019s internationals after they invited two women into England\u2019s hotel in Iceland in September and were sent home. Foden\u2019s selection for a triple-header against the Republic of Ireland, Belgium and Iceland that starts on 12 November had been anticipated and Greenwood\u2019s involvement looks more likely in the absence of Ings. The Southampton striker would have kept his place in the England squad after scoring against Wales last month and with five Premier League goals this season. Southgate will select Harry Kane and Dominic Calvert-Lewin as two of his centre-forward and his other options there are Greenwood, Tammy Abraham and Callum Wilson. Southgate has kept the door open for Jamie Vardy to return from international retirement but such a move is not expected at this stage. Other forwards named in the squad are likely to include Marcus Rashford, Raheem Sterling and Jadon Sancho. Ings was hurt against Aston Villa last Sunday and will have an operation. \u201cIt looks as though Danny is out for four to six weeks,\u201d Southampton\u2019s manager, Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl, said. \u201cHe will have small surgery tomorrow morning. It could be worse but he is out and this is not good news for us. \u201cThe scan was not too bad and showed an issue with his meniscus. He started running yesterday, jogging on the pitch, but the knee was swollen and he had pain. We decided to stop so it didn\u2019t get worse because that doesn\u2019t make sense. It was clear that we had to take another look. \u201cWe decided to go for the surgery because it is the safest way to have a four-to-six-week break only. It is a small surgery but a necessary one and hopefully it doesn\u2019t get worse.\u201d England have Nations League games in Belgium (15 November) and at home to Iceland (18 November) after the 12 November friendly at Wembley against the Republic of Ireland. Southgate must decide whether to include Reece James given that the Chelsea right-back will serve a two-match Nations League ban following his sending-off for dissent in last month\u2019s 1-0 defeat by Denmark. Harry Maguire is suspended for one game in that competition for his red card for two bookings in the same match. Kalvin Phillips is unavailable because of a shoulder injury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
