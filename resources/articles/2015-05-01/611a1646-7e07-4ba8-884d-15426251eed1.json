That\u2019s not what it looks like from where I live", "bodyText": "The phrase \u201cone nation\u201d occurs in several places in last Sunday\u2019s Observer, particularly in John Redwood\u2019s article (\u201cThe PM has his party\u2019s support. But on Europe and Scotland, it may be best to get Labour\u2019s too\u201d, Comment). I don\u2019t get the feeling we are one nation any more. The majority of Scots appear to want to live in a European country with a publicly provided infrastructure and welfare state, whereas the south east of England hankers after the American model, with everything put out to tender and lots of choice. An Apollo astronaut once said how sobering it was to realise he sat on top of a billion dollars of hardware, all supplied by the lowest bidder. Where I live in Yorkshire, we seem caught in a bind, perhaps preferring the Scots\u2019 view of society, yet shackled to the Thatcherite south east \u2013 not just Yorkshire, but a whole swath of northern England. If we are serious about constitutional reform, we should raise the question of moving the border. Another slant on this one-nation figment can be obtained by clicking on to Wikipedia and typing in \u201cBullingdon Club\u201d. As we contemplate the Balkanisation of the UK and EU, we should remember Yugoslavia. David Holdsworth Settle The result of the general election does not reflect the wishes of the electors. The first-past-the-post system is unfit for purpose. Take my constituency, Bristol West. The winning party polled 22,900 votes \u2013 35.66% of votes cast. The runner-up won a respectable 17,227 votes (26.83%), the third 12,103 (18.85%) and the fourth 9,752 (15.19%). At a stroke, the \u201closing\u201d 39,082 votes were thrown away and played no part in the national result. They were rubbished in favour of the myth that the \u201cwinner\u201d represents constituents\u2019 views. This is no isolated case, either: 46 other \u201cwins\u201d were claimed with only 30-39% of the votes; and 297 \u201cwinners\u201d failed to achieve half the votes in their constituencies (46% of constituencies). Despite the supposed virtues of the constituency-based MP, if the system cannot deliver MPs representing at least half their voters it is time it was ditched. There is no shortage of other viable systems that include the retention of constituency representatives. Michael Stanley Bristol There is much I can agree with in the comments of Tony Blair and Peter Mandelson about the need for Labour to attract the aspirational voters of England and I accept there were deficiencies in our campaign (\u201cBlair tells Labour: return to centre ground to win again\u201d, News). But their prescriptions are too simplistic, given our greatest defeat was in Scotland where the anti-austerity message appealed far beyond the nationalist camp. Perhaps they also ought to consider the effect \u2013 on voters and public trust in politicians \u2013 of their policies of taking us into the war in Iraq and courting the bankers. Experience on the doorstep indicates the public has a longer memory than we sometimes imagine. Joan Ruddock DBE Former MP for Lewisham Deptford London SE3 Will Hutton gives credit to Tony Blair for taking \u201cthe winning of and holding power as political objective number one\u201d (\u201cNeither right nor left is able to reach the whole nation\u201d, Comment). And yet he damns the Lib Dems for betraying the party\u2019s \u201cpurported values in coalition\u201d. Should parties sacrifice power to stick to principles or should winning be the main objective, even if it means betraying principles? It can\u2019t be both.
