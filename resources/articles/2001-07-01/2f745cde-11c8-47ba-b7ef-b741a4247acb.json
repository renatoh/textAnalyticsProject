However Lance Armstrong, Jan Ullrich and Joseba Beloki, last year's top three, also missed the cut, as did the entire field apart from 14 riders in the day's winning escape, according to the president of the Tour's disciplinary committee, Giovanni Meraviglia. The Tour's rules state that any rider finishing 10% slower than the stage winner when the average speed is above 44km-per hour should be disqualified. Fortunately, and unsurprisingly, they were all permitted to stay in the race as the rules allow \"exceptional circumstances\". And this was an exceptional stage. Millar described it as \"horrific\" but for the first time this Tour the entire field shared his suffering. They finished chilled and sodden to a man after almost six hours in the rain, which varied through the day from heavy to torrential. Enveloped in flapping capes, by the end their eyes were red-lidded in grit-speckled, haggard faces, their limbs goose-pimpled and tetanis\u00e9s , as French slang puts it: paralysed by cold. Horrific it certainly was, but things may be looking up for the lone British rider, although he remains in last place, the first Briton since Paul Sherwen in 1985 to wear the \"red lantern\". Millar finished in the main pack yesterday, something he has not managed since his crash in the opening time trial nine days ago and on Saturday, conscious of the need to make a show on Bastille Day for his Cofidis team, he was one of a three-rider group that held the lead to the top of the first climb. \"It's picking up a bit, I'm definitely feeling a bit better,\" he said. \"The first five days I was suffering but fortunately they took it a bit easier today. Every other day has been balls to the wall.\" Friday's leg to Strasbourg, when he finished last but one was, he says, \"one of the worst days I've ever had on the bike. Any other time I would have packed it in. I couldn't hold on to the field even on the small climbs. I honestly thought I was out of it. If I hadn't had another rider, Bart Leysen, with me, I would have been eliminated.\" \"All he can do is take it day by day,\" said his manager Bernard Quilfen yesterday. \"When you are going through what he is going through the only solution is to wait for things to get better, and he is getting better now, in his state of mind, and in his physical form.\" Quilfen, who has been in cycling for over a quarter of a century, believes, rather poetically, that what the French call caract\u00e8re - fighting spirit - is \"forged through suffering\". \"He's had a bad week, but it will be of service in future,\" said Quilfen. \"It strengthens a cyclist's character. When you've experienced what David has this week, you will come out of it a stronger person.\" With yesterday's sodden six hours coming on top of a week of pain, Millar will end up with caract\u00e8re, as well as sweat, oozing from every pore. Yesterday's great escape began three miles from the start and its 14 participants huddled together, as if for warmth, as the Tour headed south, initially a stone's throw across the Rhine from Germany and finally running parallel to the border with Switzerland. Elegant chalets and fields full of docile cows and watch-making museums reflected the Swiss tone; the weather left its mark in deep puddles, overflowing gutters and swollen rivers. With their minds merely on getting through the day, the peloton let the 14 upstarts squelch away to a lead of over half an hour, unprecedented for any break in the post-war years, which meant the main bunch had not reached the banner marking 25km (15 miles) to go when Dekker outsprinted the Spaniard Aitor Gonzalez, and the Belgians Servais Knaven, and Marc Wauters. While Dekker added a sodden victory to his three stage wins of last year, there were major ramifications as the result transformed the overall standings. The yellow jersey, which switched on Saturday from Stuart O'Grady to his German team-mate Jens Voigt, is now back on the shoulders of the Australian, who was one of the 14. O'Grady also relieved Erik Zabel of the points leader's green jersey, his long-term objective here. The reason the peloton took so little interest was not merely down to the weather: of the 14 escapees, only one, Millar's Kazakh team-mate Andrei Kivilev, has any reputation as a man who can climb mountains; he now leads Lance Armstrong and the other favourites by some 13 minutes, which could be enough to put him in the yellow jersey if he can hang on tomorrow at l'Alpe d'Huez. All riders have their own ways of coping with conditions like yesterday's and Dekker's sounded the wisest. \"When you were in the break it was better than being in the peloton,\" he said, and this is indeed the case. Fourteen men throw less spray in the eyes than 180, it is easier to skid around trafffic islands and over slippery zebra crossings in a small group, and there is less danger of hitting the brakes too hard and losing control. Yesterday, however, being in the break had one overwhelming advantage, according to the Dutchman: \"It was half an hour shorter.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
