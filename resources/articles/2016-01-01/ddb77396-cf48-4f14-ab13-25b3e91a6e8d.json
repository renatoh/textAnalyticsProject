Eastleigh\u2019s best chance of an upset might have been in the original game at their own ground, when Neil Lennon suggested their bog of a pitch helped them gain a draw, although the National League side gave a great account of themselves here, not only taking a first-half lead but pegging Bolton back to 2-2 at the interval after the home side scored two quick goals at the end of the first half. If Lennon\u2019s rather ungenerous comments about the state of the Eastleigh pitch in the first game were meant to imply the National League side might not be able to manage on a truer surface, the visitors took just 11 minutes to prove otherwise. Andy Drury found Joe Partington in space on the right with a perfectly weighted diagonal ball, and although he still had Dean Moxey to beat he did so with ease, stepping elegantly inside the full-back before sending a shot into Paul Rachubka\u2019s far corner. Bolton tried to fight back, but although Liam Trotter was well placed for a shot on goal midway through the first half his first touch let him down and Eastleigh breathed again. As the half-hour stage approached, Eastleigh had settled down and were comfortably holding their own, helped it must be said by some indecisive and untidy home passing. When Moxey tried a training ground move from a corner, passing the ball flat to the back of the area instead of sending over a cross, the Eastleigh defence read it straightaway and calmly stepped out to intercept and clear the ball upfield. The visitors did rather better than that from open play on their next attack, once again getting behind the Bolton defence on the right but failing to find a man in the middle until Jai Reason eventually saw a shot blocked. It all looked quite promising as the interval approached, with Eastleigh sensibly leaving just James Constable upfield most of the time and concentrating on keeping two lines of defence for Bolton to break through, but the underdogs were caught out seven minutes from the break when Josh Vela crossed from the right. Gary Madine found enough space near the penalty spot to bring the ball down and turn for a shot, and from then on the outcome was a formality. For all their good work in the opening period Eastleigh suddenly found themselves trailing as Bolton hit them with a suckerpunch almost immediately after the equaliser. Only a fingertip Ross Flitney save prevented Wellington Silva scoring direct from a free-kick two minutes after the restart, Eastleigh never quite managed to scramble the ball away and Moxey put the Championship side in front with a shot through a crowded area. Yet Eastleigh deserved to turn around level, and as the first half went into stoppage time they equalised. Bolton were caught with too many men too far forward, Rachubka was slow to come off his line as Reason slid a pass through for Kaid Mohamed to finish, and the winger confidently found the target. Liam Feeney hit the side netting at the start of the second half when he might have done better after Trotter had set up a promising situation by winning the ball in Eastleigh\u2019s half. Madine was better placed but was not found quickly enough. Wellington sent a shot wide on the left when crossing to the middle might have been a better option as Bolton began to pin their opponents back. Just before the hour they scored the decisive goal, Darren Pratley burying a low shot beyond Flitney after being found in the area by substitute Shola Ameobi. The goal had been coming, Pratley had headed over the bar just a few minutes earlier. The former Newcastle striker Ameobi will be leaving Bolton soon as the club can no longer afford his contract. Perhaps his assist could be considered a parting gift. Wellington should have added a fourth goal after beating almost all of the Eastleigh defence then managing to miss the target from close range, although he nearly made amends by slipping Ameobi through moments later. He missed the target too, although with Eastleigh visibly tiring Bolton were able to hang on. Their next game, at home to MK Dons in the league, could define the rest of what is proving a trying season. \u201cWe have to win, simple as that,\u201d Lennon said. \u201cIt is a massive game for us.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
