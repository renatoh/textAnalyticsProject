Adam Marshall, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, accused the foreign secretary of destabilising the government and warned that Cabinet division was undermining economic confidence. Meanwhile, some Tory MPs have texted him demanding that he resign as foreign secretary. Marshall said there was growing impatience with \u201cdivision and disorganisation at the heart of the party of government\u201d particularly with public disagreements on Brexit. Some senior members of the party gave their views publicly and sources told the Guardian that backbench MPs had sent Johnson text messages urging him to resign because of what they view as his disloyalty to the prime minister. The damaging intervention came as Theresa May attempted to relaunch her premiership during the four-day event in Manchester. The party tried to keep the focus on policy with a series of significant announcements, including: \u2022 A pitch from Theresa May to young people promising to freeze tuition fees while ministers look again at the system. \u2022 Plans for a \u00a310bn help-to-buy scheme from the communities secretary, Sajid Javid. \u2022 A \u00a3300m package from the chancellor, Phillip Hammond, to link HS2 up to cities not included on the route as part of boosting the Northern Powerhouse But tensions at the top of the party continued to bubble after Johnson gave an interview to the Sun newspaper setting out his four red lines for Brexit negotiations after his previous 4,200 word article on the subject in the Telegraph led to damaging headlines before May\u2019s critical speech in Florence last month. One cabinet minister said: \u201cBoris hasn\u2019t won any friends on the backbenches.\u201d The Conservative MP, Anna Soubry, who has been fighting for a soft Brexit, tweeted on Saturday that he \u201cmust grow up or go\u201d. On Sunday, she said: \u201cOrdinary members and ordinary people going about their lives are fed up to the back teeth of this squabbling. The source of it is Boris Johnson and that is why I put out the tweet.\u201d But others defended the foreign secretary, with the Brexit-supporting MP Anne-Marie Trevelyan arguing that most people outside London wanted the government to get on with the process however they voted in the referendum. \u201cAs far as I\u2019m concerned, Boris was only reiterating that same message that prime minister has stated regularly,\u201d she said, arguing that Brexiters accepted the need for transition but wanted to make sure the process did not stall. The BCC\u2019s Marshall said companies wanted a \u201ccomprehensive transition period, lasting at least three years\u201d in direct contrast to Johnson. He added that they had made it \u201cvery clear that they expect competence and coherence from ministers as we move into a critical period for the economy\u201d. The warnings and counter-claims came as Ruth Davidson, the leader of the Scottish Conservatives, attacked the \u201cTory psychodrama\u201d surrounding speculation over May\u2019s leadership and ruled out standing as a candidate herself. Critics believe that Johnson is attempting to position himself as a future Tory leader, but allies insisted that he simply wanted to ensure that the Brexit vote \u2013 for which he was seen as the torchbearer \u2013 was fulfilled. One claimed that Johnson had been \u201cplaced in a box\u201d but was entitled to speak out as foreign secretary and insisted that his red lines were close to actual government policy. Despite the controversy, Johnson was given a hero\u2019s welcome at fringe events. At thepacked Friends of Cyprus event, members mobbed the foreign secretary for handshakes and selfies after a short speech where he riffed that Marks &amp; Spencers opening in the Cypriot capital Nicosia meant you could buy \u201cyour knickers here,\u201d ignoring recent claims that his demeanour has been undiplomatic. Asked by reporters as he left whether he was \u201ccausing trouble for the prime minister,\u201d he ducked out of the room, but one audience member voiced loud disapproval at the press, who he said were giving Johnson \u201ca hard time\u201d. Asked at another event if he was being loyal, he replied: \u201cYes, of course, yes\u201d. No 10 sources claimed that his interview had not caused much anger, but were frustrated to see so much focus once again on Johnson\u2019s views on Brexit. May was forced to insist on BBC1\u2019s Andrew Marr Show that the cabinet was united and she would be leader \u201cfor the long term\u201d but refused to say whether Johnson was \u201cunsackable\u201d. \u201cWhat I have is a cabinet united in the mission of this government and that is what you will see this week and agreed on the approach we take in Florence,\u201d she said. \u201cBoris is absolutely behind the Florence speech. You\u2019ve seen what he is saying.\u201d She dodged a question on whether she would resign if she did not manage to get a Brexit deal and earlier told the Sunday Telegraph that she wanted to lead the party into the next election. \u201cI will fight the next election,\u201d she told the newspaper. \u201cI\u2019m not a quitter.\u201d At a fringe event on Sunday evening, Johnson\u2019s cabinet colleague and ally, Michael Gove, insisted Johnson was speaking \u201cfrom the heart\u201d over Brexit. Gove, the environment secretary, said: \u201cIt\u2019s something about which he feels deeply and passionately. When we saw his article in the Daily Telegraph the other day, no one could have expressed themselves in this way unless it came from the heart. \u201cI think any attempt to find any other motivation other than just a commitment to making an optimistic case for Britain outside the European Union is barking up the wrong tree.\u201d However, Damian Green, the first secretary of state, said he \u201cabsolutely\u201d thought May should be leader for another election and implicitly rebuked Johnson for going off message. He told the BBC\u2019s Pienaar\u2019s Politics: \u201cI am happy to make a general point that it is understandable that any group of politicians faced with a big issue will have a range of views. It is extremely sensible when you are in government to express those views in private rather than public. \u201cIt\u2019s advice for everyone. It\u2019s advice for all my colleagues at all times, that if you feel strongly about something then make your pitch in private. And then, when the government has come to a collective decision, stick to it. \u201cWe know that Boris likes giving interviews and writing articles, but the government\u2019s policy is absolutely clear; it\u2019s what was in the Florence speech\u201d. David Mundell, the Scottish secretary, was even less diplomatic about the foreign secretary. Asked at a conference fringe event how he thought Johnson would go down with young Scottish people if he became leader, Mundell said: \u201cI do recall that Boris Johnson once stood as rector of Edinburgh university. You can look at the results of that.\u201d Johnson, then the shadow higher education secretary, was showered with beer and greeted with chants of \u201cBog off Boris, you top-up Tory\u201d when he visited the university in 2006. He eventually finished a fairly distant third in the race behind Green MSP Mark Ballard and journalist Magnus Linklater, beating only the radical filmmaker John Pilger. May is also facing considerable anger among grassroots activists about the conduct of her election campaign. A string of audience members confronted Graham Brady and Eric Pickles \u2013 the authors of a review into the party\u2019s election efforts \u2013 at a fringe meeting, as they accused the party of not listening to its members, failing to organise properly and refusing to allow local issues to be mentioned on leaflets. Edwina Currie, the former Tory minister, criticised \u201cblithering idiots\u201d in central office of sending her to campaign in Labour areas and waved a conference guide at them showing those at the top of the party were \u201call white men\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
