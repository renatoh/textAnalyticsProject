Her French teacher for the morning was merely gobsmacked. Anne Campbell, one of nine MPs to take advantage of an hour's free tuition in a language of their choice, had unwittingly given the organisers the impression that she could barely string deux mots together. \"She's fluent! I couldn't believe it,\" exclaimed Richard Hennebert. Instead of covering \"bonjour\" and \"comment allez-vous?\", as he was expecting, the Cambridge MP's tutor had found himself nattering away about her house in France as if to a fellow national. \"I just filled in a form saying I'd like to improve my French,\" she said. \"I've had a cottage in France for 30 years and am a bit embarrassed I'm not more fluent.\" Mais non! \"She's very fluent, it's the real French, not the constricted French that people sometimes use,\" her temporary tutor said admiringly. \"People are always a bit shy to admit they know the language.\" Shy or not, the nine who agreed to take part in the Parliamentary Languages Challenge proved bolder than their 605 fellow members surveyed in May during Adult Learners' Week by the National Institute of Adult Continuing Education (Niace). This threw up the interesting nugget that more MPs could communicate in Latin than in Italian or Spanish. On the other hand, MPs emerged as a markedly better and keener body of linguists than the British population as a whole, able to make promises and criticise one another in at least 22 languages. And 4% of them can prattle away in five languages. Fewer than one in 10 felt they could describe themselves as fluent in French, though more than half said they could get their meaning across. As a follow-up to their survey, Niace offered MPs a free taster in their chosen language. Most of the tutors, who offered Danish, Spanish, Catalan, French, Arabic, Portuguese and Punjabi, came from the City Lit adult education institute in central London. While not in the fluent class, Hennebert's second customer of the day, Tory MP Alistair Burt, would certainly be able to make himself understood across the Channel. A quarter of an hour into the session and he had revived the basic directional words and phrases. Any passing French tourist could reliably ask him the way to Victoria Station. Burt was now ready for a version of 20 questions in which he had to give definitions of nouns written on pieces of card and Hennebert had to guess what they were. \"C'est un endroit ou on mange,\" proclaimed the former Conservative spokesman for higher and further education, giving a little smile of pleasure as Hennebert asked in a convincing tone of hesitant enquiry: \"C'est un restaurant?\" Then came a seemingly innocuous question from the tutor. But for a politician, even one seeking to recover O-level French, there can be no such thing. \"Est-ce que le fran\u00e7ais doit \u00eatre obligatoire en \u00e9cole?\" (Should French be obligatory in schools?) The Guardian craned in a little closer. \"En France, oui, en Angleterre, non,\" replied Burt, passing over the chance to please his teacher in favour of sticking to the party line. At a neighbouring table, John Randall, Tory MP for Uxbridge and vice- chair of the Punjabis in Britain All Party Parliamentary Group, was being given a tour through the Punjabi alphabet by Surinder Pal Singh. Randall, possibly the only MP to boast a degree in Serbo-Croat, was not only going to fulfil his wish to say hello to a good proportion of his constituents in their mother tongue, there was a good chance he was going to be able to write it as well. Tom Brake, the Liberal Democrat spokesman on international development, was learning that 200 million people speak Portuguese. While it would be an overstatement to say that an hour later he had pushed the tally up to 200 million and one, he was certainly making a decent stab at conversation. If the pressure was on anybody, it was on Martin Linton, a former Guardian journalist turned Labour MP for Battersea. Among the 122 MPs who replied to the Niace survey he emerged as the Commons' champion linguist, owning up to six languages. \"I've always wanted to learn Spanish and have never got my head around it,\" he told his tutor, Natalia Ribas Pueyo. \"Whenever I try to speak the language, French or Italian comes into my head.\" Perhaps this is why he has restricted his visits to Spain to weekends. \"You should never go to a country for more than a week without having done them the courtesy of learning a bit of their language.\" In which case, Ribas Pueyo deserves some commission from the Spanish tourist board. Well within his allotted hour, the honourable member for Battersea was speaking enough Spanish to justify two weeks on the Costa Brava."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
