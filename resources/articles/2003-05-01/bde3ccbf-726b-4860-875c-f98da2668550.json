The press tent has been tripled in size. But it is doubtful if this latest manifestation of sporting man v woman has gained more attention than an event that took place near London almost a century ago. It was a challenge match, to be played over 72 holes, between Harold Hilton and Cecilia (Cecil) Leitch on October 11 1910, 36 holes at Walton Heath, and October 13, 36 holes at Sunningdale. Hilton had twice won the Open championship as an amateur, and had also won the Amateur, and Cecil, as she was always called, was to win four British Ladies' Amateur championships, five French and one Canadian. They were, respectively, the Tiger Woods and Laura Davies-at-her-best of their day. Phil Pilley, who has done wondrous work in compiling a history of Walton Heath for its centenary, recalls the occasion in loving detail. In the days when amateurism was all, Hilton was a sporting superhero. Leitch was a pioneer when feminism was in its first stirrings - the suffragettes were a year or two away. The challenge came about when Hilton estimated that the difference between a male and female champion was about nine strokes a round when playing off the men's tees and he reckoned on winning when conceding a stroke every other hole. That was enough for Leitch - later to be called \"the first of the Amazons\". She accepted the conditions and on the due date, according to Golf Illustrated, some 4,000 people swarmed all over Walton Heath. They were, said the magazine, \"ignorant and unruly\" and, sure enough, Leitch hit a pram on the very first hole. But she was a good player, no mere token. She had a wide stance, what was called a hard, fast rhythm and was the first woman to hit the ball hard rather than just sweep it away. Indeed, so hard that Bernard Darwin, the man from The Times, recorded that she hit the ball with \"a splendid, firm, snap\" and was able \"to make the ball bite, with fizz, and stop\". That is beyond many women players even today and it was not long before Hilton realised he was in a match. At the end of the first day Leitch missed a four-foot putt on the 36th green that would have seen them all square. Two days later Sunningdale offered rain and strong winds, conditions not ordinarily conducive for women, and Leitch was five down with only 15 to play before she rallied. In fact she rallied to such effect that she won seven of the next nine holes and before Hilton knew what had happened he was shaking hands on the 35th green, a loser by 2&amp;1. \"I was beaten fair and square,\" he said. Someone calculated the number of shots difference in the two scores and, taking account of the concessions, came up with the figure of 36. That of course is exactly what Hilton had calculated - four rounds at nine strokes a round - and was probably enough to mollify wounded male pride."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
