Northampton may have scraped into the last eight as the second-best pool runners-up but a trip to Munster and a similarly daunting semi-final obstacle offer scant reason for optimism. Barring a miracle from the Saints, the Premiership's top seeds will have fallen on stony ground. With the Six Nations less than a fortnight away, European competition has not provided a springboard for Martin Johnson as his England side gather for warm-weather training in Portugal. It will take more than a little Algarve sun to defrost the sense that the Irish and French have the rest of Europe firmly by the throat. For the fifth time in six years the Heineken champions look likely to come from the Celtic League or the Top 14, probably the latter if the semi-final draw is any guide. At least one big French club is guaranteed a home draw in the last four and Munster and Leinster will have to win on foreign soil before they can contemplate the final at the Stade de France on 22 May. There is a soup\u00e7on of solace for the English, in that it is just 12 months since France supplied one quarter-finalist and were idle onlookers after that. The latter stages of this season's Amlin Challenge Cup will also feature three Premiership sides, alhough two of them - Wasps and Gloucester - have been pitted against each other. But despite the passion and desire of Northampton, Leicester and London Irish on the final weekend of pool matches, England's three best-equipped sides managed just one try \u2013 scored by an Australian, Chris Malone \u2013 between them. As with the national team, the killer punch is a lost art. The Premiership is part of the problem. With relegation to worry about and months of hard slog required just to reach the play\u2011offs, it is far more of a marathon than, say, the Magners League. The Top 14 does, admittedly, last even longer but there is a key difference: the richer French clubs are unfettered, for now, by the sort of wage-cap restrictions which restrict their English counterparts. This allows for bigger squads, permitting key figures to take a break every now and again. The counter-argument is that weekly hand-to-hand combat prepares players better for top-level Heineken games than sitting on their backsides. London Irish's head coach, Toby Booth, suggests there are \"a matrix of different factors\", not least the current law interpretations at the breakdown. \"It's certainly not going to help teams who have to play 30-35 games a year,\" he says. \"I don't think it's about the Premiership versus the Top 14 or the Magners; it's more a question of needing to be ambitious. Maybe some [English] teams have been a little conservative.\" There is also the inescapable fact that Ireland have more world-class players than England and that such exceptional individuals are not spread across a dozen teams, as is the case in the Premiership. The Leinster captain, Leo Cullen, says the quality of the Magners League \"has gone up dramatically\" in the past couple of years. \"I've played in England as well,\" he says, of his time with Leicester, \"and the fact there is no relegation in the Magners helps teams to play with real ambition. It's a really competitive league now.\" Michael Cheika, Leinster's coach, rejects Booth's theory that central contracts give Irish teams an advantage: \"Do you prefer players being fresh, or going into your first pool game with 10 players having only played together once? Each system has its benefits and disadvantages. You've just got to roll with the punches.\" Northampton will draw comfort from their determined effort in Limerick on Friday and believe that they can go one better next time. Johnson's England, though, are swimming against the tide. Tomorrow he will confirm at least two additions to his squad, with Leicester's Dan Cole and Worcester's Matt Mullan in line to bolster the front row. Johnson will also confirm inside the next 48 hours whether Steve Borthwick will continue as captain against Wales on 6 February. It is not just a question of personality \u2013 with Tom Croft injured, it seems unlikely Johnson will risk further trouble by dropping his lineout specialist. If Borthwick still merits a starting place, he is the most obvious captain. Wielding the axe would truly represent a sea-change in managerial thinking."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
