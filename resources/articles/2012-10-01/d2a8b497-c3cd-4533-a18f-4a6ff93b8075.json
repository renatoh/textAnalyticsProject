There was more drama in the ninth inning than there was for the first eight innings combined, but the Detroit Tigers managed to hang on to a 2-1 lead, thanks mostly to a strong eight plus inning from Justin Verlander. The Detroit Tigers now have a commanding 3-0 ALCS lead over the New York Yankees. It feels like all signs point to the New York Yankees getting swept tomorrow for the ALCS Game 4, but they will have C.C. Sabbathia going for them, second only to Justin Verlander in guys you want on the mound in an potential elimination game. We'll be liveblogging that game here at 8:00pm EST, not to mention Game 3 of the NLCS between the San Francisco Giants and the St. Louis Cardinals at 4:00pm EST. Hope you'll be there. That will be all from us tonight, however, so thanks to everyone who followed along with us and especially those who chose to contribute. Ciao! For how long does Leyland stick with Phil Coke here? This is starting to bring up bad memories of the 9th inning of ALCS Game 1. Raul Ibanez is up in the ninth inning with a chance to tie or win the game. This is a frightening situation for Detroit considering recent events. The first pitch? Just outside, ball one. Think these hitters are glad to not be facing Verlander anymore? Nick Swisher is on-deck, he will pinch-hit for Russell Martin if it gets to that. Ibanez takes ball two. I wouldn't give him anything to drive either, Mr. Coke. Ibanez takes a mighty hack at 2-0, everybody knows what he wants to do. 2-1. Coke throws him a fastball out of the zone to see if Ibanez will chase, but it's too far outside. 3-1. Hitter's count on the 9th Inning Home Run Specialist. Ibanez fouls it off. 3-2. The Yankees are down to their last strike for their third straight batter. If they had put together at-bats like this for most of the series they would be the ones about to take a 3-0 series lead. Ibanez fouls off another one. Still 3-2. He swings and misses at a breaking ball and it's all over! The Tigers have won! Jayson Nix is in to run for Teixeira, representing the tying run. Robinson Cano is in to face Phil Coke. Cano takes the first pitch for ball one. Cano just doesn't want to make the last out of the game here, forget ending any hitless streak. Cano takes the next pitch for a ball. Raul Ibanez is on deck, remember. The Tigers do NOT want to see him. Coke throws Cano a strike. 2-1. Cano fouls the next one to play, the rain is falling and the Yankees are again down to their finally strike. Holy crap is it LOOOOOOUD in Comerica. Coke gets the sign. 2-2, Cano slaps in a base hit to end a 0-29 hitless streak. There are runners on first and second for the Yankees! We have... DRAMA! Mark Teixeira is out next. He's still representing the tying run remember. Coke starts him off with a strike as well. Teixeira takes the next pitch for a ball, and then fouls one off to fall behind 1-2. The Tigers are just a strike away, and, thankfully, are not facing the St. Louis Cardinals in this situation. Teixeira takes the next pitch. It's a ball. 2-2. The crowd is LOUD. The set and the pitch... and it's just outside. 3-2. The crowd is loud AND mad now. Full count, the struggling Cano on deck. Teixeira hits the next one foul. Pitcher and hitter do this again. Coke takes a sign form Avila. Teixeira hits a base hit to keep the Yankees alive! Ichiro takes a strike. 0-1. The crowd is rowdy, they sense the finish line. Ichiro hits a bouncing ball to Infante on the next pitch, and the Tigers are one out away from taking a 3-0 lead in the ALCS. Jim Leyland wants Coke to finish up this game. I know the feeling. Ahem, I of course am referring to lefthander Phil Coke, who is apparently basically the Tigers' closer this postseason even if Jim Leyland will never call him that. He's here to face Ichiro. Leyland comes out to talk with Verlander and he... leaves him in? Did I mention that it's the ninth anniversary of the game where Grady Little left Pedro Martinez in to face the Yankees in the ALCS? I'm just going to bring up that factoid. The first pitch to Brett Gardner? A strike. The crowd, buoyed by Leyland's decision, cheers this one loudly. Gardner takes a ball, 1-1, and then fouls one off, 1-2. Gardner is following Nunez's lead, fouling off pitches and either waiting for a mistake or trying to get him out of this game. Gardner takes the next pitch. 2-2. Verlander's at 129. Nobody is out, nobody is on. Gardner fouls off yet another pitch. He's still throwing gas at 98 mph. Gardner hits another one foul. Gardner might be ending Verlander's complete game chances in this at-bat. Gardner finally hits a grounder back to Verlander, who finishes the play, and that will be it for Verlander who receives the loudest ovation of the night. What a job from Verlander. I say that every start it seems, but it's true. HOME RUN! Eduardo Nunez is out, and he falls behind 0-2 before I can even figure out who is hitting. The crowd is noisy-as-heck, like exactly how loud New Yankee Stadium wasn't (except for the booing). Verlander's 0-2 pitch is in the dirt. 1-2. Nunez laces the next one foul into the seats, oof hope that didn't hit anybody. Still a 1-2 count, Nunez fouls off another one. Just keep making him throw pitches, he's at 120. Leyland can't let him pitch into infinity. Nunez hits another screaming liner that just goes foul. Verladner throws another ball, I wonder if those line drives are a sign that he's fading a bit here. Nunez swings at 2-2, fouling off another one, a 99 mph fastball. Just a great, great at-bat from Nunez here. The Yankees want to see the bullpen right here. Nunez hammers a hanging breaking ball that Dirks can't catch it The crowd is stunned! The bad news for the Yankees? Justin Verlander is out to start the ninth inning. The other bad news for the Yankees? They're going to need to bring in some baserunners if they hope to get to Raul Ibanez. So yeah. The New York Yankees want Joba Chamberlain in this game. Why? I have no clue. We are on full midges alert here in Michigan. Omar Infante hits a flyball off him, but like most flyballs this evening that one's not going out. It's just an out. Leyland has his bullpen up just in case, I imagine he doesn't want to wait too long for going to it after the decision not to bring in Octavio Dotel in Game 1. Let's see how he plays the top of the ninth inning, shall we? It's raining now in Detroit. The last thing anybody wants is a rain out, except maybe the Yankees since that seems to be the only way they could get Verlander out of the game. Boone Logan is still in the game, because why mess with something that's been working, and gets Peralta to line out to Gardner who makes a nifty play in the outfield to rob him of a hit. Gardner then makes another catch on an Avila liner and that will do it for Logan. Girardi wants a pitching change, but fantastic effort by Logan to keep the Yankees in this one. The Kirkby Perspective: Quake in Maine, was to keep us all awake, where are the aftershocks New York Yankees? It seems that only Earthquake Valverde was enough to awaken these Yankees bats. Speaking of... That's pretty much the Tigers' plan every night. It's a neat strategy that only really works if you have Verlander. Curtis Granderson hits a pop-up to Peralta to end the inning. Wow, maybe Verlander will be back for the ninth. The Tigers faithful give him a standing ovation just in case they don't get another chance. Meanwhile, Russell Martin is getting treatment on his hand in the dugout. That's more wonderful news for New York, isn't it? Eric Chavez comes out next, he hits a high flyball to Austin Jackson for the second out of the inning. Just what the Justin ordered. My question: If and when Detroit manager Jim Leyland takes out Verlander, do the Yankees bring Alex Rodriguez and Nick Swisher out to pinch-hit? I have to imagine we'll see at least one of them, presumably A-Rod. Justin Verlander, I can't believe this is happening, is out for the eighth inning. I'm shocked, SHOCKED... He's looking for a quick inning. I can't see him back for the ninth regardless. Here comes Russell \"Goodfella\" Martin. Verlander gets a gift strike call at 2-1 to even it up, throws a ball at 2-2 to make it a full count, before getting Martin to ground out to Cabrera for the fist out of the inning. Andy Dirks is here, it really does feel like the Tigers would like to grab an insurance run here. I know, I know, that's FOX level analysis but I don't see Verlander throwing a complete game and the Detroit bullpen is a huge question mark. (I mean they don't even have a closer at the moment.) Dirks flies out to Gardner, and Logan does some pretty good job out of the bullpen for someone used to short outings. Boone Logan stays in to actually pitch to Delmon Young this time around, with one out and nobody on-base. I'm a little surprised that Logan is still pitching here, but he gets Young to strike out. If they can get the bat in Raul Ibanez's hands in the ninth inning, they probably have a chance. Right now? Right now they seem overmatched. Up pitching for the Yankees? It's Boone Logan finally facing Prince Fielder as Girardi was waiting for this entire time. LOOGan in a lefty-on-lefty matchup gets ahead 0-2, but then misses with two straight out-of-the-zone, maybe hoping for Prince Fielder to go fishing. Fielding fouls off the next pitch into the seats, and then pops up to the shallow outfield, after some wind-aided confusion, Cano manages to haul it in for Ichiro. A note from Benjamin Estes: It's good to know that there will never be a change in baseball commentators aversion to statistics. \"You'd think that 95% of the time with the bases loaded Cabrera would drive in the runs,\" sez someone on TBS. Well, he actually had a .273 average this year, which means it's more like 27%. But whatever. TBS baseball coverage exists only to make the Fox baseball coverage seem slightly more competent. There's certainly a Presidential Debate comparison to make here as well. The Night Tripper can even make this chestnut sound good. Raul Ibanez is out to see if he could tie the game, but it's not the ninth inning so his chances are very slim. Verlander gets him to fall behind a 1-2 with a masterful curveball in the zone. Ibanez fouls the next one off to keep the at-bat, the inning, alive. Ibanez gets a piece of the catcher on a swing, after a quick check up from Leyland, it seems that he's okay. Ibanez takes a pitch outside. 2-2. Ibanez then hits a wicked line drive right to Prince Fielder who takes care of it. That's seventh straight shutout innings for Verlander, or as he calls it: Just another day at the office. Robinson Cano, zero-for-eternity, is up next for the Yankees. I mean, this can't continue right? He's going to have to make up for that sometime right? Verlander gets ahead of the slumping second baseman, 1-2. This is exactly when Cano could shock the world right? A game-tying home run right here, right, right? At least an RBI double. Cano fouls off a 1-2 fastball. And at 1-2, he foul-tips a ball that Avila hangs onto for the second out. No such luck this time out. On the Tigers' squander the previous inning: The table is set for Mark Teixeira, who hits yet another flyball here which is just a mistake, the wind pushes it down and Dirks corrals it for the first out of the game. As a music geek, I'm totally into both, although it would be better if hitters and closer were way more original. How about some Velvet Underground, Kool Keith, Ornette Coleman or DJ Shadow? \"Mojo Magazine\" should be in charge of such things. Justin Verlander, and this is unprecedented, is up to start the seventh inning. He's here to face Ichiro, the one dude has been able to do anything against the MLB's most difficult ace to hit. Verlander falls behind Ichiro 3-0, who takes a strike, and then gets his (and New York's) second hit of the game. Roger Kirkby follows up: This system left the AL, and in the case of the Yankees fighting The O's for the division, no room to rest up. MLB Clusterslappydoodle. The Yankees had plenty of time to rest, did you see the lineups that Bobby Valentine wrote up for them at the end of the series? Every game against the Red Sox the last few weeks of September was a rest day. So, it's Boone Logan against Miguel Cabrera with the bases loaded and one out. This has a recipe for absolute, absolute disaster. But instead he hits the first pitch he sees into a double-play. Wow! That was... That was not the outcome I was expecting there. Odd bringing in Boone Logan here, since Girardi has been intent on making his left-handed pitchers become Prince Fielder specialists. Also, he's not really that good. But anyway, the Tigers have brought in Avasail Garcia to pinch-hit for Berry. Logan falls behind Berry 3-1, the crowd goes nuts, and Garcia hits a single to load the bases for Miguel Cabrera! Girardi is coming in to replace Eppley, he wants Boone Logan to face Quintin Berry. Roger Kirkby: This game (so far) shows adding another wild card team was a mistake. All teams are now running on fumes. I cannot blame the schedule for the Yankees' offensive struggles, and the Tigers actually look pretty much like the team they were all season, just with Cabrera in what counts as a slump for him: An inconsistent team with a great starting pitcher who got into the playoffs because the Chicago White Sox floundered down the stretch. Omar Infante hits a base hit to get on for the Tigers. There's more action in the Yankees lineup here, presumably for Boone Logan. Back at the plate, \"Hashtag\" Austin Jackson, 1-3 with a single today, slices what would be a base hit but it goes foul. That makes a 2-1 count and Infante might be running here. The 2-1 pitch is a ball, and Infante steals second standing up. The steal ends up not mattering too much, as Eppley walks Jackson on the next pitch. Cody Eppley is out to start the sixth as well. He strikes out Avila on three pitches. One more run here by the Tigers could put this one essentially out of reach. Assuming they don't have to bring in Valverde. It's okay but it's not even the best song on \"Centerfield\". That would be \"Rock and Roll Girls\" and it's not even debatable. Brett Gardner hits a liner right to Verlander. Verlander briefly drops it, but doesn't panic even with the speedy Gardner running, he recovers it and throws to first to end the inning. There really doesn't seem to be a lot of drama in this game. It feels like New York's in a 10-run hole with how badly their offense has been struggling. \"Tonight, the role of Derek Jeter will be played by Eduardo Nunez...\" Jeter's understudy grounds out to first for the second out of the inning. Justin Verlander, and I hope you're seated when you hear this, is back out to start the sixth inning. Curtis Granderson, having the series of nobody's life, takes three straight balls. Anyway he can gets on would be good for New York. Instead he fouls out on 3-1. That won't get him on base at all. If the Yankees want a \"feel\" manager, Grady Little is still available. A baseball team relying on a \"hunch\"/\"feel\" manager is like someone making financial decisions based on what their morning U.S.A. Today Horoscope says. Sidewinding Cody Eppley comes in, because he and Rapada are pretty much a package deal, and he gets Jhonny Peralta to fly out to centerfield to end the inning. Rapada remains in the game still to face Andy Dirks. Nunez makes a diving grab at an almost hit from Dirks and throws to Robinson Cano for a force. Cabrera makes it to third base on the play, but there's now two away. And the bullpen revolving door continues for New York. Rapada is done, two more batters than I expected at least. Clay Rapada is up for some LOOGY work against Prince Fielder. He gets ahead of Fielder 0-2, throws a pitch outside the zone, and then gets him to ground out for the first out of the game. With first base open, the Yankees keep Rapada in the end to intentionally walk Delmon Young with first base open. Not something I would have predicted before this series: They would pitch to Cabrera and Fielder but walk Delmon of all people. Roger Kirkby: Time to start our \"Now That's What I Call Baseball\" 2 CD set of songs for Winners and Losers for the World Series. Winners CD: Who's Sorry Now, by Brenda Lee Losers CD: Daydream Believer, by The Monkees Add your picks to the compilation . Eh, the best song about baseball ever written was \"Bill Lee\" by Warren Zevon, and that's only applicable if the Boston Red Sox or the Montreal Expos are playing. And the Expos are dead. RUN! Chavez is awarded an error on the play, an error that becomes a tad more costly as Berry steals second on Phelp's first pitch to Cabrera (a ball for what it's worth). Cabrera takes a mighty swing on the second pitch, I would aim more for a groundball here than a flyball out if I were him. The atmosphere is not conductive to home runs tonight. Doubles however? Maybe it could be good for those. Cabrera hits a line drive over Granderson's head, Curtis misplays it and Cabrera ends up on second base with a double and Berry scores on the play! And that's it for David Phelps. David Phelps is back out, facing off Quintin Berry to lead off the inning. Berry hits a two-hopper to Chavez, who can't make the play. Berry ends up safe on first. The DH, as always, is a divisive subject. Here's Annerley's thoughts: The original way of playing baseball is the right way. Make the pitchers hit; it keeps them honest. No strutting and fake bravado (yes you Clemens) and brushing hitters back unless you are prepared to take as well as give. I'm trying to think of a good reason to make pitchers hit. That it would increase the possibility of violence would not make my \"good\" list. We're halfway through a regular ninth inning game, which means it's time for me to bug you to bug me. Send the blog your thoughts, comments, predictions, political analogies etc. by emailing them to hunter.felt.freelance@guardiannews.com or tweeting them to @HunterFelt. We'll use them here! Verlander falls behind 0-2 again, this time against Eric Chavez. He only starts off hitter on two-counts. Sam Hollbrook calls a borderline strike on the next pitch and kinda makes up for it by calling the next one a ball. Chavez fouls off the next one and we have a full count here. Chavez pops up to Peralta on the infield and the Yankees cause no further damage. Up next for the Yankees is Ray Li- er, um, Russell Martin. Verlander gets ahead of Martin 0-2. That's more like the Verlander I know, he follows up with a buckling curveball that Martin wisely lays up on. He then hits a flyball to Austin Jackson, who gets a very bad read on the ball in the wind, but turns himself around to make the catch. Anybody have the score in the Presidential Debates? In any case, Justin Verlander is back out for the Tigers. Shocked anyone? He's facing the Legendary Raul Ibanez, who just flies out here because it's not the ninth inning yet. Report on Phil Hughes: A back issue of some sort. No further specifics. it might be irrelevant if the Yankees can't come back in this one. Omar Infante hits a flyball that Ichiro grabs. Just not a great day for hitting those tonight unless your name is Delmon Young. Austin Jackson, at the tail in of a great sophomore season, falls into a 0-2 hole. I'm trying to come up with a different way of saying that, as it's been happening a lot in this series. Jackson shows his increased plate awareness by taking the next two pitches, but he hits a groundball to Nunez. Verlander has had a long wait, but he does have a lead to play around with now. Alex Avila drops in a single and now it's runners on first and second with just one out. Good point, with interleague play going on every day the NL, it's going to be a hassle for teams to continually rejigger their lineups accordingly. They might as well play by the same rules now. Phelps begins, with Dirks on first and Jhonny Peralta in an 0-2 count at the plate. Phelps throws two balls to make it 2-2, hard to blame him for still adjusting here. He didn't expect to be here. The next pitch? Also ball three. Peralta has a full count here. The runners goes on 3-2, but Peralta fouls off the next pitch, a do-over for everyone involved. Peralta hits a long flyball out to Granderson, Dirks retreats to first. We have a new pitcher for the Yankees. They're bringing in David Phelps, a starter during the regular season, to take over for Phil Hughes. They want a few innings out of their reliever here. Jhonny Peralta was in a 0-2 count at the time Hughes has been removed, and Phelps will get as much time as he needs to warm up here. Roger Kirkby has photographic evidence of Russell Martin/Ray Liotta: And here is Russell \"Ray Liota\" Martin meeting Joe Pesci at home plate. http://i824.photobucket.com/albums/zz165/fakebunts/gifs/velez-new.gif Let's please stop with this \"one run is all Verlander needs\" business. Have we learned nothing about leads in this postseason? Hughes walks Andy Dirks, so it's one on and still nobody out. The Tigers gotta think about trying to score him too. Two runs would be a little more comfortable. And there's something wrong with Hughes apparently. The trainers come in and take him out of the game, trailing just by a run in the fourth inning. That's not a good sign for the Yankees at all. HOME RUN! Am I required to make some sort of tortured metaphor comparing the Presidential Debate to the MLB Playoffs? Because I'm just fresh out. At least the MLB Playoffs are decided on the field and not in Public Opinion Polls, although A-Rod is doing poorly at both as of late. Delmon Young starts off the fourth against Hughes, and he continues his mashing against Yankees pitching! He hits a line drive homer and the Tigers take the lead! Teixeira takes ball two, has Verlander lost his command? The Yankees have to take advantage if so. Teixeira pops-up to foul ground. The hefty Cabrera manages to get to the ball for the second out, a play well outside his normal range. (Or even a standard third-baseman's range, let alone an out-of-position first baseman's range.) Cano grounds out to Infante, and that's all there is for the top of the fourth. The presidential debate has begun? Whichever candidate votes to install the DH in the National League gets my vote. PITCHERS DON'T HIT IN 2013! Ichiro works a full count and then gets the first base hit for the Yankees. Gotta tip your cap to the guy, and expect him to be on second base shortly. Gardener, Ichiro (first name only, please, like Cher), Teixeira are up to see if they can do anything against Verlander. Gardner gets ahead in the count 3-1, think he'll have the green light like Fielder? Well, he does, chasing what may be ball four. The Yankees hitters are being aggressive towards Verlander, what's the line about hitting the knuckleball: There are two theories, neither of them work? So it goes with Verlander. Gardner protects himself by fouling out the next few pitches, making Verlander work, but he pops out to the catcher Avila who makes a nice play to convert it into an out. That's not especially nice, but since not being especially nice is kinda my thing. So I'll allow it. I would be really worried about breaking this game open with one swing, and so is Phil Hughes. He falls behind 3-0, afraid to challenge him. Fielder swings at 3-1 but it's yet another good-looking flyball out. Obviously Fielder has the green light there but you're going to want to be sure if you're swinging on 3-0 with two out and two on. In any case, a good job by Phil Hughes there. Miguel Cabrera up, with a man on second and two out, falls into a 0-2 hole. Hughes and Martin get crossed up and a ball goes right through Martin's legs, moving Berry up to third. The 2-2 pitch is outside and it's a full count now on Cabrera. Miggy LASHES a ball just foul. Oof, a scary swing for Hughes that. Man the crowd keeps getting louder! And Hughes throws ball four. It's runners on the corner for Fielder. The speedy Quintin Berry tries to bunt for a base hit but Eric Chavez throws to Teixeira to just get him in time. Jackson does make it to second, but no sacrifice for Berry. Omar Infante, the best ninth-hitter left in the MLB playoffs, hits a routine flyball to the outfield. One down. Austin Jackson is up next for Detroit, and he gets the second base hit of the game off of Hughes. The #AustinJacksonStrikesOut hashtag will have to be used some other time. Eduardo Nunez hits a flyball to Andy Dirks, manning right field. That's 9 up and 9 down for Verlander, on an economical number of pitches. So, the Tigers have that going for them. Which is nice. Curtis Granderson, having a poor postseason just like much of his teammates, swings and misses at a four-seam fastball. Yowsers. This reminds me: Verlander gets better as the game gets later. The thing about Justin Verlander is that I'm sometimes just telling the Tigers' offense to hurry up and get off the field. He's just that incredible to watch, like baseball crack. Baseball Crack begins the 3rd inning by falling 3-1 to Eric Chavez. Chavez gets crossed up on the next pitch, swinging and missing at a probable ball four, and then hits a flyball to Austin Jackson. Catcher Alex Avila finds himself up probably a bit quicker than he expected. Hughes blows a fastball by him on a 2-2 count to end the inning. A fast second inning for both sides. Andy Dirks is lineup for the bottom of the second, he hits a chopper to Cano at second. One down. Jhonny Peralta flies out to Gardner in left on two pitches. That's... That's not bad. Anybody else have any separated at births? Tweet @HunterFelt or email hunter.felt.freelance@guardiannews.com. Avila almost tumbles over a railing to catch a Russell Martin pop-up to end the inning. The old Yankees lineup would be able to see 120 pitches in five innings. Of course, that lineup had Jeter, A-Rod, Nick Swisher and a productive Robinson Cano. It's only the second inning, so I wouldn't expect Raul Ibanez to do much here. Ibanez at least gets Verlander to throw some pitches, laying off some and fouling off others, working a 3-2 count before also grounding out softly to Peralta. Robinson Cano, 0-for-his-last-26, is up for the Yankees against Verlander. You know what I'm saying about \"reverse lock\" theory? This is exactly what I'm talking about. Look for Cano to... Never mind, Cano grounds out to Peralta at short instead. From David Lengel: I was just wondering if you ever get deja, deja, deja, deja, deja vu? Haven't you asked me this before? Game 1 hero Delmon Young gives a 1-1 pitch a good ride, but it rides its way to Ichiro's glove in right. That's one inning in the books. Prince Fielder, hitting cleanup, takes two balls from Phil Hughes. He takes a strike at the knees and then fouls off the next one. It's evened up now at 2-2. The next pitch? A bit inside. It's a full count now and Comerica is raucous. Fielder walks on the next pitch and the Tigers have runners on first and second with two out. Miguel Cabrera, the Triple Crown winner who has been having a fairly quiet postseason, is up next with Berry on first. Cabrera hits a long flyball but it's not long enough, Granderson catches in the outfield. Email from Roger Kirby on last inning: In the multicultural world that is baseball, that inning is known as a one, deux, tres inning I now have an overwhelming desire to listen to Girls Aloud's \"Can't Speak French\". Quintin Berry should strike out, but the umpire calls it a ball, and then swings and gets a base hit on the very next pitch. Funny how that happens. \"Hashtag\" Austin Jackson grounds out to Eric Chavez, playing third for Alex Rodriguez, for the first out of the inning. Mark Teixeira hits a long flyball to quickly put an end to the inning. Verlander just needed nine pitches in the first. This is a bad start for New York, who could benefit from making Justin throw as many pitches as possible and try to get into that Detroit bullpen. Ichiro is up next. Verlander gets him to fall behind 1-2, and, after taking ball two, he becomes Verlander's first strikeout victim of the game. He won't be his last. The Detroit fans are much more into this game than the fans at Yankee Stadium. Justin Verlander's first pitch of the game? A strike, what else? Brett Gardner shows bunt and then just takes it. Gardner then grounds out Infante on pitch two. What no strikeout? Verlander's lost it. The good news for the Yankees? It's the ninth anniversary of Aaron Boone's 2003 ALCS winning home run. They will always have that. I can honestly say that I wouldn't be as a big of a Red Sox fan if it weren't for this moment (and the assist from Grady Little). That's what's odd about this game: It breaks your heart and you fall in love with it more. Just in case you thought that this earthquake thing was one of my comedic \"bits\" here's the skinny: Hope everyone affected is okay. Unconfirmed reports state that Girardi has emerged from the Yankees dugout with a Trollface face. I dunno this seems more like just standard mushrooms. Now, Russell Martin hitting cleanup? That would have been bath salts. Well, coming into this game, it seems like the New York Yankees have no shot at this game, but I'm worried about this being one of those potential Reverse Lock situations, where a game's outlook is so one-sided that the opposite result occurs. It's like the cheesy action movie line \"It's quiet... Too quiet\". Adding to my suspicions, there was an earthquake in New England about 30 minutes ago as I was setting up this preview. That can only be a sign of bad things to come, and what could be worse than an utterly unexpected Yankees win? I\"m going Yankees 4 - Tigers 3, with most of the damage coming against Detroit's bullpen in the eighth and ninth. Of course if Verlander's still pitching the eighth and ninth innings, well New York's done. What are your thoughts? Email them to hunter.felt.freelance@guardiannews.com or tweet @HunterFelt See what I mean? It seems like almost too easy of a prediction to make. It's not like these playoffs have been at all predictable after all. Who knows? Valverde is still available out of then pen, after all. Yesterday, the San Francisco Giants evened up the National League Championship Series by defeating the St. Louis Cardinals 7-1. David Lengel liveblogged that game here. If you need to keep track of the MLB Playoffs, I recommend the Guardian's handy-dandy MLB Playoffs schedule. If the Yankees lose today, however, you may want to just ignore those Games 6 and 7 in the ALCS. What does a New York Yankees lineup look like without Derek Jeter, Alex Rodriguez or Nick Swisher? Fairly ridiculous it turns out: 1. B. Gardner, LF 2. I. Suzuki, RF 3. M. Teixeira, 1B 4. R. Cano, 2B 5. R. Ibanez, DH 6. R. Martin, C 7. E. Chavez, 3B 8. C. Granderson, CF 9. E. Nunez The Detroit Tigers lineup is a tad more, um, recognizable: 1. A. Jackson, CF 2. Q. Berry, LF 3. M. Cabrera, 3B 4. P. Fielder, 1B 5. D. Young, DH 6. A. Dirks, RF 7. J. Peralta, SS 8. A. Avila, C 9. O. Infante, 2B Girardi is officially in \"So crazy it just might work\" mode. Very few people are going to cry about the most successful team in baseball history, the team with the highest payroll in the sport, but if they ever were going to, tonight would be the night. The New York Yankees enter tonight's Game 3 of the American League Championship Series against the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park in a tough spot. The New York Yankees have already dropped the first two games of the series and now go on the road to face Justin Verlander, arguably the best pitcher in the game. The Yankees lost their first game against the Tigers despite tying it up in the ninth inning off of now-reassigned Detroit closer Jose Valverde. In the loss, first ballot Hall of Fame shortstop Derek Jeter suffered a season-ending injury, leaving the team without a captain and a flailing New York offense without one of its key contributors. His loss felt even more devastating than the Yankees dropping the series opener. The next game, thanks to a non-existent offense and one particularly bad blown call, the Yankees lost 3-0, blowing an outstanding outing by starter Hiroki Kuroda pitching on three day's rest for the first time in his U.S. career. The Yankees offense, so potent in the regular season, has sputtered so badly in the postseason that the focus isn't on how the Tigers have been managing to keep New York at bay. The turning point came in the extra innings of Game 1 after Valverde blew a 4 run lead in the most horrifically comic way possible. Detroit could have collapsed then and there, the Washington Nationals coming unglued in NLDS Game 5 against the St. Louis Cardinals comes to mind, but they held on. In Game 2, even when Kuroda was holding them off the basepaths, Detroit's hitters never seemed to worry. The Detroit Tigers are playing with a lot of confidence and tonight they have Justin Verlander, who is good for a complete game shutout every time he's on the mound, while the Yankees have to rely on the still inconsistent Phil Hughes. As far as New York fans go, they won't have Alex Rodriguez or Nick Swisher to kick around anymore, at least not to start the game. The third baseman and the outfielder (if you want to be generous here) are out of Girardi's starting lineup against Verlander. It's a move that would seem absolutely absurd at the start of the MLB Playoffs but now is almost unsurprising. At the very least, with A-Rod and Swisher out this is the most likable Yankees lineup they've put out in eons. (And at least Nick Swisher won't get his feelings hurt today.) Is this a Yankees lineup that is good enough to defeat the Tigers on the road, against the best pitcher alive, and avoid falling into a 0-3 hole in the ALCS?

It's the New York Yankees vs. the Detroit Tigers at Comerica Park. First pitch is scheduled around 8:00pm EST (which means around 8:12pm EST because it's nationally televised) and we'll have the starting lineups shortly."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
