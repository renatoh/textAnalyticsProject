He faces demands for damages of up to \u00a310m. Two and a half years after being cleared in the criminal courts of the manslaughter of Mohammed Raja, a civil high court judgment declared that the multi-millionaire had, indeed, hired \"two violent thugs\" to carry out the killing. The ruling is the latest twist to one of the most embittered strands of litigation currently before the British courts. Mr Van Hoogstraten, 60, who cultivated his reputation as a ruthless, hard man, did not appear yesterday to hear the judgment; he was not even legally represented. Raja, 62, had been suing Mr Van Hoogstraten over a disputed property deal when he answered the doorbell of his home in Sutton, south London, on July 2 1999. He was stabbed and shot by Robert Knapp and David Croke. Both are now serving life imprisonment for murder. Mr Van Hoogstraten was sentenced to 10 years at the Old Bailey in 2002 for manslaughter. His conviction was later quashed by the court of appeal. The original trial judge was found to have misdirected the jury over their need to be certain whether Mr Van Hoogstraten had known that Croke and Knapp were carrying a firearm and had anticipated the consequences of their actions. At the trial Mr Van Hoogstraten had denied employing Knapp in any capacity. Giving judgment yesterday, Mr Justice Lightman said: \"I am satisfied that the recruitment of the two thugs was for the purpose of murdering Mr Raja and not merely frightening or hurting him. The use of two violent thugs armed with a shotgun was more than was needed to frighten or injure him. The second shot was deliberately aimed at killing him. \"Mr Raja had at all times shown himself resilient, ready to resist threats and to complain to the police. Nothing less than murder would rid Mr Van Hoogstraten of this thorn in his flesh.\" The property tycoon had boasted about the murder \"and threatened a repeat if aggravated\". Mr Justice Lightman explained that he reached his conclusion \"on the balance of probabilities\" - the civil law standard of proof - \"and indeed, if it were necessary, beyond reasonable doubt\" - the criminal law standard. By arranging the murder, Mr Van Hoogstraten attempted to obtain settlement of Mr Raja's court action against him on more favourable terms. \"The evidence pointing to this conclusion is overwhelming,\" the judge said. But \"his purpose in murdering Mr Raja has not been achieved because ... Mr Raja's family have been as resilient as was Mr Raja in standing up to Mr Van Hoogstraten\". No new evidence was presented, but previous convictions, which could not be mentioned in the criminal trial, were disclosed. The court heard that Mr Van Hoogstraten had convictions going back to 1956. In 1967 he was jailed for demanding money with menaces and causing criminal damage by explosion - a grenade attack on a rabbi's house. Five years later he was convicted of corrupting a prison officer. Further convictions included forcible entry, conspiracy to cause damage, threatening a barrister in a courtroom, assault and contempt of court. In recent years he has dedicated his energy to building \"Hamilton palace\", a neo-classical, copper-domed mansion near Uckfield in east Sussex, at an estimated cost of \u00a340m. The judge ordered him to pay \u00a3500,000 interim costs within 14 days. In applying for costs, Peter Irvin, counsel for the Raja family, told the judge: \"Your judgment shows Mr Van Hoogstraten to be a cowardly and murderous thug who will stop at nothing to preserve his miser's hoard.\" The Raja family's attempt to extract the money they claim they are owed will return to court on January 11. As well as seeking \"aggravated and exemplary damages\", they have submitted claims for personal injury, post-traumatic stress and financial dependency. Two of Mr Raja's granchildren witnessed the killing. In a statement outside the court, the family said: \"We are very pleased with the court's findings, but it has been a devastating and uphill struggle to get here.\" Patricia Hare, the family's lawyer, said they had been granted an order freezing many of Mr Van Hoogstraten's assets in Britain. She estimated the family's claims to amount to between \u00a38m and \u00a310m. \"The fight for compensation will now go on to the next stage,\" she said. \"[Mr Van Hoogstraten] has had a fair and just hearing. He has had every opportunity ... to have legal representation.\" Mr Van Hoogstraten's former lawyer, Giovanni di Stefano, yesterday confirmed that he no longer represented him. The Metropolitan police said no new evidence had been presented and it had \"no plans at this time\" to reinvestigate the murder. Mr Van Hoogstraten was yesterday holidaying in Zimbabwe, where he has business interests, one account suggested. But staff at the Courtlands hotel in Hove, Sussex, one of his properties, said he had been there during the day. When the Guardian called, he had \"gone out\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
