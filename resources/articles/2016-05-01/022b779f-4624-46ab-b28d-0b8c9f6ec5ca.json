The Panama Papers database lists Turnbull\u2019s historical role with the company more than 20 years ago, which was part of a subsidiary of an Australian publicly listed mining company Star Mining NL. Documents from Mossack Fonseca \u2013 the Panamanian law firm at the centre of the biggest leak in history \u2013 show that the company acted as registered agent for Star Technology Systems during the period of Turnbull\u2019s directorship. A register of the shareholder and directors of Star Technology Systems Limited lists Turnbull as the director of the entity in 1993. His name appears alongside the former New South Wales premier Neville Wran. Both men ceased being involved with the subsidiary company in 1995. Turnbull said there had been \u201cno suggestion of any impropriety whatsoever\u201d when asked about the reports on Thursday. \u201cThe company concerned was a wholly owned subsidiary of a publicly listed Australian company. So an ASX listed company of which Neville Wran and I were both directors for about two years,\u201d he said. \u201cSo it is \u2013 the involvement is very, very well known and as the article [in the Australian Financial Review] acknowledges, there\u2019s no suggestion of any impropriety at all.\u201d A spokesman said Turnbull was not aware of Mossack Fonseca\u2019s role as registered agent of the company. The role of registered agent does not involve any management of the operations of companies but will generally involve companies like Mossack Fonseca dealing with company registry in the British Virgin Islands or other countries. The documents show that a company called Capital Corporate Services Limited, which acted on behalf of Star Technology Systems Limited, was dealing directly with Mossack Fonseca. It is not uncommon for publicly listed Australian companies to maintain subsidiaries in the British Virgin Islands. The Australian Financial Review\u2019s revelation that Turnbull\u2019s name appeared in the database drew criticism from Arthur Sinodinos. \u201cThat is a dead horse being flogged, it\u2019s a 20-year matter, it\u2019s old news \u2013 they just want to run it because they can. The Fin Review on its front page should be debating policy instead of behaving like a downmarket tabloid,\u201d he said on Radio National on Thursday morning. But Labor\u2019s campaign spokeswoman, Penny Wong, called on the prime minister to provide a full explanation of Turnbull\u2019s involvement in the company. \u201cHow many other companies was he involved in which were established in tax havens?\u201d she asked. \u201cHow many other companies was he involved in that Mossack Fonseca was involved with?\u201d \u201cHe should be very upfront in answering questions about what he did or didn\u2019t know about the activities of this company in relation to the Siberian goldmine.\u201d The Coalition\u2019s campaign spokesman, Mathias Cormann, said Turnbull had no questions to answer over his role in the company. \u201cNo, is the short answer,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously this is more than 20 years ago. There is absolutely no suggestion of any wrongdoing.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 12 May 2016 to clarify that the prime minister was a director of Star Technology Systems Limited and not the managing director."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
