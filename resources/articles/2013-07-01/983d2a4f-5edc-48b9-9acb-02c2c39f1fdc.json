Courtney Meppen-Walter, a former Manchester City youth team player and England under-18 captain, was allowed to leave prison on Monday, a quarter of the way into a 16-month sentence. The prison service said Greater Manchester police had been told of the error and efforts were being made to return Meppen-Walter to custody. \"Releases in error are very rare and we take any incident extremely seriously. An investigation will take place into the circumstances that led to this release,\" said a prison service spokesman. The widow of one of Meppen-Walter's victims said she was \"devastated\" to learn he had been allowed to walk free and she felt \"badly let down\" by the criminal justice system. The footballer was jailed on 28 February at Manchester crown court, where the sentencing judge said he would serve half his sentence in custody but might be released earlier on an electronic tag. Meppen-Walter, from Blackley, Greater Manchester, was driving his grandfather's Mercedes at almost twice the 30mph speed limit when he hit a car at a junction. Its driver, Kulwant Singh, 32, from Salford, and his sister, front seat passenger Ravel Kaur, 37, from Cheetham Hill, Manchester, were both killed. Minutes earlier, Meppen-Walter had been \"jockeying\" and \"playing games\" on a nearby dual carriageway with a friend in a VW Golf. The victims had arrived in the UK in 2001 to start a new life after fleeing persecution by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Kaur's two sons, aged 16 and 17, who were rear seat passengers, were injured in the crash in central Manchester last September. They are now orphans, having lost their father in Afghanistan. Meppen-Walter had one previous conviction for speeding \u2013 for doing 56mph in a 30mph zone. Singh's widow, Kushwant, said on Monday: \"The news of Meppen-Walter's release from prison has devastated me. His original sentence of 16 months for causing death by careless driving to both my husband and his sister was not sufficient in the first place. \"He has now been released after serving just four months, which is a quarter of his sentence. I feel that I have been badly let down by the criminal justice system.\" As well as being sentenced to 16 months concurrently on two charges of causing death by careless driving, which he admitted, Meppen-Walter was also banned from driving for three years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
