Mr Blair stressed that his preference was to \"take the UN route\", but did not rule out support for military action without further recourse to the security council. He said that, ahead of any US-led action against Iraq, \"our preference is to go back to the United Nations security council and have a second resolution\" outlining the use of force. Resolution 1441, passed last year, demanded that President Saddam allow unfettered access to inspectors searching for weapons of mass destruction. However, defining his government's position in more detail than he has done so far, the prime minister added a caveat about returning to the security council that did not completely rule out supporting military action outside a UN resolution. Mr Blair said he \"could not be constrained\" by the possibility of a country imposing an \"unreasonable block\" or proviso that would hinder a fresh UN resolution. He added: \"I want to make it quite clear, and I believe this to be the position of all the main security council members, that if there is a breach [of the first resolution] we would expect the United Nations to honour the undertakings that were given and make sure that the will of the UN is upheld.\" The White House has been careful not to commit itself to having to seek a second resolution before starting any military action, and Mr Blair's comments today would still allow him room to support the US doing so. Mr Blair said: \"The only qualification we have added... is that if you did have a breach, went back to the UN, but someone put an unreasonable or unilateral block down on action, in those circumstances we have said we can't be in a position where we are confined in that way.\" But he added: \"However, my own judgment is that if there is a breach, then action will be authorised.\" Mr Blair said he was \"quite sure\" that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and that those weapons pose a \"real active threat to British national security.\" The prime minister was speaking at his monthly Downing Street media briefing amid reports that scepticism about the wisdom of military action without conclusive proof that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction is growing in the Labour Party. Mr Blair sought to turn around the question of whether Britain should support a war against President Saddam, saying: \"Are people really saying that if there is a breach of that UN resolution, no action should follow? \"If we did that, we would send a message to the outside world which would, in my view, be absolutely disastrous for the security of our world.\" \u00b7 'People will support action if UN breach proven' Mr Blair was asked how he would explain to a mother who has just waved her son off to war in the Gulf why it was necessary that he should risk his life. He said the idea of Iraq might sometimes seem remote but added that his great fear was waking up to find a dictatorial regime had used weapons of mass destruction, or that weapons had fallen into the hands of terrorists. The prime minister added: \"Every single day, I am faced with information as to how these weapons are proliferating. It is a matter of time, if we do not act, before terrorism and weapons of mass destruction come together.\" Mr Blair said he believed polls suggested that, if there was a proven breach by Iraq and the UN sanctioned action, a majority of people would back it. But he added: \"Polls or no polls, my job in a situation like this is sometimes to say the things that people don't want to hear.\" He argued that the difference in the government line between Iraq and North Korea, which is suspected of already having at least one nuclear weapon and is believed to be seeking more, was that there had been a 10-year history of trying to reduce the threat from President Saddam. Asked whether London was prepared for a possible terrorist strike, Mr Blair said: \"I believe we are as well prepared as we can be - but as both New York and London know, when you are dealing with fanatical groups of people who are prepared to do anything to cause destruction, it is difficult to be prepared against every possible eventuality.\" \u00b7 January 27 deadline played down Earlier today, Mohammed el-Baradei, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said that UN weapons inspectors would need \"a few months\" to finish their work in Iraq. The inspectors are scheduled to deliver a report to the UN on January 27, which has been seen as date when war could be triggered. Mr el-Baradei acknowledged that there was a \"great deal of anxiety that we need to finish our job\". However, he said the inspections would not be over by the end of the month. Mr Blair said January 27 was an important date, but insisted that it was not a deadline for war. He added: \"None of us are putting speculative or arbitrary timeframes on this. I believe that the inspection process is the right process. That's what the UN resolution laid down.\" \u00b7 A poll of 1,204 American adults found that only one third of the US public supported a war on Iraq without UN approval and allies. With UN backing, 83% of US citizens would support the war, according to the poll, carried out by Princeton Survey Research Associates. It also found that 44% of those who responded thought that \"some or most\" of the September 11 hijackers were Iraqi citizens."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
