Abse, the older brother of poet Dannie Abse, spent 29 years in the Commons as an MP for Pontypool (1958-83) and Torfaen (1983-87), writing in his spare time books such as a biography of Mrs Thatcher entitled Margaret, Daughter of Beatrice; The Man Behind the Smile: Tony Blair and the Politics of Perversion and, in 2000, Fellatio, Masochism, Politics and Love, described as an analysis of the repressed homosexual components of the relationship between Gordon Brown and Tony Blair. Of rather more lasting significance was his parliamentary campaigning for a series of social reforms during the 1960s: the end of criminal prosecutions for attempted suicide, the abolition of capital punishment, reforming divorce law, the decriminalisation of homosexuality and the legalisation of abortion among other measures. The former Labour prime minister Jim Callaghan reputedly once told him: \"You do much more good in terms of human happiness than 90% of the work done in parliament on political issues.\" While tributes from current and former prime ministers were noticeably absent, Neil Kinnock, the former Labour leader, and his wife Glenys said: \"Leo was courageous, highly principled, very funny and totally unique. We are glad that he had such a long and fulfilling life in which he gained so much social progress by being an outstanding free-thinking socialist.\" Abse is survived by his second wife, Ania, 50 years his junior, whom he married in Poland in 2000, five years after the death of his first wife, Marjorie."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
