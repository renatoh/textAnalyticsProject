Reports emerged this week from Pinewood Studios that an explosion on the film\u2019s set on Tuesday destroyed part of a sound-stage roof and tore off large chunks of exterior panelling, as well as causing a \u201cminor injury\u201d to a crew member. The explosion is the latest setback to affect production of the film known as Bond 25, the 25th and latest in the hugely profitable series based on Ian Fleming\u2019s books that began in 1962 and has earned over $7bn worldwide. The UK\u2019s Health and Safety Executive has announced it is to make inquiries into the incident, though it as yet has stopped short of a full investigation. Bond 25 has been hit with a series of problems that, though in some ways not unusual for a production of its scale, are causing repeated delays and suggest a sense of crisis is enveloping it, and there is even talk of a \u201ccurse\u201d. Shooting had to be cancelled after lead actor Daniel Craig injured his ankle in May and needed surgery that put him out of action for a fortnight. Producers have hired multiple writers to rework the script \u2013 most eyecatchingly, Fleabag\u2019s Phoebe Waller-Bridge, only the second woman to receive a writing credit on a Bond film, who has called for the series to \u201cevolve\u201d and \u201ctreat women properly\u201d. And a recent launch event in April, streamed live on Facebook from Jamaica, proved a disappointment, with lead producers Barbara Broccoli and Michael G Wilson unable to confirm the title of the film, due to be released in less than a year\u2019s time, in April 2020. Arguably the most significant setback, however, occurred in August last year, when the original director, Danny Boyle, abruptly left the project over \u201ccreative differences\u201d, meaning Broccoli and Wilson had to start again almost from scratch, with no way to meet the original planned release date of autumn 2019. A month later, Cary Fukunaga was announced as Boyle\u2019s replacement. Part of the difficulties the Bond film is facing is a result of its attempts to overhaul and reposition a series that \u2013 despite the strength of its traditionalist appeal \u2013 looks in danger of becoming rapidly outdated in the current climate. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that the 007 franchise needs to make a big effort to be fresh and current in the age of Time\u2019s Up,\u201d says Anna Smith, chair of the London Film Critics\u2019 Circle and host of the Girls on Film podcast. \u201cThough Bond films are hardly woke, representation has been improving over the years, though I think there is still a long way to go when it comes to female characters \u2013 the cavalier treatment of Monica Bellucci in Spectre springs to mind. I\u2019m excited to see what Phoebe Waller-Bridge does with the script, and if it takes time to get that right, I\u2019m ready to wait.\u201d Crisis has never seemed far away in the Craig era, with the actor repeatedly sustaining injuries since taking on the role, including losing two teeth in a fight scene in Casino Royale and having a fingertip sliced off during Quantum of Solace. External factors have also contributed: the 2007-08 writers strike hampered the production of Quantum of Solace, with Craig admitting he rewrote scenes with director Marc Forster, and a financial crisis at parent studio MGM in 2010 meant extensive delays before Skyfall could get under way. However, the extraordinary box office success of Skyfall and its follow-up, Spectre \u2013 the second and third highest-grossing films of all time in the UK \u2013 has meant that the series has had to cater to growing fan demands and wider scrutiny in the press and social media. Smith says: \u201cThe challenge will be balancing political correctness with reassuring their core audience that James Bond is still a traditionally \u2018masculine\u2019 man and avoiding a backlash. Trolls are very quick to panic about their favourite franchises going feminist \u2013 often just based on a trailer. But I hope there are many other Bond fans who would welcome further progress.\u201d \u2022This article was amended on 7 June, to correct the figure of the Bond series worldwide earnings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
