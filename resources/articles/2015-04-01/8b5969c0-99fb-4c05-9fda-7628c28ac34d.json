Brendan Rodgers needs to overhaul his troubled attacking options with Mario Balotelli, Fabio Borini and Rickie Lambert likely to be surplus to requirements and Daniel Sturridge proving prone to injury. Depay, who helped PSV win the Eredivisie title for the first time since 2008 on Saturday, is a target. The PSV coach, Phillip Cocu, admitted after winning the title with a 4-1 defeat of Heerenveen that he expected Depay and the midfielder Georginio Wijnaldum to leave. The PSV technical director, Marcel Brands, has since claimed United have inquired about the 21-year-old, who has scored 20 league goals this season and played under Louis van Gaal for Holland at last summer\u2019s World Cup. \u201cWe have had a telephone call from them about him,\u201d Brands said. \u201cBut no talks have been held. Several top clubs have expressed interest.\u201d Tottenham Hotspur tried to sign Depay for a reported \u20ac20m [\u00a314.4m] last year but PSV will demand a higher fee following his starring role in their championship success. \u201cIt will be much higher than the offer from Tottenham Hotspur. He will be very expensive,\u201d Brands said. The presence of Van Gaal gives United an advantage over their Premier League rivals for Depay\u2019s signature, as does the likelihood of Champions League football at Old Trafford next season. Liverpool\u2019s prospects of convincing the 21-year-old to come to Anfield may be determined by whether they finish in the top four. Rodgers\u2019 team trail fourth-placed Manchester City by seven points having played one game fewer than Manuel Pellegrini\u2019s team and missing out on the Champions League would compound the disappointment of Sunday\u2019 s FA Cup semi-final defeat by Aston Villa. Liverpool\u2019s players were given Monday off following their anaemic performance at Wembley but it is believed further talks have taken place over a new contract for Jordan Henderson. The club\u2019s vice-captain will enter the final 12 months of his current deal at the end of this season having refused to accept Liverpool\u2019s terms for an extension. Henderson is keen to extend his Anfield career and a resolution to a contract impasse that began earlier this season is understood to be close."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
