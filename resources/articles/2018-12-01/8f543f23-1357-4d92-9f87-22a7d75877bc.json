Even Alan Solomons, Worcester\u2019s much-travelled and vastly experienced director of rugby, cannot recall anything like it. Nine clubs, ranging from fourth-placed Wasps to bottom-placed Newcastle, being separated by a mere nine points is not conducive to a relaxing festive period. Hence the tension surrounding Friday\u2019s game between the Warriors and 10th-placed Northampton and Saturday\u2019s Leicester v Harlequins fixture, to name but two. Solomons, now 68, is not quite the oldest coach the Premiership has seen \u2013 the 71-year-old Alan Gaffney had a temporary stint in charge of Northampton last season \u2013 but he has been around long enough to know the coming months will be relentless for all involved. So what, ultimately, will settle this relegation game? Since 2011-12 the side conceding most tries has always finished bottom \u2013 to date Leicester (39 in nine games) and Bristol (36) have been the most porous. For Solomons, though, there is one other golden rule. \u201cStaying up is all about consistency of performance. If you don\u2019t perform consistently, you\u2019re going to land up with a problem. New Zealanders in the old days had a saying: \u2018For 80% of the time you need to be at 90% of your game. For 10% of the time you want to be at 100%. For the other 10% you\u2019re going to dip below that.\u2019 We\u2019re talking about human beings ... you\u2019re never going to be at full-pitch all the time.\u201d Solomons should know. During the South African\u2019s brief spell at Northampton over a decade ago the Saints lost eight games in a row. He was relieved of his duties and had to look on from afar as the team narrowly survived in 11th place, with Harlequins going down. Two seasons later, in 2006\u201107, Northampton finally dropped into the Championship. The moral of the story? Teamwork, a united dressing room and mental resilience matter as much as talent. \u201cIt\u2019s the environment you create that is absolutely vital,\u201d says Solomons, previously in charge of Ulster, Edinburgh and the Stormers and an assistant coach to Nick Mallett when the Springboks went 17 Tests unbeaten in the late 1990s. \u201cMy philosophy is to create an environment in which each individual \u2013 and the collective - can realise their potential and be motivated to come to work every day and prepare as best as possible. You\u2019ve also got to have resilience. Life\u2019s about getting up every single time you\u2019re knocked down. Players have got to learn those life lessons. I\u2019ve been around a bit and have seen a few things and it\u2019s part of my job to help them.\u201d Confidence is the other critical element. Worcester have been in these situations before and instinctively know how to respond. Clubs such as Leicester, on their worst run since 1975, are entering uncharted waters. \u201cGeordan Murphy and Mark Bakewell are good blokes and they\u2019ve got good players,\u201d says Solomons. \u201cThey\u2019re just having a loss of confidence and I\u2019m confident they will recover. But this is a different-level Premiership this year, as all the other directors of rugby keep telling me. All the teams have got quality players; they\u2019re well-coached and well-prepared. Your preparation is critical. If you are 10-15% off at this level, you\u2019ve got a problem. I\u2019ve not seen us have an easy game yet.\u201d For Worcester, with a burgeoning academy, this presents a familiar dilemma. How can hugely promising youngsters such as Ted Hill, capped by England last month, or the forceful teenage centre Ollie Lawrence, be allowed time to develop when the next 80 minutes might dictate their club\u2019s entire future? Solomons believes sealing off the top tier would help all concerned. \u201cIf it is ring-fenced, you\u2019re really able to invest in building your club. To some extent that\u2019s to the benefit of English rugby. I think it\u2019s a healthy thing if guys stay in their environment.\u201d Above and beyond the politics of the game the fresh investment deal secured by Premiership Rugby this week and the Warriors\u2019 publicity-shy new owners, the influence of Worcestershire\u2019s answer to Professor Dumbledore will also be crucial. Once a lawyer specialising in litigation, Solomons is not one of sport\u2019s laissez-faire gurus. In the past he has even insisted on teams training on Christmas Day \u2013 \u201cThat was a bit over the top\u201d \u2013 and once refused to allow a club player in South Africa to skip a match to attend his brother\u2019s wedding. His argument was that the ceremony should not have been arranged \u2013 \u201cThat\u2019s why God invented summer\u201d \u2013 for the rugby season. He freely admits there is a widening generation gap between himself and his squad \u2013 \u201cMy taste in music and theirs is radically different\u201d, he says. But he reckons that certain things never change. \u201cCore values are important to me. Integrity is number one, being altruistic, being a good pro: I find those appeal to whatever generation I\u2019ve coached. I don\u2019t think age is a limiting factor. You just have to be passionate about what you do. If you want to do it for the glamour you are doing it for completely the wrong reason.\u201d When the going gets tough, as it is about to do, nobody will be less fazed than the rugby-mad Solomons."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
