This time, though, there was no need to second-guess the Frenchman's exit strategy because his cards lie defiantly upturned on the club owner Tom Walkinshaw's table. Unless Gloucester offer him a new contract within the next three weeks, Saint-Andr\u00e9 insists he will say au revoir . With his side second in the Zurich Premiership and safely into the semi-finals of the Parker Pen European Shield, it may appear Saint-Andr\u00e9 is simply playing a shrewdly timed hand but he claims he has no choice. Wait any longer, he warns, and Gloucester will find themselves fatally handicapped in the race for new signings who can improve the team even further next season. \"I can't sign new players when I don't know what is happening to myself,\" said the Frenchman, who will be meeting Walkinshaw this week to make the same point. \"If it is going to take two months to get an answer, it would be better I left. I want to compete with the best in England. If, instead, we lose four or five key players it will be difficult to stay. I must know if Tom Walkinshaw wants to keep me.\" Walkinshaw, as head of the Arrows team, is up to his elbows preparing for the new formula one season but these are crucial days for his rugby investment. Among those players waiting for a puff of smoke, of any colour, from the Kingsholm chimney is the England tight-head Phil Vickery, wanted by Leicester among others, while many of the club's influential French contingent would follow Saint-Andr\u00e9 back home if he left. With Walkinshaw also poised to unveil plans to move Gloucester to a new ground, the owner can ill afford to transport a squabbling team. The club's record since Saint- Andr\u00e9 took charge speaks for itself, however, and the former French wing also disputes claims that half his team hate him. \"If you speak to the players, I don't think a lot want to leave. I was a little afraid how the guys would react to all the rumours this week but we had a good meeting on Tuesday. We are in the same boat.\" Saint-Andr\u00e9 is even prepared to take the extraordinary step of hiring a specialist coach purely to accelerate the disaffected Henry Paul's union education, a generous response to the latter's public criticism of the standard of coaching at his new club which has led to an internal disciplinary hearing this week. On Saturday, Paul's contribution from outside centre on a swamp of a pitch was minimal, at best, with the backs coach Paul Turner barking positional instructions at him from behind the goalposts in the style of Bernie the Bolt - \"Left a bit, right a bit\" - of Golden Shot fame. Saint-Andr\u00e9 is sympathetic enough to propose a one-on-one coach two days a week -what is Graham Henry doing in the next few months, one wonders? - but believes Paul's absence at England training on Mondays, when Gloucester hold their skills session, has helped neither player nor club. \"My job is not to teach one guy, my job is to make the team successful. It's no good saying 'This guy will be good in 20 years' otherwise I'll be sacked in six months. I think he needs more time than he expected, but he wants to play for England very quickly.\" All of which sparked the question of how the passionate Frenchman would have reacted had his side lost to an inventive Irish side who, on a surface more suited to water buffalo than gazelles, felt they deserved better than a solitary bonus point as reward for their clever approach work. On a wet Dr Foster-style day, though, Gloucester's pack was ideally equipped for the task, with their French hooker Oliver Azam marking his return from a much publicised suspension with a 47th minute try. Likewise in the kicking department thanks to Ludovic Mercier, whose 100% return out of the mire was little short of miraculous, allowing his side to shrug off late Irish tries from Chris Sheasby and Mike Worsley.
