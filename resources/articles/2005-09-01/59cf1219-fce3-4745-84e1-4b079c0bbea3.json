Today, however, Justin Langer and Matthew Hayden did what England's supporters have feared might do all summer and put on a sizeable opening partnership to take the Aussies to 112-0 before bad light ended the day's play at tea. There were very few chances on offer as Langer, the more expansive of the pair, reached 75 and Hayden 32. The one chance came when Langer pushed at Paul Collingwood, only to watch in relief as Trescothick spilled a high catch to his right. Largely, progress was steady if unspectacular, with England hoping that the rain clouds looming large over The Oval would do their damage sooner rather than later. And upon being offered the light directly after tea, the Australian pair - somewhat surprisingly - accepted. Earlier, England's hopes of posting a substantial first-innings total depended on a frantic wag of their tail. What they got was more of a twitch, but the 54 runs added to their overnight total nudged Michael Vaughan's side to 373. It was left to Ashley Giles (32) and Steve Harmison (20 not out) to provide the attacking impetus amidst 90 minutes of general Australian frustration. While Shane Warne ended England's resistance by trapping Giles leg before, it was his pace counterparts that did the real damage today. Brett Lee struck with just the ninth delivery of the day, delightfully defeating Geraint Jones (25); teasing the wicket-keeper to probe down a wrong line, the ball swung away to upend off stump. Glenn McGrath also found a rhythm he had been lacking yesterday, despite being frustrated by Hoggard's stubborn 36-ball stay. The Yorkshireman collected two singles, after being dropped in the slips off McGrath, but the bowler retaliated with a slower, 74mph ball that prompted Hoggard to lob straight to Damien Martyn at mid-off. McGrath ought to have collected a second wicket, but saw Giles's nick behind fail to persuade umpire Rudi Koertzen, who claimed he hadn't heard an edge. Television replays showed that England had clearly ridden their luck. Fortune was also favouring Harmison, whose brave strokeplay was aided greatly by two top-edges over Adam Gilchrist and his slip cordon. In the end, though, it was left to Warne to wrap up the innings, ending with figures of 6-122."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
