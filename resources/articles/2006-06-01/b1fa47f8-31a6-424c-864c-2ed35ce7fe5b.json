Oleg Blokhin's team had lost their opener 4-0 but outclassed the Asians, whose uncertainty at set-pieces was ruthlessly exposed. Ukraine's midfielder Maksim Kalinichenko set up Andriy Rusol's opener and Shevchenko for the third goal, from a corner and free-kick respectively, as the Saudis' susceptibility to the high ball fatally wounded their chances of taking anything from the game. Serhiy Rebrov, meanwhile, claimed his side's second when his speculative effort from distance sailed into the top corner after the Saudi Arabia goalkeeper Mabrouk Zaid slipped as he tried to move across his line, and Kalinichenko deservedly completed the rout six minutes from time. The win puts Ukraine's hopes of progressing to the knockout phase of their first World Cup back on track and their fate will be decided in the final game against Tunisia. The eastern Europeans dominated this game throughout, with Blokhin's change to a 3-5-2 formation offering plenty of width to generate a series of crosses which troubled the nervous Saudi Arabia defence. Saudi Arabia showed promise going forward in patches, but created little by the way of scoring chances. Determined to recover their self-respect after being outclassed by Spain, the Ukrainians played with energy and patience on a slippery pitch. Rusol set the Ukrainians on their way with fewer than four minutes gone when he beat the Saudi defence to Kalinichenko's corner from the right, steering the ball past Zaid with his knee to give his team the perfect start. And while Redha Tukar almost levelled immediately with a half-volley, it was the Ukrainians who looked the more likely to add to the scoring as the Saudis panicked whenever the European side pushed forward. Shevchenko came agonisingly close to doubling Ukraine's lead in the 13th minute when he met another excellent Kalinichenko corner with a powerful header, only for Ahmed Dokhi to block his shot on the goalline. Chelsea's latest big money signing had another effort eight minutes later but this time Shevchenko's attempt from long range was straight at Zaid. The Saudis offered little serious goal threat, with only the left-back Dokhi causing anything like consternation in the Ukrainian defence, but even his attempts at goal were off target. With nine minutes to go to the break, the Ukrainians doubled their lead as Rebrov let fly from more than 35 yards with a right-foot effort that beat Zaid, whose footing gave way on the soft, wet turf as he struggled to cover the Dynamo Kiev man's shot. Andriy Voronin should have increased Ukraine's advantage further one minute before the interval when an abysmal attempt to clear by Hamad Al-Montashari fell at the forward's feet but the shot was pulled across the face of goal. However, with less than a minute on the clock after the resumption, the Ukrainians added to their total and this time it was Shevchenko's turn to punish the Saudis for their poor defending when he rose above Al-Montashari to head in Kalinichenko's free-kick from the left. Kalinichenko continued to cause the Saudis problems and he came close to claiming the goal his display demanded in the 65th minute, only for his curling shot to just miss a top corner of Zaid's goal. With six minutes to go, the Spartak Moscow striker finally got his name on the scoresheet as Shevchenko turned provider, the 29-year-old running beyond the Saudi defence using his impressive pace down the left before cutting the ball back for Kalinichenko who shot into the roof of the net."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
