The authors of the letter, which was sent to the chair of the committee, Representative Trey Gowdy, and simultaneously released to the press on Monday, claim the Republicans on the committee leaked incomplete versions of testimony transcripts in a manner designed to make Clinton look bad. The move comes in the wake of comments last week by Representative Kevin McCarthy, which appeared to admit that the committee was a cynical political exercise, part of \u201ca strategy to fight and win\u201d against Democrats. McCarthy is currently considered to be the frontrunner in the race to replace John Boehner as speaker of the House when Boehner steps down at the end of October. John Hudak, a fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said that McCarthy\u2019s comments had been \u201ca tremendous error\u201d because it gave Democrats the ability to take back the narrative and convince moderate voters \u2013 at whom this letter is really aimed \u2013 that the committee is indeed a political witch-hunt. \u201cThis is a political issue that Republicans have been winning on for week after week \u2013 that\u2019s no longer the case,\u201d said Hudak. \u201cNow it\u2019s clearly not as much of a winning issue for them, something they\u2019re not going to dominate on in controlling the narrative. In a big way this was the biggest thing they had on Secretary Clinton, and now they don\u2019t, and thats a tough political loss for them.\u201d He described making the comments as \u201cfrankly, political amateurism\u201d on McCarthy\u2019s part. \u201cIt\u2019s turning into a political disaster for [Republicans],\u201d he said. The authors of the letter \u2013 it is signed by representatives Elijah Cummings, Adam Smith, Adam Schiff, Linda Sanchez and Tammy Duckworth \u2013 specifically reference McCarthy\u2019s comments, saying that they show that the committee is an \u201cunethical abuse of millions of taxpayer dollars and a crass assault on the memories of the four Americans who were killed in Benghazi\u201d. They said that they would be unilaterally releasing the full versions of the transcript, starting with the interview of former state department chief of staff Cheryl Mills in September. \u201cWe do not take this action lightly,\u201d the letter concludes. \u201cWe have held off on taking such action for more than a year, but we will no longer sit and watch selective, out-of-context leaks continue to mischaracterize the testimony the Select Committee has received.\u201d Clinton, in an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Al Sharpton on Sunday, called McCarthy\u2019s comments \u201cdeeply distressing\u201d. On Monday she expanded on that, telling Today that the committee \u201cwas set up, as they have admitted, for the purpose of making a partisan political issue out of the deaths of four Americans\u201d. \u201cI would never have done that, and if I were president and there were Republicans or Democrats thinking about that, I would have done everything to shut it down,\u201d she added. The letter marks the start of the second difficult week for Trey Gowdy. A former prosecutor whose work on the committee has made him very popular with the so-called Freedom Caucus in the house, he was the subject of intense speculation last week after a movement led by representatives Mia Love and Jason Chaffetz to draft him into running for majority leader, under the assumption that McCarthy would replace Boehner. Chaffetz has since himself announced that he is running for Boehner\u2019s job. The following day, more rumours were circulating about Gowdy \u2013 this time, that he would be stepping down at the end of 2016. Gowdy forcefully denied both rumours, going as far as to formally declare his intention not to run for leadership at a meeting of the House Republican conference on Tuesday. Jamal Ware, the communications director for the committee, struck back robustly at the five signatories to the letter in a press release on Monday afternoon. \u201cBy selectively leaking and spinning parts of Secretary Clinton\u2019s top aide Cheryl Mills\u2019 transcript, Democrats have shown their nakedly political motivation, willingness to violate the letter and spirit of House Rules, and their desire to defend Secretary Clinton without regard for the integrity of the investigation,\u201d the statement said. \u201cMost Democrats on the Benghazi Committee have endorsed Clinton and they are now running a protection effort for the former Secretary,\u201d the statement continued. \u201cIt is one thing to merely sit idly by while others do serious work, it is quite another to attempt to undercut that work with selective leaks in violation of House Rules.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
