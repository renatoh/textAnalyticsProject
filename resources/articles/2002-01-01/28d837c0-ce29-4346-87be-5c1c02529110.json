American blamed its record quarterly loss on a weak economy and security fears after the September 11 attacks. The massive loss contrasts with a $47m (\u00a333m) profit a year ago. \"Influenced by the lingering effects of last September's attacks, the final three months of 2001 were incredibly difficult,\" said Don Carty, AMR's chairman and chief executive officer. \"Traffic, particularly business travel, was down significantly in the quarter, which - when combined with lower average fares - resulted in a record quarterly loss.\" Analysts said AMR's financial performance was about as good as could be expected after a series of disasters and mishaps. Two of American's jetliners were destroyed by hijackers in the September 11 attacks, as well as two planes belonging to United Airlines. Last November, an American Airbus A300 crashed on takeoff in New York and in December a man was caught allegedly trying to light explosives in his shoe on a transatlantic American flight. Even before the September 11 attacks, the airline industry was suffering from the fallout of the global downturn as passenger numbers fell. September 11 only exacerbated matters, plunging the industry into its worst crisis since the Gulf war. Tens of thousands of airline workers have been laid off as passenger traffic figures, especially across the Atlantic, plummeted. Last year, the Bush administration and Congress agreed to a multibillion dollar aid package for US airlines. On this side of the Atlantic, British Airways is also reeling from the current crisis, and has been forced to lay off 7,000 workers. Only low-cost carriers such as easyJet and Ryanair have managed to prosper in the current turmoil. The airline industry as a whole is estimated to have lost $13bn last year, according to Keijo Suila, the chief executive of Finnair. AMR said it had taken steps to bolster its financial position, including strengthening cash reserves, cutting capacity, reducing capital spending and cutting operating costs. The company has slashed 20,000 jobs since September 11."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
