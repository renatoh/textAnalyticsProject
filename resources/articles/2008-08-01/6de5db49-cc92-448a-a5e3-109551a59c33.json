Sure, Street Fighter and the like were amusing enough on the SNES in 1992, but can the genre still be relevant in 2008? Soulcalibur IV would suggest so. This is a stylish and enjoyable fighting game that successfully allows both button-bashing novices and dexterous devotees to indulge in some swashbuckling combat. Star Wars fans will enjoy it too, with Darth Vader and Yoda appearing as playable characters. At its core, though, SC IV is an old-fashioned fighting game that rewards patience and practice. There is a surprising depth to the action - as usual, blocking and timing are key - and multiplayer is where the real fun is to be found. The character design - all pneumatic chests and short skirts - shows the genre has still not outgrown its adolescent market, but older players might still enjoy a nostalgic return to their button-bashing heyday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
