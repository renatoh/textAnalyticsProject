Such was the intensity of the 15 seconds that reduced a big field to a single, untouched survivor, however, that as soon as he starts to recall the mayhem at the 23rd fence back in 1967, the fog of four decades swiftly melts away. He can remember what he was thinking as the field galloped towards the smallest fence on the course aboard Kapeno. Like so many of the other jockeys, he thought that he was in with a chance, since only a no-hoper called Foinavon, who was then almost a fence adrift, could be ruled out with any certainty. There were loose horses towards the head of the field, including Popham Down, an early casualty, but things were still looking distinctly promising. \"Kapeno was a very classy horse and he was still going very well,\" Gaselee says. \"He had a habit of falling at Becher's in his previous visits to Liverpool but on this occasion we'd already got over it twice and I was starting to think, this is really good news. \"Then I saw the loose horse up ahead. He ran into the wing, stopped briefly, then turned and trotted down the entire fence in front of the field. I cannoned into him, though I stayed in the saddle, and there are two things that I distinctly remember. \"Normally when you're riding in a race, you don't really hear the noise of the crowd even in the finishing straight because you are concentrating so hard. But in those days they had a grandstand at the Canal Turn and I was suddenly aware of this extraordinary sound of voices and shouts - and it was the shock of the people in the stand. \"The next thing I thought was what a bloody stupid way it was to finish my race. But then I realised that as far as I could see, nothing had got over at all. I took another dart at it and ran into something else, then at the third attempt I got over and went on to finish 10th. And like every other jockey in the race, I still think I should have won.\" Foinavon, a 100-1 no-hoper, was of course the only horse to negotiate the 23rd cleanly. At least one other runner, though, did get across at the first attempt with his jockey still in the plate. \"I was long gone by the time it all happened, as my horse overjumped at the first,\" remembers Andy Turnell - who, like Gaselee, later trained a National winner. \"But my father [Bob] also had Rondetto in the race, with Johnny Haine riding, and he was the first to get over intact, only to collide with something on the other side and get unseated. \"He was a very useful horse, he won a Hennessy and was third in the National twice, so if he'd stayed on, there's no way in the world that Foinavon would have beaten him. Rondetto would have won by a distance.\" The mayhem that allowed Foinavon to win may never be repeated and is the most famous pile-up in National history, but far from the only example. In 1928, the great Easter Hero stood off too far at the Canal Turn and became stuck on top of the fence, causing such chaos that only nine of the 41 horses behind him managed to survive, while only two actually finished. And it is just six years since the riderless Paddy's Return veered across the same fence and took nine horses out of the race. \"That's the National for you and you always have to realise that anything can happen at Aintree,\" says Terry Biddlecombe, who remounted and finished fourth on Greek Scholar in Foinavon's National. \"I couldn't believe it as I saw it all happening in front of me. I was stuck on the inside, and my horse baulked and landed with his front legs on the fence. Then I couldn't back out as another horse had come up my arse. If he'd only knocked me over, I could have jumped back on again and I might have had a chance.\" Could it happen again? As Gaselee, who trained Party Politics to win the race in 1992, points out, \"these days there are run-out areas so it's much easier for loose horses to get off the course, though of course, there are no rules in the National. \"It was really just one of those extraordinary things that happen at Aintree, and it wasn't nearly as galling as the false start [that voided the 1993 race] when Party Politics was favourite and in the best form of his life.\" But that, of course, is another Grand National story."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
