Donald Trump reverted to his blame-casting, grievance-airing, media-bashing ways on Thursday in a press conference that started strangely and ended in an even weirder place. It was the same Trump who spent more than four years lambasting the \u201cfake news\u201d media as enemies of the people. But now it was taking place during a global pandemic in which thousands of lives depend on trustworthy sources and reliable information. Despite the gravity of a situation that has earned comparisons to war, Trump began with a joke: \u201cI have to say I think with social distancing, that the media\u2019s been much nicer. I don\u2019t know what it is, all these empty, these inbetween chairs,\u201d \u2013 a reference to how reporters now space themselves out in the White House briefing room. Trump added: \u201cI love it, it\u2019s so much nicer, but I shouldn\u2019t say that because you\u2019ll get me now.\u201d Stephen Hahn, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, and Deborah Birx, the response coordinator for the coronavirus task force, remained stony-faced behind him. The president continued to paint a sunny picture about clinical trials and economic recovery but, as reporters began to challenge him over the federal response to the crisis, his mood darkened. Questioned by an NBC News journalist about his recent claim that he recognised the outbreak as a pandemic before others did, Trump complained: \u201cWe were very prepared. The only thing we weren\u2019t prepared for was the media. The media has not treated it fairly. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you how prepared I was. I called for a ban from people coming in from China long before anybody thought it was \u2013 in fact, it was your network, I believe they called me a racist because I did that.\u201d Bridling with indignation, he added: \u201cIt was many of the people in the room. They called me racist and other words because I did that, because I went so early.\u201d Mike Pence and the surgeon general, Jerome Adams, who is African American, remained expressionless behind him. Trump is accustomed to sycophancy from Pence and the others around him \u2013 phrases such as \u201cThe president has ordered\u201d and \u201cThe president directed\u201d. The reporters, however, did not get the memo. He seemed upset that they had the temerity to grill him about his frequent downplaying of the threat of the virus and failure to organise testing kits. Trump was asked about the first two cases of coronavirus among members of Congress. He used it as an opportunity to chastise the gathered media. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re sitting like you people are sitting. You\u2019re actually sitting too close.\u201d It was another of those occasions when no one is entirely sure whether Trump is joking. In any case, the reporters in the briefing room \u2013 which long ago was the White House swimming pool \u2013 looked distinctly unamused. Trump went on: \u201cYou should really \u2014 we should probably get rid of about another 75, 80% of you. I have just two or three of you that I like in this room. I think that\u2019s a great way of doing it. We just figured a new way of doing it, but you\u2019re actually much too close. You two, you should leave immediately.\u201d This was pretty rich from a man who continues to shake hands and flout rules on social distancing, even on the White House podium. Last week, when it emerged that Trump had been at Mar-a-Lago with a Brazilian official who had tested positive for the virus, he reluctantly agreed to take a coronavirus test, which came back negative. \u201cI got a test because you people were driving everybody crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cI had no symptoms but I had a test and my doctor told me don\u2019t get it, you don\u2019t need it, everybody said you don\u2019t need it, but I had it because the press was going crazy.\u201d Trump has spent much of his presidency boasting about the economy; now it is suddenly a sore point. One reporter prefaced his question, \u201cRight now, the economy has essentially ground to a halt.\u201d Irritated, Trump butted in sarcastically: \u201cThanks for telling us, we appreciate it.\u201d The reporter continued his gloomy forecast and Trump snapped: \u201cGo ahead, what\u2019s the rest of your question, everybody in the room knows that.\u201d The president has been criticised for constantly using the xenophobic term \u201cChinese virus\u201d. A sharp-eyed photographer caught a picture of his notes, showing the word \u201ccorona\u201d was crossed out and replaced by \u201cChinese\u201d in handwritten black ink. The issue came up at the end of the briefing, but not as anyone had imagined. Chanel Rion, who works for the pro-Trump One America News Network, and recently speculated wildly that the coronavirus might have been created in a lab in North Carolina, asked: \u201cDo you consider the use of the term \u2018Chinese food\u2019 racist \u2013 because it\u2019s food that originates in China or has Chinese roots? Appreciating the gift, Trump replied: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s racist at all.\u201d Rion, who last year took Trump\u2019s lawyer Rudy Giuliani to Ukraine to spread baseless conspiracy theories, wasn\u2019t done. \u201cOn that note, major left-wing news media, even in this room, have teamed up with Chinese Communist Party narratives, and they are claiming that you are racist for making these claims about \u2018Chinese virus\u2019. \u201cIs it alarming that major media players, just to oppose you, are consistently siding with foreign state propaganda, Islamic state radicalism, Latin gangs and cartels? And they work right here at the White House with direct access to you and your team.\u201d Finally, the Trump era had jumped the shark. He revelled in it. \u201cIt amazes me when I read the things that I read,\u201d he said. \u201cIt amazes me when I read the Wall Street Journal, which is always so negative. It amazes me when I read \u2013 the New York Times is not even \u2013 I barely read it. You know, we don\u2019t distribute it in the White House anymore, and the same thing with the Washington Post. \u201cBecause you see, I know the truth. And people out there in the world, they really don\u2019t know the truth. They don\u2019t know what it is. They use different slogans and different concepts for me almost every week trying to catch something. \u201cLast week, it was, oh, chaos. You see me, there\u2019s no chaos. No chaos. I\u2019m the one telling everybody to be calm. There\u2019s no chaos at the White House. We have unbelievable professionals. It\u2019s really \u2013 I mean, I think I came up with the term, I hope I came up with the term, but it is fake news. It\u2019s more than fake news, it\u2019s corrupt news.\u201d Trump continued to gripe about media outlets not calling him and said Democratic governors have praised him. \u201cThis administration has done a great job, but the press is very dishonest.\u201d Rion chimed in: \u201cMore than dishonest. They\u2019re siding with state propaganda!\u201d Suddenly we were in the rightwing fever swamps of the internet. As Hahn and Birx looked on, betraying no emotion, Trump replied: \u201cI think they do. They are siding with China. They are doing things that they shouldn\u2019t be doing. They\u2019re siding with many others; China is the least of it. \u201cSo why are they doing this? You\u2019ll have to ask them. But if we had an honest media in this country, our country would be an even greater place.\u201d Minutes later, the self-styled \u201cwartime president\u201d was gone. Yet another pivot had been unpivoted. John Heilemann, a host on the MSNBC network, observed: \u201cThe president, aspiring to be Churchillian, turns out at every turn to be Donald Trump.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
