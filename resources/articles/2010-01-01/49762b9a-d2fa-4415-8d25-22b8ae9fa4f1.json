The US Chamber of Commerce, which is helping American companies to co-ordinate efforts, is keeping an interesting list of donations by company on its website. A week on from Haiti's earthquake, the chamber said 203 firms have stepped up with a total of $83m in aid. The chamber's business civic leadership centre, which has been tracking disaster donations by companies for a decade, said this is the fastest response it has seen by US companies to any tragedy. It seems churlish to create a league table of generosity - but it's noticeable that the size of companies seems to bear little relationship to the size of donations. According to the chamber's records, the best US effort so far is by a Wall Street stockbroker, Jeffries &amp; Co, which has raised $7.5m. Jeffries pledged its entire global trading commission on Friday to Haiti, raising $5.5m, and topped this up with $1m of company funds, plus $1m in donations from its 2,628 employees. Germany's Deutsche Bank did something similar, handing $4m in equity trading commissions on Friday to Haiti. Meanwhile, bigger Wall Street players including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Morgan Stanley have so far given $1m apiece. Firms directly involved in Haiti include the telecoms company Digicel, which provides cellphone coverage in the battered country and has donated $5m. The London-based drinks firm Diageo, which has a joint venture to operate a brewery in Haiti employing 1,300 people, is sending 45,000lbs in food and emergency supplies. So far, 36 companies have donated $1m or more. Drugs firm Amgen has pledged $2m. Microsoft is giving $1.25m and is providing technical support for charities working in Haiti. Google, Pepsi, UPS and Starbucks are among those giving an initial $1m each. The US chamber of commerce advises its members that \"cash is king\" and that it's easier to give funds to relief organisations than to make gifts \"in kind\". Still, some companies have opted to donate products - Procter &amp; Gamble is sending water purifiers and the Vitamin Shoppe, a US retail chain, is sending energy bars. America's largest company, Wal-Mart, has pledged $500,000 cash and is sending $100,000 worth of pre-packaged food kits to the Red Cross."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
