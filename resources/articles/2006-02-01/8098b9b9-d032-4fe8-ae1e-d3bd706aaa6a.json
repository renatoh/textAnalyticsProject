One of Chaim Soutine's celebrated paintings of a flayed beef carcass sold at Christie's for \u00a37.8m. At the same house, later in the week, two Francis Bacons went for around \u00a35m each. Down the road, at Sotheby's, a private collection of Edvard Munch exceeded predictions dramatically. Eight of Fred Olsen's Munchs proved very strong; one - a perfectly hideous Summer Day - went for \u00a36.2m. A major Gauguin went for \u00a312.3m at the same sale. Later in the week, Lucian Freud's well-known portrait of Bruce Bernard fetched \u00a33.5m. Perhaps more tellingly, Sotheby's sold an Anthony Caro steel sculpture on the same evening for \u00a31.3m. That may now sound like small change. But it's worth pointing out that the previous auction-house record for an Anthony Caro, an artist with a huge international reputation and a long-running career, was \u00a377,675. Before last week, you would have paid a higher aesthetic premium for the metalwork in a BMW than for that in an Anthony Caro. Not any more. Money is floating massively in the skies over New Bond Street and King Street and alighting, frankly, where it can. Of course, this is not a universal phenomenon. It was surprising to learn that, at one of these extraordinary events, a painter as splendid and celebrated as Michael Andrews broke a record for his work at the relatively modest amount of \u00a3176,000. But overall, art is being fought over in a way it hasn't been for some time. Perhaps it is even rising up again to the dizzy period of the late 1980s and early 1990s, when a Japanese businessman bought a Van Gogh portrait for $82.5m. In 1967, Peter Wilson, then chairman of the board of Sotheby's, initiated the Times-Sotheby Index, which charts the cost of pictures just like any other commodity. It proved a self-fuelling engine. By demonstrating that pictures could be thought of in this way, the index guaranteed that they would be. It presided over a vertiginous rise in the value of art, as moneyed individuals, corporations, even pension funds found that they could justify the acquisition of a painting in exactly the same way that they could a block of shares. Probably the strangest effect of the index was to bring all sorts of unlikely artists into the glare of fashion. Previously, it had been possible for a private collector without huge means to acquire works by major but unfashionable artists. In the 1940s, what seemed the embarrassingly naff allegories of Edward Burne-Jones and other pre-Raphaelites could be acquired for under \u00a3100. In the past 30 years, according to some estimates, works by the pre-Raphaelites have appreciated in value between 2,000% and 10,000%. The effect of the index was to encourage people, whatever their personal taste, to seek out good investments. There are, now, only relative bargains, not absolute ones. What matters is a signature and a clean provenance; for those reasons, the market has settled on the well-documented careers of artists from the past 100 years or so, and contemporary artists have acquired a value - that of provable authenticity - that was never a primary factor before. Of course, you can buy art for almost nothing: the various Affordable Art Fairs, for instance, will sell you new art for a few hundred pounds. But in the present climate, that sort of stuff has the rough resale value of a sofa from Habitat. What has disappeared as a buyable prospect is art by a distinguished name without current cachet. Even the monstrosities of a Bouguereau are heading up into the \u00a35m region. Under the influence of the Times-Sotheby Index, art now is more expensive in real terms than it has ever been. Historical prices achieved are nowhere near the prices paid now. Money paid for a Titian or a Raphael in the 19th century, once adjusted, can't touch that $82m Van Gogh. As for living artists: of course, it is difficult to make comparisons between renaissance Italy's currency and ours, but it does seem as if Michelangelo's fee for painting the Sistine Chapel works out at a couple of hundred thousand pounds, no more. A more realistic comparison is supplied by the career of Joshua Reynolds. He was a painter at the height of fashion, working in the richest city in the world. At the end of his life, his standard fee for a major whole-length portrait was \u00a3200 - probably equivalent to around \u00a320,000, or a little more. The monstrous figures now being achieved are all very well, but in the end they are anti-art, based largely on ideas of what will hold its value best. It not only fetishises art beyond all reason, but effectively shifts art back into the private realm, since no museum can justify paying such prices. It also damagingly squashes one of the most vital factors in the development of taste, superficial trends and fashions, by insisting that all signed art is potentially good, because - look at the index - it outperforms any other investment. A small but devastating crash would, in the long run, do the world of good."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
