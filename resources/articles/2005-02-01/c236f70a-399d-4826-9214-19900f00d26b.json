Wadi Rum, Jordan", "bodyText": "Why? My English teacher was Robert Bolt, who wrote the screenplay for Lawrence Of Arabia. A few years ago, when there was a lull in the Middle East conflict, my wife and I went to Wadi Rum. I got to ride a camel, which was terrific fun as they are such strange beasts - said to be 'a horse drawn up by a committee', but I thought they were rather noble and sensible. The best thing? The silence of the desert. When you are there, you feel that one little shout will travel for 100 miles. My ideal day: I'd be up at the crack of sunshine for a glass of yoghurt and tea. Then I'd take a camel ride for an hour or so. In the afternoon, I would be whisked off in a 4x4 to a large tent for a decent lunch. After a nap I'd head to Al Aqabar for an evening in a fantastic restaurant. My advice: Go at the right time of year. Around now is good because the climate is bearable - in the height of summer you will be hot as toast. Getting there: Expedia (expedia.co.uk) has return flights between Heathrow and Jordan from \u00a3410pp. Where was your best holiday? My honeymoon in Paris, in 1969. Of course, Paris was also where Mrs Thatcher crept up on me while I was reporting. It turned out to be a sublimely significant moment - the time when she lost it. That whole episode had a weird truth to it. What is the best hotel you have ever stayed in? The Hotel Bristol in Paris (hotel-bristol.com). It is ridiculously expensive but the food is superb. Where do you want to go next? Back to Bora Bora. Of all the South Pacific islands, it is the best. What do you never travel without? A little radio to pick up the World Service. \u00b7 John Sergeant's latest book is Maggie: Her Fatal Legacy (Macmillan, \u00a320)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
