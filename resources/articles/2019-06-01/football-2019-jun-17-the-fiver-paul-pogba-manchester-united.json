The picture in Pogba\u2019s mind, however, involved a near-instant departure for a tough shift at the coalface of relentless self-promotion. Within 72 hours he landed in Asia for the first leg of his one-man promotional tour of South Korea, China and Japan. This is not to be confused with Manchester United\u2019s forthcoming promotional tour of Australia, China, Singapore and, er, Wales. On this tour, Pogba is promoting two brands: Adidas and Pogba Inc. Among the subjects Pogba has spoken about on his travels is Paul Pogba. And also, cleanliness. \u201cThe national team in Japan, they always clean the changing room and it looks like a new changing room,\u201d he whooped. \u201cThis is a very good message for everyone and we should do the same in Europe.\u201d Manchester United\u2019s changing room is like the Augean stables of Greek mythological fame: full of unutterable filth. As in the myths, at some point someone will just have to sluice away the lot of it. For now, though, it is what it is, and Pogba is a part of it \u2013 though perhaps not for long. After three years at Old Trafford, it seems the French ace is eyeing pastures new. Speaking at a promotional event in Tokyo also featuring four sumo wrestlers, the player was asked about his future. \u201cAfter this season, and after everything that happened this season, with my season being my best season as well,\u201d he tooted, \u201cI think for me it could be a good time to have a new challenge somewhere else.\u201d Pogba came third in the club\u2019s player of the year poll, behind Luke Shaw and Victor Lindel\u00f6f. He could, of course, accept a new challenge in the same place, the challenge being to focus more on ball-kicking and less on the general pursuit of sponsordollars. Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s attempts to make United less embarrassing could certainly do with the assistance of peak-form Pogba, but sporting achievement is not on the midfielder\u2019s mind. \u201cI have been in Manchester for three years and have been doing great \u2013 some good moments and some bad moments, like everybody. Like everywhere else.\u201d The question now is whether there\u2019s a big club somewhere with a spare \u00a3150m down the back of el sof\u00e1. Apparently United are \u201cdistinctly unimpressed\u201d with Pogba\u2019s revelation and are resolved not to sell him unless they receive an \u201castronomical\u201d offer. They have resolved that nobody\u2019s going to be taking them to the cleaners, though perhaps it wouldn\u2019t be such a bad idea.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cEven the venerable New York Times is joining your STOP FOOTBALL campaign\u201d \u2013 Kristian Karamfiles. \u201cWhat with Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County clinging on, how about calling a newly-promoted Premier League \u2018Teemu Pukki\u2019s Norwich\u2019. It might not be original enough for you though, as the Finnish newspapers appear to have got there first\u201d \u2013 Mike Walsh. \u201cHastily Googling for stuff at work is dangerous (Fiver letters passim). My colleague (definitely my colleague) was putting together a presentation about the appalling treatment of Colombian trade unionists some years ago. He needed to find a picture of then US president George W Bush in his younger years, but what he typed into Google on the work laptop was not his smartest search\u201d \u2013 Dan Ashley. \u201cI work at a cosmetics company, with mostly female co-workers. On a recent occasion, it was observed at a meeting that those under a certain age named Richard will not go by the nickname D!ck. This prompted an ill-advised search for \u2018Famous D!cks\u2019 on a work computer and an ever more ill-advised mass email from yours truly. I never did hear from HR, surely because they (correctly) assumed I would be red-faced enough about it without them\u201d \u2013 Matt Richman. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

BITS AND BOBS After 30 years at Roma, Francesco Totti has left the club. But he\u2019s going down swinging. \u201cThey knew of my desire to offer a lot to this squad but they never wanted it,\u201d he fumed. \u201cThey kept me out of everything. For eight years here, since the Americans came, they\u2019ve done everything they could to sweep us aside \u2026 Presidents come and go, coaches come and go, players come and go. But not emblems. This is far worse than retiring as a player. Leaving Roma is like dying.\u201d Chelsea have invited Frank Lampard\u2019s Derby County\u2019s Frank Lampard over for talks to succeed Maurizzio Sarri, who has already made himself at home at Juventus. \u201cWe want him and to retain his services for the long term,\u201d cooed Rams owner Mel Morris, who definitely isn\u2019t thinking about compensation. England forward Toni Duggan has recovered from thigh-knack and will be fit to face Japan on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m itching to get out there,\u201d she cheered. \u201cI\u2019m going to be fit, so I have a big smile on my face.\u201d Aston Villa have topped up Wolves\u2019s piggy bank with \u00a33m for defender Kortney Hause. Arsenal\u2019s first-team coaching roster is now one former underwear model to the good after Freddie Ljungberg was brought in to replace Steve Bould. At least as far as our Steve Bould-in-his-smalls knowledge goes. And despite next season\u2019s Premier League ball being a sphere, just like it is every year, guff-touting Nike creatives reckon it will have a bigger area on it for players to thwack it at goal. \u201cThe ball comprises just four fuse-welded panels to provide a bigger \u2018sweet spot\u2019 for ball-striking,\u201d parped a swoosh-adorned suit.
