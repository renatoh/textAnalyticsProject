And Richmond Football Club has revealed that one of its players was racially abused at the same game. The club said on Saturday said the AFL was investigating \u201canother incident of abuse\u201d involving Bachar Houli, who is Muslim. The banner, adorned with \u201cUPF\u201d logos and which read \u201cStop the mosques\u201d, was displayed near the scoreboard at the city end of the MCG at half-time. A video of it being put in place was later uploaded to the United Patriots Front Facebook page. The AFL chief, Gillon McLachlan, condemned the banner as \u201cdivisive, ignorant and deeply offensive\u201d. McLachlan said the league\u2019s security manager was investigating and if the people responsible were AFL members they would \u201cbe banned from games\u201d. \u201cOur game has a history of egalitarianism and inclusion, and we must make sure that it continues to be a place where all Australians feel welcome,\u201d McLachlan said. The Richmond Football Club said in a statement: \u201cBachar Houli, and the broader Muslim community, deserve better than having to endure the small-minded people that seek to promote division and hatred.\u201d Collingwood also called for a ban on those responsible for the banner. \u201cThe club awaits the outcome of further investigations into the matter by the AFL, the Victoria Police and MCG security,\u201d a club statement read. The banner, which also said \u201cGo Pies\u201d, drew swift condemnation from the Collingwood president, Eddie McGuire, who promised bans if the culprits were found to have any official connection with the club. \u201cThese people do not speak for Collingwood and are condemned by Collingwood. If it is established that they have a formal connection to the club, this connection will be severed,\u201d the club statement said. \u201cThere is no place at Collingwood, or in our game, for such behaviour.\u201d Veteran sport broadcaster Francis Leach also condemned the banner. \u201cThe UPF saw an opportunity to exploit a nasty stream of fear and loathing that has crept into the game and the wider community,\u201d Leach wrote in a blog post on Saturday. \u201cHow the game responds to this latest act of intolerance will say a lot about where it sees itself as a community leader. One thing that it must do is stand up for the values of tolerance and inclusion that underpin everything we cherish about sport and particularly AFL football.\u201d The foreign minister, Julie Bishop, has also denounced the display. It is \u201cdeeply unfortunate\u201d people chose a football game to make a political statement, she said. \u201cThere is a time and a place and that was not the time and not the place,\u201d she told reporters in Washington on Saturday. \u201cI don\u2019t believe that those sentiments add anything to the debate about what is a serious challenge and that is trying to ensure that Australians live side by side, exercising a high degree of tolerance and appreciation of each other\u2019s cultures, backgrounds and differences.\u201d The MCG said on Twitter that those responsible for the sign had been ejected \u201cfor displaying material that was deemed to be racist and offensive to others\u201d. The far-right nationalist group the United Patriots Front, whose logo appeared on the banner, posted a rambling statement on its Facebook page predicting that the AFL and the media either would or would not react strongly against the display. UPF spokesman Blake Cottrell said he was concerned for the \u201cfuture of Australia\u201d and claimed that the message on the banner was not \u201cunreasonable\u201d. \u201cYou think i\u2019m peddling fear? I\u2019m concerned about the future of my country and I\u2019m realistic about the people being brought into this country, that they aren\u2019t like us and never will be like us,\u201d Cottrell said. McGuire called for the people responsible for the banner to be banned from football for life, Channel Nine reported. \u201cI hope the police got their names and numbers, if they\u2019ve got anything to do with our club they\u2019ll be banned,\u201d he said. \u201cGet these people and make an example of them. They should be banned for life.\u201d The UPF hit back at McGuire in a video on Facebook on Saturday, saying he was in no place to criticise their views after his comments regarding Adam Goodes in 2013. McGuire was forced to apologise for an on-air gaffe suggesting indigenous player be used to promote the musical King Kong. The AFL will follow up the incident with MCG security and Victoria Police."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
