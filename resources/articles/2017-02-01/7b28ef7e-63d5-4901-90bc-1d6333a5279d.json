The company said earlier on Tuesday that it was experiencing \u201chigh error rates\u201d on the platform affecting a large part of the east coast of the US. Then on Tuesday afternoon, Amazon posted on its service health dashboard that the issue had been resolved: \u201cAs of 1:49 PM PST, we are fully recovered for operations for adding new objects in S3, which was our last operation showing a high error rate. The Amazon S3 service is operating normally.\u201d The Amazon Simple Storage Solution (S3) is used by tens of thousands of web services for hosting and backing up data, including the Guardian, which was heavily affected. The problem had also affected some internet-connected devices, such as as smartphone-controlled light switches. The outage even affected a site called \u201cis it down right now?\u201d which monitors when other sites are down. The case highlights how reliant the internet has become on several players, including Amazon, Cloudflare and Google who provide the expensive centralized infrastructure on which the web runs. The so-called cloud is actually made up of thousands and thousands of powerful computer servers, stored by Amazon and others in huge server farms. The companies build and maintain them so so that smaller players don\u2019t have to. It\u2019s convenient and flexible (you only pay for the storage they use) for companies who don\u2019t have the resources or skills to do it themselves \u2013 that is, until there\u2019s a problem."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
