With seven matches and a brace of Twenty20 games, the whole concept is overblown \u2013 commercially successful, but wearying. Coming straight after the intensity of the Ashes series, it is just a tedious appendage. The Australian captain has been at home, some England players are struggling to raise their game and finding the atmosphere downbeat, and the talk in the White Hart, this column's sounding board where things move on swiftly, with a hint of amnesia, is that Andrew Strauss's men are a bunch of losers. Against which accusation I am forced to defend them without real conviction. Their general limited-overs inadequacies, nothing new of course, have come to the fore and their real strength has been forgotten. This past week has been like putting on the support act after Elvis has left the building. The questions come fast. Why is Jonathan Trott not playing? Where is the good place that Owais Shah is supposed to inhabit, and how does his presence there as a numpty batsman affect property prices? Indeed if in the space of a few days while occupying said good place you football-tackle one of your own players into the infirmary, tread on your stumps and run yourself out, what would constitute a bad place? And there is that old chestnut: why are England so poor at a form of the game at which they play so much domestically? This latter is a conundrum. There has been limited-overs cricket played here at first-class level since 1963 and England have yet to win a major trophy. It does not stack up. But experience at county level does not translate into experience at international level. Put simply, almost all other international teams have played more one-day cricket. Whether the benchmark for an established player is 30 games or 50, the fact is that England cricketers have been deprived of competition. This latest series is what you get if that is the road you take. When it comes to real experience, England are near the bottom of the heap. In the list of the most capped one-day players, Alec Stewart, top of the England roll with 170 caps, is 81st. So there will not really be much to shout about when Paul Collingwood, in all probability, goes past him but stops some way short of Sanath Jayasuriya's 436 appearances. Generally, English players play too much domestic one-day cricket and not enough international. Another argument is that for too long, none of the formats played in county cricket mirrored the international game. This was not an issue when the Gillette Cup came into existence in 1963 as a 65-overs-a-side entity, or indeed when the 40-over John Player League was introduced on Sundays in 1969, because the first one-day international was not until 1971 in Melbourne. For a while, the World Cup, which began in 1975, was played to 60 overs, as was the Gillette from 1965. Only in 1987 did the formats part company \u2013 the World Cup dropped to 50 overs and domestic competitions were played at 60, 55 and 40 overs. Not until 1996 did the Benson and Hedges Cup drop from 55 overs to 50; three years after that the 60-over competition also dropped to 50. But was this absence of conformity a sufficient reason for England's lack of success? Maybe not, for in 1987 and 1991 they reached the World Cup final, something they have not come close to repeating subsequently. Twenty20 was first played here, but much good it has done. Success has been hijacked elsewhere. So perhaps the England and Wales Cricket Board's plan for next summer, to abandon 50-over cricket in favour of the 40-over variety, is not as daft as it might sound. A bit of thought has gone into the decision. Changing because South Africa do not have a 50-over domestic competition yet are ranked No1 in the world in one-day internationals is not a solid reason. South Africa have not won the World Cup. It may be instead that the ECB is anticipating a change in the international format before the 2015 World Cup. In which case, well done for being proactive. The broadcasting rights for that tournament have already been sold on the basis of a 50-over format. I think 50 overs a side can provide a well-balanced match, with the possibility of comebacks and an ebb and flow that are not possible in shorter forms of the game. However, in terms of developing international skills, a reversion to what is really the old Sunday league may be no bad thing. It is not the technique of pacing an innings that generally eludes England batsmen, but the capacity to play explosively. That is something 40-over cricket might address. Bowlers might learn more of the varied arts at which, for example, Australia's Nathan Bracken is so adept. Running might become more aggressive. It is a bold step, but it might just be an inspired one."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
