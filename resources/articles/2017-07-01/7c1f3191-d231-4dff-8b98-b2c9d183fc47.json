As the EU chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, underlined the need for clarity on the British side at the end of the latest round of exit negotiations, soft Brexiters in the cabinet are now confident they have achieved a consensus about an \u201coff the shelf\u201d transition deal. The claim that a collective view has been reached comes after weeks of a brutal briefing war over competing visions of Brexit since the general election wiped out Theresa May\u2019s majority, culminating in the prime minister\u2019s admonition this week that there is \u201cno such thing as an unsackable minister\u201d, and sowing confusion in Brussels about the reliability of the British negotiating position. But as David Davis concluded Brexit talks in Brussels on Thursday, the senior cabinet source told the Guardian that the mood has shifted significantly and that ministers now hoped to agree a deal as soon as possible to give certainty to British business. \u201cIf you ask business when they want to see it agreed, they\u2019d say tomorrow,\u201d the source said, adding that such a deal could last between two and four years and could be expected to involve continued free movement of people. The source felt the most likely scenario was a deal lasting three years. The scale of the challenge that remains in the Brexit negotiations was the focus for Barnier in a Brussels press conference alongside Davis. He said Britain still needed to clarify its offer, including on the exit bill. \u201cAs I said very clearly to David, a clarification of the UK\u2019s position is indispensable for us to negotiate and for us to make sufficient progress on this financial dossier, which is inseparable from the other withdrawal dossiers.\u201d Echoing complaints from officials on the British side about a lack of flexibility from the Europeans in the early exchanges, Davis responded: \u201cWe have had robust but constructive talks this week. Clearly there is lots left to talk about and further work to do before we can resolve this. Ultimately getting a solution will require flexibility on both sides.\u201d The high stakes of the talks were emphasised by the news that British people living in the EU could lose their right to move between member states after Brexit unless Britain made a reciprocal offer. A UK source close to the negotiations said that there was agreement on about 50% of citizens\u2019 rights issues but said there were still \u201csignificant gaps\u201d in the EU\u2019s offer. While Davis was in Brussels, May was hosting business leaders in Downing Street to hear their concerns about Brexit, in the latest sign that the government is keener to listen since the general election. A No 10 spokesman said: \u201cThe prime minister reiterated that the government\u2019s overarching goal is for a smooth, orderly exit culminating in a comprehensive free trade deal with the EU, with a period of implementation in order to avoid any cliff-edges.\u201d Business groups have repeatedly stressed their desire for a transitional deal, with the CBI suggesting continued membership of the single market and the customs union, until new trading arrangements can be put in place. Some cabinet ministers, including Michael Gove, had been resistant to a formal transition period after Brexit day. But the new environment secretary and key leave campaigner is now reluctantly signed up, after being confronted with the reality of the risks of a \u201ccliff-edge Brexit\u201d for his department. David Davis, the Brexit secretary, has publicly softened his approach in recent weeks, telling a House of Lords select committee that \u201cpracticalities\u201d would force a need for a transition period. He insisted that a free trade deal could be concluded during the two-year formal negotiating period \u2013 but that other countries would need time to prepare new customs systems. The international trade secretary, Liam Fox, also conceded that a transition deal might be necessary; but speaking to the BBC on Thursday he insisted that striking a new trade deal with the EU \u2013 the second part of the two-stage negotiation process \u2013 would be simple. \u201cThe free trade agreement that we will have to do with the European Union should be one of the easiest in human history. \u201cWe are already beginning with zero tariffs, and we are already beginning at the point of maximal regulatory equivalence, as it is called. In other words, our rules and our laws are exactly the same.\u201d Two \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d models that could apply to the UK during the transition period include European Economic Area membership, which includes single market access and exemption from some EU rules, though members pay budget contributions and accept free movement. The Swiss model, membership of the European Free Trade Association (Efta), means access to EU market for some but not all areas of trade, with no duty to apply EU laws apart from some trade regulation, though free movement also applies. Advocates of a soft Brexit within the cabinet include the business secretary, Greg Clark, and the chancellor, Philip Hammond, who has been the target of leaks to undermine him from within the cabinet, including claims that he suggested trains were easy enough for even women to drive and argued public sector workers were overpaid. Gove will make his first speech as environment secretary on Friday where he will pledge a \u201cgreen Brexit\u201d and describe himself as \u201can environmentalist first\u201d. The newly returned cabinet minister will warn of the dangers of climate change, which he said \u201cthreatens both fragile natural habitats and developing human societies\u201d and condemned how the world had \u201callowed extractive and exploitative political systems to lay waste to natural resources.\u201d Gove will say Brexit is an opportunity to \u201creview\u201d environmental protections. \u201cOutside the European Union there is scope for Britain ... to be a global leader in environmental policy across the board,\u201d he will say, pledging to develop a \u201cglobal gold standard\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
