In an interview on Sky News on Sunday morning, the prime minister promised \u201cthere won\u2019t be checks\u201d despite warnings to the contrary in leaked Treasury documents. The documents, seized on by Labour last week, also raise the prospect that there could be tariffs on trade going the other way. However, Johnson did admit there would be checks if goods are then going on to the Republic of Ireland. During an interview on the Sophy Ridge on Sunday programme, Johnson said: \u201cThere\u2019s no question of there being checks on goods going [between] NI/GB and GB/NI because they are part of \u2013 if you look at what the deal is, we\u2019re part of the same customs territory and it\u2019s very clear that there should be unfettered access between Northern Ireland and the rest of GB \u2026 The whole of the UK comes out of the EU.\u201d Ridge asked the prime minister why he was maintaining there would be no checks when the Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay, and the government\u2019s impact assessment suggested there could be. He said: \u201cNo, the whole of the UK comes out of the EU. We\u2019re a UK government. Why would we put checks on goods going from NI to GB or GB to NI? It doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d On checks on goods heading into the Republic of Ireland and therefore the EU, Johnson said: \u201cSo the issue is how to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland and we can do that by making sure that there are \u2013 by having some checks on goods that might be proceeding into the Republic.\u201d Labour revealed on Thursday that the Treasury documents suggested there would be at the very least exit summary declarations when goods are exported from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, \u201cin order to meet EU obligations\u201d. A section headed \u201ceconomic impact on Northern Ireland\u201d suggests high street goods are \u201clikely to increase in price\u201d, and many exporters could struggle with the costs of disruptive border checks. On his \u201cAustralian-style, points-based\u201d immigration system, Johnson said immigrants would be sorted into three categories: those with exceptional talent, skilled workers, and a group who will not have the right to stay but will be allowed in to do time-limited specific jobs. He said he wanted to \u201cbear down\u201d on unskilled migration and there would be lower levels of immigration after Brexit. Johnson refused to say whether he would resign if he failed to win a majority at the general election on Thursday. The prime minister\u2019s decision to call the snap vote could hand Jeremy Corbyn the keys to No 10 \u2013 making Johnson one of the shortest-serving leaders in British history. He said he would not be drawn on his political future when asked three times if he would stand down if he failed to secure a majority. Johnson admitted he was nervous and \u201cfighting for every vote\u201d. On his manifesto promise to deliver 50,000 more nurses, he said there would be 31,000 new posts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
