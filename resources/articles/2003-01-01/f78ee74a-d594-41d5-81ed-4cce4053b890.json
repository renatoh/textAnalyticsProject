Cape Town has a magnificent location, set on a sweeping bay with the world heritage site Table Mountain as a backdrop. The Victoria &amp; Alfred Waterfront is home to many hotels and good restaurants, with Mariner's Wharf at Hout Bay the place to go for seafood. The Garden route, from Cape Town to Port Elizabeth, is a breathtaking journey. Along the 769-mile route, Mossel Bay has excellent beaches, whale-watching and great white shark diving. Knysna is another popular stop-off point, set between the Indian Ocean, Outeniqua mountains and forest. Port Elizabeth is an ideal family resort, its huge sandy beaches attracting sun worshippers. East London also has good beaches for surfers and anglers. Durban is a vibrant, cosmopolitan city with good night life. The main stretch of hotels and restaurants lie along Marine Parade. There is a strong Indian culture in the city which adds to a wide variety of cuisine. Places worth visiting include the Botanical Gardens, the African Art Centre and Umgeni Bird Park. The wildlife in South Africa is spectacular, and an opportunity to experience the Big Five should not be missed. The Kruger National Park caters mainly for self-drive visitors, although guides are available. Private game reserves offer more luxury with dawn and dusk drives and personal guides. Sanbona has recently opened on the Western Cape, a three-hour drive from Cape Town. Further east, towards Port Elizabeth, is the multi-award winning Shamwari with lodges in spectacular settings.
