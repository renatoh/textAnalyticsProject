Drew the breath with diving save to deny Zagadou 8 Juan Foyth Surprise selection. Overpowered on two occasions but got away with it. Some nice moments 7 Davinson S\u00e1nchez One or two sloppy actions but showed his pace and strength in a number of one-on-ones 7 Toby Alderweireld Solid and unflustered. His comeback has been an unheralded feature of Tottenham\u2019s season 7 Serge Aurier Maverick display. Many wobbles yet extreme adventure, outrageous flicks and an assist 7 Moussa Sissoko Grew into the game and given great ovation on substitution. Did make a few mistakes 7 Harry Winks Turned on a sixpence and always tried to inject urgency. Passing was on point 8 Jan Vertonghen Marauded forward from unfamiliar role. Supplied cross for Son\u2019s goal and scored second on the volley 9 Christian Eriksen Largely out of sync with his final ball but did supply corner for Llorente\u2019s headed goal 7 Son Heung-min Came up trumps with volley to emboss all-action performance. Major threat with pace and movement 9 Lucas Moura Skimmed post with sublime early touch and volley and had late effort blocked by Delaney 7 BORUSSIA DORTMUND Roman B\u00fcrki Saved from Son and Alderweireld but left exposed on all three of Tottenham\u2019s goals 6 Achraf Hakimi Lost ball in the build-up to Son\u2019s goal. Had previously been quick and assured 6 \u00d6mer Toprak Looked vulnerable to pace. A few important interventions but part of collective meltdown 5 Abdou Diallo Blotted his copybook by losing Son and Llorente for their respective goals. Too loose 4 Dan-Axel Zagadou Might have fired another story had his header not been brilliantly saved by Lloris 5 Mahmoud Dahoud Worked hard but did not take any risks and got nothing going in attacking terms for his side 4 Axel Witsel Positionally impressive, normally getting his angles right. Influence faded in second half 6 Thomas Delaney A model of industry. Worked Lloris from distance. Made important block to deny Lucas 6 Christian Pulisic Chelsea\u2019s incoming \u00a358m man drew early booking from Aurier but was peripheral and disappointing 5 Jadon Sancho Made things happen during excellent first half. Quick feet a feature and oozed confidence 7 Mario G\u00f6tze Flitted deep and wide in attempt to prise Spurs apart. Led press from false nine role. No real chances 5"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
