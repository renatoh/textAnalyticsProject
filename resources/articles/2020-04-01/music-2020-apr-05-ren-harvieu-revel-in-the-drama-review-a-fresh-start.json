It reached the UK top five, but she was dropped by her major label shortly after. Eight years later, the Salford singer-songwriter\u2019s second album reveals her desire for a fresh start. Working with Romeo Stodart of the Magic Numbers, she has created woozy, cinematic songs that are full of yearning and vulnerability \u2013 Teenage Mascara possesses a plush wave of harmonies, Yes Please is beguilingly delicate, and the otherwise conventional This Is How You Make Me Feel has a spacy production. Her rich voice remains the star, though, stopping the album from ever sounding twee and schmaltzy. The standout track is Cruel Disguise, where Harvieu\u2019s melancholy, powerful vocal combines with a lithe bassline and baroque rock stylings. And while the singer may no longer be flavour of the month, this is still an impressive set."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
