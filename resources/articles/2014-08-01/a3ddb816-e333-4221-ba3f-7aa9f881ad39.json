St Louis police chief Sam Dotson said the man was wielding a knife and behaving erratically before the shooting. \u2022 US attorney general Eric Holder pledged that the federal government\u2019s investigation will be \u201cfair\u201d and \u201cindependent\u201d in an editorial posted on the St Louis Post-Dispatch website. He said he supports peaceful protests but condemned the \u201cvery small minority\u201d creating violence. \u2022 This comes a day ahead of Holder\u2019s expected arrival in Ferguson. FBI and department of justice employees have been canvassing Ferguson and working with community leaders as part of the federal investigation into the shooting. \u2022 A public memorial for Michael Brown will be held on Monday, his family announced. The time and location of the service has not been released. \u2022 A grand jury will hear evidence on the shooting of Michael Brown on Wednesday, according to the Washington Post. \u201cWe know this is of interest to a lot of people around the country,\u201d Edward Magee, a spokesperson for the office of St Louis County prosecuting attorney Robert McCulloch. \u2022 The city of Ferguson issued a plea for \u201cnighttime quiet and reconciliation\u201d following the previous night\u2019s protests, which saw at least 78 people arrested. Despite intervention by the national guard, law enforcement could not quell the chaos at last night\u2019s demonstrations. Follow the Guardian\u2019s Rory Carroll (@rorycarroll72), and Chris McGreal (@ChrisMcGreal) ongoing reporting from Ferguson. Hedy Epstein, the 90-year-old Holocaust survivor arrested while protesting the situation in Ferguson, said \u201cracism is alive and well in the United States,\u201d in an interview with Newsweek. Epstein was arrested after refusing to leave a protest outside the Wainwright state building in downtown St Louis, where demonstrators had gathered to ask Missouri governor Jay Nixon to deescalate law enforcement\u2019s response to demonstrations. \u201cI\u2019m deeply, deeply troubled by what\u2019s going on in Ferguson,\u201d Epstein told Newsweek. \u201cIt\u2019s a matter of racism and injustice, and it\u2019s not only in Ferguson\u2026. Racism is alive and well in the United States. The power structure looks at anyone who\u2019s different as the other, as less worthy, and so you treat the other as someone who is less human and who needs to be controlled and who is not trusted.\u201d US attorney general Eric Holder pledged that the federal government\u2019s investigation into the shooting will be \u201cfair\u201d and \u201cindependent\u201d in an editorial posted on the St Louis Post-Dispatch website this afternoon. \u201cAt the core of these demonstrations is a demand for answers about the circumstances of this young man\u2019s death and a broader concern about the state of our criminal justice system,\u201d Holder said. \u201cAt a time when so much may seem uncertain, the people of Ferguson can have confidence that the Justice Department intends to learn \u2014 in a fair and thorough manner \u2014 exactly what happened.\u201d He said \u201cthe full resources of the department of justice\u201d are being used in the investigation, including the deployment of about 40 FBI agents and prosecutors in the department\u2019s civil rights division. He also called for calm in the streets, while acknowledging that it is being done by \u201ca very small minority.\u201d \u201cThe Justice Department will defend the right of protesters to peacefully demonstrate and for the media to cover a story that must be told,\u201d Holder said. \u201cBut violence cannot be condoned. I urge the citizens of Ferguson who have been peacefully exercising their First Amendment rights to join with law enforcement in condemning the actions of looters, vandals and others seeking to inflame tensions and sow discord.\u201d St Louis mayor Francis G Slay has just made a statement about the fatal police shooting that occurred earlier this afternoon: Slay went on to say the community members he is contacting include local pastors, the NAACP and members of the board of alderman. He then said that there will be \u201ca complete and transparent investigation to review circumstances and policies.\u201d The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) has issued a statement condemning the arrest of journalists in Ferguson. The group said it \u201cis alarmed by the continued harassment and detentions of journalists\u201d covering protests in the city. At least 11 reporters have been arrested since the protests began, according to CNN. \u201cFerguson is an international story and journalists are going to cover it. They have a right to do so without fearing for their safety or liberty,\u201d said CPJ deputy director Robert Mahoney. \u201cThe harassment and detention of reporters must stop. From senior commanders on down, the word must go out to security forces to let journalists do their job.\u201d We have more details on the police shooting that happened around 12:30pm local time in St Louis on Tuesday and left a 23-year-old African American man dead. Crowds that had gathered at the scene of the shooting became rowdy during a press conference with St Louis police chief Sam Dotson, chanting the refrain popularized by the Ferguson protests: \u201cHands up, don\u2019t shoot.\u201d Area residents were able to temporarily calm the crowd until the end of the press conference, when shouting resumed, according to the St Louis Dispatch. Dotson then entered the crowd and repeated the information he had shared with the press. Some members of the crowd asked why tasers were not used to stop the man, who was wielding a knife as he approached police. But tasers are not standard issue for St Louis police, said MSNBC\u2019s Christopher Hayes. The officers involved have been placed on administrative duty pending an investigation, Dotson said. NPR spoke with Ferguson residents who insist that despite the city\u2019s history of segregation, it has never had a strong activist culture. \u201cI think the fact that St. Louis is the catalyst for a nationwide conversation is highly ironic,\u201d said resident Etefia Umana. More from NPR: Saulsberry tells me about her daughter Mya, who just graduated from Missouri\u2019s Culver-Stockton College and who spent part of the semester in California with Angela Davis. The tragedy in Ferguson has activated young people like her Mya, she says. On cue, Mya materializes, holding a sign. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d have to practice civil disobedience so soon,\u201d she says. She\u2019s been at most of the rallies and protests. \u201cIf I\u2019m not at work, I\u2019m out here in these Ferguson streets.\u201d Though everyone is exceedingly polite on Canfield, some folks say there are some tensions. \u201cThere\u2019s a generational divide,\u201d says Demetrius Upchurch, a high school teacher from a few towns over who\u2019s here with his 4-year-old son, Aiden. He\u2019s visiting some family; his 85-year-old grandfather lives near the street where Michael Brown was killed. Upchurch says his grandfather is scared by the unrest. \u201cOld people don\u2019t understand younger people, and younger people don\u2019t understand older people.\u201d He says he tries to keep it real with his students about the police, and lets them know they can talk to him. He tells us a story from a few months back about how his son and fiance\u00e9 saw him roughed up and thrown on the ground by some local police officers. It seems a lot of people here have stories about the police. He says it\u2019s important for leadership to come from the generations raised on hip-hop, \u201cnot just some old Christian pastor who was around when Martin Luther King was around.\u201d The allusion to Jackson is not missed. A grand jury will hear from witnesses to the shooting of Michael Brown on Wednesday, according to the Washington Post. \u201cWe know this is of interest to a lot of people around the country,\u201d Edward Magee, a spokesperson for the office of St Louis County prosecuting attorney Robert McCulloch, told The Washington Post. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do this fairly and also attempt to do it in a timely manner.\u201d Evidence will be presented to a 12 member jury so they can determine whether or not the information is sufficient return an indictment on the case. More from the Post: McCulloch met with his lead prosecutors on Tuesday at 1:30 pm to review the status of the investigation and the evidence that has been gathered so far. Meanwhile, in Ferguson, protesters and some elected officials have been calling on McCulloch to step aside as the prosecutor and have an independent special prosecutor handle the case involving Wilson. In a grand jury investigation, a prosecutor alone determines whether to recommend specific criminal charges be brought. The jury can ask questions to determine whether the evidence warrants the charges, while no outside lawyers for the victim or the defendant can be present or ask questions. The victim had stolen two energy drinks from a convenience store and was wielding a knife and acting erratically, said Dotson. Dotson said witnesses could hear the man saying: \u201cshoot me now, kill me now.\u201d He said the man did not respond to demands to drop his weapon as he approached the officers, carrying the knife with an overhand gesture. The man was within three to four feet of the officers when they shot him. \u201cI think officer safety is the number one issue,\u201d Dotson said. Police have shot dead a 23-year-old African American in St Louis, according to Sam Dotson, the St Louis City chief of police. Anthony Gray, an attorney representing the family of Michael Brown, told the LA Times a public memorial for Brown will be held on Monday. The location and time of the service have not been announced. As our live blog coverage continues, here\u2019s where things stand in Ferguson on Tuesday afternoon. \u2022 Police arrested 78 people during the most recent night of protests, according to a list reportedly from the St Louis County Justice Services. Only four of those people are residents of Ferguson, while 50 are residents of the St Louis area. \u2022 The City of Ferguson called for \u201cnighttime quiet and reconciliation\u201d on Tuesday. The city said it is exploring actions including efforts to increase the amount of black law enforcement officers, encourage police officers to live in the city and that it would work to acquire dash and vest cams on police officers. \u2022 The Michael Brown shooting investigation is going smoothly a US attorney said in an interview with Time. \u201cWhile the lack of details surrounding the shooting may frustrate the media and breed suspicion among those already distrustful of the system, those closely guarded details give law enforcement the best yardsticks for measuring whether witnesses are truthful,\u201d said Richard A Callahan. This update comes a day before US attorney general Eric Holder is set to arrive in Ferguson. \u2022 The Ferguson-Florissant School District has delayed the start of school into next week because of \u201ccontinued unrest in and around Ferguson.\u201d Despite the cancellation, teachers carried signs offering to educate students outside a local library in the morning. \u2022 The Guardian\u2019s Rory Carroll examined the protesters who are said to be outside agitators bent on maintaining the chaos. \u201cIf you don\u2019t live here you don\u2019t worry about the burning and looting,\u201d said Steve Beale, 27, who works at an electrical goods store. \u2022 UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon called on US authorities to be sure they are protecting the rights of protesters in Ferguson. \u201cThe Secretary-General calls on the authorities to ensure that the rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression are protected,\u201d a UN spokesperson said. Police arrested 78 people in Ferguson during the most recent overnight protests, according to NBC News and local St Louis news channel KSDK, which published a list reportedly from St Louis Justice Services. Only four people arrested are residents of Ferguson, 50 are residents of the St Louis area and 19 are out-of-state residents. The remaining five are from other parts of Missouri. Of those arrests, 75 were for failure to disperse, two were for unlawful use of a weapon and one person, from Illinois, was arrested for interfering with an officer. QuikTrip, a company that had a store location looted and destroyed during protests, said it is making sure employees at its Ferguson location have access to counseling and is offering to transfer them to nearby stores. \u201cHonestly, the only focus we have is we\u2019re taking care of employees and customers at other locations,\u201d QuickTrip spokesperson Michael Thornbrugh told Tulsa World. \u201cWe\u2019ve been unable to even go in and do anything else at the location.\u201d The company has not decided whether it will rebuild the store and is leaving security issues to local police. \u201cWith all due respect, there\u2019s nothing left to protect,\u201d he told the St Louis Business Journal. A US attorney working on the Michael Brown shooting case said the investigation is going smoothly in an interview with Time. \u201cWhile the lack of details surrounding the shooting may frustrate the media and breed suspicion among those already distrustful of the system, those closely guarded details give law enforcement the best yardsticks for measuring whether witnesses are truthful,\u201d said Richard A Callahan, US attorney for the eastern district of Missouri. \u201cWithout those yardsticks, an investigation becomes more of a guessing game or popularity contest than a search for the truth.\u201d He said FBI agents have canvassed the area surrounding the shooting scene and are collecting informations from witnesses. Physical evidence is also being analyzed following the completion of an autopsy ordered by the federal government. This update comes a day before US attorney general Eric Holder is set to arrive in Ferguson. St Louis Post-Dispatch photographer David Carson, who took the photo currently at the top of this live blog, rode along with the St Louis County Police tactical team during Monday night\u2019s protests. The Post-Dispatch has a gallery of his behind-the-scenes experience. Michael Brown\u2019s parents said they believe protests in Ferguson would end if justice was brought to the police officer who shot and killed their unarmed son. The officer, Darren Wilson, left his home shortly after Brown was shot and has not been charged with any crimes. \u201cJustice will bring peace I believe,\u201d Lesley McSpadden, Brown\u2019s mother, told the Today show\u2019s Matt Lauer in a Monday morning interview. \u201cHim being arrested, charges being filed and a prosecution. Him being held accountable for what he did.\u201d His mother said she is still waiting to know why her son was killed. The Guardian\u2019s Jessica Glenza has more details on the interview. Police arrested Getty photographer Scott Olson on Monday evening. These are some of the photos he has been taking during the protests. More can be seen in this gallery. The Guardian\u2019s Rory Carroll has been on the ground in Ferguson since last week. He checked out claims that many of the most volatile protesters are outsiders who showed up in Ferguson because they are attracted to the chaos. Carroll reports: Volunteers \u2013 locals and outsiders \u2013 had for a time kept a fragile peace by linking arms and forcing rowdy youths, many covering their faces with masks and bandannas, back from lines of police with riot gear and armoured vehicles. \u201cRelax. If we relax, they relax,\u201d said one man with a megaphone. For a time it worked, and it seemed Ferguson could break the cycle of violent confrontation. Then, about 500 metres down the other end of the avenue, in front of the ruins of a destroyed QuikTrip store that has been a focus of the protests here, a small group of youths tore up street signs and threw bottles at police. Then at least one of them opened fire, triggering a heavy police response of stun grenades and teargas which made the town, yet again, resemble a war zone. \u201cIf you don\u2019t live here you don\u2019t worry about the burning and looting,\u201d said Steve Beale, 27, who works at an electrical goods store. \u201cYou don\u2019t worry about stores closing, or losing your job, or walking for miles to buy food. Well, I live here and I do worry.\u201d The City of Ferguson has called for \u201cnighttime quiet and reconciliation\u201d per a release handed out on Tuesday and published by reporter Faith Abub\u00e9y. \u201cIt is our hope that as we continue to work for the wellbeing of Ferguson, residents will stay home at night, allow peace to settle in, and allow for the justice process to take its course,\u201d the flyer said. \u201cWe owe it to our children to be able to return to school and work together peacefully for Ferguson\u2019s future.\u201d \u201cWe plan to learn from this tragedy, as we further provide for the safety of our residents and businesses and progress our community through reconciliation and healing.\u201d It said that city leadership is working with \u201cexisting community relationships\u201d and residents to start a new dialogue and create long and short term solutions to the city\u2019s issues. The release says they are exploring actions including efforts to increase the amount of black law enforcement officers, encourage police officers to live in the city and work to acquire dash and vest cams on police officers. Initiatives to improve local business and youth programs are also being explored, the city said. Norm Stamper, a Seattle police chief from 1994 to 2000, writes for The Guardian about how the police can work with its community in times of protest, like he tried to do during the 1999 WTO protests. Meanwhile, the police department needs to immediately begin a process of demilitarization and replace the military model with a community policing model. As part of that, they should adopt the \u201cMemphis model\u201d of crisis intervention \u2013 requiring every employee to undergo a week of intensive training in defusing and de-escalation techniques conducted by mental health and communications experts. And they need to prohibit Swat operations for anything other than school shootings, armed hostage situations and other immediate crises when negotiations fail and lives are at stake. So should every police department in America. It\u2019s clear that Ferguson\u2019s police officers, politicians and community leaders haven\u2019t yet really embraced a philosophy of \u201ccommunity policing\u201d, and that they weren\u2019t working in partnership to identify and solve crime, traffic and other community-police problems \u2013 not with a police force that is 93% white in a city that is two-thirds black, or with a trove of military garb waiting in the wings. Some in the Ferguson area, like Missouri State Highway Patrol Captain Ron Johnson, understand the basics. But you can\u2019t reverse the effects of years of military-style policing in a few hours of walking among protesters. Still, law enforcement officers in Ferguson \u2013 and in so many other places \u2013 need to start somewhere. They need to start here ... or else they\u2019ll just keep failing in all the same ways. Every night of demonstrations in Ferguson is followed by a batch of volunteers showing up at the scenes of the protests in the morning to clean-up debris like gas canisters and broken glass. UN secretary general Ban Ki-Moon on Monday called for US authorities to ensure protesters\u2019 rights are protected in Ferugson, reports Reuters. \u201cThe Secretary-General calls on the authorities to ensure that the rights to peaceful assembly and freedom of expression are protected,\u201d UN spokesperson Stephane Dujarric told reporters. \u201cHe calls on all to exercise restraint, for law enforcement officials to abide by U.S. and international standards in dealing with demonstrators,\u201d Dujarric said. The Ferguson-Florissant School District has again delayed the start of school, cancelling classes through the week. \u201cWe believe that closing schools for the rest of this week will allow needed time for peace and stability to be restored to our community and allow families to plan ahead for the additional days that children will be out of school,\u201d the district said on its homepage. \u201cWhile we deeply regret this delay to the start of the 2014-2015 school year, our first priority is the safety of our students.\u201d District officials made this decision after speaking with local law enforcement and district security staff. The first day of school was supposed to be Thursday, 14 August, but school officials postponed the start to Monday because of the protests. It announced on Sunday night that classes would also be cancelled on Monday because of \u201ccontinued unrest in and around Ferguson.\u201d Some teachers, however, are offering to help students in the local library. Guardian columnist Steven Thrasher says that the real looting of Ferguson, and across the US, is that its black citizens are marginalized by structural racism. Thrasher writes: It\u2019s not like the \u201cbest\u201d stores of Ferguson \u2013 the McDonald\u2019s or the Walgreen\u2019s, for instance \u2013 provide much more than minimum wage jobs, barely helpful for subsistence living. The dollar stores pedaling cheap goods and unhealthy food that no one needs aren\u2019t much better. And it\u2019s undeniable that the worst of Ferguson\u2019s businesses \u2013 the many legal loan sharks who blight its streets \u2013 are actively strangling the last breaths from Ferguson\u2019s black residents who are already on the margins. Will looting solve any of this? No. But will bringing in the National Guard to protect the very loan sharks and fast food restaurants who are exploiting us? Hell no! And let\u2019s face it: fear of these businesses getting destroyed is what\u2019s bringing the troops in, not big-picture concerns about the legal looting of human lives. Racism, looting Missouri since crackers owned slaves, lit Ferguson on fire \u2013 not some looter with a firecracker. Too often, a call for non-violence becomes a blanket excuse to do nothing and maintain the status quo. The National Guard is coming in to maintain the status quo and that is unacceptable \u2013 because black Missourians, like most African Americans, were already drowning in the status quo when Mike Brown was still alive. Missouri state highway patrol captain Ron Johnson became emotional at a 2.20am press conference on Monday morning as he discussed the continued chaos in Ferguson. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make this neighbourhood whole, we\u2019re going to make this community whole, and we\u2019re going to do it together,\u201d said Johnson, close to tears. \u201cAnd I am not going to let criminals who come here from across the country or live in this community define this neighbourhood.\u201d Johnson defended action by law enforcement and urged peaceful protesters to contain their actions to daytime. He successfully lead a peaceful protest on Thursday after being brought in to command law enforcement\u2019s response to the protests, but the positive energy quickly dissipated as chaos returned the following night. Welcome to our live coverage of the situation in Ferguson, Missouri, where national guard intervention has failed to bring calm to the streets as protesters continue to demonstrate following the fatal shooting of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown 10 days ago. Police arrested 31 people during the overnight protests, which were marked by gunfire, teargas and stun grenades. Those arrested include people from as far away as New York and California, said Captain Ron Johnson of the Missouri state highway patrol during an early morning press conference. Police also arrested a Getty photographer on Monday. Johnson defended law enforcement\u2019s response to the demonstrations and urged protesters to contain demonstrations to daytime in order to prevent the \u201ctiny minority of lawbreakers\u201d from getting cover in the night. As community members clean up gas cans, broken bottles and other debris on Tuesday morning, people are waiting to see if the riots continue into this evening or if peace can be brought to the city. Details on the shooting are still unclear, as witnesses have presented contradictory accounts of the shooting and Ferguson police have yet to release the results of its autopsy, despite Brown\u2019s family sharing the results of their private autopsy late Sunday night. President Barack Obama is back on vacation after taking a break on Monday to meet with attorney general Eric Holder about the situation. At a Monday press conference, Obama said Holder would be going to Ferguson but took a detached tone when speaking about the racial issues behind the protests. We will provide continuing coverage as the events unfold throughout the day."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
