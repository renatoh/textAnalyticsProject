This week the Scottish Amateur champion failed to make it into the last 32 of the Amateur championship at Royal Porthcawl, beaten by one hole by Richard Walker in the first round. Hume played superbly at Woburn to make the cut among the professionals of the European Tour but yesterday fell victim to the ancient amateur adage that two up and five to play never wins. Walker, 32, a former pro, had been three down after only five and was still two down after 14. But he holed from 30 feet at the 15th, saw Hume three-putt the 16th and then eagled the long 17th to take what transpired to be a winning lead. Richard Finch was another to experience the vagaries of form. On Tuesday he played the round of his life, getting round Pyle and Kenfig in the qualifying event in a course-record 61. Yesterday he was beaten by a 23-year-old Californian, Mike Plate, who plays off plus two and was one of only two Americans, out of an entry of 33, to qualify for the match-play stages. The other, Robert Funk, second cousin to the US Tour player Fred Funk, was beaten by Thomas Sundstrom. It is an astonishing fact that Finland, Sundstrom's home country, entered 13 players into this championship, qualified six and there are still three left. The game gets ever more global. One former champion, Craig Watson of East Renfrewshire, was beaten by Limerick's Tim Rice and another, Gary Wolstenholme, progressed at the expense of Craig Shave. Wolstenholme, who won in 1991, is the reigning South African stroke-play champion and has won the Berkhamsted Trophy, the Hampshire Hog and the Lagonda Trophy already this year. He also has his eye on a place in England's team for the Eisenhower Tro phy to be played in Malaysia later this year. Competition for the Eisenhower team will be stiff, and two other hopefuls, Zane Scotland and Jamie Elson, both won. Scotland, 19, beat the Scottish international Marc Warren and yesterday had six birdies in his 4 &amp; 3 victory. Scotland leads the life of the full-time amateur. Already this year he has played in Argentina, Malaysia, South Africa and Australia, and is the current champion of both Spain and Portugal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
