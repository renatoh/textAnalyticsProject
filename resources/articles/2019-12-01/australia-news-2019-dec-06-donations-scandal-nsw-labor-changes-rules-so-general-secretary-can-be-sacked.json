The federal leader, Anthony Albanese, and NSW leader Jodi McKay released the interim report of a review of the troubled branch on Friday, committing to implement all recommendations of former attorney general Michael Lavarch. The new rules, which are designed to weaken the all-powerful general secretary position and remove conflicts of interest in the party\u2019s most senior management, will apply from February. The review was launched in October to prevent a repeat of shocking allegations that the party accepted $100,000 in banned developer donations from Huang Xiangmo, which resulted in the suspension and then exit of the general secretary Kaila Murnain. The report noted that although that most recent incident was \u201cbad enough\u201d, the last two secretaries had left \u201cfollowing damaging controversies\u201d, none of the last six secretaries had served full terms and \u201can earlier [independent commission against corruption] inquiry led to the conviction of two former Labor state ministers\u201d. Under the proposed changes, NSW Labor will have a president elected by 75% of its conference \u2013 ensuring the position is not controlled by any one faction \u2013 to function as a chair of the new state executive board. The NSW general secretary \u2013 akin to a chief executive \u2013 will still be responsible for day-to-day running of the branch, but Lavarch said the job would now come with a \u201cproper definition of the role\u201d, key performance indicators and rules on delegation of powers to other officers. The secretary will be barred from seeking elected office for five years from the date of their appointment. The nine-member state executive board will consist of the president, three vice-presidents and five other board members, also elected by 75% of conference. The board in turn will appoint the four members of a new structurally separate audit and risk committee, whose members can be drawn from outside the party. Lavarch said that would ensure that the political and compliance sides of the party would be separated to \u201cremove confusion between management and oversight\u201d. McKay said she would prefer the audit and risk committee be non-members, praising the new structures for creating \u201cchecks and balances that we have been missing as a political party\u201d. Albanese said the reforms \u201cabout accountability, transparency [and] increasing democracy\u201d would \u201cchange the culture\u201d of the branch. \u201cThese structural reforms will ensure the NSW branch never again commits the sort of mistakes we\u2019ve seen that have lead to embarrassment of ordinary party members about the activities that have occurred in recent years.\u201d McKay described the changes as \u201csweeping\u201d, highlighting the importance of improved accountability for the general secretary, including that they can be sacked for poor performance. Under the rules the secretary and assistant secretaries can be sacked by 75% of the 40-person administrative committee, an existing structure which survives the reforms. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a difficult time in the past and I think what the events of the Icac showed is that we need to have a mechanism in place that when the general secretary didn\u2019t perform \u2026 that they could be released from that role,\u201d McKay said. Albanese said the reforms cured the \u201cpapal infallibility\u201d of the general secretary. McKay said the final report would deal with Labor action committees, such as Chinese Friends of Labor."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
