The comment, a simple no to a question from Radio Five Live in a round of morning interviews to mark his election, was a rare admission for a British politician, especially a party leader. Later, in a clarifying statement, Clegg implied he was at the agnostic end of the atheist spectrum. \"I have enormous respect for people who have religious faith. I'm married to a Catholic and am committed to bringing my children up as Catholics,\" he said. \"However, I myself am not an active believer, but the last thing I would do when talking or thinking about religion is approach it with a closed heart or a closed mind.\" Rowan Williams, the Archbishop of Canterbury, told Five Live later: \"It matters less to me than to know that they [politicians] are honest and reliable and that what beliefs they have they hold sincerely. \"This isn't a country where Christianity is imposed by law ... obviously, I would prefer it if he were a Christian but you know, his integrity is what matters.\" Keith Porteous Wood, director of the National Secular Society, said: \"I do not think it will make him less popular. However, I do think that some people who represent religious institutional views may try to make his political life difficult as a result of that.\" Clegg was also uncertain when asked about his declared enthusiasm for David Bowie. He said his favourite Bowie album was Changes, a greatest hits compilation. Five Live listeners texting the programme immediately doubted him. Clegg revealed yesterday he had drafted former Bowie collaborator Brian Eno as an adviser on \"how we can reach out beyond Westminster\". Clegg stuck to the script by speaking of his \"message of optimism, energy and ambition\" after beating rival Chris Huhne by 511 votes. He also shared David Cameron's reluctance to talk about any past drug use. \"I'm going to cast a veil over that ... I think politicians are entitled to a private life before they go into politics,\" he said. But he criticised the Conservative leader's support for tax breaks for marriage. \"What I want to do is talk up the idea of family life in all its different guises and not be exclusive, and particularly not try to use the tax system in effect to make moral judgments about the kind of family you live in,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
