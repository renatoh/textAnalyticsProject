He tells her he\u2019s going to Las Vegas. She\u2019d only worry, he says. This was one of many lovely personal touches in The Massacre that Shook the Empire (Saturday, Channel 4), about the slaying of hundreds of Indians by the British-Indian army in Amritsar in 1919. In less than an hour, the programme succeeded in bringing together sensitive reporting of the massacre and the context in which it took place; angrily examining our \u201cwilful amnesia\u201d about the brutality of the British empire and our idea of British exceptionalism; and offering many insights into the second-generation experience. Despite the grave subject matter, there was a lightness of touch, thanks to Sanghera\u2019s charm as presenter. The weird nuggets of personal information he offers up \u2013 that one of his uncles killed another uncle, that he got a brain parasite the last time he visited India \u2013 bring a quirky edge. He speaks bad Punjabi to a group of men in the street, trying to find out where to buy a lathi \u2013 a long stick the British claimed was being used as a weapon by Indian protesters \u2013 and they think he\u2019s after some lassi, \u201ca kind of Indian yoghurt,\u201d he deadpans. But this is a serious documentary. A century ago, soldiers shot 379 (officially, though likely to be many more) people, including children and babies, who were at the Jallianwala Bagh park in Amritsar. \u201cI believe,\u201d says Sanghera, \u201cthe Amritsar massacre was the moment Britain lost its empire.\u201d Churchill said later that it was an isolated event in British rule \u2013 the fault, essentially, of one rogue senior officer. He was Reginald Dyer, and Sanghera visits his great-granddaughter, Caroline \u2013 she has the look of an aged royal\u2019s lady-in-waiting \u2013 to find out if his family live in eternal shame. But Caroline reveres him. He was an \u201chonest, obedient soldier\u201d who, she claims, was being charged at by 25,000 people, and is iffy about the murdered babies. I\u2019m not convinced of the value of asking Dyer\u2019s great-granddaughter what he might have been thinking, but their meeting is deliciously awkward. Dyer \u201chad a lot of friends who were Indians,\u201d she says. \u201cWe all adored the Indians and I\u2019m delighted to meet you,\u201d she tells Sanghera. \u201cI think I\u2019m probably more British than Indian,\u201d he replies. The unpicking of identity and the effect of the massacre down the century is the sparkling undercurrent here. Sanghera, whose parents emigrated to the UK from just outside Amritsar, looks uncomfortable on one of the Punjabi city\u2019s narrow streets as a man drives up close behind him on a scooter. \u201cIf my parents had stayed here, this is the kind of place I would have grown up.\u201d The site of the massacre has topiary in the shape of riflemen and white squares are painted on the walls to frame the bullet scars. A historian says he believes the true figure of those killed could be up to 600 \u2013 including bystanders enjoying the park with their families \u2013 and Sanghera reads some horrific testimonies of those who were there. As if the massacre wasn\u2019t bad enough, in the aftermath the Brits implemented \u201cfancy punishments\u201d, which included public floggings, making Indians salute white people on the street (punished by torture if they failed) and a \u201ccrawling order\u201d, where Indian men were made to crawl down a street. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to read this,\u201d he says of the testimonies, \u201cand not feel physically sick.\u201d Sanghera \u2013 all slick metropolitan uniform of smart jacket and white trainers \u2013 is the product of his British education and says he hadn\u2019t given much thought to what empire meant. Not many of us have, even though it explains so much about our inflated view of our position in the world \u2013 especially pertinent at the moment. \u201cIf we can\u2019t be honest about Britain in India 100 years ago then how can we be honest about how we view Britain in the future?\u201d asks Raj Kohli, a descendant of a survivor, at a meeting with Caroline Dyer \u2013 she is used in the most contrived ways, but at least is a catalyst for good quotes. It feels like a genuine revelation to Sanghera that the British empire is, as he describes it, \u201can exercise in institutionalised racism\u201d. Don\u2019t many of us know this? Although it takes the specifics of a documentary such as this to confront it. In a taxi on the way to his family\u2019s home in Wolverhampton he admits \u201cit fundamentally changes the way I see my country and my place in it.\u201d He wants the British government to apologise (it declined to do so to mark the centenary last week, although the prime minister, Theresa May, expressed \u201cdeep regret\u201d). It\u2019s hard to watch this and not feel the same."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
