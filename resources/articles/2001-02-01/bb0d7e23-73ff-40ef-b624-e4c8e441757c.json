Graham Taylor is hoping his Watford team hold a return ticket in the play-off lottery while his opposite number Paul Jewell can only dream about such things after sinking to the bottom of the pile. Watford may get even luckier, according to their wing-back Neil Cox, a positive thinker despite the scars of promotion battles won and lost with Middlesbrough and Bolton. His current team may be nine points behind second-placed Bolton, albeit with a game in hand, but Cox insists that the gap can be closed in the final third of the season, when pressure sometimes turns form upside down. \"We haven't given up on second place, definitely not. When this club went up last time they won nine out of the last 10 games,\" Cox said. \"We've got 17 games left and I've just said to the lads 'Another 17 wins and we're there.' We've got a lot of games against teams in the lower half. \"Bolton are in the FA Cup and that can affect things. They've all got to play one another as well but we've played most of them twice already. And this squad is experienced; we've been through it before and that's vital.\" Jewell, hoping to complete a deal for Manchester City's striker Gareth Taylor this week, has pushed young players in when he needs experience, but it is the only way to go for a club in chaos. In fact he may already be thinking long term - Hillsborough-speak for the Second Division. Publicly he says his players - locally labelled the Grange Hill XI - can keep the club in the First Division, even though their record of five points from the last 27 is a sure signpost to relegation. Wednesday have 16 games remaining and probably need to win half of them. \"We've got a hell of a battle. It's going to be a fight but there is a lot of football left yet and I think we'll get the points we need,\" said Jewell. Paolo Vernazza opened the scoring though Gerald Sibon equalised for the hosts. Darren Ward restored Watford's lead then Efan Ekoku, who should have scored earlier at 0-0, replied .But Tommy Smith hit the winner after the break. There is hope for Wednesday. They made chances in the first half, fought back twice, and should have been awarded an 80th-minute penalty when Gilles de Bilde was clearly brought down by Robert Page. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
