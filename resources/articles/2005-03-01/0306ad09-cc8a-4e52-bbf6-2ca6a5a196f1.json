The Scottish Media Group-owned station has signed a deal with music-to-mobile technology company Sydus allowing people to access Virgin Radio and its sister stations, Virgin Radio Classic Rock and Virgin Radio Groove, on their phones. Virgin Radio broadcasts on analogue FM in London and crackly old AM nationwide, so listeners outside the capital could benefit from a better quality broadcast on 3G. Software can be downloaded from the station's website onto a 3G phone for free and the stations are then accessed via a Virgin Radio logo on the phone's screen. At the moment mobile phone users can listen to the radio through their hands-free headsets if their phone has an integral analogue FM radio receiver. But the Virgin Radio deal is the first time radio will be streamed over the 3G spectrum and there are about 30 handsets that are compatible. However, UK 3G phone users are unlikely to start listening to Virgin Radio through their hands-free headsets right away because it will be very expensive. In countries where the local mobile network operators offer unlimited access 3G packages for a set monthly fee it will not cost any extra to listen in to Virgin. In the US, for instance, unlimited bundles cost about $20 (\u00a310.40) a month and in India they are $11 (\u00a35.70) a month. There are almost 15 million people worldwide with 3G phones. Virgin Radio needs to convince the UK's mobile network operators to offer a package that makes 3G radio affordable and has meetings with two of the operators lined up. \"As far as we - and Sydus - are aware this is the first radio application for a 3G mobile phone. It was what 3G was made for. We were promised that 3G would bring all kinds of brilliant content but you only get the occasional video clip. Radio is content that is useful to a lot of people,\" said James Cridland, the head of new media at Virgin Radio. He believes the Virgin Radio service could be a key point for the mobile phone operators to sell 3G to their customers. Four years ago the country's five mobile network operators paid \u00a322.5bn to buy the 3G licences from the government and need to recoup the money by offering content that consumers want to use at an affordable price. At present 3G phones in the UK are used mainly for photo messaging and video clips from football matches. Many people rarely use the 3G services on their phones at all. Some radio companies in the UK have started to link up with mobile phone operators to offer music services in preparation for cheaper access and wider content making mobile 3G services more affordable in the future. Orange has a tie-in with the commercial radio chart show Hit40 UK to send users the title of each chart track as it is counted down on the radio show, allowing users to download the track or ring tones. And BT and Classic FM-owner GWR have a joint project called Livetime designed to use GWR's national digital radio network to beam videos, music and text messages to mobile phone users. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
