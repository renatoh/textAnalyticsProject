This weekend Billy Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers' Union, finally agreed terms with Royal Mail chief executive Adam Crozier over pay, pensions and working practices after months of fraught negotiations. Tomorrow afternoon, the union's executive board will meet to rubber-stamp the package, which will then be put to the union's 130,000 Royal Mail members, who are expected to vote to accept it. The union has called off all planned action while the ballot is held, which is expected to take up to a month. Both sides will claim victory in the dispute that has paralysed the postal network. The dispute - which began in June when Royal Mail made its first offer of a pay rise linked to efficiency improvements - has seen the first national postal strikes take place since 1996. It is understood the deal includes phasing out up to 92 'Spanish practices' such as staff who complete their delivery round early being paid extra for doing more work, or automatically earning overtime if the amount of mail reaches a certain level. Neither side, however, would confirm details of the agreement. Royal Mail has argued throughout the dispute that introducing modern working methods is essential to its survival. It is expected to keep its current pension scheme open to existing employees but it is understood the union has backed down on demands to include new recruits. A 2.5 per cent pay rise this year will be followed by a smaller rise next year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
