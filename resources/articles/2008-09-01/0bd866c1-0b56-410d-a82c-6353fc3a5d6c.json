Despite being the reigning European senior champion and having competed at the Beijing Olympics, Daley, 14, had previously been too young to enter a junior championships. Daley, who will compete in the three-metre category today, qualified in first place for the 10-metre event, just one point ahead of China's Xiu Bo, and kept his lead through three rounds before dropping points on his final dive. Britain's James Milton, a potential partner for Daley in the synchro, was fourth, while China's Wu Dongliang took bronze."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
