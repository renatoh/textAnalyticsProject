May, a longtime environmental activist and lawyer, won leadership of the party in 2006, after a 17-year stint as executive director of the Sierra Club. Her long tenure with Canada\u2019s Greens, helped make her one of the most recognizable faces in the country\u2019s fight against climate change. She oversaw a number of firsts for the party \u2013 including multiple seats in the house of commons, provincial wins in Prince Edward Island and Ontario. But she was unable to transform growing concerns over the climate crisis into greater representation in parliament. Although polls in the run-up to the election put the Greens ahead the leftwing NDP, May\u2019s party failed to translate that lead in victories, while the NDP captured 24 seats. The Greens had previously mused about winning enough seats to hold the balance of power in a minority government scenario. While May will no longer head the Greens federally, she will continue to lead a caucus of three members, herself included, in parliament. She also pledged to bring \u201cmassive\u201d and \u201ctransformative\u201d changes to Canada\u2019s climate policy in the upcoming parliament \u2013 and has been a frequent critic of prime minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s policies, which she says are inadequate. In a recent interview with the Guardian, May said she believes \u201cCanadian views are changing\u201d and that the \u201cold political parties are letting people down\u201d. May\u2019s resignation is effectively immediately, meaning Jo-Anne Roberts, a former journalist and Green party candidate who placed third in the October federal election will take over as interim leader today. Possible contenders to replace May include Alex Tyrrell, leader of the Quebec Green party, who has criticised May\u2019s comments on the oil sands and abortion. Tyrrell and a small group of Greens launched a petition last week for a \u201cfree and fair\u201d vote for a new party leader in the coming months. With May\u2019s resignation, the party will now vote for a new leader in 2020 at the annual Green convention."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
