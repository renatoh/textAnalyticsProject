Again. Recently the Mayor's office has taken to firing off letters to the paper in an attempt to clarify inaccuracies. But no missive has been published. Now Diary hears that a joint letter from Ken and the Department of Transport, fiercely rejecting the paper's claims that a recent meeting between the Mayor and Minister John Spellar ended in acrimony, has also bitten the dust. The Standard has told Spellar's people it will publish the letter only if Ken's name is taken off. Even Pravda would have balked at such an ultimatum. Wide boy Deep concern among 'friends' of Alan Yentob, left, as he prepares for a forthcoming stint presenting highbrow arts programmes - think Sister Wendy with fewer teeth. Several BBC pals are quietly suggesting Al attend a gym in preparation for the move. An unkind soul mutters: 'With new widescreen technology his present girth would frighten the viewers.' Projectile Max In between presenting the International Press Awards at Reuters, signing up Leeds United FC as clients and extolling the virtues of Sophie Rhys-Jones' PR skills for BBC1's My Worst Week, PR guru Max Clifford made a flying visit to Blackpool Pleasure Beach last week where, for a reported \u00a325,000 fee, he opened its latest ride, the \u00a31 million Spin Doctor. Invitations to try the ride were declined, however. 'I had just enjoyed a very good lunch and intended hanging onto its contents,' the maestro tells Diary , although, ever the pro, he considered the extra column inches he could have generated for the ride if he were to chunder on the VIPs below. Big brother where art thou? Conclusive proof that Big Brother's Jade is not a waste of space. Diary's heroine and her fellow BB cohorts helped Channel 4's digital channel E4 attract a chunky 4.6 per cent of viewers in multichannel homes while the series was shown, according to figures from rating agency Barb. Sadly, E4's share of viewers has slumped to 0.8 per cent now that BB is over - below where it was before the series started. This has been the pattern since the first BB was screened. Inevitably it means a fourth series will be commissioned next year, as even the unquestionable delights of programmes such as Dawson's Creek don't seem able to suck in those pesky young viewers. Give that woman a chat show. Fistral fisticuffs Shabby goings on at the World Qualifying Series Surfing event in Newquay last weekend. At the winners' presentation, camera crews from Carlton and the BBC almost came to blows over gaining access to the press pit at the front of the stage. As both crews squared up to each other, bouncers hauled them away. The bickering could still be heard as the opening speeches started. Neil and pray he goes 'A dramatically smaller, streamlined BBC would ensure that more money ends up on the screen so that the licence fee goes further,' thundered one genius back in the early 1990s. Such a view may be at odds with that of the maniacally imperialist Greg Dyke, but Diary is sure this won't harm the chances of Andrew Neil (for 'twas he) in his quest to be a regular face on Newsnight, a move that, tragically, would see him depart the Barclay Brothers empire. We know Andrew's staff on the Business and the Scotsman will be wishing him every success in his attempt to land the new job. The aid of the party It makes for scintillating reading, the electoral commission's register of donations to political parties. Diary was intrigued to learn Eddie Izzard coughed up \u00a310,000 for Labour while Richard 'I don't believe it' Wilson managed \u00a31,500. But Diary was dismayed to see its former PR firm, Brunswick, shelled out \u00a39,000 to help Mr Blair fight the good fight. And we thought boss Alan Parker was true blue. Express purposes An interesting compare-and-contrast exercise last week. The Telegraph, reporting parent company Hollinger's figures, headlined the article with the prosaic 'Hollinger reports'. The piece proudly stated that Hollinger 'raised profits from comparable operations in the first half of the current year.' The Express, however, saw things differently. Under the headline 'Telegraph group sinks deeper into red', the paper detailed how Hollinger had racked up overall losses of \u00a385.6 million in the first six months of the year. Wonder of Wooliesgate Another day, another problem for the coruscating minds entrusted with enhancing the image of high street basket case Woolworths. The dears were forced to think on their feet when comedian Paul Kaye, below, recently referred to himself in an interview as a 'c**t' for taking part in a \u00a320 million ad campaign designed to woo shoppers back. The swift reprimand from Woolies (which is paying him \u00a3100,000 for his efforts) was rapidly transmitted to the press and transformed into a 'Woolies gags comedian' splash. With tongues firmly in cheeks, the spat has become known internally as Woolworths' C**tgate."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
