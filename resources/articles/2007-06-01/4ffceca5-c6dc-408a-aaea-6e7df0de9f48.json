There are four suites and 14 large bright double rooms with the kind of mountain views you'd only expect to see after a day's hiking; I could see all the way to the sea from my balcony. There's local Andaluc\u00edan food served in the restaurant, and while it's a relatively large country hotel with an outdoor swimming pool, all the rubbish is recycled, and each year the three Spanish owners have introduced a new eco feature, such as solar heating for the water and a waste water irrigation system. \u00b7 0034 952 112111, cerrodehijar.com.
