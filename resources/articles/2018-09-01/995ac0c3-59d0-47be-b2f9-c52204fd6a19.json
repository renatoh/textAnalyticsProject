He was the same person as he is now. He liked to show off a little bit but he\u2019s a very nice guy. \u201cHe was always very natural but of course he\u2019s a superstar now. But he\u2019s always the same. He liked to laugh, to talk. He has a big personality. He had the [confidence] because he was good on the pitch as well. To show off, it\u2019s good sometimes.\u201d Watford, with a 100% record after four games, have double United\u2019s points tally, with Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s side appearing at times this season to be teetering on the brink of a crisis. \u201cIf they are a little bit in trouble we have to take our chance to win the game,\u201d Doucour\u00e9 said. \u201cI knew Paul for a long time and it\u2019s always great to play against him, but I want to be better than him on the pitch. I want to win the battle in midfield and to win the game.\u201d The 25-year-old has not given up hope of joining Pogba in the senior France side. \u201cOf course it\u2019s one of my dreams to have a call-up,\u201d he said. \u201cI think I have to be very good on the pitch and of course Watford have to be at the top as well to have more visibility for me. I can have a call-up this year.\u201d Despite Watford confounding the bookmakers to sit third in the league Doucour\u00e9 dismissed the possibility of Watford emulating the Leicester side of 2015-16 and winning it. \u201cEverything can change very quickly,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are very strong teams with very strong squads and it\u2019s hard to compete against them. We can win against anyone but we are not the new Leicester.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
