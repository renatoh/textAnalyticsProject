As I'm sure you're all aware, Friday is National Thank You Day (What, no one told you? I've been stocking up on cards since, oh, five minutes ago). Research company Maritz has found that 19% of us are never thanked for our hard work, and a third of workers are thanked twice a year or less. This would be bad news in itself, but it gets worse. Maritz has called in MP John Greenway to support the campaign (presumably Jordan was unavailable). He says: \"Saying thank you costs nothing, but can be the most valuable ingredient in the motivation of staff\". Groundbreaking, no? Anyhoo, my first reaction was \"Who he?\" so I looked him up. Apparently he is Tory MP for Rye, keen on hunting and capital punishment and, of course, thanking people. What a gent! \u00b7 Just when you need the boss to get decisive she goes on a people-are-our-business training course. I'm sorry, but when you're trying to organise the Christmas party, the last thing you need to hear is: \"Oh just consult the troops and do whatever makes them happy\". I consulted the troops. They have very clear ideas about what makes them happy. The only problem is that their requests range from the standard black-tie chow down to An Evening with Britney: How Marrying Your Staff Can Be Good for Your Business. \u00b7 As if that weren't bad enough, they can't agree on a date, with half demanding a Friday night mash-up and the rest insisting they can only attend for 15 minutes on the last Monday in January. Research from the Millennium Hotel in Knightsbridge suggests I'm not the only one. Top of the Christmas party horror list is finding the invitations are wrong, closely followed by having to organise the event at short notice and staff not enjoying the party. That last one really gets me going. In fact, I may have to print \"FUN IS COMPULSORY\" on the bottom of the invitation. Not that I expect anyone will take any notice. \u00b7 Of course, the Christmas party pales in comparison to rallying the troops for secret santa. Whoever came up with this idea deserves to be shot. It might look like innocent fun, but one has to ask: do you need another novelty desk tidy? Do you need reminding that your colleagues don't really care about your individuality? No, you do not. Anyway, according to Pitman Training, secret santa is encouraging the incubation of a terrifying disease sweeping the country: Same Present Syndrome (SPS). Some 67% of us suffer from SPS, with perfumed soap proving to be the least popular present. Pitman found that 46% of us would prefer to receive a boost to our careers in the form of a \"training gift voucher\". Now there's a depressing thought. I'll stick to soap on a rope."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
