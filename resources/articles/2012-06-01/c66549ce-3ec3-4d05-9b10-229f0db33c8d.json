Of the other leading stars, Arcturus is sinking in the W and Capella twinkles low in the N in the region where noctilucent clouds are making their annual appearance. Hovering above the horizon between the NW and NE, these are composed of ice crystals at high altitudes where they catch the sunlight to shine like bluish cirrus long after low level clouds are in darkness. We need binoculars to glimpse Mercury in the bright WNW twilight during the first few evening of July, but it soon dims and sinks from sight. Mars and Saturn are still on show in the lower SW sky though both have set by our map times. Saturn, mag 0.7 to 0.8, is slow-moving 5\u00b0 above Spica in Virgo, the pair standing some 20\u00b0 high and 30\u00b0 below Arcturus as the twilight fades. Mars lies 24\u00b0 right of Saturn on the 1st and dims from mag 0.9 to 1.1 as it speeds eastwards to lie 8\u00b0 to the W of both Saturn and Spica on the 31st. Catch the Moon below Mars on the 24th and close to Spica on the 25th. With Venus and Jupiter now together in our predawn sky, early risers are in for a treat. Ninety minutes before sunrise on the 1st, Jupiter is conspicuous at mag -2.0 but very low in the ENE where it stands 6\u00b0 below the Pleiades. Over the coming minutes the brilliant mag -4.4 Venus climbs into view 5\u00b0 below Jupiter. During the month, the two planets climb higher before dawn, while Venus slips farther away from Jupiter as both track eastwards against the stars of Taurus. The 15% illuminated waning Moon joins the show on the 15th, occulting Jupiter for watchers in SE England, as Venus stands 7\u00b0 below and to their left and less than 3\u00b0 to the left of Aldebaran.
