In study published in the journal Ecology, a pair of biologists in the province of Ontario found that northern pitcher plants \u2013 also known as turtle socks \u2013 devour juvenile spotted salamanders. M Alex Smith, a professor of biology at Guelph University first discovered a salamander in a pitcher plant accidentally: he was leading a group of university students on a field course in Ontario\u2019s Algonquin Park. But the sighting of the small amphibian in the plant felt like a \u201cWTF moment\u201d, Smith told the Guardian in an email. After consulting with the park\u2019s resident salamander expert, Patrick Moldowan, a PhD student at the University of Toronto, the two suspected Smith\u2019s discovery might have been more than a chance sighting. After surveying pitcher plants in Algonquin, Moldowa found that 20% of plants had at least one juvenile spotted salamander in them. \u201cThe second WTF moment,\u201d said Smith. The pitcher plant is one of nearly 600 carnivorous plants found throughout the world. Inhabiting much of Canada and the eastern United States, the pitcher thrives in low-nutrient areas, such as bogs. The plant is well known for its appetite of invertebrates, like spiders and other small insects \u2013 but the discovery of decomposing salamanders significantly expands the scope of what plants may be consuming \u2013 and raises numerous questions. \u201cAre plants a significant form of mortality for the salamanders? Are the salamanders a significant form of nutrition for the plants? Are the salamanders, in fact, not a good thing for the plants?\u201d said Smith. What makes the research especially tantalizing, said Smith, is that while the plants and salamanders are relatively common sightings in the park, researchers didn\u2019t realize the deadly relationship between the two. The remote Wildlife Research Station in Algonquin park \u2013 the province\u2019s oldest protected area \u2013 has been active for the last 70 years. \u201cThis crazy discovery of previously unknown carnivory of a plant upon a vertebrate happened in a relatively well-studied area on relatively well-studied plants and animals!\u201d said Smith. The team is testing multiple hypotheses about what lures the young salamanders into the fatal grip of the pitcher plant. One suspicion is that the salamanders accidentally fall into the plants and drown. The plants might also have a digestive enzyme that speeds up the process: researchers observed it took less than two weeks for the salamanders to decompose. \u201cI hope and imagine that one day the general public\u2019s interpretive pamphlet for the bog will one day say, \u201cStay on the board walk and watch your children \u2013 here be plants that eat vertebrates!!\u201d said Smith. \u2022 This article was amended on 13 June 2019 because salamanders are amphibians, not reptiles as an earlier version said.
