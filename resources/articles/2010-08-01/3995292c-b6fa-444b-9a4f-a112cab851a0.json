There are not just \"real risks\" that women, disabled people, older people, black and ethnic minority people will be \"disproportionately affected\" by the emergency budget announcements. It's already happening. Yvette Cooper, shadow minister for women and equalities, exposed this when she carried out the equality impact assessment the government should have carried out itself, as May advised. The Con-Dem coalition claims to be about \"new politics\". The reality is the very oldest politics of divide and rule \u2013 the most vulnerable in society suffering the most from the worst excesses of the cuts being driven through by George Osborne with his privileged background. Freezing child benefit and abolishing the \u00a3190 health in pregnancy grant, for example, doesn't create jobs or support economic growth. It just takes money and support from women and children. William Beveridge, a Liberal and the architect of the welfare state, had a vision of security for all. This new coalition is about the opposite \u2013 creating fear. Diana Holland Assistant general secretary, equalities, Unite \u2022\u2008I asked the chancellor, in a written parliamentary question, \"whether his department undertook an equalities impact assessment in respect of the measures proposed in the June 2010 budget\". This is something the government is required to do by law. I received a \"holding answer\" on the last day before parliamentary recess, which stated \"I shall let the Hon Member have a reply as soon as possible.\" Yes or no would have done! Caroline Lucas MP Green party leader \u2022\u2008There does not, as Julian Glover suggests, \"have to be a discussion of cuts\" (Now that cuts are accepted we must all decide our fate, 3 August). There has to be a discussion about how to resolve the public sector deficit. And Labour still has time to develop a campaign on the principle of fairness: One, the deficit is like a mortgage and it does not make sense to pay it off more quickly than necessary if it causes pain \u2013 no homeowner would choose to do this. So, slow down. Two, resolving the deficit must be done fairly. Those who benefited most from the boom years \u2013 including the 1,000 richest UK residents, whose combined wealth, according to the Sunday Times Rich List, stands at \u00a3335.5bn \u2013 must contribute their fair share first to lop billions off the deficit in the most painless way. Third, Labour can remind people that we only have a deficit as the public lent the money to the banks, and the banks therefore need to pay their fair share of the deficit. So, a deficit repayment tax on the newly announced bank profits. Time for Harriet Harman to revive Labour's traditional values and place them in this modern setting? Richard Brunner Glasgow \u2022\u2008When will journalists such as Julian Glover acknowledge that free bus passes, the winter fuel allowance and child benefit, far from being \"middle-class perks\", are universal benefits? Means-testing of universal benefits always leads to a decline in take-up on the part of those who are most disadvantaged and thus compounds pre-existing needs. I would urge Glover and his cuts-accepting middle-class mates to stop taking up these benefits or give the proceeds to charities for children or the elderly. That would be a bit of individualistic behaviour that could appease their guilt without sabotaging these schemes for those who need them most. Bob Cant Brighton \u2022\u2008I wonder how many of those who participated in the survey (Fears grow of double dip recession, 5 August) were signatories to calls to stop Labour's \"jobs tax\". Three months ago many business leaders claimed that increasing national insurance by 1p would have a disastrous impact on their enterprises, and favoured slashing public expenditure. Now they have discovered that there are few if any victimless cuts \u2013 but at least we're all in this together. Les Bright Exeter, Devon \u2022 You report that Tony Benn and others have launched a campaign demanding that people revolt against Tory plans to cut services (Benn calls for revolt against cuts by 'government millionaires', 5 August). The call is welcome, but nothing beats actually doing something. This is why I and many other trade unionists will be taking the protest directly to the Tory party conference in Birmingham on 3 October. The demand? The right to work. Keith Flett London \u2022 Your correspondent Kathleen Steane (Letters, 5 August) voted Conservative and is \"upset and angry\" that she assisted in the coming to power of a Conservative government carrying out Conservative policies. Dearie me. Gerald Kaufman MP Lab, Manchester Gorton \u2022 I was waiting in the local hospital recently and decided to have a cup of coffee. To my surprise I found that the coffee shop, run perfectly adequately till now by the WRVS on a voluntary basis, had been replaced by a Costa coffee shop. The Costa manager told me that the WRVS couldn't afford the rent of the shop which the NHS was charging. Of course the cost of a cup of coffee had spiralled. Is this the first costly swallow of a hard winter? Gary Craig Newton on Ouse, North Yorkshire"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
