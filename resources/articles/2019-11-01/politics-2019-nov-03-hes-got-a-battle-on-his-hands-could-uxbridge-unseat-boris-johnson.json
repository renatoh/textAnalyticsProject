In the heart of Boris Johnson\u2019s west London constituency, this former manor house hosted talks over the ill-fated treaty of Uxbridge in 1645, an abortive attempt to end the first English civil war, which arose from a battle between parliament and the executive and ultimately led to Charles I losing his head. Now the recently restored gastropub is about to bear witness to the consequences of another parliamentary fight: a general election with the possible prospect of a serving prime minister losing his seat. \u201cI think the youth vote will go against him and I think he\u2019s got a battle on his hands,\u201d said MaryJane Prendergast-Lister, 18, who works at the Crown and Treaty and will be a first-time voter. She said the focus would be on Brexit. For those her age, \u201cthis is their first opportunity to have their say, though maybe there\u2019s no point now,\u201d she said, dressed up for Halloween on the day Johnson had pledged that the UK would leave the EU. The pub\u2019s deputy manager, Sophie Girard, 27, agreed. She is French, though she was born in the UK. She returned to the UK 12 years ago and now finds herself having to apply for residency, which she said was \u201cabsurd\u201d and \u201csomething I didn\u2019t think was necessary up until the result came in on [referendum] day\u201d. Her British friends all voted remain. \u201cThey think the election will be all about Brexit, and so do I,\u201d she said. Taking on Johnson in Uxbridge and South Ruislip will be Labour\u2019s Ali Milani, 25. He may not have Johnson\u2019s recognition factor on Uxbridge high street, but on the campus of nearby Brunel University, his alma mater, he is well known. Mobilising the student vote is crucial if he is to topple Johnson, whose majority was halved in 2017 to just 5,034, now the smallest of any prime minister since 1924. Johnson\u2019s seat is on an internal CCHQ list as potentially at risk. There have been rumours he might relocate to a safer one. Milani requires a swing of just over 5%. He is the antithesis of Johnson. An Iranian immigrant who moved to a Wembley council estate with his mother and sister when he was five, he studied politics at Brunel, where he was the student union president before becoming a vice-president of the National Union of Students. A practising Muslim, he attends Friday prayers on Brunel\u2019s campus, and he pitches himself as the \u201clocal candidate\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve studied here, I\u2019ve worked here, I live here. I had surgery in the local hospital. I tell them on the doorstep: when Boris Johnson is ill, which hospital do you think he will be treated at?\u201d he said. \u201c[Johnson] has no connections to this area other than as a platform for him to get to No 10. At the time it was a safe seat for him, though not any more.\u201d Milani believes no single issue will determine the election outcome. As well as selling Labour\u2019s national \u201ctransformative, exciting vision\u201d on the doorstep, he will also be wooing voters on local issues such as Johnson\u2019s \u201cbetrayal\u201d of residents on Heathrow\u2019s third runway, and the future of Hillingdon hospital, parts of which are so dangerous and decrepit that child patients had to be moved out of its paediatrics department because it was deemed unsafe. Volunteer activists from the leftwing grassroots group Momentum intend to flood the constituency in Milani\u2019s support as part of its \u201cLet\u2019s Go\u201d network. Momentum\u2019s national coordinator, Laura Parker, said the strategy in Uxbridge would be focused on mobilising the seat\u2019s large student base at Brunel. \u201cMomentum will be running campus tours and working closely with youth groups to register students to vote and get them out on polling day,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s no wonder Boris Johnson has tried to gerrymander against this by changing the election date to the end of university term.\u201d Milani would also attract votes from residents \u201cfurious\u201d over the Heathrow expansion, she said. \u201cBoris Johnson has sold out students to a life of debt and precarity, sold out Heathrow families to airport bosses, and next wants to sell us all out for a disaster deal with Trump.\u201d Milani will hope to appeal to minority ethnic voters, whose numbers in the constituency have steadily increased, nearing 30% of the local population. His political opponents will undoubtedly point to some antisemitic remarks he has been accused of making as a teenager on Twitter, for which he has repeatedly apologised. The Conservatives reportedly recently spend \u00a31,178 in a single day on Facebook advertising aimed at 200,000 voters, calling for Uxbridge\u2019s threatened police station to be kept open. Crime resonates with local people. Gurmail Singh, a Johnson constituent and president of the Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha in neighbouring Southall, said complaints about crime had gone up significantly in recent months. \u201cLaw and order, policing, hospitals \u2013 people will vote on these wider issues,\u201d he said. Christine Harris, an art teacher, said having the police station in Uxbridge was vital for peace of mind. But Brexit, rather than local issues, would loom large for many voters, she said, \u201cbecause people want it out of the way\u201d. Outside Uxbridge underground station, Dick Rodgers, from the Common Good party, was calling for pro-EU votes. \u201cHe\u2019s got a decent majority but not insurmountable,\u201d he said of Johnson. Vote splintering over Brexit could play any way. There are rumours Richard Tice, the multimillionaire businessman and chairman of the Brexit party, could stand for parliament, but he has refused to confirm it would be against the prime minister, a decision that could hand the seat to Labour. Equally a Liberal Democrat and Labour split could ensure a Johnson victory, though Milani believes this is an unlikely scenario given the Liberal Democrats lost their deposit in 2017. While he cannot afford to outgun Johnson on social media, Milani has pledged to expend more shoe leather on the constituency\u2019s streets, and can draw on an army of foot soldiers eager to be part of this David and Goliath battle. \u201cJust think of the earthquake it would send to Westminster if we were to win, and the message it would send to the country. It is something I am willing to fight every day for,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
