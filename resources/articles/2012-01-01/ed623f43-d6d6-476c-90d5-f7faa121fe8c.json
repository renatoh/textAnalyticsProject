The camera is jumping around all over the place and it's all very close range. There's some brown fur in there somewhere, plus heavy breathing and a pathetic whimpering noise. Slowly it becomes clear what's going on. The scene is actually being filmed by a dog, which must be wearing the camera around its neck. So we're looking out along the underside of the dog's snout. In the dog's mouth is a deer; I know it sounds implausible but the dog is a very large one (it looks like a greyhound but it may be some kind of lurcher) and the deer is very small (a Chinese water deer, as it happens). The dog is shaking the deer from side to side. This is killing, up close and personal. The viewer almost feels as if they're being shaken to death by a dog. The scene is characteristic of Leo Maguire's powerful observational documentary, both in the artful way it is filmed (maybe a teeny bit too artful, I thought, at times: I could have done with less lingering on poppy fields etc and the whole thing fitting into an hour) and the cruelty and violence of the subject matter. There are other violent scenes involving animals. Like hare coursing, and a horrible cockfight in which one bird is on the point of collapse as the other pecks away at its head and one of the men watching shouts: \"Kill him then, you fucking useless cunt. Oh, he's gone, finish him son, finish him.\" (No cameras around the cocks' necks, thankfully.) But most of the violence is between men. And between boys. \"Box, box,\" says Hughie Doherty to his son, who's pounding the pads his father is holding up. \"See, he won't give, go on, Charlie, upper cut, Charlie, uppercut, do an upper cut, Charlie, up the way, quick, over the top, hook, bish bash, bing bang ...\" Charlie is 18. Months. Charlie's older brother Francie, seven, is already an established fighter. \"When I'm in a fight, I have to remember it's not just for me, it's for my family and my name,\" he says. If dad Hughie ever saw Francie not standing up for himself, running away, or crying, then he'd give him \u2013 his own son \u2013 a good slapping, for letting the name down. Names mean a lot around here, especially if it's Doherty. Or Butcher. Fred Butcher seems unsure about whether he wants his sons to be fighters or not. \"I'll train them myself when they get a bit older,\" he says one minute. But then the next he says he's not going to encourage it. \"I don't really want them to be fighters.\" I'm not sure they've got much choice really. It's going to be ingrained. Later we see Fred, covered in blood, having been beaten, and kicked, and carved up with a machete, very nearly killed. Now he's looking for revenge. We also witness a terrifying display of fight power from Hughie, who destroys a man much bigger than himself. And \u2013 most disturbing of all for me because they're children \u2013 we see little Francie sparring with another boy, for ages and ages, getting floored, standing up again, finally knocking the other kid down, and being hugged and kissed and congratulated by his family. This is very different side to the Irish Traveller and Romany Gypsy communities from the one we saw in Big Fat Gypsy Weddings. That was about the flouncing and frills; this is about the fighting and the fists. And again there'll be criticism, I'm sure, that these people are being misrepresented. I don't know how representative it is, or even if it needs to be. There's no doubt that Hughie Doherty and Fred Butcher and their families are real, and that this is how they are, and this is how they say they do it in their community. Gypsies and Travellers have settled disagreements with their bare knuckles for ever and they continue to do so. And to teach their sons how to. Some people will say it's not a bad way. You have a disagreement, so you have a fight, and that's the end of the matter. It just looks \u2013 to us softies who don't have wheels underneath our houses \u2013 a bit bloody scary and brutal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
