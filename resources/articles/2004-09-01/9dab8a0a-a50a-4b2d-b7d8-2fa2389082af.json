AMD has already been previewing its Opteron prototype, while Intel talked up the technology at this week's Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco. Dual core chips have two processors on the same chip. This allows a single computer to be partitioned to act like two computers. AMD demonstrated the cost-saving possibilities for businesses using an HP ProLiant containing four dual-core Opterons. www.amd.com/dualcore2 www.intel.com Bluetooth pulled Ericsson Technology Licensing, a spin-off Bluetooth research and development company, is being disbanded as Ericsson is forced out of the market by increasing competition. Ericsson has been a prime mover in the Bluetooth market: it invented the technology and helped turn it into an industry standard, particularly for mobile phones. The company is not abandoning the technology, but claims its \"mature state\" has made the spin-off uneconomic. However, users may think there is still work to be done: the use of Bluetooth personal area networking to connect all manner of IT hardware has been dogged by interoperability issues that are still being tackled. www.ericsson.com/bluetooth/news Security tightened Wi-Fi is getting more secure. Companies are queuing up to have their products certified for the newly ratified Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) standard. The standard forms a major part of the 802.11i wireless networking specification. Although hardware with WPA2 has been available for months, interoperability and security could not be guaranteed until all elements had been approved. Now Intel, Cisco Systems, and Realtek are awaiting the seal of approval that interoperability specifications have been met. The high level of encryption in WPA2 makes network communications almost impossible to hack, and will ensure the level of access allotted to users will be adhered to. http://masl.to/?K33014C39 Apache warcry Licensing for Microsoft's proposed SenderID anti-spam standard is not acceptable, claims the Apache Software Foundation. Apache, which develops the eponymous open source web server, has written to the technical committee working on the specification saying the current proposition is too controlling for use in the open source world. Under the current proposals, Apache claims users would have to apply to Microsoft to use the anti-spam software, and development projects to improve the standard could be blocked by the Redmond firm. SenderID is based mainly on Microsoft's Caller ID, and offers another way to validate the source of incoming emails and filter spam. http://masl.to/?V2AE11B39 VoIP numbers Ofcom, the UK's telecoms regulator, is setting aside phone numbers starting with 056 for use with internet phones that are usually based on VoIP ( Voice over Internet Protocol). The new 11-digit numbers will be assigned by internet telephony providers. Customers will also be able to have new numbers with regional prefixes, such as 01 and 02, and some may be able to keep existing numbers. However, 056 will generally be recognised as \"the area code for cyberspace\". Grid Britain British physicists are unveiling the world's largest computer grid this week. The team, primarily centered at Oxford, Manchester and Glasgow universities, has linked up more than 6,000 computers at 78 international sites as a massive processor for the particle physics work at the Cern research lab in Switzerland. The project forms part of the development of the Large Hadron Collider Computing Grid, which will analyse the results of collisions between sub-atomic particles. The collider is expected to churn out 15 petabytes of data per year from 2007, and it all has to be stored and analysed. The grid's computers will combine their resources to act as a massive supercomputer for this purpose. http://lcg.web.cern.ch/LCG/ Mobile Java Sun's Java language was launched with the claim that programmers could \"write once, run anywhere\", and nowhere has that been more patently untrue than on mobile phones. However, phone suppliers Nokia and Vodafone have combined \"to lead a roadmap for mobile Java standards\". The aim is to define \"a consistent Java API services architecture\" so that applications will be compatible across different devices. This is not the first attempt to fix the problem. Both companies say they are committed to the platform and reference implementations should be available next year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
