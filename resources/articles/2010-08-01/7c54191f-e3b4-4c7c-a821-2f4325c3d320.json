The England No1 overawed some opponents, and showed his experienced ringcraft in escaping occasional danger moments. But Adams will have a far harder task in the next championship at Sheffield 2011, where England's other leading GMs, Nigel Short, Luke McShane and David Howell, are already confirmed entries. Behind Adams, three generations fought for supremacy, and the GMs and IMs in their 20s or early 30s had the best of the argument with the veterans from the Fischer boom of the 1970s and an aspiring bunch of teenagers. The former champion Stuart Conquest was the only older player to figure in a six-way tie for third prize, while Ireland's Ryan-Rhys Griffiths, 17, impressed more than any of the English juniors. Nick Pert took second prize alone with 8/11 with a polished and solid performance. His twin Richard, Adam Hunt, and Jonathan Hawkins all shared third after excellent tournaments, Hunt scoring a GM result. In the battle among them the games below had a significant bearing on the final outcome. White's 3 Bf4 is the solid London system, and Black's response was a shade overactive (13...b6 or Bf5 is safer).White then had a small but increasing plus and 36 Qa5! Bxc6 37 Ba7! would win. Black missed a defensive chance (37...Rf8!) and resigned after 41 Qc6 with no defence to Bb6-c7xd6.
