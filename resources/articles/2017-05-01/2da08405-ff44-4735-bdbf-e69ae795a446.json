Labor\u2019s infrastructure spokesman, Anthony Albanese, has called on the government to reverse the cut from $11.6m to $8.8m in the 2016 budget, which is due to take effect on 1 July. The treasurer, Scott Morrison, is laying the groundwork for an infrastructure budget by announcing the government will separately account for \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d debt, to be distinguished by whether it produces productive capital. Two projects in particular are expected to be the focus: Sydney\u2019s second airport at Badgerys Creek, which the government has said it will build itself, and the inland rail, which Malcolm Turnbull has described as a \u201cvery high priority\u201d. Albanese has been on a tour of Australia highlighting public transport projects that Labor believes should be funded, including Brisbane\u2019s cross-river rail, Perth\u2019s Metronet, Adelaide\u2019s light rail project Adelink, Melbourne\u2019s Metro and a rail link to Badgerys Creek. Albanese argues that the 25% funding cut to Infrastructure Australia and the creation of a separate infrastructure financing unit in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet will undermine its capacity to evaluate projects and structure financing for them. \u201cMr Turnbull should be supporting Infrastructure Australia in the name of evidence-based policy making and sensible financial stewardship,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead, he is usurping its role and slashing its resources.\u201d Albanese said that, after \u201cfour years of infrastructure neglect\u201d, the government should use the budget to invest in projects that enhance productivity and boost economic growth. Labor has criticised the government\u2019s record on infrastructure, particularly the decision to dump public transport projects in 2014 in favour of funding the Perth freight link and Melbourne\u2019s East West Link. The East West Link was projected to return just 45c in the dollar and the Abbott government was criticised by the audit office for funding it prematurely. The cancellation of that project by the Andrews Labor government set off a stoush with the federal government over $1.45bn of funds from the federal asset recycling program. On Friday Albanese accused the Turnbull government of punishing Victoria for voting Labor by withholding asset recycling funds from Melbourne Metro, which Infrastructure Australia identified as a project with national significance. \u201cVictoria currently receives just 7.7% of the commonwealth\u2019s infrastructure budget, despite being home to 25% of the Australian population,\u201d he said. \u201cA good way to begin addressing this inequity is to fund the Melbourne Metro, which the Coalition cut $3bn from in the 2014 budget to help fund the dud East West Link toll road.\u201d On Wednesday Turnbull said it was \u201cabsolutely untrue\u201d that the federal government was shortchanging Victoria on infrastructure spending, citing the fact that 20% of roads spending is in Victoria. He said that the Andrews government had wasted $1.2bn when it cancelled the East West Link which he called a \u201ca vitally important piece of infrastructure\u201d. Asked about the cross-river rail in Brisbane, Turnbull said the project was important but still \u201cat an early stage\u201d, adding that the federal government had given $10m to develop the business case. He pointed to other projects the government supported including light rail on the Gold Coast and $100m for a new stadium in Townsville. \u201cSo right across the country, we are building, we are committed to developing the Infrastructure Australia needs to lead and succeed in the 21st century.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
