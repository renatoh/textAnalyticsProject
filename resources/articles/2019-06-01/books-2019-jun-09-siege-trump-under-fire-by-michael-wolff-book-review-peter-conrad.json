Then, capitalising on Trump\u2019s threats to Kim Jong-un, Michael Wolff\u2019s Fire and Fury prospectively upgraded it to a war movie. But the nuclear fulminations were only bluff, and Trump soon began to exchange endearments with the chubby North Korean despot, having been told that he might qualify for the Nobel peace prize. The world didn\u2019t end after all, and the anticlimax has forced Wolff, in this new account of later developments, to think again about the Trump show\u2019s genre. Siege reclassifies the hapless administration as a comic opera, calls the president a clown, and makes his rants and tantrums sound absurd not alarming. To keep us quaking, Wolff gives his gossipy narrative a militarised title: we are asked to imagine Trump holed up in the White House as his enemies, armed with subpoenas, close in. Yet this is not the siege of Mafeking, let alone that of Leningrad. The war of attrition waged by Wolff and his fellow journalists has hardly worn Trump down; he retains the freedom of the air, tweeting out a daily barrage of lies and insults and jetting off to stoke up bigots in midwestern arenas or embarrass foreign heads of state who wince as they welcome him on to their soil. Mostly Siege retells scandalous stories that are pretty familiar, with few fresh disclosures. Despite the indiscreet tattle dribbled into his ear by the disgruntled Steve Bannon, Wolff has no idea what arcane surgical procedure (or impasse in nuptial negotiations?) kept Melania in hospital for a week last summer, let alone how Putin managed to reduce Trump to the status of a brutalised cur during their confidential colloquy in Helsinki. The book does have some sharp insights about Trump\u2019s mental deficiencies. Wolff diagnoses narcissism and megalomania, but adds that Trump, despite his keening self-pity, is too imperceptive about people and incurious about their motives to suffer from paranoia. Others rely on incredulous expletives, not clinical jargon, when characterising him. Sean Hannity, the Fox News demagogue who spends hours on the phone with Trump each day, calls him \u201ctotally fucking crazy\u201d; Nick Ayers, after briefly rehearsing to replace John Kelly as his chief of staff, flees in horror from a man he allegorises as \u201cMr Fucking-totally-out-of-his-mind-crazy\u201d. We knew that Trump was illiterate, and now in a neat symmetry Wolff discloses that he is innumerate as well. \u201cDysfunctional and inept\u201d, he \u201ccan\u2019t walk down steps\u201d, and \u201cdoesn\u2019t know how to use a phone\u201d. Insecurity assails this hollow man, who even resents the fact that his adolescent son Barron, elasticised by a sudden vertical spurt, is about to overtake him in height. \u201cHow do I stunt his growth?\u201d he often asks as he recoils from the Oedipal beanpole. Such malevolent blabbing reveals that Trump is all id, \u201cunable to control his own running monologue\u201d. Wolff also suggests that he has \u201cno solely private thoughts\u201d, which is why he is \u201calmost never voluntarily alone, and absolutely never alone and awake without the television on\u201d. His head, it seems, is a reverberantly empty boom box, a woofer surmounted by a teased orange tea cosy. Trump\u2019s compulsive mendacity is also astutely analysed here. No ordinary political fibber, he\u2019s too intellectually clumsy to dissemble and prevaricate. Untruths, Wolff argues, are his metier and his business strategy, and they insulate him in an alternative reality. The Art of the Deal, in which even Trump\u2019s name on the title page counts as a lie, might have been called The Art of Fiction if Henry James hadn\u2019t got in first. This professional fraudulence makes Trump shameless and in a way blameless: it\u2019s hardly his fault that his followers gobble up the whoppers he feeds them. \u201cHe really might,\u201d says Wolff with a shudder, \u201cbe a genius.\u201d At this point the book\u2019s genre switches to sci-fi. What if this \u201cstrange organism\u201d with its \u201cuncanny ability to survive every threat\u201d is some kind of unkillable force, like the xenomorph in Alien? Wounded multiple times, Trump has never \u201cbled out\u201d. Even Bannon believes in his \u201cmagical properties\u201d, while Trump keeps his guarded distance from the monster he has created by referring to himself in the third person. It\u2019s a relief to learn that, once at least, his coiffed, confected, permatanned persona unravelled and exposed him as nothing more than a senescent baldie: the morning after the Fox pundits ganged up to attack him for reneging on his border wall, he arrived in the Oval Office in such a ferocious tizz that \u201cfor a moment, his hair came undone\u201d. That\u2019s all the comeuppance Wolff can provide. But he speculates impatiently about how the fiasco will end \u2013 with a faked heart attack, or a doleful ultimatum delivered by Ivanka? Perhaps with another bankruptcy, if some possibly dodgy money-laundering loans are uncovered? Bannon predicts that, whatever the scenario, Trump \u201cwon\u2019t go out classy\u201d. Wolff, who admits to a \u201ctrain-wreck fascination with Trump\u201d, was hoping for a catastrophe to coincide with his book\u2019s publication, and reserved his final chapter to deal with the indictments he expected Mueller to issue. Disaster-movie tropes accordingly menace the last pages: the runaway train is about to derail, the aeroplane\u2019s wings are coming off. However, thanks to Mueller\u2019s legalistic caution, Trump didn\u2019t crash and burn, so a flustered Wolff has to apologise for one more anticlimax. He concludes with the kind of teaser that entices television viewers to stay tuned, assuring us that Trump\u2019s \u201cescape, such as it was, would be brief\u201d. There is no reason for the verb\u2019s subjunctive mood, which implies that Wolff already knows what will happen next: his self-destructive subject has so far proved indestructible, which is clearly frustrating. All the same, Wolff can afford to be cheerful. With retribution postponed, he now has an excuse to write a third money-spinning volume. \u2022 Siege: Trump Under Fire by Michael Wolff is published by Little, Brown (\u00a320).
