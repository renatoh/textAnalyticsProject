He trod his beat with good humour, dignity and an open heart for well over 50 years. Under his shrewd stewardship - he was editor from 1972 until 1992 and remained as a consultant and contributor during his retirement years - the Stage, once a mere cheerleader for showbiz, became an essential adjunct to the world of theatre, television and film and a well-edited and well-written journal to boot. He set an example of integrity and good humour that made a lasting impression in the world of showbusiness and among his colleagues. Many reporters and reviewers owe Peter Hepple a lot, and not just because he served for many years as a dedicated treasurer, and then secretary, of the Critics' Circle. Hepple may not have been a dazzling critical writer, but he was a first-rate journalist, someone who took as much pleasure in Ken Dodd or Tony Bennett as he did in the latest new play at the National Theatre or the Bush. He emerged from the postwar twilight of nightclubs and vaudeville - his real stomping ground was the old Talk of the Town at Leicester Square, the London Palladium, and the West End clubs such as the Embassy, the Pigalle and Quaglino's - to embrace the new theatrical realities of the Royal Shakespeare Company, the far-flung London fringe and regional pantomimes. He regarded the latter, unfashionably but correctly, as the lifeblood of the nation's theatrical tradition and prosperity, the place where popular art could be seen at its best. He never drew cultural distinctions between high art and low comedy. He absorbed all activity as a sort of miraculous manifestation of the performing arts, trudging dutifully between engagements like a privileged participant at the feast: last year, in the 125th anniversary issue of the Stage, he declared that light entertainment was reclaiming the theatre, referring to the \"compilation, tribute or dance shows with strong pop or exotic elements\". Hepple enjoyed these developments and wanted to see much more of good, robust popular music invading the theatre proper. For a while in the mid-1960s his commitment to star quality was transformed into action, when he worked as a publicity officer for Danny La Rue in his golden period as a night-club performer in Hanover Square. But even at the epicentre of the cabaret world, Hepple's writing was always marked by a nod in a new actor's direction, or a kind word for some new theatrical enterprise. He would sit for days and nights on end through night-club showcases in Margate or Cumbria and always find something constructive to say. His stamina was legendary. Peter Hepple was born in Wood Green, London, an only child. His father, who worked shifts at Cable and Wireless, introduced him to the weekly delights of the Wood Green Empire. He was educated at the City of London school, evacuated to Marlborough college during the second world war and did his national service with the Royal Engineers in Orkney, Egypt and Turkey. It was in Ankara, he said, that he discovered his taste for drink and nightclubs. After short bursts of employment as a surveyor and at Burke's Peerage, he started reviewing as a freelance for such long deceased publications as Show Pictorial, Theatre World and Where to Go in London (later subsumed in What's On in London). His first show for the Stage was the male impersonator Ella Shields at the Queen's Theatre, Poplar. His last was Ibsen's The Pillars of the Community directed by Marianne Elliott at the National Theatre, which he loved. Last week in the Stage he reviewed, with characteristic kindness and insight, a book about theatrical mothers; next week, the newspaper will print his last article, a fascinating low-down on the new popularity of psychics on the Stage, in which he relates this new phenomenon to Victorian spiritualism and its place in secular entertainment. He was an extraordinarily well-informed supporter of Barnet Association Football Club, and always had wise words to share on soccer in general and lower league teams in particular. He is survived by his wife, Josie, and their daughters, Clare and Julia. \u00b7 Peter Hepple, journalist, born January 2 1927; died October 11 2006"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
