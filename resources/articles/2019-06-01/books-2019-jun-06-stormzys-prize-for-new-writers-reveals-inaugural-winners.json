The half-Brazilian, half-Montenegrin Monika Radojevic has won for her collection of poetry, 23 and Me, alongside Hafsa Zayyan for her novel We Are All Birds of Uganda. The rapper welcomed the results, telling the winning pair: \u201cA lot of talented people don\u2019t fulfil their potential, they are so talented but they sit on it. I call it the beautiful shame. But you guys have the confidence to write, to do something about it, and that\u2019s amazing.\u201d Radojevic, whose poems draw from \u201cthe joys, the confusions and the moments of sadness behind having one\u2019s history scattered around the globe, and the way in which your identity is always worn on your skin, whether you like or not\u201d, said that winning the award \u201chas shown me that people can connect with the story I have to tell \u2026 It has given me a platform for my voice to be heard in a way that I have never before experienced.\u201d Zayyan, who was born to a Nigerian father and Pakistani mother, said that she had entered the competition knowing very little about publishing, and that the award had shown her \u201cthat opportunities to have your work recognised really do exist \u2026 I am so grateful \u2013 and so excited \u2013 to have been given the opportunity to tell a story that I have wanted to tell for a long time.\u201d Her novel brings together the stories of Sameer, the son of penniless refugees who graduates from Cambridge and works for a City firm, and Hasan, whose family moved to Uganda from India and whose business now spans multiple locations in Uganda. More than 1,200 submissions were received for the award, which sets out to find \u201cthe stories that aren\u2019t being heard\u201d. According to the poet Kayo Chigonyi, who was on the judging panel alongside Stormzy, \u201creading for the prize felt like being given a vision of the future. There was innovation among these entries as well as a very welcome collapsing of received notions of literariness,\u201d he said. Also on the panel were the writer Yrsa Daley-Ward, the writer and agent Nikesh Shukla of the Good Literary Agency and Susan Sandon, MD of Penguin Random House UK. The winners will receive representation from the Good Literary Agency and a publishing contract with #Merky Books, Stormzy\u2019s imprint at Penguin Random House. #Merky Books has already published Stormzy\u2019s own \u201cstory so far\u201d, Rise Up, with its second book, Taking Up Space: The Black Girls\u2019 Manifesto for Change by Chelsea Kwakye and Ore Ogunbiyi out on 27 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
