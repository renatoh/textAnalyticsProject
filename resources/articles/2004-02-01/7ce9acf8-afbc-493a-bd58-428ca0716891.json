England's captain received his fifth yellow card for a careless first-half challenge on Miguel Angel Angulo in the 1-1 draw at the Estadio Bernab\u00e9u. That rules him out of next weekend's visit to Espanyol Barcelona. Valencia, in second place, went ahead with a 74th-minute goal from Roberto Ayala, the Argentinian defender whom Madrid judged too expensive a potential purchase at \u00a38m in August. Luis Figo equalised with a penalty in the 93rd minute after a foul on Ra\u00fal. The Dutch midfielder Edgar Davids also faces a ban after being sent off in Barcelona's 3-1 win over Atletico Madrid . Davids collected two yellow cards and the red in five minutes midway through the second half, the second for handball. In Italy Milan had to thank the Ukraine striker Andriy Shevchenko for the equaliser which secured a 1-1 draw with struggling Lecce . They lead Roma by five points. Third-placed Juventus moved within a point of Roma after beating Reggina 1-0 through a 50th-minute goal from Enzo Maresca. Lyon still hope to secure a French title hat-trick after winning 2-1 away to Auxerre and going second, four points behind Monaco. The Rangers-bound defender Jean-Alain Boumsong scored Auxerre's late consolation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
