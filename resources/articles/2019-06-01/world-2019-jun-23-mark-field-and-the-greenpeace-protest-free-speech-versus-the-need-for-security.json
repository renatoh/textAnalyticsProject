On reflection, I am not so sure. We can never assume, as your editorial claims (22 June), that \u201cthere was no physical threat\u201d. This cannot have been clear at the time; there have been too many occasions when unanticipated assaults have led to death or serious injuries, as in the case of Jo Cox MP. Recent attackers, both individually or in groups, have used concealed knives or explosives to carry out their murderous intentions. Dissent can only be seen to be \u201cnon-violent\u201d after the event. I now speculate what might have been my reaction to all this if the protester had been a young man, and the individual who sought to forestall a possible tragedy had been a courageous female. Surely some credit should be given to anyone who decides to intervene when the intentions of an interloper are unclear. The really worrying question in these difficult times remains: how can a large group of people not invited to a major official occasion have managed to gain entry to make their protest, however peacefully, without any prior entrance check? Where on earth were the essential security arrangements? Roger Putnam Holmrook, Cumbria \u2022 What I\u2019ve noticed in all the controversy after the manhandling of a Greenpeace protester is that no space has been given to the content of the protest. On Greenpeace\u2019s website I found the alternative speech that the protesters were trying to deliver. It is about the climate emergency and addresses Philip Hammond\u2019s remark that we can\u2019t afford to take the action needed to bring emissions down to zero \u2013 in other words we \u201ccan\u2019t afford\u201d to take the action needed to safeguard the futures of our children and the people of the world. It\u2019s an eloquent and passionate speech and it deserves to be printed in the Guardian.
