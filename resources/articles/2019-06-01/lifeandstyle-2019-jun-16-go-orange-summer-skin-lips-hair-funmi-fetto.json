However, this glowfest skin/tangerine lip/pool hair combo, as seen at Fyodor Golan, is summer personified. The orange lip is not easy. It takes confidence and can draw attention to blemishes and redness (a light, dewy foundation with highlighter should sort this). For the uninitiated, dip in via a sheer orange or coral.

It also includes skin-soothing aloe vera as opposed to oil and it comes in a squeezy tube so you can manage the output easily. As the texture is akin to a semi-foamy cleanser, albeit with fine particles (biodegradable castor beads), a little goes a long way. Massage into wet skin and, minutes later, you have smoother, brighter, softer skin. So while I\u2019m still not really an advocate of body scrubs, this is one I would absolutely recommend adding to your weekly body care routine because it actually works.
