Boyle, who had been the clear favourite to win the ITV1 talent show, was admitted to the Priory in Southgate on Sunday evening after her behaviour had become erratic following her defeat by street dance act Diversity. Even the prime minister was prompted to express his concern for her health. A spokeswoman for Britain's Got Talent said the 48-year-old church volunteer was \"exhausted and emotionally drained\" and would remain at the clinic to \"take a few days out for rest and recovery\". Scotland Yard confirmed that police had been called at 6pm to a central London hotel where doctors were assessing a woman under the Mental Health Act. \"The woman was taken voluntarily by ambulance to a clinic,\" a spokeswoman said. \"At the request of doctors, police accompanied the ambulance.\" However, it emerged last night that Boyle \u2013 who has learning difficulties after being starved of oxygen at birth \u2013 had not been psychologically tested by producers before she was allowed on to the show, although psychologists were available to contestants who needed them. The production company, TalkbackThames, said it would now review its policies. A spokeswoman said: \"It is a talent show at the end of the day and people are auditioning on their talent merits. There is no formal psychological testing at the beginning of the show. Compared with something like Big Brother, where you are looking at people going into a house for three months, the people on Britain's Got Talent have three or four performances maximum and spend only seven to 10 days in a hotel for the semi-finals and final. It is a very different scenario. \"But because of the level of media attention and the speed with which this has become a global phenomenon, we will be reviewing all of our policies and in relation to psychological assessment.\" Boyle's brother Gerry played down fears over his sister's health, saying he had spoken to her and she was feeling better. \"She's at the Priory talking to people there about how she feels and where she goes from here,\" he said. \"She sounded a bit happier, she sounded a bit more like herself, but certainly a bit more rested. \"She's been on a tremendous rollercoaster. There's been an enormous amount of media speculation and intense activity. She's not used to that. She's coming to terms with that now that she's no longer an anonymous face. \"I think what led up to it was the build-up to the show and just psyching herself up for that and then wondering after the show, 'Where do I go now?'\" Britain's Got Talent judge Piers Morgan added: \"It is probably a good thing all round that Susan didn't win and can be under the radar for a bit. It is not a very serious matter, she is just exhausted and needs some rest.\" Gordon Brown said he had watched Saturday's final and had called Simon Cowell and Morgan to check on Boyle's wellbeing. \"I hope Susan Boyle is OK because she is a really, really nice person and I think she will do well,\" Brown told GMTV. The immense pressure put on Boyle, who became a YouTube sensation after her first appearance on the ITV talent show, saw her swear at tabloid journalists who were camped out at her hotel and she also reportedly became upset backstage at the final when her dress was not ready. The huge international interest in her saw more than 100 journalists and 21 film crews from around the world turn up to the show's final press conference expecting a Boyle win. Boyle's predicament has prompted questions about the amount of support given to reality TV contestants. \"Her going to the Priory was absolutely predictable. On shows like this, when it looks like someone is getting a big groundswell of popularity, they need more than just the programme makers saying psychologists are there,\" said Jo Hemmings, a behavioural psychologist who has assessed testing on Big Brother. A senior TV executive, who has had experience dealing with contestants on a number of reality shows, added: \"On Big Brother, the key question you ask the contestants is how would they cope being locked up for 13 weeks under the public gaze, and that is always checked and double checked. Producers even try and talk them out of going in the house, but there is no way on Earth they would do that on Britain's Got Talent, and they shouldn't necessarily do that.\" But former ITV controller of entertainment Duncan Gray, who oversaw earlier series of the show, defended the producers. \"They are such responsible programme makers that if there was the slightest doubt about her mental state, [executive producer] Richard Holloway would not have allowed her to go on.\" Boyle is expected to stay in the Priory for the next few days before making decisions on what to do next. Plans are already under way for a US tour and for her to record an album of Broadway songs with the Czech National Symphony Orchestra. She is also due to join the Britain's Got Talent national arena tour, which begins in Birmingham on 12 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
