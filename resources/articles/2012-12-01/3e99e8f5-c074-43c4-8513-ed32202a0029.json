His arrival in The Town (ITV1), sunglasses rammed firmly on nose, face unreadable, mouth resolutely shut, is rather more ambivalent. \"I bet he smells of all the right things,\" remarks Kelly the florist as he appears in the square. I wasn't, at first, quite so sure. But this time Scott is here to solve the riddle rather than create it. Mark is returning home to bury his parents after they seemingly took their own lives, washing a pile of sleeping pills down with booze. We see teenage sister Jodie discover them in an arresting opening sequence: a cosy suburban round of goodnights and cups of tea ending in blue-lipped slumber and lives torn apart. In his first script for TV, playwright Mike Bartlett captures brilliantly the bleakness of a location you return to from duty not desire; the oppressiveness of being for ever the person you were as a teenager, rather than the adult you've become, coupled with the realisation that everything and nothing has changed. \"The biggest thing I had to worry about this morning was a leak in the bathroom,\" Mark tells old schoolfriends in the pub, trying to grab at a life that just hours ago was real but has been displaced by a decade-old castoff he had no wish to revisit. The whole \"that London\" shtick is rather overdone, but there's a real deftness and lightness of touch on show as Bartlett allows Mark's story to unfold slowly and painfully, from the books by the bedside with their pages turned over, to the text messages and emails the police ignore. That terrible ache of grief and disbelief hangs on the screen as the family divides in the very depths of its despair: Mark struggling with the loss of his parents, but also the loss of his carefully built city life; a guilty Jodie hiding her fears behind teenage bravado; gran Betty left shell-shocked. Scott stands at the centre of The Town, but is surrounded throughout by an ensemble cast of the highest order: Avigail Tlalim gives a fine performance as Jodie, a screen teenager who actually sounds like one \u2013 cross, defensive, chin-tilted against the world \u2013 while Julia McKenzie gives a beautifully controlled rendition of the crumpled Betty. Particularly clever casting comes with Martin Clunes as the buffoonish mayor, who turns out to be less of a joke than even his closest adviser suspects. There are some lovely moments of humour: the new undertaker who threatens to be sick before dropping Mum on her head; the old undertaker who heads down the pub to sing Rick Astley. Gran desperately trying to get rid of the \"understanding\" police officer whose bum seems to have melded itself to the sofa. They provide relief, but also point up the horror of the situation. ITV has been making something of an effort with its drama of late, and The Town feels like a solid step forward, both surprising and intriguing. I'm hoping future episodes don't slide into the standard crime-mystery drama mould. Although given the confidence of this first episode, I'd be surprised if that were the case. I like to imagine that Simon Sebag Montefiore has an orchestra with him at all times, ready to strike a bombastic chord whenever he chances on an interesting artefact or building. Which, given that he is striding about Rome, examining sacrificial livers, unpicking its anti-Christian grafitti and uncovering the joys of its magnificent sewers \u2013 \"a twilight canyon of filth\" \u2013 would be practically non-stop. And so it is with the soundtrack for Rome: a History of the Eternal City (BBC4). There are times in Montefiore's fascinating exploration of this holy city when he seems to be battling the heavenly hosts to be heard, but the historian prevails, sweeping along the viewer with his irresistible tale of sacred Rome and the gods it has adopted. Some astonishing photography accompanies his arguments: beautifully composed pictures of ancient sites alongside colourful \u2013 sometimes slightly too literal \u2013 scenes from the modern city, with Montefiore in his panama, sweating it out under the fierce Roman sun. Also sweating it out, albeit thanks to teenage hormones and ineptitude rather than grand classical narratives, are Will, Simon, Jay and Neil, reunited on the small screen in The Inbetweeners USA (E4). The UK show from which it has been adapted has always made its particular brand of cringe-inducing hilarity look effortless \u2013 the American remake, however, underlines that its success was no accident. While characters and storylines have been imported wholesale, presumably in the hope of retaining that magic spark of recognition between audience and drooling teenage lummox, the boys are just a bit too socially acceptable. That lusciously wrong language also obviously proved too strong for a US audience \u2013 and what really is The Inbetweeners without \"clunge\"? Cancelled, after one season: MTV axed the show last week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
