There were moments of quality, some absolute howlers and the sort of VAR controversy that everyone would happily consign to the bin. In the end a draw was frustrating for both teams, but just about the right result. Bottom-of-the-table Norwich gave a gutsy performance and took a first-half lead through Mario Vrancic. They thought they had a second too, after Teemu Pukki superbly dispatched a 40-yard Vrancic pass, only to be belatedly adjudged offside by a distance not discernible to the naked eye. Spurs equalised quickly after half time through Christian Eriksen, went behind again with a comical own goal from Serge Aurier and earned parity late with Harry Kane\u2019s cute penalty. It was VAR\u2019s intercession that got everyone talking. Its wobbly blue and red lines looked as if they were mingling as Stockley Park adjudged Pukki\u2019s shoulder to be ahead of Toby Alderweireld\u2019s toe in the buildup to the Finn\u2019s 33rd minute strike. The video official on the day was Chris Kavanagh, the man who, as referee in Norwich\u2019s 1-0 defeat to Aston Villa on Boxing Day, awarded a Norwich throw to Villa in the buildup to their winner. Daniel Farke made sure to note that coincidence after the match. \u201cI thought the aim of VAR was to make the game more fair,\u201d Farke said. \u201cLast match we conceded a goal out of a clear and obvious mistake from the referee. It was not allowed to be overruled by VAR. Today I think if you watch back without a line you would say it was not offside, because my player was a yard further back. The referee from our Villa match was also the VAR today.\u201d Farke was otherwise in upbeat spirits despite a point not doing overly much to help the Canaries\u2019 fight against the drop. They competed well against Spurs throughout but were especially impressive in the first half, and deserved their half-time lead, even if the margin was less than they hoped. Their goal came from the Bosnian Vrancic, who has had to bide his time to get a place in this Norwich side despite their struggles. His calmness was crucial for promotion last season, however, and he took his effort superbly, driving on to overturned possession and giving a flick of his right boot before coming back across the ball. Caught out for just a moment, Paulo Gazzaniga could not get close. It was Juan Foyth who lost the ball for Spurs, sauntering out from the back, and by the time the game restarted after half-time he had departed the field. Jan Vertonghen was hooked off too as Jos\u00e9 Mourinho abandoned an experiment with a back three and threw on every creative player he had. Within five minutes of the restart Spurs had parity; Jamal Lewis was deceived in an aerial duel with Kane, handled the ball to correct his mistake and gave away a free-kick in Eriksen territory, with the customary result. The madness was not over, however, and six minutes later Norwich were back ahead in comical circumstances. After a good spell of possession Emi Buend\u00eda released Pukki into the Spurs box. Just as the Finn was teeing up a shot, Alderweireld arrived on the scene and poked the ball off Pukki\u2019s toe. What the Spurs man did not envisage, however, was Serge Aurier also turning up. The clearance bounced off the Frenchman and into the Tottenham net. At this point Spurs\u2019 creative players grabbed hold of the match \u2013 with Tanguy Ndombele as midfield pivot the pick of the bunch. Norwich were under severe pressure but looked to be standing firm, central defenders Christoph Zimmermann and Grant Hanley regularly putting their bodies on the line. Then with nine minutes remaining Norwich lost possession in their attacking third. They then compounded the error by backing off a counterattack comprised of just Kane and Dele Alli and when Kane invited Zimmermann to jump in with a challenge in the box, the German obliged. Kane got up and did with his penalty what Eriksen had done with his free-kick. \u201cIt was not necessary to tackle in this moment,\u201d said Farke, discussing yet another costly error for his team with Crystal Palace the next to visit Carrow Road on Wednesday. \u201cWe have to learn out of these moments and yes, it probably cost us two points. It was difficult for my two centre-halves but they showed great attitude and great commitment. If we go on with this great spirit and great commitment we still have a chance.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
