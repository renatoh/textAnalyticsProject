During a school visit, Mr Cameron told a class of sixth-form students: \"I'm afraid I think we are going to have to keep student fees.\" He added: \"You want to go to universities that are well-funded, have good tutors, good facilities, and I want as many people who think they are going to benefit from universities to be able to go, and I think if you want those things and if you want to keep taxes down, the money has to come from somewhere.\" He said the party would, however, review the arrangements for paying back debts. \"Let's make sure that students from low-income homes can go to the best universities in the land through bursaries and scholarships,\" he said. \"But I think we have got to be realistic and say that people have to make a contribution.\" Mr Cameron told the class he thought university was a \"really worthwhile thing to do\". In complete contrast to the party's policies during the general election last May, Mr Cameron first announced he would not scrap fees during last year's leadership contest. The vice-president education of the National Union of Students, Julian Nicholds, said Mr Cameron's stance was no surprise. \"The Tories have always advocated policies that will see student hardship and graduate debt soar, such as commercial interest rates on student loans. \"Whilst Mr Cameron may have scrapped his party's opposition to allowing more students into higher education, the combination of commercialised loans and \u00a33,000 a year fees will do little to encourage potential students. \"We are extremely concerned that access to education under a Tory government would be limited to those who can afford it. It is worrying that there remains little to distinguish between the policies of the two main parties, and we believe this lack of choice paints a bleak future for prospective students. We would urge both parties to rethink their stance on the future of education.\" The Liberal Democrats said today's announcement proved the Tories could not be trusted. The party's education spokesman, Edward Davey, said: \"David Cameron himself wrote the Tory manifesto that contained pupil passports and a pledge to scrap tuition fees. \"In less than 12 months he has completely changed his mind... Extending selection by ability and backing fees proves the Tories are still more concerned with the prospects of the few at the expense of the many.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
