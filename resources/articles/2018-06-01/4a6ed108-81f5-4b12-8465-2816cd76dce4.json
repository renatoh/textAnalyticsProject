Setting out the health service\u2019s key priorities for the future as it marks its 70th year, Simon Stevens, the body\u2019s chief executive, warned of a \u201cdouble epidemic affecting our children\u201d that also included obesity. \u201cIt is obvious that there is more unmet need for young people\u2019s mental health services than probably any other part of the health service,\u201d he said in his keynote address at the NHS Confederation annual conference in Manchester. \u201cThe conversation, though, around young people\u2019s mental health has got to be wider than just about what the NHS can do. \u201cThis is certainly about schools, but we also have to ask some pretty searching questions around the role of technology companies, social media, and the impact that that is having on childhood. \u201cSo, this cannot be a conversation that is simply left to the National Health Service to pick up the pieces \u2013 for an epidemic of mental health challenge for our young people induced by many other actors across our economy.\u201d He said the NHS must \u201clock in\u201d progress on cancer and mental health, while also prioritising the integration of social care as it considers plans for the next five to 10 years. Obesity was also highlighted as a key issue for the health service. \u201cIt is absolutely true that we need to be more physically active,\u201d Stevens said. \u201cBut that by itself is not going to deal with what\u2019s happening to our food and drink calorific environment. \u201cThat said \u2013 here is a key fact for you \u2013 on average in this country we spend twice as much time on the toilet than we do exercising.\u201d The prime minister, Theresa May, has pledged a long-term funding settlement for the NHS, which celebrates its 70th anniversary next month. \u201cI want that to be done in conjunction with NHS leaders and provide a multi-year funding settlement consistent with our fiscal rules and balanced approach,\u201d she told parliament\u2019s health and social care select committee in March. \u201cEnsuring the NHS can cope with demand ahead of the spending review, I would suggest we can\u2019t wait until next Easter. I think in this 70th anniversary year of the NHS\u2019s foundation we need an answer on this.\u201d The prime minister did not say how much more money the long-term plan could involve. But Stevens told the audience he was \u201cheartened\u201d by the commitment to securing a deal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
