We\u2019re meant to be going to a big party in the country, and we will need to spend a night in our tent. \u201cI hate camping,\u201d she says. \u201cWhy don\u2019t we just sleep in the car?\u201d \u201cHave you ever slept in a car?\u201d I say. \u201cWe have a really nice tent.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll probably still be in pain,\u201d she says. \u201cLet\u2019s just massively overpack,\u201d I say. \u201cBring everything \u2013 duvet, pillows, rugs \u2013 and see how it goes.\u201d \u201cUgh,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen is your appointment?\u201d I say. \u201cTwo-thirty,\u201d she says. \u201cHa!\u201d I say. \u201cWhy are you laughing at me?\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not laughing at you, it\u2019s just that\u2026\u201d \u201cYou have a tooth pulled and see how funny it is,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s a joke,\u201d I say. \u201cNot to me!\u201d she says, touching the side of her face. \u201cIt\u2019s famous,\u201d I say. \u201cTwo-thirty.\u201d \u201cShut up,\u201d she says. Two days later, I find myself in a field in Devon, standing over a pile of stuff \u2013 pillows, bags, an air mattress, a pump, the dog and the as-yet-unerected tent. \u201cDo you need help?\u201d my wife says. \u201cNo,\u201d I say. \u201cJust motivation.\u201d \u201cI need painkillers,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m off to find water.\u201d Our tent is not suitable for most forms of camping, because it\u2019s heavy and has the footprint of a bouncy castle. It\u2019s made of canvas, and will allegedly accommodate seven people. If you saw it standing among a load of other tents at a festival, you would probably think: I\u2019ll bet the person who owns that is an arsehole. But I am good at putting it up. I\u2019ve had a lot of practice over many years, and I can now manage it by myself, without fuss. When my wife returns 15 minutes later, I\u2019m basically done. \u201cWow,\u201d she says. \u201cSee?\u201d I say. \u201cIt\u2019s fun.\u201d I lose track of my wife at the party. Some time after midnight I go to check if she\u2019s in the tent, but when I get halfway there I realise I won\u2019t be coming back, either way: my limbs and eyelids are heavy, and my slightly damp duvet is calling. As I climb a small rise I catch sight of the pointed canvas peak silhouetted against the night sky, and I instinctively think: I\u2019ll bet the person who owns that is an arsehole. My wife is in the tent, snoring lightly. The air mattress is partially deflated. There is some residual buoyancy \u2013 enough to send an undulating wave beneath her as I sit, causing her to swear at me in her sleep \u2013 but when I lie down all my joints make contact with the ground. When I wake up the next morning, my wife is gone and the mattress is flat. I\u2019m so stiff I can\u2019t figure out how to sit up. Why, I think, did I even bother putting up the tent? I might as well have slept face down on the grass. That\u2019s when I hear the first drops hitting the canvas. It\u2019s raining steadily by the time my wife returns. \u201cWhat do we do?\u201d she says. \u201cWe pack it up wet, shove it in the car, and deal with it later,\u201d I say. The traffic is terrible, and we don\u2019t arrive home until 5pm. \u201cLet\u2019s never camp again,\u201d I say, pulling the tent from its bag. \u201cYou\u2019re doing that now?\u201d my wife says. \u201cWhen else?\u201d I say. I drag the sodden tent into the garden and spread it out on the dry grass. As soon as I do, it starts raining. I decide to leave it where it is until summer comes. That evening the oldest one and his friend come round for a takeaway. My wife goes to bed early, leaving the three of us to watch the football. I ache all over, but I am tremendously grateful to be indoors. \u201cIs that a corner?\u201d the oldest one says. \u201cIt should have been,\u201d his friend says. \u201cAnd so I was like, \u2018When\u2019s your appointment?\u2019\u201d I say. \u201cAnd she said, \u2018Two-thirty.\u2019\u201d \u201cHa!\u201d the oldest one says. \u201cThat\u2019s hilarious,\u201d his friend says. \u201cI know, right?\u201d I say."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
