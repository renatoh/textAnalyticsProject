Mr Pringle is moving from his current role as Capital group programme director to take up the newly created role of managing director of 95.8 Capital FM. As a result the Capital FM Network managing director, Andria Vidler, who was in charge of 95.8 Capital FM, is leaving the company. In another move designed to focus Capital's management resources on its flagship station, the group operations director and board member, Paul Davies, will take a more active day to day role in running the London network. Mr Davies will lead a team of executives charged with enticing listeners back to 95.8 Capital FM. \"Our mission to win back listeners to our flagship station is a significant challenge. Not surprisingly I have given our most senior people the task,\" said David Mansfield, the chief executive of Capital. \"Capital in London still enjoys commercial brand leadership and it is critical we distance ourselves further from the competition. \"We have the strongest brand name, a format that allows us to have the flexibility we need in music and presentation and a great team of people capable of achieving success.\" Ratings for Capital's flagship London station dipped to an all time low when latest Rajar audience figures came out in May. Its market share fell from 8.8% to 8.1%. Capital began introducing changes at its 95.8 Capital FM in the spring, broadening the range of music, introducing a Saturday night rock show, an album chart programme and relaunching the Chris Tarrant breakfast show. As part of the latest management changes, John O'Hara is moving to become the regional managing director of the Capital FM network, looking after all the company's stations outside London. Andy Johnson takes over from Mr Pringle as the head of group programming, while Ric Blaxill has been made creative director. Capital is planning to make an announcement about the future of the breakfast show in November. This will do nothing to stem speculation that Tarrant is set to leave the slot at the end of the year. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
