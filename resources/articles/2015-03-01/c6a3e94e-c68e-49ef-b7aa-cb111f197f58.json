They\u2019ve removed the screw so it\u2019s been sorted. I really don\u2019t think his knee is a big issue now. If anything good has come out it all [the spitting contest with Evans] it\u2019s the fact that we can do this now.\u201d After watching video footage of the incident, Carver realised he could not defend the Senegal striker for his part in an altercation which also saw Evans banned for six games. \u201cI sat down with Papiss and said \u2018listen I can\u2019t defend you on this, you\u2019ve done wrong and have to accept whatever punishment you get\u2019. There\u2019s no place in the game for it. Spitting is one of the lowest forms of anything you can do on the pitch. He was provoked but retaliating in the same manner is just as bad.\u201d After talking to Carver, Ciss\u00e9 pre-empted the Football Association\u2019s disciplinary process by issuing a public apology. \u201cPapiss is down because of what happened,\u201d Carver said. \u201cBut he made a good statement, a proper statement. \u201c The irony is that Cisse would have almost certainly been given a shorter suspension had he lashed out at Evans with his fists or his feet. \u201cI think one or two other players might have reacted differently to the provocation and got less of a ban for their retaliation,\u201d said Carver who must cope without his top scorer at Everton on Sunday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
