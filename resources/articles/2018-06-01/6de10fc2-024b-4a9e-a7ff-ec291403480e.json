Never before had the reigning champions lost seven successive league games in the modern era, and it did not take long herefor it to become apparent the Rhinos were about to create an unwanted record. This defeat leaves them hovering above the competition\u2019s bottom four, who will split from the rest in a month\u2019s time to fight against relegation with the Championship\u2019s best in the Qualifiers. In 2016 Leeds\u2019s presence in that mini-league was shocking. To be there two years from the past three would be unthinkable. But it is perhaps the nature of this defeat to second-placed Wigan which will be most concerning. Leeds had improved of late but by half-time they were 22-4 behind after being comprehensively outplayed, and matters only got worse. Such was the nature of their performance it prompted the usually positive McDermott to tell it like it was. \u201cI could give you some cliches and they would be true \u2013 but if you\u2019re asking me if I\u2019m concerned then yes, for sure,\u201d he said. Though Leeds took the lead through Brett Ferres\u2019s early try, by half-time two tries for Liam Marshall and another for Josh Woods \u2013 the teenage half-back who was magnificent for the home side \u2013 had established a commanding advantage which Wigan did not surrender. The Rhinos\u2019 performance only worsened after the interval. The moment Liam Farrell strode through a huge gap in Leeds\u2019 defence to touch down underlined the gulf between the two sides, before the Rhinos topped that by throwing two wild passes in midfield in the final moments which were picked off by Wigan players and eventually finished by Marshall and Tom Davies. There were moments of promise for Leeds, Joel Moon\u2019s late try among them. But the champions are running out of excuses as well as time. On this form Leeds may need the sides below them to keep losing should they wish to avoid the Qualifiers this summer.
