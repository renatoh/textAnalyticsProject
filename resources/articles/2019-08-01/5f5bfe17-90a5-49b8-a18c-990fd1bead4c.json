The Brazil international, who was left out of Barcelona\u2019s squad for their La Liga opener against Athletic Bilbao on Friday \u2013 which they lost 1-0 \u2013 looks set to join the German champions following a summer of speculation. His loan deal is expected to include an option for a permanent move. \u201cWe can confirm that there is an agreement in principle for the loan of Coutinho to Bayern,\u201d said Barcelona\u2019s club director, Guillermo Amor, before the league match. \u201cWe just have to finalise the deal.\u201d Bayern\u2019s sporting director, Hasan Salihamidzic, added: \u201cI can confirm that [chief executive] Karl-Heinz Rummenigge and I were in Barcelona and we have reached an agreement with the club, player and agent,\u201d Salihamidzic was quoted as telling the broadcaster ZDF. \u201cOnly a few details are still to be sorted out. We are very happy that we will bring this player to Bayern.\u201d The 27-year-old joined Barcelona from Liverpool in a \u00a3142m deal in January 2018 but has struggled to find his form in Spain and was linked with loan moves to Tottenham, Arsenal and even Manchester United during the summer window. He is pencilled in to have his Bayern medical next week. Coutinho has made 75 appearances in all for Barcelona, scoring 21 goals, and was part of the side beaten in the semi-finals of the Champions League by the eventual winners, Liverpool. Bayern\u2019s coach, Niko Kovac, who saw his side drop two points at home in a 2-2 draw with Herha Berlin in their opening game of the Bundesliga season, also welcomed the impending arrival of Coutinho. \u201cI am of the opinion that not only FC Bayern, but the entire Bundesliga and all of Germany can look forward to welcoming such a top player here in this league,\u201d he said. Bayern also announced the \u201cimminent signing\u201d of 20-year-old French midfielder Micka\u00ebl Cuisance from Borussia Monchengladbach. On the pitch, Kovac admitted his side were punished for not making the most of their dominance against Hertha. In the end, the hosts needed a Robert Lewandowski penalty to earn a point after Hertha scored two quickfire goals at the end of the first half. \u201cHertha were a bit lucky to share the spoils, but they defended well,\u201d Kovac said. \u201cWe had a lot of chances, we failed to take many clear-cut chances. But I can\u2019t blame my team. They tried everything, they gave it everything. It was one-way traffic, we were dominant. But we lacked the bit of luck you need. A compliment to Hertha for bearing up against it. We must make sure we soon collect the two points we failed to take today.\u201d Hertha boss Ante Covic, in his first Bundesliga match as a head coach, said: \u201cWhen you play away to Munich you know from the start you can\u2019t dominate the match as you\u2019d like to. You must still believe you can have some good moments to take something away from here.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
