Senior officials of the Norwegian Nobel Institute have said the 2019 winner\u2019s refusal to attend any event where he could be asked questions publicly is \u201chighly problematic\u201d. Olav Nj\u00f8lstad, the secretary of the Nobel committee, said it would \u201cvery much have wanted Abiy to engage with the press during his stay in Oslo\u201d. \u201cWe strongly believe that freedom of expression and a free and independent press are vital components of peace \u2026 Moreover, some former Nobel peace prize laureates have received the prize in recognition of their efforts in favour of these very rights and freedoms,\u201d he said. Nobel peace prize laureates traditionally hold a news conference a day before the official ceremony, but Abiy has told the Norwegian Nobel committee he does not intend to do so. Neither will the 43-year-old leader take questions from reporters after his meeting with the Norwegian prime minister, Erna Solberg, nor participate at a traditional annual event with children celebrating peace at the Nobel Peace Center museum. Nj\u00f8lstad added that the committee\u2019s concerns had been made \u201cvery clear to the prime minister and his staff\u201d. Abiy was awarded the Nobel prize for the peace deal he concluded with neighbouring Eritrea last year, three months after coming to power in 2018. The agreement resolved nearly two decades of military stalemate following a border war that ended in 2000. The former military intelligence officer has pushed through reforms at home, dramatically changing the atmosphere in what was regarded as a repressive state. Measures have included the lifting of a ban on political parties, the release of imprisoned journalists and the sacking of previously untouchable officials, some of them accused of torture. In November, Abiy faced perhaps the most serious crisis of his term in office after the death of scores of people in a wave of violent disorder. Abiy\u2019s press secretary, Billene Seyoum, said it was \u201cquite challenging\u201d for a head of state to find enough time for the extensive Nobel programme, particularly since \u201cdomestic issues are pressing and warrant attention\u201d. Abiy would attend essential events in consultation with the Nobel Institute \u201cto honour and respect the Nobel tradition\u201d, she said. At the same time, \u201cthe humble disposition of the prime minister, rooted in our cultural context, is not in alignment with the very public nature of the Nobel award\u201d, Billene said. \u201cThe prime minister is \u2026 grateful for the recognition.\u201d Norwegian media have raised concerns that the Nobel prize committee have \u201conce again made a problematic choice\u201d. Other winners have failed to engage with the media. The former US president Barack Obama also declined to speak to reporters when he won the peace prize in 2009 \u2013 and Abiy has rarely given interviews since taking office last year. Analysts say Abiy\u2019s reforms have lifted the lid on long-repressed tensions between Ethiopia\u2019s many ethnic groups and unrest is expected to worsen in the run-up to the country\u2019s election in May. When announced earlier this year, the Nobel chairwoman, Berit Reiss-Andersen, defended the choice of Abiy, saying that though some people might have considered it too early to give the Ethiopian leader the prize \u201cit is now that Abiy Ahmed\u2019s efforts need recognition and deserve encouragement\u201d. Abiy is expected to give an acceptance speech on Tuesday at Oslo City Hall before officials, including Norwegian royals, after receiving the 9m kronor (\u00a3721,000) cash award, a gold medal and a diploma. Abiy also is to meet with Solberg and open a Nobel prize exhibition during a private ceremony. Billene said Abiy was \u201cone of the most accessible Ethiopian prime ministers to date in public and media engagements\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
