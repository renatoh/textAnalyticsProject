The latest tidbit: Suleman has launched a website to receive donations, gifts and well wishes. And judging from an article in today's LA Times, the site's arrival is quite timely. The paper has managed to detail estimated costs to the state of California that Suleman's huge family could accrue. In addition to the octuplets Suleman has six other children, three of whom qualify for subsidised disability assistance. Here's a breakdown of the money she could receive from state and federal governments: Lowell Kepke, a spokesman for the San Francisco office of the Social Security Administration, said that a single parent with no income qualifies for up to $793 (\u00a3551) a month for each child with a physical or mental condition that results in \"marked or severe functional limitations\". That money is used for support and maintenance of the family, and Suleman would not be required to specifically account for how it is spent. If Suleman's disabled children received the maximum payment, she would get nearly $2,900 (\u00a32015) a month in state and federal assistance, including the food stamps. Suleman is currently a student with no income and plans to use education loans to support her children until she graduates and lands employment. Despite those who feel compelled to offer donations to Suleman, it appears taxpayers in California will undoubtedly shoulder a part of her family's financial burden."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
