The Premiership champions this week announced it is expanding its financial services arm. It already offers a club-branded credit card and savings accounts, and now hopes to kit its fans out with \"own-brand\" insurance, mortgages, investments and pensions. But financial experts say that with these sorts of products, everyone's needs are different and by going to Manchester United you are only going to be getting a limited choice of products. You should consider seeking independent financial advice, and at the very least you should make sure you shop around. Most of the new products aren't launched until December/January. Intriguingly, however, there is the promise of a \"bonus element\" enabling people buying them to benefit directly from the team's performance. So, based on what we do know, how do the products stack up? Credit card: Provided by MBNA, this has a six-month introductory balance transfer rate of 1.9%, and the rate on purchases is 14.9%. There are better rates around including Capital One and Egg, which have introductory rates on purchases of 0% for nine months and six months respectively, rising to 12.9%. Savings accounts: The club's savings accounts, provided by Britannia building society, are a game of two halves. The adult account pays a nothing-special 2.25% gross from \u00a3100-\u00a34,999, then 3.75% from \u00a35,000-plus. But the kids' account pays a high-scoring 5.5% from \u00a31. The club is now promising savers an extra two months' interest bonus of 1% if the club qualifies for the UEFA Champions League. Personal loans: Available from this week, provided by Bank of Scotland. Rates vary from 8.9% to 16.9%. Someone borrowing \u00a35,000 would pay 9.9%. There are lower rates out there - Northern Rock and Nationwide would only charge someone borrowing this amount 8.5% and 8.9% APR respectively. Life insurance/investments/pensions/general insurance: No product details available yet. All will be provided by Zurich Financial Services (the company which includes Allied Dunbar, Eagle Star and Threadneedle). The club promises they will be competitive but Craig Wetton at IFA Chartwell Investment Management says one has to assume there will only be Zurich products available, and this means you are only going to be getting a very limited choice. Zurich can be quite competitive in some areas such as life insurance, he says. Mortgages: Will be based on Britannia's flexible mortgage. This has a very good rate - bank base rate plus 0.85% for the life of the loan, plus there's a 2% discount for the first six months, giving an initial pay rate of 3.35% - says mortgage broker London &amp; Country, but it adds that a flexible tracker loan certainly won't suit everyone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
