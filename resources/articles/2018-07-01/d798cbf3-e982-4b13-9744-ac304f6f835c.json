The verdict is withering: Facebook failed. It \u201cobfuscated\u201d, refused to investigate how its platform was abused by the Russian government until forced by pressure from Senate committees and, in the most damning section, it aided and abetted the incitement of racial hatred in Burma, noting that even the company\u2019s chief technical officer, Mike Schroepfer, called this \u201cawful\u201d. Recommendations include: \u2022 \u201cClear legal liability\u201d for tech companies \u201cto act against harmful and illegal content\u201d with failure to act resulting in criminal proceedings. \u2022 Full auditing and scrutiny of tech companies, including their security mechanisms, and full algorithm auditing. Strengthen the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office (ICO). Impose a levy on tech companies operating in the UK to pay for it. The Competition and Markets Authority should investigate fake profiles and advertising fraud. \u2022 A ban on micro-targeted political advertising to similar audiences. \u2022 A \u201cnew category of tech company\u201d to be formulated which \u201ctightens tech companies\u2019 liabilities and which is not necessarily either a \u2018platform\u2019 or \u2018publisher\u2019\u201d. \u2022 Sweeping new powers for the Electoral Commission and a comprehensive overhaul of existing legislation that governs political advertisements during elections. \u2022 A further demand for Mark Zuckerberg \u201cto come to the committee to answer questions to which Facebook has not responded adequately to date\u201d. \u2022 A code of ethics that all tech companies will agree to uphold. Cambridge Analytica It was the Cambridge Analytica scandal that blew open the committee\u2019s inquiry in March, though it had already been a focus of its investigations. At its hearing in Washington in February, it had asked a series of pointed questions of Simon Milner, a Facebook executive, whose answers the report describes as \u201cdisingenuous\u201d. The report includes: \u2022 \u201cDisturbing evidence\u201d of work overseas that it urges the National Crime Agency (NCA) to investigate, including allegations it worked with Black Cube, an Israeli intelligence firm \u201cwhose work allegedly included illegal hacking\u201d. \u2022 New allegations of an undercover sting carried out by a \u201ctemporary SCL [parent company of Cambridge Analytica] employee\u201d who was paid \u00a310,000 by Alexander Nix to bribe a politician in St Kitts in the Caribbean. \u2022 Details about Cambridge Analytica\u2019s relationship with Henley &amp; Partners, a passport investment company that has programmes in St Kitts and Malta. The committee also noted that Daphne Caruana Galizia, an investigative journalist, who was murdered in October last year, was investigating the company, highlighted the damage that these passport sales were inflicting on both Malta and the European Union. The report urges the NCA to investigate SCL\u2019s work with Henley &amp; Partners. It also notes Lord Ashcroft had recently extolled the virtues of Malta as the \u201cbest destination for ambitious UK firms\u201d to have a post-Brexit presence in the EU. \u2022 \u201cReally worrying\u201d evidence that SCL also worked for the UK government, had provided psychological operation training for Ministry of Defence staff, had received classified information about Afghanistan and, according to Nix\u2019s testimony, had \u201csecret clearance\u201d. The report urges the government to ensure the NCA investigates. \u2022 Concerns about \u201cthe administrator\u2019s proposals in connection with SCL Elections Ltd, as listed in Companies House, and the fact that Emerdata Ltd is listed as the ultimate parent company of SCL Elections Ltd, and is the major creditor and owed \u00a36.3m\u201d. Recommends the NCA investigates. Russia DCMS committee chair Damian Collins told the Observer that when it first started asking questions about Russia, it very quickly led to questions about interference in British elections, including the EU referendum. \u201cAnd we noticed an aggressive campaign against us even asking these questions. It underlined the need to persist, which we have done.\u201d He said that the committee believed the evidence it had received so far from Facebook represented only the \u201ctip of the iceberg\u201d. The report includes: \u2022 A call for a full investigation into contacts between Arron Banks \u2013 millionaire backer of Leave.EU \u2013 and Russian officials and his business dealings with Russian companies. \u201cWe understand the National Crime Agency is investigating these matters. We believe that they should be given full access to any relevant information that will aid their inquiry.\u201d \u2022 A call for a full investigation into the source of Banks\u2019s donations to the referendum \u201cto verify that the money was not sourced from abroad\u201d. It notes that \u201cshould there be any doubt, the matter should be referred to the NCA\u201d. \u2022 A proposal for limits in future elections on individual donors and for major donors to \u201cdemonstrate the source of their donations\u201d. \u2022 A demand for further investigation by Facebook of Russian interference on its platform. Facebook\u2019s denial of \u201cdirect Russian interference using Facebook in the Brexit referendum\u201d was \u201cdisingenuous and typical of Facebook\u2019s handling of our questions\u201d. \u2022 Calls for a full ICO report on Aleksandr Kogan, the Russian-born scientist who was working in Russia with grants from the Russian government while harvesting Facebook data for Cambridge Analytica. \u2022 A request for more information about the ICO\u2019s statement that Cambridge Analytica\u2019s systems had been \u201caccessed from IP addresses that resolve to Russia and other areas of the CIS [Commonwealth of Independent States]\u201d. \u2022 A statement from the British government on \u201chow many investigations are currently being carried out into Russian interference in UK politics\u201d. It says: \u201cIt would be wrong for Robert Mueller\u2019s inquiry to take the lead about related issues in the UK.\u201d It calls for coordination between all relevant authorities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
