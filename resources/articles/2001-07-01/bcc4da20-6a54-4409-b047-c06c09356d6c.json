The Office for National Statistics said the underlying rate, which excludes mortgage interest payments, remained at 2.4% - just below the chancellor's 2.5% target. Food prices continued to soar, up 5.6% from a year ago, the highest annual increase for close to six years. The cost of pork, poultry and soft drinks all rose sharply relative to 12 months ago when shoppers were able to benefit from a wave of special offers. Despite the inflationary pressure, relatively stable petrol and oil prices helped keep the cost of borrowing in check. While petrol prices at the forecourt saw little change in the month, this compares to a four pence per litre rise in June last year when oil companies were concerned about a shortfall in supply. The figures are in line with City expectations, although some analysts had pencilled in a slight fall to 2.3%. The headline rate of inflation, which includes mortgage interest payments, fell 0.2% to 1.9% in June as home owners benefited from the Bank of England's interest rate cut in May. The average mortgage interest rate fell by 0.29 percentage points during the month, the ONS said. Other small downward effects came from price changes for rents and home insurance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
