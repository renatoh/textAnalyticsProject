The nerdish, music snobbery of the original novel prevails; alongside jokes about Creed and soliloquies about getting rid of Michael Jackson\u2019s entire oeuvre, vintage music T-shirts are a battleground. A Cheap Trick tee gets ridiculed, a Miseducation of Lauryn Hill one becomes shorthand for Rob\u2019s co-worker\u2019s tastes and ambitions, and an accidentally destroyed vintage Joy Division T-shirt becomes a metaphor for a toxic relationship. Rob herself mixes achingly cool girl grams (cardigans, DM boots, Matrix jackets) with Wu-Tang Clan and Beastie Boys (Licensed to Ill era) tops. Why those bands? \u201cThey\u2019re both awesome and represent going your own way whether it\u2019s deemed cool or not,\u201d says the show\u2019s costume designer Sarah Laux. A vintage rock T-shirt obsessive herself (she\u2019s been collecting them for 20 years), she sees the unspoken meaning behind the T-shirt: \u201cThey show a level of commitment to the history of music,\u201d she says. \u201cRob is no different. Having a vintage T-shirt from a classic band is like having a piece of history.\u201d Similarly on HBO\u2019s Insecure, Issa Rae\u2019s character, Issa, has an equally enviable wardrobe of vintage tees: Public Enemy, Nina Simone and Prince. In the show they are used both as an expression of the characters\u2019 personalities and a narrative wink to what\u2019s going on in the plot. \u201cEarly on during the pilot process, we talked about Issa\u2019s style feeling nostalgic,\u201d says Ayanna James, the show\u2019s costume designer. \u201cI purchased a few vintage band tees for Issa to wear at the end of the first episode.\u201d James wanted the show to have the T-shirts articulate what Issa was going through. \u201cSpecifically during season 2, I would plug in shirts that matched Issa\u2019s mood.\u201d As well as being a fashion talking point, it\u2019s also big business. Pre-loved T-shirts from Wu-Tang or Backstreet Boys can go for \u00a3500 or more on resale sites. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of $1,500 band T-shirts out there,\u201d Laux says. She\u2019s seen a Sonic Youth T-shirt go for $2,000. \u201cPeople are interested in having items of clothing that have lived a life and that are essentially one-of-a-kind pieces.\u201d In 2011, HMV started making extra space for their vintage tee selection, clocking the growing nostalgia market and that music fans would pick up a T-shirt, mug and possibly badge along with the commemorative reissue of their favourite album. \u201cWe were seeing a massive increase,\u201d says chief buyer Gary Williamson. In a world lived through screens, there\u2019s more value in the \u201cnostalgia economy\u201d where the connection to the past is of a high premium. Going analogue also plays out in a physical way. \u201cI actually think that the vinyl renaissance is the older sibling of the current T-shirt trend,\u201d says James Goodhead, co-founder of Unified Goods \u2013 a bespoke vintage T-shirt company. He says that the visual appeal of vintage T-shirts has a unique quality. \u201cThe way cotton and screen-printed graphics can age over the decades can be mesmerising \u2013 it really draws you in,\u201d he says. Vintage T-shirts from the 1970s and 80s feature a mix of polyester and cotton, they feel extra soft and will probably look a bit depleted due to age and having been washed lots. Cut to the 1990s and T-shirts were made in 100% cotton, they look a bit baggier and feel a bit more robust than their historical T-shirt cousins. \u201cThere\u2019s a new level of detail that people are really investigating,\u201d Goodhead says. Unlike other vintage fashion items, there is a place for the more \u201clived in\u201d look; little imperfections can make the garment feel filled with personality. A cracked graphic or a cigarette hole in the arm \u2013 in the case of the vintage T-shirt it can feel like this look gives it personality rather than making it feel moth-eaten and not really resellable. It all ties into the tactile sense of physically connecting to another time and place, which is important. \u201cPeople want a feeling of belonging to a movement or an era,\u201d says Goodhead. It\u2019s something that Urban Outfitters think about when they consider which vintage T-shirts to stock. \u201cWe split them into stories based on what feels like a trend,\u201d says Ruth Higginson, urban renewal buyer for the shop. But it\u2019s not just bands, it\u2019s also brands who are seeing the value in cashing in on nostalgic fetishisation. The biggest sellers at Unified Goods are associated with 90s skater chic, 50s beat poetry icons and contemporary artists. \u201cMost roads lead back to pivotal, subcultural happenings,\u201d Goodhead says. The company curates the eras that they deem relevant: on their homepage are T-shirts featuring the 90s recycle symbol, Panasonic and Mawell T-shirts and a Phantom of the Opera tee. Another consequence of social media is that the fashion cycles have sped up, so trends are coming up quickly and the idea of what \u201cvintage\u201d means has changed. Now when we use the term we\u2019re not just using it in reference to a floral blouse that looks like it\u2019s from the Second World War, we could be talking about a bucket hat from the 1990s or a boxy, shoulder-padded suit jacket from the 1980s. Goodhood recently launched a vintage T-shirt range which showcased old tech logos from Apple to the disintegrating Microsoft square. Co-founder of Goodhood Kyle Stewart thinks that the products will resonate with \u201canyone who is aware of a brand\u2019s current status and is misty-eyed for the simplicity of brands 20 years ago. The old branding of the vintage Apple products is relatively quaint compared to their contemporary appearance.\u201d More recently, Unified Goods have collaborated with the Tate Modern for the big Andy Warhol retrospective, providing vintage Warhol-related merchandise from the 1970s to the 1990s. What would the prince of pop art have made of the vintage T-shirt trend? \u201cHe would have loved it, for sure,\u201d says Goodhead. \u201cThese T-shirts have almost become small works of collectible art.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
