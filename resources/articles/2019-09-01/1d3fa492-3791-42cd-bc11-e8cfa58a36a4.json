It did not take a genius to deduce that Steve Bruce\u2019s predecessor was not really talking about deficient bedding but deploying a diplomatic metaphor to emphasise his struggles to make the most of insufficient resources at St James\u2019 Park. Ben\u00edtez\u2019s way of making Newcastle appear more than the sum of their parts was to implement a possession-light, counterattacking approach big on shape and structure which left his team hard to beat. Bruce is attempting to make that framework a little more flexible and, by upping the possession and particularly the pass-completion statistics, provide increased scope for creativity and improvisation. \u201cIt\u2019s the only way we\u2019ll improve,\u201d he maintains as he prepares for Sunday\u2019s tricky trip to Leicester. \u201cWe can\u2019t keep surrendering the ball; we\u2019ve got to cross it more, we\u2019ve got to create more chances.\u201d Few fans would disagree yet such philosophical transitions often prove uncomfortable and sometimes downright dangerous. At times this season Bruce\u2019s XI\u2019s have looked as unconvincing as the latest Peter Kenyon-led attempted takeover at St James\u2019 Park. Although Ben\u00edtez\u2019s successor is convinced that, unless his players become more comfortable and fluent on the ball, they will continually be involved in relegation skirmishes, altering the squad\u2019s deeply ingrained counterattacking mindset is much easier said than done. With Bruce having won only one Premier League game since taking charge \u2013 albeit at Tottenham \u2013 and average home attendances down by almost 10,000, he could probably have done without reporters overhearing a comment from Isaac Hayden last Saturday. It was 30 minutes into the goalless draw against Brighton when the midfielder approached the technical area and told his manager: \u201cThis isn\u2019t working.\u201d At present Bruce\u2019s every tactical tweak \u2013 and so far they have amounted to experimenting with 3-5-2, modifying Ben\u00edtez\u2019s 3-4-3 and attempting to press higher up the pitch \u2013 appears freighted with risk. Already he has learned that attempting to build everything around Jonjo Shelvey\u2019s languid playmaking skills does not work. The task is further complicated by last season\u2019s top scorers, Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n and Ayoze P\u00e9rez, having left a club also missing the similarly departed Mo Diam\u00e9\u2019s influential midfield heft. Granted, the \u00a340m Brazilian striker Joelinton has arrived but the 23-year-old is struggling to adapt to a new Premier League habitat, as is the \u00a316.5m former Nice winger Allan Saint-Maximin, 22. Meanwhile, Andy Carroll \u2013 who reportedly commands a basic \u00a320,000-a-week wage supplemented by \u00a335,000 per substitute appearance and \u00a370,000 per start \u2013 has an ankle problem and may not begin a game until the new year. While P\u00e9rez joined Leicester for \u00a330m, Rond\u00f3n was reunited with Ben\u00edtez at China\u2019s Dalian Yifang after Newcastle balked at paying \u00a316m to turn a 30-year-old\u2019s loan into a permanent deal. Diam\u00e9, 32, headed to Qatar\u2019s al-Ahli when his contract was not extended. \u201cMo Diam\u00e9\u2019s an excellent player,\u201d says Bruce. \u201cI\u2019d have tried to keep him but it was all done and dusted by the time I arrived.\u201d He is left with tantalising yet unfulfilled potential. \u201cJoelinton\u2019s still learning the trade a little bit,\u201d he says. \u201cAt Hoffenheim he played on the left, rather than through the middle, a lot and got used to that role. I don\u2019t think that, as a team, we\u2019ve created enough chances for him but I can\u2019t \u2013 or won\u2019t \u2013 change our style radically, it\u2019s got be gradual, it can\u2019t happen overnight.\u201d Ben\u00edtez previously declined the chance to sign Joelinton but did push for January\u2019s \u00a320m acquisition of Miguel Almir\u00f3n from Atlanta in the MLS. The gifted if enigmatic Paraguayan is still to score his first Newcastle goal. \u201cThe biggest problem, is what\u2019s his best position?\u2019\u201d says Bruce. \u201cHe\u2019s a really good footballer. He\u2019s not a centre\u2011forward or a natural No 10, he\u2019s an old-fashioned inside\u2011forward and we have to get the best out of him.\u201d His predecessor would argue that Almir\u00f3n looked an infinitely better fit alongside the experienced Rond\u00f3n but Bruce broadly endorses Newcastle\u2019s reluctance to invest heavily in players aged over 25 due to a lack of resale value. \u201cI agree with the policy because it\u2019s everybody\u2019s policy,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s not many Premier League teams who would want to spend big money on a 30-year-old.\u201d The trouble is, without Rond\u00f3n, Bruce\u2019s blanket seems even shorter than Ben\u00edtez\u2019s."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
