Sports.com, which supplied sports results and content to third parties including the Financial Times and AOL, was worth \u00a3125m at the height of the dotcom boom. But the administrators, Baker Tilly, have been able to raise little more than \u00a31m through the sell-off of its assets. Baker Tilley said today it had raised over \u00a3500,000 by selling the rights to the Sports.com domain name back to its original owner. The company has already raised \u00a3670,000 through the sale of its betting arm to the acquisitive online bookie, UKBetting. \"Commercial sensitivity prevents me from disclosing the exact sum received for the termination of the licence of the Sports.com domain. However I can confirm that in total we have comfortably exceeded our target of a seven-figure sum for the main domain and the betting business,\" said administrator Bruce McKay. \"This is a fantastic result for creditors who often expect to receive little or nothing from the collapse of failed dotcoms,\" he added. CBS SportsLine.com, the US site that originally leased Sports.com its domain name in a 20-year agreement, has bought back the rights and has already sold them on to an as-yet unnamed third party. Sports.com collapsed on the eve of the World Cup finals after its backers refused to pour any more money into the venture. Mr McKay said that while negotiations were still ongoing, there was now little chance of finding a buyer for the content provision side of the business. \"Sadly, this is symptomatic of the dotcom industry. Potential buyers are primarily interested in the name and customer base rather than the content of the site and the contracts that go around it. \"Unless your content is unique it is very difficult to persuade the buyer to purchase the whole package,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
