Labour's Ed Balls, when he had Gove's job in 2008, did this when the Sun had turned the Baby Peter case into a national social work crisis. Balls declared that the original Haringey serious case review into the case was \"inadequate\". It later transpired that his officials had seen it well before it was published and raised no objections. Balls's intervention was essentially defensive. He had to divert attention from Labour's expensive child protection reforms, which were supposed to prevent the very failures that the Haringey SCR described. And he also had to justify the very public removal of Sharon Shoesmith, Haringey's director of children's services. According to sources at Bradford, the first they knew that Gove considered the Hamzah Khan SCR report to be \"risible\" was when they heard from journalists on the morning of the report's publication. Two days earlier the report had been discussed with Department for Education (DfE) officials, they claim, and no red flags had been raised. The children's minister, Edward Timpson published a fierce letter to the Bradford safeguarding board (which published the SCR) on Wednesday setting out 10 questions-that-must-be-answered in the SCR report. According to Bradford, the same questions had been previously raised by DfE officials, and answers supplied. The Gove intervention, Bradford believes, is opportunistic and clearly \"political\". If Balls' motivations had been defensive, Gove's intentions were aggressively offensive; designed, say observers, to advance an ideological agenda that holds that current national child protection arrangements are inadequate, and in need of a fundamental overhaul. He has plans to change the way social workers are trained (they are too hamstrung by \"dogma\", too reluctant to take at-risk kids into care). He wants social work provision to be outsourced to private social work firms (councils are too bureaucratic) and local safeguarding boards to be reformed (the head of Ofsted, Sir Michael Wilshaw, recently described the boards as \"not really worthy of the name\"). Gove may argue that his department's rubbishing of the Bradford SCR is genuine. But he has form. Back in 2008, as shadow children's secretary, Gove was one of a handful of people allowed to read the then-unpublished Baby Peter SCR that Balls declared to be inadequate. Gove heaped praise on the report, which had been overseen by Shoesmith, calling it \"a manual for how to improve children's services\". Less than two years later, and now in power, Gove's view changed: he endorsed the rewritten Haringey SCR ordered by Balls. The original SCR was officially discredited as \"insufficiently critical and insufficiently thorough\". Is the Hamsah Khan SCR rubbish? The opinion of politicians is never the most trustworthy guide."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
