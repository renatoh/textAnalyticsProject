Guardian Unlimited Travel and Altitude Holidays are giving away a holiday to one lucky winner, plus a maximum of five friends, staying in a catered ski chalet situated in the heart of Courchevel 1650. Courchevel offers outstanding skiing with plenty of things to see and do. Skiers can access the whole of the Trois Vall\u00e9es - with over 600km of pist\u00e9s, plus the four villages that make up Courchevel.
