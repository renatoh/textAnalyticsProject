A criminal defence lawyer working in the human rights sector, she was often required to take statements from people who had experienced horrific things at the hands of others. Those stories had an indelible effect on her perspective on the law. \u201cI just didn\u2019t believe in the system,\u201d Miller tells Guardian Australia. \u201cThe one area that I think they\u2019ve got wrong, really wrong, is consent, lack of that, and believing women.\u201d It\u2019s a lesson that the protagonist of her new play, Prima Facie, learns the hard way. Tessa is a barrister with a competitive streak who somehow always lands the brief to defend men accused of sexual assault. (It\u2019s because you\u2019re a woman and they think the optics in court are better, one of her colleagues tells her.) She takes all her cases on with gusto, believing in the process, in the system. Then she becomes a victim herself, and finds the scales of justice irrevocably shifted. Now playing its premiere season at Griffin\u2019s Stables Theatre in Sydney with the director Lee Lewis at the helm, Prima Facie has already yielded critical acclaim, lauded as \u201csharp, urgently precise\u201d and \u201cmore forceful than a call-to-arms\u201d. The Sydney season has completely sold out, and the show is poised to tour. Miller says she\u2019s heard from both barristers and victims of sexual assault who have seen it; the governor of New South Wales attended last Friday\u2019s performance. \u201cI walked around with this play in my head for so long,\u201d Miller says. Writing it was her way of working through the now all-too-familiar story of women trying \u2013 and failing \u2013 to find justice for the wrongs done to them. When the MeToo movement took hold and women all around the world started publicly sharing their experiences of sexual assault, she felt like its time had come. Tessa is not based on a real person but is an amalgam of all those people that Miller saw walk through the doors of her rooms, and the stories she heard them tell day after day. The character occupies a dramatic space somewhere between a Greek chorus and the forthright anonymised testimonials of The Vagina Monologues by Eve Ensler, whom Miller notes as an inspiration. Tessa is brought to crackling life by Sheridan Harbridge, a regular presence on Australian stages and a criminally underrated actor \u2013 perhaps partly for her preferred focus on new work, rather than establishment classics. Directors often deploy her musical and comedic talents, but in Prima Facie she demonstrates the sheer capacity of her range, from swaggering barrister to crumpled, traumatised woman, to stoic, defiant activist. There is humour, too \u2013 deftly handled \u2013 and a perspicacity to the writing that means Tessa\u2019s experience feels dangerously close to home, even if you have never gone through it yourself. \u201cI\u2019m also not a sexual assault survivor or victim \u2013 I had to declare that in the rehearsal room,\u201d Miller says. \u201cBut all of us have had a near miss, or something that bled a little bit into the uncertain space \u2026 That\u2019s just our everyday lived experience of being a woman.\u201d It\u2019s that uncertain space, she says, that the law has trouble with. The problems are structural and gendered; the law, mainly created and interpreted by powerful men, requires evidence to be delivered in a consistent and neat package, but victims of sexual assault are rarely in a position to do that. \u201cYou\u2019re talking about someone who has gone into survivor mentality,\u201d she says. In that headspace, everything unnecessary becomes a blur. Hence many survivors will not remember details, like what colour the towel was or how many drinks they had, but will remember the person and what was done to them. Things become even muddier when there\u2019s a relationship at the heart of the matter \u2013 when the assault happens within a budding romance, or a marriage, or between siblings, family members or colleagues. Prima Facie was intended to give a voice to those far more common lived experiences \u2013 not the cliche of \u201csomeone who grabs a virgin from behind a bush as she\u2019s walking home from school\u201d, but the murkier, messier space where assault is perpetrated by someone close to the victim. It\u2019s hard, especially for men in the law, Miller says, to understand the lived experience of that. That difficult content made the play \u201ca killer to write\u201d, but so did the fact that she wanted to reach both a legal and lay audience. It seems to be working. \u201cWhen I wrote it I thought, oh I\u2019m going to get hell for this. Just goes to show a bit of bravery pays off.\u201d Miller is firm that the play is not trying to cast doubt on the foundational legal concept of innocent until proven guilty. \u201cIt\u2019s the basis of why we have the society we have. I am a complete believer in that,\u201d she says. Rather, she\u2019s trying to ask the hard questions about how the law operates \u2013 and fails \u2013 in its attempts to deliver justice for sexual assault. \u201cThe way it\u2019s operating is to interrogate the woman, not to interrogate the crime,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is a he-said/she-said case. There\u2019s often very little other evidence. They\u2019re often in complete agreement that the sex act happened, but it\u2019s whether it was consensual or not.\u201d We also need to interrogate our ideas about what justice might look like in these cases, she says. What do victims want? The answers may surprise us. \u201cIt\u2019s about listening to what women want out of the process, as well as making sure the process is not harming them in any way as they go through it,\u201d Miller says. \u201cAnd not constantly making them out to be a liar. \u201cI\u2019ve had so many conversations about what the answers are now, but what\u2019s interesting to me is that lawyers are the ones that are least knowledgeable about the answers. Whereas academics or bystanders or people who have looked into other cultures really have some good answers. It\u2019s actually a bigger conversation than a law conversation.\u201d \u2022 Prima Facie by Suzie Miller is showing at Griffin\u2019s Stables Theatre, Darlinghurst, until 22 June. The production is touring to Canberra Theatre Centre 26\u201329 June and Riverside Theatres Parramatta 3\u20136 July"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
