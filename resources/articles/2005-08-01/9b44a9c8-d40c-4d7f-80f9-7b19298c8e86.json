What, in any case, was the intention? Practice? Punishment? Something to occupy the mind and keep them away from Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas for five minutes? Perhaps the biggest question mark was placed on the idea that preparation for the second Test against the best side in the world should include Twenty20 Cup and Totesport League matches. We can now say that Andrew Flintoff will go to Birmingham bolstered by a blistering 49 from 28 balls at The Oval; that Marcus Trescothick, having hit 25 from 19 balls in the Twenty20 semi-final there, can look forward to Thursday's examination from Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne with increased confidence; and that the captain Michael Vaughan can now carry into the match the feelgood factor created by his unbeaten century for Yorkshire against Kent on his home ground. Only Matthew Hoggard appears to have got very little from his day release to his county but he has had a pretty mundane season anyway and there is less for a bowler to gain from the limited overs and quirky field restrictions of the one-day format . But the decision made by Duncan Fletcher is not as left-field as it sounds. Batsmen who are out of form or down on their luck can do one of several things in an attempt to rectify matters. Firstly they can practise, which is fine for ironing out technical deficiencies; Tiger Woods would not correct errant driving by thrashing balls round the links. Secondly, they can actually get out and play, for old hands will tell you that no amount of practice can reproduce precisely the match situation, in terms of general ambience and competitive instinct, encapsulated in the feeling that one mistake and that is the day done. Thirdly, of course, they could opt to do nothing in the belief that there is nothing to do: the wheel will turn. For all that, sending batsmen off to Twenty20 was an interesting move by Fletcher but there is a reason why it would suit Flintoff and Trescothick rather than it would have some of the more staid players, who may have regarded a slow hundred against Derbyshire as better preparation. Each to his own. Sometimes it is merely the feel of the ball on the bat, the clean strike, that can set things in motion again and the very nature of the Twenty20 competition promotes unrestrained strokeplay. At the level these cricketers operate, confidence plays a massive part. If Trescothick's or Flintoff's timing has been awry there is little to lose and much to gain in allowing them free rein for an afternoon with plenty of time for net practice in the run-up to the game in any case. The remarks of South Africa's captain Graeme Smith, having led Somerset to the Twenty20 title, were instructive too. \"Guys are under pressure from ball one,\" he said. \"International cricket is a unique kind of pressure compared to domestic cricket and Twenty20 provides it for those coming through. It closes the gap between international cricket and domestic cricket pressurewise.\" When Stuart Robertson, then of the England and Wales Cricket Board, came up with his innovative idea to bring cricket back to the masses, he cannot have envisaged the shortest, most effervescent form of the game could have such a direct impact on the longest. Vaughan did not have the benefit of Twenty20 but he will have gained from his Headingley outing every bit as much as his one-on-one indoor sessions with Fletcher. In the aftermath of the first Test, the England captain has been contradictory. He \"felt good\" at Lord's, he has said, but nonetheless was castled twice, not something that should happen in such emphatic manner to a top player, who would be expected first of all to get wood on straight deliveries and if not that, pad. Outwardly, it seems, he has been in denial, yet still he sought Fletcher's counsel just as he had last year after a modest run in the opening Tests of the summer against New Zealand and the subsequent tri-nation one-day internationals. On that occasion his response was twin centuries against West Indies at Lord's. Now though his technique will be laid bare once more, the challenge this week to draw on the experience and feel of what, astoundingly, was only his second century in a one-day match (he has none for England) and adapt his game back to the demands of Test cricket, where strokeplay is more dependent on the quality or otherwise of the bowling. If the pitch at Edgbaston this week proves to be a little slower than that at Lord's the game could become more attritional, with patience a virtue as much as the capacity to take the game to the opposition. If that should be the case, it is the time Vaughan has spent at the crease, familiarising himself with all that involves, that will prove as important to him as the quick-fire way in which he scored his Sunday runs. The type of cricket is largely irrelevant. At least he appears to be back on track."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
