The Contract for the Web requires endorsing governments, companies and individuals to make concrete commitments to protect the web from abuse and ensure it benefits humanity. \u201cI think people\u2019s fear of bad things happening on the internet is becoming, justifiably, greater and greater,\u201d Berners-Lee, the inventor of the web, told the Guardian. \u201cIf we leave the web as it is, there\u2019s a very large number of things that will go wrong. We could end up with a digital dystopia if we don\u2019t turn things around. It\u2019s not that we need a 10-year plan for the web, we need to turn the web around now.\u201d The contract, which has been worked on by 80 organisations for more than a year, outlines nine central principles to safeguard the web \u2013 three each for governments, companies and individuals. The document, published by Berners-Lee\u2019s Web Foundation, has the backing of more than 150 organisations, from Microsoft, Twitter, Google and Facebook to the digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation. At the time of writing, Amazon had not endorsed the principles. Those who back the contract must show they are implementing the principles and working on solutions to the tougher problems, or face being removed from the list of endorsers. If the stipulation is properly enforced, some may not last long. A report from Amnesty International accuses Google and Facebook of \u201cenabling human rights harm at a population scale\u201d. The report comes weeks after Google was found to have acquired the personal health records of 50 million Americans without their consent. The contract\u2019s principles require governments to do all they can to ensure that everyone who wants to can connect to the web and have their privacy respected. People should have access to whatever personal data is held on them and have the right to object or withdraw from having that data processed. Further principles oblige companies to make internet access affordable and calls on them to develop web services for people with disabilities and those who speak minority languages. To build trust online, companies are compelled to simplify privacy settings by providing control panels where people can access their data and manage their privacy options in one place. Another principle requires companies to diversify their workforces, consult broad communities before and after they release new products, and assess the risk of their technology spreading misinformation or harming people\u2019s behaviour or personal wellbeing. Three more principles call on individuals to create rich and relevant content to make the web a valuable place, build strong online communities where everyone feels safe and welcome, and finally, to fight for the web, so it remains open to everyone, everywhere. \u201cThe forces taking the web in the wrong direction have always been very strong,\u201d Berners-Lee said. \u201cWhether you\u2019re a company or a government, controlling the web is a way to make huge profits, or a way of ensuring you remain in power. The people are arguably the most important part of this, because it\u2019s only the people who will be motivated to hold the other two to account.\u201d Emily Sharpe, the director of policy at the Web Foundation, said: \u201cThe web\u2019s power to be a force for good is under threat and people are crying out for change. We are determined to shape that debate using the framework that the Contract sets out. \u201cUltimately, we need a global movement for the web like we now have for the environment, so that governments and companies are far more responsive to citizens than they are today. The contract lays the foundations for that movement.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 25 November 2019 to include Twitter among the signatories."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
