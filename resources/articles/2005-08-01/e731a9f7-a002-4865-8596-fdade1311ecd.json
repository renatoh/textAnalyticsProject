Yeshiemebet Girma, 29, wore a black and silver headscarf as she sat in the dock at Bow Street magistrates court in central London, with her arms folded and fists clenched. Her sister Mulumebet Girma, 21, sat next to her in the dock. Both women waved and smiled at relatives in the public gallery as they were remanded in custody to appear again at the Old Bailey on November 17. They both face one charge under Section 38 of the Terrorism Act; that they failed to disclose information about Mr Osman, who is alleged to have tried to blow up a tube train near Shepherd's Bush on July 21. He subsequently fled to Italy, where he is in custody. The two women were read an additional charge today under the Criminal Law Act, which stated that between July 21 and July 27 they helped Mr Osman to evade arrest. The older sister's address was given as the Stockwell Gardens estate in south London and the younger sister's as Dorset Road, Stockwell. The prosecutor, Deborah Walsh, outlined details of the case against the two women, which cannot be reported for legal reasons. Bail applications for the pair were refused by the district judge, Timothy Workman. The two women sat in the dock with three female prison officers, remaining composed throughout the hearing. Yeshiemebet is a mother of three, including a seven-month-old baby. Mulumebet spent her childhood between the ages of three and nine in Italy, where her father was a diplomat. Her lawyer, Joseph Giret, described her as a \"model citizen\" and said she had recently gained a 2.1 degree from Brighton University. \"Sadly she missed her graduation ceremony because she has been in police custody,\" he said. The sisters are among 10 people due in court today in connection with the failed July 21 bomb attacks in London. Earlier, Ismael Abdurahman, 23, of Kennington, south-east London, appeared via video link from Belmarsh jail in London. Mr Abdurahman first went before magistrates last week charged under the Terrorism Act with failing to disclose information about Mr Osman. He appeared again today charged with a further four offences, all relating to allegations of helping Mr Osman and the other alleged would-be bombers, Ibrahim Muktar Said, Yasin Hassan Omar and Ramzi Mohamed. Siraj Yassin Abdullah Ali, 30, of New Southgate, north London, also appeared by video link today. He is charged with failing to disclose information about Mr Said and Mr Omar and with assisting Mr Said in evading arrest. Shadi Abdel Gadir, 22, of Brighton, appeared charged with failing to disclose information about Mr Osman. The electrical engineering student was also accused of a new charge of assisting Mr Osman in evading arrest. Wharbi Mohammed, 22, of Notting Hill, west London, appeared facing two new charges of helping the would-be bombers in addition to charges already made of failing to disclose information about Ramzi Mohamed and with assisting him in evading arrest. Asias Girma, 20, of Stockwell, south London, the brother of Yeshiemevet and Mulumevet, was the next to appear, charged with failing to disclose information about his brother-in-law Mr Osman, and with assisting him in evading arrest. The court heard that he had come to Britain aged seven from Ethiopia and had been granted indefinite leave to remain. Later, Mulumebet's boyfriend Mohamed Kabashi, 23, of Mary Magdalene Road, Brighton, appeared on charges of failing to disclose information about Mr Osman and with assisting him in evading arrest. Finally, Omar Almagboul, 20, of Dyke Road, Brighton, appeared via video link charged with failing to disclose information about Mr Osman and with assisting him in evading arrest. Many of Mr Almagboul's family, including his younger sister and his father, a businessman, were in court for the brief hearing and waved to him via the video link-up. In a separate hearing Abdul Sharif, 28, of Crossford Street, Brixton, south London, appeared to face two charges of failing to disclose information about Mr Osman and Mr Mohamed. Shaven-headed Mr Sharif, who was arrested last night, pleaded not guilty to both charges. He faces a maximum jail term of five years if convicted. All the men who appeared in court today were remanded in custody until November 17, when they will appear at the Old Bailey. Mr Ibrahim, Mr Omar and Ramzi Mohammed have each been charged with attempted murder, conspiracy to murder, conspiracy to endanger life by using explosives and making or possessing explosives with intent to endanger life. A fourth man, Manfo Kwaku Asiedu, has been charged with conspiracy to murder and conspiracy to endanger life by using explosives. They were remanded in custody earlier this week to reappear at the Old Bailey on November 14."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
