It now returns to its first big success. Even at a preview (with audiences less liable to be related to cast members than at press night), Fully Committed, directed by its star, Mark Setlock, is getting a standing ovation. As the roars of laughter whizzed past my straight face, I found it hard to believe that this was not partly due to the appreciation \u2013 not to say indulgence \u2013 that greets a one-man show which is delivered at high speed. Kevin Bishop takes the part of the would-be actor who is staffing the phones alone at a fashionable, overbooked restaurant, plush upstairs, squalid below them. He plays the callers and the called. He\u2019s the Japanese woman who rings up (specially perky face) to reserve \u201crunch\u201d, and a coke-snorting Australian PA who needs to make sure Naomi Campbell is not too near the lighting sconces. He is a furious magazine editor, a brave widowed father, a rasping-voiced octogenarian who complains the sampler menu\u2019s portions are tiny, and a Frenchman who can\u2019t face taking a call from a woman because she has a face like a dog. He is bribed and bullied, and given some sharp moments by Becky Mode\u2019s script. Someone has been taken ill in the ladies\u2019 lav: \u201cDid she puke?\u201d \u201cSame principle. Different outlet.\u201d A mafia boss wants a waiter to sing at a table celebrating a wedding anniversary: would our hero oblige with a rendering of The Lady is a Tramp? Nonstop hilarity; much eyebrow work; lots of rushing from phone to phone. All too strenuous to be rescued by the faint dramatic arc. Fully committed? Only partly engaged. Fully Committed is at the Menier Chocolate Factory, London SE1 until 15 November"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
