The unfurled paper swims in the air. I first saw Ventilator, this 1997 work by the Mexican-born artist Gabriel Orozco, in Paris last year. There, the three lengths of paper drew a helix turning in space, in constant writhing motion below the fan. So simple, so effortless and elegant, so very nearly stupid, it is Orozco at his best. But there are only two rolls on the fan in Orozco's Tate Modern show. And the fan is spinning fast, the paper twisted as it whizzes round below the blades. Like two mad pilot fish, or comets perhaps. All this talk of toilet paper. It is just material. There's material everywhere for making art: labels slipping off wet beer bottles, rotted tree trunks, rusted tins; a busted football, rainwater pooled in its deflated hollow. The world is full of stuff: sometimes it's just a case of noticing things. As much as thinking and doing, artists look. Or rather, they see things the rest of us miss or pay little attention to. This is why, when you leave an exhibition, the world can feel all keyed-up, and things remind you of the art you have just left. You begin noticing things, too. This is one of art's rewards, a sharing of sensibility. Orozco's work has shown regularly in Britain since the early 1990s. The current Tate exhibition originated at MoMA in New York, where I saw it a year ago. There it felt mummified by the museum, but it came alive when it moved to the second floor of the Centre Pompidou in Paris last autumn, where works were displayed in a single large gallery, two false walls removed to give an open view down onto the streets. Orozco works well when one is reminded of everyday life and the cacophonous visual poetry all around us. Nowhere is this more apparent than in Orozco's photographs: rainwater flooding a flat roof, reflecting sky and inverted trees; a furred-up shower head that looks like a cratered full moon; a chick spied in a nest through foliage, titled Big Bang. Every time Orozco makes a show I find something new, even if it is old. The Pompidou exhibition felt less a display than a laboratory, the works themselves gestures and experiments, many of which were shown on big tables in the middle of the room, alongside his Citro\u00ebn DS, cut longitudinally and reassembled, to look like a racing car for a single occupant, and an elevator cage you can enter, but which has been reduced in height. Inside, you feel compressed by gravity, endlessly descending. It's similar to the sensation one feels stepping onto an escalator that isn't working. At Tate Modern we are in the land of high art again, even if he is showing a huge lump of plasticine he once rolled through the streets of New York, accumulating rubbish in its greasy surface, and picking up imprints of paving slabs and gratings. And the empty shoebox, stranded on the floor, a container of nothing. One gallery floor is covered in shredded car and truck tyres \u2013 frayed like rope ends, curved, curled, patterned like monstrous reptilian skins, puddled with melted aluminium from the wheels. Orozco gives order to the wreckage. Another gallery is hung with clothes lines draped with bits of felted tumble-drier lint. The greyed, sometimes diaphanous lint is at once delicate and awful. It's full of hair, shed skin, fibres impregnated with DNA, hung out like the abject remnants of a flaying. In another room sheets of Japanese paper are printed with headlines from obituaries: \"A Comedian Known for Unorthodox Skits \u2026 Champion Archer Who Shot for Errol Flynn \u2026 Philosopher, Author and Friend of Popes.\" There are dozens of the texts: lives encapsulated, trivialised, hilariously and painfully condensed. What will Orozco's obituary say, one asks \u2013 or our own, come to that? And it will come to that. Perhaps the artist's best-known work is a skull, every inch drawn over with a chequerboard grid. It is a thousand times better than that glittery diamond-crusted skull of Damien Hirst's. There's something like love in the way the lozenges of the grid scallop into the eye-sockets and curve over the surface, mapping the cranium, like a mind meeting its container. Orozco also makes paintings in tempera and gold leaf and on bits of folded and unfolded paper \u2013 little Rorschach blots that resemble bodies, silhouettes, fragments of lettering. There are also black ceramic heads, torsos and pelvises, impregnated with the artist's handprints, and delicate graphite-on-plaster drawings whose tonal gradations and line are both certain and questioning. You come away wanting more. In one room, visitors can play billiards \u2013 on an oval table with no pockets, two white balls and a single red ball suspended above the green baize. It is a futile game in which the end is always out of reach. Games and play are important to Orozco. Play defies death and at the same time prepares us for it. Think of nursery rhymes and childhood games \u2013 someone always dies. A clay shape, squeezed in the artist's cupped hands, sits on a plinth. In an accompanying photograph, the artist opens his hands, showing the clay form. It is very like a human heart."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
