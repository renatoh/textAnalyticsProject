It's hard to tell which white-knuckle activity you will enjoy the most, or which is likely to terrify you the least. So, why not try a selection? Very few places allow you to combine white-water rafting, sea kayaking, paragliding, scuba, canyoning and mountain trekking. Fortunately, Kas, on the Mediterranean coast of Turkey, is one of them. You can experiment with different adventure activities without breaking the bank. Within easy reach are grade 5 rapids, clear blue, tideless diving waters and 3,000m mountains. There are also fantastic ancient ruins, and, if the action wears you out, unspoilt beaches to loaf on. Trekking The coastal region of south-west Turkey has dozens of excellent trekking routes. The most famous is the Lycian Way - it takes almost three weeks to complete the whole walk, but you can break it down into more manageable one- or two-day trips that take in highlights such as Nine Lakes Mountain, Mount Olympos and various ancient ruins. If you decide to overnight, you can stay at a mountain farm house and sample Turkish food at its best. Where to book: Kas-based Bougainville Turizm (+90 242 836 373, bougainville-turkey.com) organises a wide range of trekking from \u00a310. Sea kayaking A 40-minute drive along the coast from Kas is the fishing village of Ucagiz and a sunken Roman city. Swimming and diving are banned near the site, so the best way to get close up is in a sea kayak, which also gives you access to the small beaches that are hard to get to with bigger boats. Where to book: Bougainville Turizm offers daily sea kayaking packages from April to November, from \u00a320. Paragliding Rising 2,000m above the lagoon of Oludeniz, Mount Babadag is one of the world's top locations for paragliding. You will be strapped into a basket-cum-seat in front of the pilot, who guides you safely back down to earth. You can also jump from the 1,600m Mount \u00c7ukurbag with views over the Greek island of Kastellorizo and the Kas peninsula. Where to book: SkySports Paragliding operates from both Kas (+90 242 836 239, skysports-turkey.com) and Oludeniz (+ 90 252 6170511). Each descent costs \u00a355. White-water rafting Take a leisurely drive up the Dalaman river valley, deep into the mountains through pine forests and groves of pomegranate and olive. The journey back down river is much tougher: a three-hour charge through high-grade white-water rapids, such as Twin Sister (double grade 3) or the Sling Shot (grade 4). Where to book: Alternatif Outdoor (+90 252 417 27 20, info@alternatifraft.com) offers trips from May-October from \u00a355 including all equipment/transfers and lunch at the end of the journey. Diving The sea near Kas stays clear and warm up until late November, and offers an abundance of underwater life including marine turtles. The lack of tides and the high standard of dive boats and schools make it a good spot to learn. On a Discovery Dive, you will be taken to a calm island bay just outside Kas harbour and taught the basics in shallow water before undertaking a longer guided dive lasting approximately 20 minutes. Five-day PADI Open Water courses are available. Where to book: Bougainville Turizm rent boats, dive equipment and offers Discovery and PADI courses. Prices start from \u00a330. Ancient ruins The coast near Kas has many Greek, Roman and Lycian sites. One of the most enchanting is at Patara, a rambling Lycian port with an amphitheatre, magnificent stone gates, a collection of funeral caskets and a town square. Just behind it is 17km of glorious sandy beach, a breeding ground for one of the biggest colonies of marine turtles in the Mediterranean. Where to book: Bougainville Turizm offers a day trip for \u00a323pp including lunch. Or take a bus, dolmus (mini-bus) or taxi from Kas or Fethiye. Entry to the ruins costs \u00a32. Way to go Getting there: Exodus (020-8675 5550, exodus.co.uk) offers a variety of activity packages to Turkey, from 15 days' walking along the Lycian Way to one week's sea kayaking along the Turquoise coast.
