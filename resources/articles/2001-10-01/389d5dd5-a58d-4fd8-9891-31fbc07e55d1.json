He said he would spend \u00a340m over the next 18 months on procuring up to 25,000 operations in the private sector. This compared with \u00a320m promised last year to buy 10,500 operations as part of the government's concordat with the private hospitals. Mr Milburn's move - part of a \u00a3100m package of new money to relieve pressure on accident and emergency departments - came in response to sharp criticism from the audit commission on growing waiting times since Labour took office. It found the proportion of patients in England and Wales seen by a doctor within one hour of arriving in A&amp;E fell from 72% in 1996 to 53% last year. Most of the deterioration had occurred since 1998. The proportion of patients needing further treatment who were admitted to hospital within four hours of arrival in A&amp;E sank from 89% to 76%. Sir Andrew Foster, the commission's controller, said the figures were cause for concern. It was disappointing that a 10% increase in the number of A&amp;E doctors was not bringing quicker treatment for the 15m people who attended A&amp;E each year. \"There is a long way to go before all patients are seen quickly and treated well,\" he said. It was alarming that progress towards the government's target for dispensing clot-busting drugs to heart attack victims was slow. By next year 75% of heart patients should get the drug within 30 minutes of arriving in hospital, but most hospitals did not keep records and those that did met the target for only 33% of patients. \"This is life and death stuff. Next year's target is looking distinctly questionable,\" Sir Andrew said. Mr Milburn responded with a two-pronged programme to open up more hospital beds for emergency admissions and to reform A&amp;E procedures. Officials said one of the main reasons for trolley waits in A&amp;E was lack of capacity elsewhere in the hospital. The NHS had a bed occupancy rate of about 90% and this was too high to provide enough flexibility for emergency admissions. By spending \u00a340m on operations for NHS patients in private hospitals, Mr Milburn intends to reduce pressure on NHS beds, free capacity for emergency patients, eliminate long trolley waits and reduce the number of operations cancelled at the last minute. He will spend another \u00a340m to recruit 600 A&amp;E nurses. Other parts of the package in clude the appointment of local emergency care coordinators. Mr Milburn said A&amp;E procedures would be reformed to \"stream\" patients according to the gravity of their condition. At present people with the least serious problems find themselves continually put to the back of the queue when more serious cases arrive. Under the new system, patients will be sorted into four streams with separate staff running each. People will be treated in the order they arrive and will not be leapfrogged by the more critically ill. The government wants diagnostic services to be available round the clock. It will be urging staff to change working practices and abandon demarcation lines to promote teamwork. Mr Milburn said: \"Waiting is the public's number one concern about the NHS. We are determined to tackle waiting in A&amp;E.\" The commission report found 10 hospitals where fewer than 20% of patients were seen by a doctor within an hour of arrival at A&amp;E. At 12 hospitals fewer than 20% were admitted to a ward within four hours. Sir Andrew said he could not name the hospitals because the information had been collected confidentially. Small departments, treating fewer than 40,000 patients a year, had the shortest waits and rural hospitals were quicker than those in urban areas. Waits in London were longest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
