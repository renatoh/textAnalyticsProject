Their Wigmore Hall concert transformed usually genteel works by Mozart and Haydn into epic, violent dramas. They were joined by Michael Collins in a sensuous performance of Mozart's Clarinet Quintet; in the slow movement his playing was full of operatic poise. But the third movement revealed the Takacs' taste for wit, as they relished the quirky mimicry between the first violin and viola. The last movement of Haydn's C major quartet, from the Op 74 set, exploded into life. The music's rustic drones and folk-like melodies were used as an excuse for a riotous dance. The second violinist, Karoly Schranz, became a peasant hooligan, laying into Haydn's infectious syncopations with demonic glee. He had another chance to hijack the musical argument in the central slow movement of Bartok's Fourth String Quartet. The movement opened with a quiet cello line, which emerged from a chromatic mist in the other parts, but this eerie calm was shattered by the unbridled passion of Schranz's playing, releasing an expressive outpouring from the rest of the quartet. These Hungarian musicians are noted for their interpretations of their compatriot Bartok, and this performance demonstrated why. They were completely at home in the unpredictable contrasts of the outer movements of the Fourth Quartet. The first movement oscillated between aggressive power and ghostly murmurings; the second was a macabre shadow dance for muted strings. The fourth movement was a bizarre pizzicato scherzo, featuring shot-like snaps of strings rebounding off fingerboards; and the finale paralleled the first movement with its expressive force. Difficult music, on the surface, but the Takacs players made Bartok's dissonances dance, no less than they did the finale of the Haydn quartet. They revealed the connections between Bartok's most complex music and his Hungarian roots - as well as making an immediate bond with the Wigmore Hall audience."}, "isHosted": false}}}
