But Bob Dylan\u2019s place as one of the world\u2019s greatest artistic figures was elevated further on Thursday when he was named the surprise winner of the Nobel prize in literature \u201cfor having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition\u201d. After the announcement, the permanent secretary of the Swedish Academy, Sara Danius, said it had \u201cnot been a difficult decision\u201d and she hoped the academy would not be criticised for its choice. \u201cWe hoped the news would be received with joy, but you never know,\u201d she said, comparing the songs of the American songwriter to the works of Homer and Sappho. \u201cWe\u2019re really giving it to Bob Dylan as a great poet \u2013 that\u2019s the reason we awarded him the prize. He\u2019s a great poet in the great English tradition, stretching from Milton and Blake onwards. And he\u2019s a very interesting traditionalist, in a highly original way. Not just the written tradition, but also the oral one; not just high literature, but also low literature.\u201d Though Dylan is considered by many to be a musician, not a writer, Danius said the artistic reach of his lyrics and poetry could not be put in a single box. \u201cI came to realise that we still read Homer and Sappho from ancient Greece, and they were writing 2,500 years ago,\u201d she said. \u201cThey were meant to be performed, often together with instruments, but they have survived, and survived incredibly well, on the book page. We enjoy [their] poetry, and I think Bob Dylan deserves to be read as a poet.\u201d Born Robert Allen Zimmerman in Duluth, Minnesota, in 1941, Dylan got his first guitar at the age of 14 and performed in rock\u2019n\u2019roll bands in high school. He adopted the name Dylan, after the poet Dylan Thomas, and, drawn to the music of Woody Guthrie, began to perform folk music. He moved to New York in 1961, and began performing in the clubs and cafes of Greenwich Village. His first album, Bob Dylan, was released in 1962, and he followed it up with a host of albums now regarded as masterpieces, including Blonde on Blonde in 1966, and Blood on the Tracks in 1975. He is regarded as one of the most influential figures in contemporary popular culture, though his music has always proved divisive. Speaking last year, Dylan said: \u201cCritics have been giving me a hard time since day one.\u201d His own response to receiving the prize is unknown. He rarely gives interviews, and has a troubled relationship with the fame attached to his decades of popularity. However, he has toured almost non-stop since 1988 and last weekend he played the inaugural Desert Trip festival in California, alongside other giants of the 1960s, the Rolling Stones, the Who, Paul McCartney and Neil Young. Among the musical, literary and even academic communities, respected figures expressed their delight at Dylan\u2019s Nobel prize. The author Salman Rushdie told the Guardian he was delighted with Dylan\u2019s win and said his lyrics had been \u201can inspiration to me all my life ever since I first heard a Dylan album at school\u201d. \u201cThe frontiers of literature keep widening, and it\u2019s exciting that the Nobel prize recognises that,\u201d Rushdie said. \u201cI intend to spend the day playing Mr Tambourine Man, Love Minus Zero/No Limit, Like a Rolling Stone, Idiot Wind, Jokerman, Tangled Up in Blue and It\u2019s a Hard Rain\u2019s Gonna Fall.\u201d Musician Jarvis Cocker said Dylan was a \u201cgreat choice\u201d and highlighted the 1963 track Don\u2019t Think Twice, It\u2019s Alright as a personal favourite. \u201cIt\u2019s a great break-up song: he\u2019s making light of it but one or two little digs show that he is actually a bit upset,\u201d Cocker said. \u201cI think Dylan\u2019s sense of humour is often overlooked.\u201d Prof Seamus Perry, chair of the English faculty at Oxford University, compared Dylan\u2019s talent to that of the poet Alfred Lord Tennyson, calling the songwriter \u201crepresentative and yet wholly individual, humane, angry, funny and tender by turn; really, wholly himself, one of the greats\u201d. The former poet laureate Andrew Motion said the prize was \u201ca wonderful acknowledgement of Dylan\u2019s genius. For 50 and some years he has bent, coaxed, teased and persuaded words into lyric and narrative shapes that are at once extraordinary and inevitable.\u201d Author Joyce Carol Oates said there should be no question about Dylan\u2019s work being considered literature, praising the academy\u2019s \u201cinspired and original choice\u201d. \u201cHis haunting music and lyrics have always seemed, in the deepest sense, literary,\u201d she said. The writer Will Self, however, called on Dylan to follow the example of the French philosopher Jean Paul Sartre and turn down the prize. \u201cMy only caveat about the award is that it cheapens Dylan to be associated at all with a prize founded on an explosives and armaments fortune, and more often awarded to a buggins whose turn it is than a world-class creative artist,\u201d Self said. \u201cReally, it\u2019s a bit like when Sartre was awarded the Nobel \u2013 he was primarily a philosopher, and had the nous to refuse it. Hopefully Bob will follow his lead.\u201d Not everyone was overjoyed by the announcement, however. Irvine Welsh, the author of Trainspotting, said that although he was a Dylan fan \u201cthis is an ill-conceived nostalgia award wrenched from the rancid prostates of senile, gibbering hippies\u201d. The novelist Hari Kunzru was equally sceptical. \u201cThis feels like the lamest Nobel win since they gave it to Obama for not being Bush,\u201d he said. The winner of the prize is chosen by the 18 members of the academy, who look for \u201cthe person who shall have produced in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction\u201d, according to Alfred Nobel\u2019s will. The prize was expected to be announced last week, in the same week as the science medals, and the delay prompted speculation that the panel could not agree on a winner \u2013 though this was rebuffed by Danius. Danius advised those unfamiliar with the work of Dylan to start with the 1966 album Blonde on Blonde. \u201cIt\u2019s an extraordinary example of his brilliant way of rhyming, putting together refrains, and his pictorial way of thinking,\u201d she said. When she was young, Danius admitted, she was \u201cnot really\u201d a Dylan fan, preferring the works of David Bowie. \u201cPerhaps it\u2019s a question of generation \u2013 today I\u2019m a lover of Bob Dylan,\u201d she said. Major writers believed to have been in the running for the award included the Kenyan Ngugi wa Thiong\u2019o, the American Don DeLillo and the Japanese author Haruki Murakami. At Ladbrokes, where the singer was at 16/1 from 50/1 when betting was suspended, the spokesman Alex Donohue said \u201ca lot of people scoffed when his odds came in to 10/1 from 100/1 in 2011. Looks like there was something blowin\u2019 in the wind after all.\u201d Dylan is the first American to win the Nobel prize for literature since Toni Morrison in 1993. His triumph follows comments in 2008 from Horace Engdahl, the then permanent secretary of the Nobel prize jury, that \u201cthe US is too isolated, too insular. They don\u2019t translate enough and don\u2019t really participate in the big dialogue of literature ... That ignorance is restraining.\u201d A jury now headed by Engdahl\u2019s successor has obviously changed its view."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
