Michael McCullers, who has the distinction (as I see it) of having co-scripted the very funny Austin Powers sequels, has written and directed this entertaining chick-flick. It stars Tina Fey as Kate, an uptight career woman who in her late-30s discovers in herself a need for babies, but also that she is infertile. So she finally opts for surrogacy with the reproductively unchallenged trailer-park diva Angie, played by Amy Poehler, who has to move in to Kate's spiffy apartment for some odd-couple laughs. Scenes are stolen by Steve Martin as Kate's creepy, pony-tail wearing boss and especially by Sigourney Weaver as the smarmy head of the surrogacy agency, who seems to be able to get pregnant all the time, quite naturally, in her late 50s and tactlessly glories in her earth-mother status in front of the childless clientele. McCullers' script, though not burdened with many killer lines, is likable, workmanlike, with real narrative developments nicely worked into the screenplay."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
