As for Sian, she considered herself heterosexual. Yet, when she was offered the job, she had a feeling that it could change her life. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure why, but it felt like a really big decision.\u201d The pair quickly formed a close friendship. \u201cMy friends were wary of her at first,\u201d says Holly. \u201cThey thought I was falling for a straight girl and that I\u2019d get my heart broken.\u201d In a \u201cwork hard, play hard\u201d atmosphere, they enjoyed drinking together at the pub in the evenings. \u201cOne day, I ended up giving her an Indian head massage,\u201d says Sian. Looking back, there must have been more going on than she realised. It wasn\u2019t until Holly went away for a month for an operation that Sian started to question her feelings. \u201cI think these days it\u2019s easier to be gay, but at the time it was still seen as quite a big deal. It felt like something we\u2019d have to keep secret.\u201d Although she had \u201cnever connected with anyone like that before\u201d, she was conflicted. When Holly returned in March 2007, Sian went to see her. \u201cShe came to my house to tell me that she was \u2018definitely not interested in women\u2019,\u201d Holly remembers. But after spotting Sian\u2019s overnight bag, she wasn\u2019t sure that she meant it. \u201cI knew I\u2019d fallen for her, but it seemed easier to walk away,\u201d explains Sian. She quickly changed her mind. \u201cWe\u2019d had a few drinks and I remember thinking that I needed to live passionately, so I just decided to go for it. You have to grasp life with both hands,\u201d she says. \u201cPlus, you probably didn\u2019t want to get the night bus home,\u201d Holly laughs. They celebrated their love with a civil partnership in 2012, getting married four years later. \u201cIt seemed important to do, because it\u2019s taken such a fight to get here,\u201d says Holly. Although it took Sian longer to recognise the romantic nature of their relationship, she can\u2019t imagine life without her partner. \u201cI\u2019ve met someone who understands me completely and utterly,\u201d she says. \u201cHolly is so genuine, caring, funny and loyal. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s possible to put into words the connection of meeting \u2018the one\u2019.\u201d For Holly, it was her partner\u2019s warmth and kindness that stood out. \u201cShe has this amazing aura; she\u2019s a beautiful person.\u201d In 2013, the couple moved to Shetland after Holly was offered a new job. \u201cIt\u2019s such an amazing place and it was an incredible adventure,\u201d says Sian. The couple spent their time exploring the outdoors. \u201cWe loved it there, but we were so far from friends and family and we knew we wanted to start a family.\u201d They made the decision to return to England 18 months later, bringing back their three rescue cats. \u201cWe were actually together for a few years before we succumbed to the lesbian cat stereotype,\u201d says Holly. \u201cAlthough, sadly, one died, so we just have two now.\u201d They had a daughter in 2017 \u2013 Sian carried her \u2013 and now live in a small town in Suffolk. \u201cWe haven\u2019t always had it easy in terms of acceptance from others,\u201d says Holly. \u201cBut we\u2019re very lucky to have each other.\u201d Sian agrees. \u201cSometimes you have to fight for the person you love. I never thought I\u2019d end up with a woman. But love is genderless. You fall in love with a person and for me that\u2019s Holly.\u201d \u2022Want to share your story?
