When asked about the use of the local food bank, the Conservative candidate is quoted as saying: \u201cYou will not improve the long-term capability of handling finances without better financial education from primary school upwards. We must get better at handling money.\u201d What a pity that the increasing number of people who have to rely on food banks just can\u2019t manage the money that they haven\u2019t got. Bridget Cuthbertson Hexham, Northumberland \u2022 Reading your article (George the Poet on why he had to say no to an MBE, 30 November), I was reminded of the historian RH Tawney, who said of peerages: \u201cCruel boys tie tin cans to the tails of dogs; but even a mad dog does not tie a can to its own tail.\u201d Judy Turner Malvern, Worcestershire \u2022 If Nigel Farage is such a good friend of Donald Trump, he should know that Trump is a teetotaller, and so his sexist comments would not come \u201cafter a night out with a drink\u201d (The verdict: Friends in high places a hindrance for Farage, 2 December). Joe Locker Surbiton, London \u2022 It was Rhett Butler who said \u201cFrankly, my dear, I don\u2019t give a damn\u201d (Letters, 30 November). Scarlett O\u2019Hara said \u201cI\u2019ll think about it tomorrow\u201d, a mantra obviously adopted by the climate deniers. Kathy Arundale Altrincham, Greater Manchester \u2022 Thank you to Richard Walker for pointing out that it should be attender, not attendee (Letters, 30 November). I\u2019ve been an annoyee about this point for ages. Susan Saunders Teddington, London \u2022 Keep the colourful Eyewitness centre spread photos coming, I need them to wrap my Christmas presents.
