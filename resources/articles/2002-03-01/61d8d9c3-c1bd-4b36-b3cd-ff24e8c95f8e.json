The troubled broadcasters were yesterday placed into administration by the High Court after admitting they cannot afford to pay the remaining two instalments of their \u00a3315m three-year agreement to televise live matches. Last week the Football League refused to accept a revised offer of \u00a350m from ITV Digital for the remainder of the contract, insisting it must be honoured. Paphitis said: \"You can't cut a contract off tomorrow, and it is disappointing the way Carlton and Granada have acted - it is corporate vandalism.\" Culture, Media and Sport Secretary Tessa Jowell has insisted the Government will not step in to bail out ITV Digital, but Paphitis believes they should still accept some responsibility. \"The Government should have been involved a long time ago,\" he said. \"This whole issue is not about football. About \u00a31bn of shareholders' money was invested in digital television, which the Government backed, and ITV Digital are trying to put the blame on a \u00a3200m contract with football.\" Fellow promotion hopefuls Coventry stand to lose \u00a32m-a-year if ITV Digital goes to the wall, but chief executive Graham Hover is still hoping the Football League can salvage something from the crisis. \"As far as the league is concerned there is a contract with ITV Digital which is owned by Granada and Carlton, and if the company does go under then the two owning concerns have a responsibility to honour that contract,\" he said. \"If we lost the contract it would cost us around \u00a32m, which is eight or nine per cent of our turnover - and it would be a big, big blow. However, we are confident the league will be able to make sure responsibilities are met.\" Sheffield Wednesday, who along with Coventry are thought to have serious debt problems, have moved to assure fans the club will survive. Chief executive Alan Sykes said: \"Contrary to newspaper speculation, the club will not be placed into administration over this issue - and we remain 100% confident Sheffield Wednesday will survive the financial problems affecting the whole of English football. \"This is an issue of huge importance to all English professional football clubs, and it is the duty of ITV Digital's shareholders to resolve the situation. Rather than walking away from this problem, we see Carlton and Granada as part of the solution.\" More optimism has been voiced by Jeff Bonser, owner of Walsall, who is confident his club can weather the financial storm. \"Any well-run business will always have contingency plans in hand, just in case a major sponsor pulls out or it hits a difficult trading situation,\" he said. \"If the worst comes to the worst we will survive and build our new stand at the same time. That project goes ahead regardless of any uncertainty about the TV deal.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
