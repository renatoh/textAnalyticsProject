With a stay-at-home order in place, all activities usually associated with the city \u2013 premieres, parties, events and schmoozing \u2013 were on hold when they reportedly arrived last month, and studios had stopped production. Following months of drama swirling around Harry and Meghan\u2019s decision to step down as working royals, which officially came into force on Wednesday, in the face of a deadly global pandemic they have finally taken a backseat in the public consciousness. Reports of their sudden arrival in Meghan\u2019s hometown from Canada, just before the US closed its border amid the coronavirus outbreak, were greeted with subdued surprise. They had been living on Vancouver Island with their 10-month-old son Archie since their shock announcement in January that they were leaving in search of a \u201cmore peaceful life\u201d. Donald Trump made time to greet them \u2013 via Twitter of course \u2013 in trademark style. \u201cThe US will not pay for their security protection,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey must pay!\u201d They do not appear to be cowed by the president\u2019s welcome note, issuing a swift rebuttal to Trump, saying they had \u201cno plans to ask the US government for security resources\u201d, adding: \u201cPrivately funded security arrangements have been made.\u201d According to their final Instagram post under their former identities \u2013 they will no longer use the term \u201cSussex Royal\u201d \u2013 they are \u201cfocusing this new chapter to understand how we can best contribute\u201d. Clearly major changes are already under way. As they parted ways with Buckingham Palace, they also wasted no time in announcing the appointment of new chief of staff Catherine St-Laurent, who previously worked for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. So what lies in store for the couple? And when life in the city begins to return to normal \u2013 assuming it will \u2013 what might their day-to-day lives look like? Melanie Bromley, chief news correspondent and head of news operations for E!, says: \u201cAs much as they both have \u2013 Meghan especially \u2013 some roots in Canada, LA is her home. It is where she grew up, it\u2019s the place that she knows best, and so it isn\u2019t a surprise that they\u2019re here. I think what has surprised people is just the fact that they came here so quickly.\u201d As soon as the city kicks back into business again, the couple are expected to shoot to the top of everybody\u2019s invite lists. \u201cUltimately, this is a city where royalty trumps celebrity,\u201d says LA-based Bromley. \u201cThey are potentially the most famous residents of Los Angeles \u2013 or at least they\u2019re on the same level as Oprah [Winfrey], as that kind of celebrity, AAA list.\u201d The couple are currently living in a \u201csecluded compound\u201d, according to People. Meghan, a self-professed \u201cCali girl\u201d, grew up in LA in Woodland Hills, and her mother, Doria Ragland, lives in the city. But Harry, 35, and Meghan, 38, are reportedly house-hunting in the ocean-facing celebrity hotspot of Malibu. To get a sense of the scale of their intentions, Bromley says look no further than the appointment of St-Laurent. \u201cThat\u2019s a huge hire of somebody who knows the foundation world, who has relevance in that industry, who\u2019s a real heavy hitter \u2013 and that hire alone tells me how serious Meghan and Harry are when it comes to what their new life will look like,\u201d she says. While they have yet to provide details on what form their charity might take, causes are likely to include mental health, the environment and the climate crisis, gender equality and women and girls\u2019 rights. And what about work? Under their new plan, they will no longer rely on taxpayer funding and will instead earn their own income. Meghan\u2019s first gig, doing the voiceover for Disneynature documentary Elephant, released on streaming platform Disney+ on Friday, was met with generally warm reviews. But it won\u2019t earn her money because she donated her fee to conservation charity Elephants Without Borders. However, the documentary will be an interesting test of her \u201cbankability\u201d as a star, says LA Times entertainment industry reporter Anousha Sakoui. \u201cDisney will get the first insight into the sellability of their name when it comes to content. Immediately, that has got some profile.\u201d While royalty \u201chas a mystique that sells\u2019, she says that \u201cthe popularity is what\u2019s important to studios. They are money-making organisations\u201d. Ted Sarandos, Netflix chief content officer, has voiced his interest in working with the couple, and last year Prince Harry announced he had teamed up with Winfrey for a documentary series on mental health for Apple TV+. Sakoui warns, however, that everybody in LA has a lifespan and has to work for attention \u2013 even A-list celebrities and royalty. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people competing for attention, and they will have to compete for them as well. But they have great connections.\u201d Joe Bel Bruno, editor-in-chief of website dot.LA, believes that once the city reopens for business, the couple will be sought after for every Hollywood and charity function. \u201cWe already have a lot of celebrities, and we have multibillionaires who live here from the business world who like to entertain and like to throw these sort of events, and they will be No 1 on the list. Everyone will be clamouring to get them because we don\u2019t have royals here, so this elevates the scene a bit.\u201d The proliferation of wealth in LA also makes it an ideal place to fundraise. \u201cIt\u2019s the perfect place for them building a foundation. And then on top of that, Meghan is able to pursue her Hollywood career, and she will be sought after just for her name and status,\u201d he says. Meanwhile, he thinks that a lot of businesses \u2013 such as Snapchat, based in Santa Monica \u2013 and charities will be interested in working with Harry. \u201cThere are companies based here that would welcome him to be on their boards, just as status.\u201d Mindy Weiss, party consultant to the stars, says when the Sussexes are not working with charities, she can see Meghan as a fan of Goop \u2013 Gwyneth Paltrow\u2019s lifestyle brand, also based in Santa Monica \u2013 and Harry playing polo. But security will be essential, she says, as the paparazzi are \u201caggressive\u201d. \u201cThe paps will love them, and it will be crazy at the beginning \u2013 but, just like anything and any celebrity, eventually they become part of the community and it just becomes a normalcy in La La Land.\u201d Phil Lobel, whose Hollywood PR company Lobeline Communications lists Brad Pitt among its previous clients, says Harry and Meghan will be \u201cthe new it couple\u201d and can see them supporting numerous charities in the southern California area. The couple have enlisted the services of PR firm Sunshine Sachs, whose clients include Ben Affleck and Leonardo DiCaprio. But in terms of their brand, Jeetendr Sehdev, LA celebrity branding expert and author of US bestselling book The Kim Kardashian Principle , believes they will not follow any preordained rules, and that their \u201cdisruptive\u201d approach especially appeals to Generation Z. \u201cThe Meghan and Harry brand has always been very disruptive. They\u2019re going to show us all a different way in which royal family members can live,\u201d he says. He sees their prime revenue stream as being their charity \u2013 a \u201cforward-thinking woke charitable foundation\u201d \u2013 book endorsements and other endorsements, speaking engagements, and from \u201cHarry opening up about his life as a royal family member\u201d. \u201cThe closest comparison to Meghan and Harry will be the Obamas and what they\u2019re actually doing, I mean they\u2019ve created an entertainment entity where they\u2019re producing documentaries and I think that will be a similar route that Meghan and Harry can certainly take.\u201d But, he says, Meghan is a more \u201cnatural fit\u201d in their new surroundings than Harry, whose brand is going to take a little more work. While he doesn\u2019t think they should model themselves on existing LA royalty, the Kardashians, he does think they need to follow their example when it comes to opening up. \u201cLetting people into who they are \u2013 because at the moment we don\u2019t really know who Meghan and Harry are. We just know that they\u2019re part of the royal family.\u201d So, will they get the peaceful life they were hoping for? \u201cI don\u2019t believe Meghan and Harry are moving out to Los Angeles for a peaceful life,\u201d said Sehdev. \u201cI think they\u2019re moving here for a particular type of lifestyle.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
