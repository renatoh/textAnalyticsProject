That's not only because a couple of our sides lost and Maccabi Haifa cut through Manchester United a worrying number of times. It's also because the Spanish clubs look a cut above the rest. Valencia's performance in their victory over Liverpool was so good I felt privileged to be there. Deportivo La Coruna beat Bayern Munich 3-2 in Germany and, even more ominously, Real Madrid won 3-0 at Roma. Don't forget they've still got Ronaldo to come. With Barcelona beating Bruges, Spain started with four wins out of four. Our best chance of lifting the Champions League seems to lie with Arsenal, the outstanding team here, but if they're going to conquer the Spanish they'll probably have to go up another gear. Arsenal lost twice to Deportivo last season and were knocked out by Valencia the year before. When you consider that the Spanish have had at least one team in the past three finals it shows the strength of their league. Their clubs seem to be able to open defences more easily than anyone. Attacking quality is so important in the Champions League and Spanish sides have tremendous creativity. They'll pick you off with absolute incisiveness if you let them come at you, as Liverpool discovered, and they can also be brilliant on the counter-attack. In the past Europe was a lot about defensive strength, particularly with ties played over two legs. But teams are more adventurous now and that's favoured the Spanish and maybe hurt the Italians. Serie A sides get beaten if they sit back away, and on their home grounds opponents go at them and try to win. Arsenal have a very positive attitude but what worries me is whether they get enough support for Thierry Henry on their travels, particularly when there's no Dennis Bergkamp. Although they've got Freddie Ljungberg back and Robert Pires to come, that may hinder them. In Liverpool's case, I'd like to see them carry the fight more when they go to Basle and Spartak Moscow. At Valencia I thought they adopted too much of an old-school philosophy, concerned with keeping things tight. I'm not sure that's the way now. The top teams are good enough to pick you off if you invite them on to you, and I think Liverpool need to pin back their opponents a bit more. G\u00e9rard Houllier had talked about being more offensive but I don't know whether he was just giving it the words. He used one striker with one playing behind, but I'd liked to have seen two forwards and Emile Heskey on the left of midfield. That way the opposition back line isn't unoccupied and easily able to set up and join attacks. Liverpool also struggled when they won possession because, with so many men back, they never really had outlet balls. If they wanted to pass to another red shirt it was only about four yards away, and Valencia got well in among them and made sure things broke down. I felt this Valencia team looked even better than the one that got to the 2000 and 2001 finals. I'd heard them described as negative but they were very up and at it, with Pablo Aimar behind John Carew, two wingers and central midfielders who got up and down for fun. I talked to Julio Salinas, the old centre-forward, before the game and he told me Valencia were not playing well. If that's them out of form, I wouldn't like to see them on fire. They looked good defensively as well as in attack. I rate Santiago Canizares as the best goalkeeper in Europe and you could understand why Manchester United and Leeds were supposedly interested in Roberto Ayala. I can't see Manchester United failing to qualify from their group, but Juan Veron disappointed me against Haifa in a game I'd expected him to do well in. I'm not sure United could afford to give away as many chances against top teams, and they need at least one of their tenacious midfielders back quickly. As for Newcastle, they'll do tremendously well to go further because I wouldn't be surprised to see Juventus, Dynamo Kiev or Feyenoord win at St James' Park. I'm not thinking they'll automatically finish high up the Premiership either. Their back line, by the standards they want, is quite ordinary. When you think of their better players they're the offensive ones like Kieron Dyer and Craig Bellamy. I think Shay Given saved them a lot last season. Confidence is a million things in football and I wonder whether Newcastle have the foundations to get back to where they were. Just as I wonder whether any of the Premiership teams can sink this Spanish armada."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
