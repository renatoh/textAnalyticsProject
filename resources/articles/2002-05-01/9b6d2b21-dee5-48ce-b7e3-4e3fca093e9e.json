The watchdog Air Transport Users Council believes competition from other airlines will keep low fares coming but despite that, the prospective deal threatens to diminish consumer choice and thus could push up prices. The two carriers compete head to head only on two domestic routes, from Belfast to Glasgow and Edinburgh. But while easyJet has not revealed whether it would continue to operate Go as a separate airline, their respective main departure airports, Luton and Stansted, are not far apart. So there is clear potential to concentrate flights at one or other, reducing the travellers' options. Destinations particularly vulnerable to such consolidation could be Malaga, Barcelona and Nice, which both serve from their home bases. Reassuring is the fact that there would continue to be a clear difference between the merging airlines, which fly to major airports, and their major competitor, Ryanair, which mainly uses secondary gateways to cities, such as Frankfurt Hahn, where charges are generally lower. While easyJet has opted for Charles de Gaulle as its airport for Paris, Ryanair uses Beauvais. However, there are also small differences of style between Go and easyJet themselves which the AUC would be loath to see vanish. As Simon Evans, the Council's chief executive, notes, the former's web site offers customers the option of choosing the lowest fare available or a more expensive deal allowing them to switch flights without penalty. The latter's simply offers the cheapest ticket. If customers need to change departures times they must pay \u00a310 plus any difference between the fare for their original flight and the one they subsequently want to take. Plenty of carriers, he says, are still battling for the cheap fares market. Besides Ryanair, there are two other low-cost operators in Buzz and newcomer bmi Baby, and in some cases traditional carriers provide alternatives. Tax deters Balearics visitors The Balearics are expecting the number of tourists visiting this year to drop by around 100,000, partly due to the eco-tax, which costs around \u20ac1 per person per night. Meanwhile, Ibiza is hoping to use some of the money raised to promote itself as an upmarket and family destination, trying to distance itself from its clubbing image. Best value in the Med Thomas Cook's annual round-up of prices in resorts reveals that the Algarve and the Costa del Sol provide some of the best value in the Mediterranean this summer. The Algarve offers some of the cheapest prices for eating out, with a three course meal at \u00a36 and a bottle of house wine from \u00a33.60. A cup of coffee (61p) and a Pi\u00f1a Colada (\u00a32.45) were also among the cheapest in the survey, although the price of a bottle of beer at \u00a31.55 was one of most expensive. Tenerife and Cyprus also offer excellent value for eating out. In Tenerife, you can enjoy a meal and drinks for four for seven nights for less than \u00a3200, while in Madeira it will cost you twice that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
