He has told his new readership just what they wanted to hear: that Labour is \"betraying\" our children. In 1994 when the former Ofsted chief first began to attack teachers, universities, unions, exams and local education authorities, Telegraph readers were reassured. Here was a man who would not let those leftwingers get away with implementing new-fangled educational theories. He had, it was true, flirted with them as a young teacher, but local authority admin and promotion to the National Curriculum Council had changed all that. Mr Woodhead's article in today's Telegraph starts with an easy shot at a delegate at a schools standards meeting who suggested that teachers should be renamed \"learning professionals\". Fifteen hundred words later, he sets out the reforms he sought, and which, he claims, he did not secure because Tony Blair and David Blunkett refused to support him: to identify failing schools and teachers, to publish reports written in \"plain English\", to challenge \"child-centred orthodoxies\" (orthodoxies which, oddly, were also \"progressive\"), to stress mental arithmetic and phonetic reading, to challenge \"irrelevant\" teacher training, to inspect local education authorities and expose their \"waste of taxpayers' money\", and to expose (again) \"vacuous\" educational research. So what would take the place of the child-centred orthodoxies? What does Mr Woodhead believe in? We know that he subscribes to educationalist Michael Oakeshott's belief that education is \"a conversation between the generations in which the young learn what they can about the cultural inheritance upon which their humanity depends\". We also know that he thinks education \"must be much more than a preparation for life in the utilitarian sense\" and that it is \"intrinsically valuable\". (Is this a broadside against the government's plans for specialist schools, which have attracted criticism from across the political spectrum? He does not say.) We also know that he wants to cut down on bureaucracy, which is laudable. But red tape is an inevitable result of reform. You cannot have one without the other, and to focus on the packaging rather than tackling the substance is an easy target. For all the apparent pragmatism of Mr Woodhead's approach, and his gift for identifying failure, he has little to offer that is new. Labour knew that, which is why it retained him for just long enough to reassure parents that traditionalism still had a place in government education policy. Now it is time to move on.
