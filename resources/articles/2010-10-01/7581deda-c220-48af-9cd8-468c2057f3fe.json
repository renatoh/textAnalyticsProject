Given the way in which Alex McLeish has been setting out his side, with five in a predominantly defensive midfield and a single not very mobile striker, it is hardly surprising the Belarussian playmaker has found it hard to make an impact. As he himself has pointed out, Blues play a rather different style of football from that he became accustomed to at Arsenal and Barcelona. On Saturday, however, along came Blackpool. Knowing the Seasiders would play 4-3-3 and attack from the start \u2013 a method that before this match had seen them win more points on the road than any other team in the Premier League \u2013 McLeish finally loosened the shackles, putting out a team with two strikers and pushing Hleb forward to play in what he anticipated would be the space behind them. He anticipated correctly. As the chastened Blackpool manager, Ian Holloway, acknowledged, Blackpool simply failed to adapt and Hleb revelled in the freedom. If City had had more pace and movement up front than was offered by Garry O'Connor and Nikola Zigic, they would have won by five or six. That Holloway would blame himself was probably inevitable, as was his promise that, if Birmingham employ similar tactics when they visit Bloomfield Road in January, his players will know how to counter because he will show them. It must, however, be a concern to their supporters that there was no one on the field capable of reorganising, or indeed that Holloway was apparently unable to change things around with a few crisp instructions from the dug-out, the more so because he admitted he had been concerned about Hleb beforehand. \"I almost, almost, went against my overall principles and put in [an extra midfielder] at the start of the game, and didn't play one of the centre-forwards,\" Holloway said. What Blackpool need to do, Holloway said, is learn how to stop people playing. \"I'm not saying we would play that system every week but we had a right good think about things and thought this might give them a problem,\" McLeish said. \"We got a couple of breaks for the goals, but we haven't had a break to shout about over the past seven or eight games.\" Birmingham's goals \u2013 the first a Liam Ridgewell header from a couple of yards, the second bundled in from almost equally close range by Zigic \u2013 were bizarre affairs stemming directly from mistakes from Blackpool players. But there was nothing lucky about the scoreline. \"I'm a total optimist and we're going to keep going and keep learning,\" Holloway said. The trouble is, everybody else is learning at the same time.
