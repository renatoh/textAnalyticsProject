It is packed to bursting point with economic migrants. And many of them - at least 80 on board - are children, some as young as nine and 10, heading to the city to work in factories and sweatshops. Almost 90 per cent of the children enslaved in New Delhi's garment sweatshops are from the Sitamarhi district of Bihar. This region, straddling the Nepalese border, has no industry; most inhabitants are illiterate and a majority of families have seven or eight children. Many families send their children away to Mumbai, Delhi or Surat to work. Sitting on the floor of the filthy cattle-class compartment, his shirt buttonless, 10-year-old Mohammed is hungry and tired. Above all, he is confused. He told The Observer he had been approached a week earlier in the village of Ragarpura in the Sitamarhi district of Bihar by a man who introduced himself as Sadiq. He dazzled them with still pictures of girls dancing in a Bollywood movie, then convinced their parents to let them go for the equivalent of \u00a37 per child. He immediately sold the children on to 'Rakesh' who told the children he was their new owner. 'Sadiq was funny. He told us he would give us lots of sweets if we went with him to New Delhi and do two hours of light work every day,' Mohammed says. 'Rakesh won't tell us where we are going. We are frightened of him. I tried to tell a policeman in the station but he laughed. Rakesh threatened to stab me.' In the station, a policeman looks at the children. 'Somebody in Bihar gives birth to them, and they become our headache!' he says. 'Good riddance to them all. They are Delhi's problem now.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
