As expected, the reaction to his comments was harsh and full of calls for impeachment. Hope Hicks, former communications director for the Trump Administration, will testify behind closed doors before the House judiciary committee next week. The transcript will be made public, according to committee chair Jerry Nadler. The response to the George Stephanopoulos interview, in which President Trump admitted that he would accept information on a political opponent from a foreign government, has been swift: Here\u2019s a clip from the interview with George Stephanopoulos, in which President Trump admitted that he would accept information on a political opponent from a foreign government. Did we really learn nothing from that whole Trump Tower to-do with Russia in 2016? In an interview with ABC\u2019s George Stephanopoulos, the president admitted that he would accept information on a political opponent from a foreign government. \u201cIt\u2019s not an interference, they have information - I think I\u2019d take it,\u201d President Trump said. \u201cIf I thought there was something wrong, I\u2019d go maybe to the FBI - if I thought there was something wrong. But when somebody comes up with oppo research, right, they come up with oppo research, \u2018oh let\u2019s call the FBI\u2019. The FBI doesn\u2019t have enough agents to take care of it. When you go and talk, honestly, to congressman, they all do it, they always have, and that\u2019s the way it is. It\u2019s called oppo research.\u201d Stephanopoulos asked about Donald Trump Jr and the regrettable role he played in the Trump Tower meeting in June 2016. He asked if Trump\u2019s son should have brought the Russians\u2019 offer for \u201cdirt\u201d on Hillary Clinton to the FBI. \u201cSomebody comes up and says, \u2018hey, I have information on your opponent\u2019, do you call the FBI?\u201d Trump responded. \u201cI\u2019ll tell you what, I\u2019ve seen a lot of things over my life. I don\u2019t think in my whole life I\u2019ve ever called the FBI. In my whole life. You don\u2019t call the FBI. You throw somebody out of your office, you do whatever you do,\u201d Trump continued. \u201cOh, give me a break \u2013 life doesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d \u201cThe FBI director said that is what should happen,\u201d Stephanopoulos replied. (During congressional testimony last month, FBI director Christopher Wray told lawmakers \u201cthe FBI would want to know about\u201d any foreign election meddling). \u201cThe FBI director is wrong, because frankly it doesn\u2019t happen like that in life,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow maybe it will start happening, maybe today you\u2019d think differently.\u201d The full interview is set to air on ABC next week. The New York Times is reporting that the Justice Department investigation into the Russian inquiry may go beyond attorney general William Barr\u2019s original question of why the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation into the Trump campaign. In planning to interview senior CIA officers, the Justice Department is indicating that they \u201care focused partly on the intelligence agencies\u2019 most explosive conclusion about the 2016 election: that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia intervened to benefit Donald J. Trump.\u201d The interview plans are the latest sign the Justice Department will take a critical look at the C.I.A.\u2019s work on Russia\u2019s election interference. Investigators want to talk with at least one senior counterintelligence official and a senior C.I.A. analyst, the people said. Both officials were involved in the agency\u2019s work on understanding the Russian campaign to sabotage the election in 2016. While the Justice Department review is not a criminal inquiry, it has provoked anxiety in the ranks of the C.I.A., according to former officials. Senior agency officials have questioned why the C.I.A.\u2019s analytical work should be subjected to a federal prosecutor\u2019s scrutiny. Attorney General William P. Barr, who is overseeing the review, assigned the United States attorney in Connecticut, John H. Durham, to conduct it. The Justice Department has not submitted formal written requests to talk to the C.I.A. officers, but law enforcement officials have told intelligence officials that Mr. Durham will seek the interviews, two of the people said. Communications officers for both the C.I.A. and the Justice Department declined to comment. The C.I.A. director, Gina Haspel, has told senior officials that her agency will cooperate \u2014 but will still work to protect critical pieces of intelligence whose disclosure could jeopardize sources, reveal collection methods or disclose information provided by allies, according to current and former American officials. Ms. Haspel will not block the interviews and has told the agency that talking with Mr. Durham need not jeopardize secrets and is consistent with cooperating with Mr. Barr\u2019s inquiry. Florida governor Ron DeSantis issued a proclamation ordering state flags be lowered to half-staff and asking Floridians to pause to remember the victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando, where 49 people were killed in 2016. The problem? He made no mention of the gay community that was targeted that night three years ago, something that Democratic state Representative Anna Eskamani called him out on via Twitter. The Associated Press is reporting that when the governor was asked about the omission at a bill signing in Jacksonville, he claimed he wasn\u2019t involved in drafting the original proclamation. \u201cWhen someone said that this wasn\u2019t in there, I said, \u2018Well, then put it in there.\u2019 So we fixed it,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, we flew the flags at half staff and that was the reason we put out the proclamation. Sometimes these things happen and you\u2019ve just got to correct it.\u201d It appears that in addition to correcting the original proclamation, DeSantis has since made his planned visit to Pulse on the anniversary. At a roundtable discussion on stopping opioid abuse and reducing drug trafficking, acting homeland secretary Kevin McAleenan told the president that the wall along the southern border is getting built at a rate of about two miles a week. From the pool report: \u201cHow is the wall coming along?\u201d President Trump asked in relation to drug trafficking. \u201cIt is coming along aggressively,\u201d McAleenan responded. \u201cWe built two miles last week; we are up to about two miles per week right now so extending that capability across key sectors.\u201d \u201cAnd you will have, by the end of next year, how much?\u201d Trump asked. \u201cBy the end of next year, it will be over 400 miles,\u201d McAleenan answered. \u201cOver 400 miles, and we have to kick and scream for every inch because the Democrats will just not give us what we need,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIn fact, I think we will be very close to 500 miles by the end of the year, which would be great. It will have a huge impact.\u201d Representative Justin Amash, the first Republican to call for the impeachment of President Trump, has broken from the party line once again in voting to hold attorney general William Barr and commerce secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt for failing to comply with subpoenas related to the 2020 census. This comes a day after Amash voted against the resolution authorizing House judiciary committee chair Jerry Nadler to go to court to enforce congressional subpoenas. Here\u2019s a statement from House judiciary committee chair Jerry Nadler on Hope Hicks agreeing to testify before the committee next week: The Washington Post is reporting that Hope Hicks, a former aid to President Trump, will testify before the House judiciary committee next Wednesday. Though the testimony will take place behind closed doors, the transcript will be released to the public, according to the Post\u2019s sources: Hicks will be the first former Trump aide to go before the committee investigating whether Trump tried to obstruct a probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. But Hicks might not answer many of the panel\u2019s questions, citing the president\u2019s assertion of executive privilege on events that occurred inside the White House. Earlier this month, the White House instructed Hicks not to cooperate with a congressional subpoena for documents related to her White House service. Robert Trout, a lawyer for Hicks, declined to comment. The committee subpoenaed Hicks, the former communications director, last month as part of its obstruction of justice investigation related to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report. The president has been fighting the committee\u2019s attempts to bring forth witnesses, and this interview marks a significant triumph for House Democrats. Hello everybody, Vivian Ho taking over for Oliver Laughland. Hope you\u2019re all having a superb Wednesday. Democrats in the House Oversight Committee have just voted to hold US attorney general William Barr and Treasury Secretary Wilbur Ross in contempt of congress. The vote relates to the refusal to hand over documents related to the decision to include a citizenship question in the 2020 census. Donald Trump continued to obfuscate over a letter he received from North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un and denied he was against US intelligence services activities in the region. Donald Trump Jr briefly appeared at a closed door senate intelligence hearing and said he is not worried about any potential perjury allegations. Bernie Sanders delivered an impassioned speech at George Washington University in defence of his political ideology. I\u2019m handing over to my colleague Vivian Ho in San Francisco now. House Democrats have voted in the Oversight Committee to hold the US attorney general, William Barr, and the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, in contempt of congress over their failure to supply documents relating to the citizenship question in the 2020 census. The vote had been delayed from earlier this morning after President Trump exerted executive privilege over the requested documents. The committee\u2019s vote will now go to the full house and represents a significant escalation in the ongoing battle over next year\u2019s census. The Associated Press continues: Democrats fear the citizenship question will reduce census participation in immigrant-heavy communities and result in a severe undercount of minority voters. They say they want specific documents to determine why Ross added the question to the 2020 census and contend the administration has declined to provide the documents despite repeated requests. The administration has turned over more than 17,000 of pages of documents and Ross testified for nearly seven hours in March. The Justice Department said two senior officials were interviewed by committee staff and said officials were working to produce tens of thousands of additional pages of relevant documents. The oversight panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, disputed the Justice Department\u2019s account and said most of the documents turned over to the committee had already been made public. \u201cWe must protect the integrity of the census and we must stand up for Congress\u2019 authority under the Constitution to conduct meaningful oversight,\u201d Cummings said Wednesday. Sticking with the 2020 race, we have a report that former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is taking time off from exploring a presidential run. Hallie Golden has a quick story for us: Former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz will be taking the summer off from exploring his potential 2020 bid for the US presidency. In a statement released Wednesday, Schultz said he experienced \u201cacute back pain\u201d while he was traveling in Arizona as part of his campaign work, and ultimately had to undergo three back surgeries. He said he has decided to spend the summer focused on rest and rehabilitation. \u201cI take this detour from the road reluctantly,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cMy concern for our country\u2019s future remains, as does my belief that the American people deserve so much more from our elected officials.\u201d In January, the billionaire announced he would explore a potential run for the presidency as an independent candidate. The news sparked a backlash from leading Democrats worried such a move could help President Donald Trump win his reelection bid in 2020. Schultz has spent months traveling to 15 states, talking with thousands of local residents as part of his campaign. In January, he visited his home town of Seattle to promote his new book and was greeted by dozens of protestors. He said he will be back in touch after Labor Day. We\u2019ll return to the Democratic 2020 campaign for a short while and to my colleague Adam Gabbatt who spent the morning with Texas Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke here in New York. O\u2019Rourke, whose campaign has dropped off in recent weeks according to some polls was here to take part in a morning run with LGBTQ activists. Here\u2019s Adam\u2019s report: O\u2019Rourke turned up right on time, ready for action. The 47-year-old was decked out in full running garb for the two-mile jog, mid-thigh shorts displaying willowy legs. He was wearing an Iowa Cubs baseball hat, which seemed on message given the importance of the Hawkeye State in the Democratic primaries. \u201cEverybody ready to run?\u201d O\u2019Rourke asked the roughly 30 people who had assembled on a popular running path close to the Hudson River. There was a muted response. \u201cTwo miles is all we\u2019re doing,\u201d he added, which served to lift spirits a little. With that, O\u2019Rourke bolted off down the pathway, surrounded by people who appeared to have varied levels of commitment to running. Most were wearing the customary shorts, T-shirts and trainers, but one man had opted for the less orthodox white denim jeans, while another wore cut-offs. Federal prosecutors have revealed that they are developing a national security case against the Chinese woman arrested at Donald Trump\u2019s private member\u2019s club in south Florida and charged with unlawful entry. Yujing Zhang, the 33-year-old, was caught attempting to enter Mar-a-Lago with a thumb drive infected with malware in April this year. The Miami Herald reports that prosecutors have requested that certain evidence in the case is held under seal as it includes classified information, an indication that Zhang could face far more serious charges than the ones already laid out. Their full report is here. Away from today\u2019s activities at the White House, Democratic candidate for president Bernie Sanders has been addressing the George Washington University in DC. His speech has been billed as a major defence of his political philosophy. My colleague, Lauren Gambino was there and will be filing a story shortly. Here are a few of her observations on Twitter: You can also read Lauren\u2019s excellent piece from yesterday that includes exerts from Sanders\u2019s expected speech. She assures me he stuck to the script. Trump is asked another question about his recent letter from Kim Jong-un and an intimation made yesterday that he does not support US intelligence agencies operations in the secretive east Asian state. Trump dodges the question again and states: \u201cThere\u2019s been no nuclear testing whatsoever [in North Korea].\u201d He reiterates that he received a \u201cnice letter\u201d from Kim and adds: \u201cRight now we have a very good relationship. Maybe better than its been for 25 years. Maybe forever.\u201d Duda is asked about Poland\u2019s relationship with Russia, specifically whether he views Russian president Vladimir Putin as an ally. Trump interjects before Duda answers calling the question a \u201cset up question\u201d. Duda gives a straight answer: \u201cI would very much like Russia to be a friend of Poland. It is our great neighbour.\u201d The pair take a couple more questions on procedural issues relating to immigration ties between the two countries and then the press conference is over. The two heads of states are now taking a few questions from reporters. Trump is asked whether transferring around 2000 troops to a base in Poland is a snub to the state of Germany over its decision to proceed with the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project with Russia. Trump denies that\u2019s the case but adds: \u201cI will tell you very strongly that I think Germany is making tremendous mistake by relying on the pipeline.\u201d He adds: \u201cPoland has been a tremendous friend of ours for a long time... Our relationship is just a very strong one.\u201d Trump is then asked about a letter he received yesterday from North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un, specifically he is asked whether the White House is planning a third summit with North Korea. He does not answer the latter, but describes the letter as a \u201cVery nice letter. Unexpected.\u201d He adds: \u201cSome day you\u2019ll hear about what as in that letter.\u201d We\u2019re back at the White House now as Donald Trump and Polish president Andrzej Duda hold a joint press conference in the Rose Garden. The press conference was preceded by fly over from a F35 fighter jet, of which the Polish state has just purchased a significant number of. The press conference is viewable here. We\u2019ll bring you highlights: Here\u2019s how things stand at lunchtime today: Donald Trump exerted executive privilege over a suite of documents relating to the 2020 US census. The move led house democrats to postpone a contempt vote against Attorney General William Barr and Treasury Secretary Wilbur Ross. Trump met with Polish president Andrzej Duda and announced he was considering moving an additional 2000 US troops to Poland. Trump\u2019s eldest son, Donald Trump Jr, made a brief appearance at a closed door Senate Intelligence hearing. He told reporters afterwards he has no fear of a perjury investigation following his appearance. Trump is scheduled for another appearance with his Polish counterpart later today at the White House Rose Garden. There were a few lines to digest from that impromptu presser. But sticking with today\u2019s main news on the 2020 census, Trump responded to a question on his decision to exert executive privilege on Justice Department documents relating to the decision to add a citizenship question. Trump conceded he was not completely across the issue as it is a \u201clegal matter\u201d but added: \u201cI think when you have a census and you\u2019re not allowed to talk about when someone is a citizens or not, that doesn\u2019t sound very good to me.\u201d He continued: \u201cI think it\u2019s totally ridiculous that we would have a census that wouldn\u2019t ask it...I think you have the right to ask.\u201d It\u2019s worth reminding readers here again that the census is not a citizenship test but a measure of the US population. It is a central part of American democracy that plays a pivotal role in determining representation in the US congress. Trump also confirmed he would meet with Vladimir Putin at the upcoming G20 summit in Osaka. He joked that he may allow reporters into the room this time. President Trump and his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda, have just taken questions from reporters at the White House. We\u2019ll wait for the full remarks to materialize by the Associated Press reports the top line that Trump says he is considering moving an extra 2,000 troops into Poland from elsewhere in Europe. The report continues: Trump is cautioning during an Oval Office meeting with Polish President Andrzej Duda that the decision isn\u2019t final. US officials had said Trump was expected to announce that he was sending about 1,000 additional troops and a squadron of Reaper drones to Poland to aid its self-defense amid concerns about Russian military activity. Polish leaders have been lobbying for additional forces for months and had hoped for a permanent U.S. base they said could be called \u201cFort Trump.\u201d The leaders are scheduled to participate in a \u201cjoint signing ceremony\u201d Wednesday before they go to the Rose Garden for a news conference. It appears the closed door Senate Intelligence committee hearing with the president\u2019s son has finished. Trump Jr briefly appeared in front of reporters at Capitol Hill. He had been compelled to appear before the committee following publication of the Mueller report, which raised questions about his 2017 testimony to the same committee during which he testified about the now infamous meeting between members of the Trump campaign and a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower during the 2016 presidential race. Trump Jr told reporters: \u201cI don\u2019t think I changed anything I said [in prior testimony] because there was nothing to change.\u201d Responding to a question that asked whether he feared perjury allegations, he responded: \u201cNot at all.\u201d Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway has just been speaking to reporters at the White House. Here are few highlights via the White House pool report: Conway was asked for comment on the pending supreme court decision on the 2020 census. She said: \u201cI think what\u2019s happening is that people who are worried...that it\u2019s constitutional, in fact, to ask a citizenship question on the US Census, are trying to pregame it and get ahead of that by colluding the coverage and that\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d Conway took a dig at former Vice President Joe Biden, the leading candidate in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. She referred to the primary contest as \u201cthat hot mess\u201d and added it was: \u201cobsessive, weird, and downright goofy that Vice President Biden doesn\u2019t mention President Obama but a few times in his speech, and he mentions President Trump 76 times.\u201d On the street protests in Hong Kong, Conway said: \u201cobviously we want people to live in peace and prosperity. It was pretty remarkable to see that many people take to the street.\u201d She added it was possible that Trump will address Beijing\u2019s extradition policy with Chinese President Xi when they next meet. Donald Trump Jr arrived at Capitol Hill a short while earlier for his closed-door hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee. He was asked by reporters if he had come to correct his 2017 testimony and responded there was \u201cnothing to correct\u201d. As we mentioned earlier in the blog, Trump Jr has been compelled to appear before senators after resisting invitations for months. The senators want to discuss answers Trump Jr gave the panel\u2019s staff in a 2017 interview, as well as answers he gave to the Senate Judiciary Committee in a separate interview behind closed doors that year. Trump\u2019s former lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, told a House committee in February that he had briefed Trump Jr approximately 10 times about a plan to build a Trump Tower in Moscow before the presidential election. But Trump Jr told the judiciary panel he was only \u201cperipherally aware\u201d of the real estate proposal. For readers who may not have followed the ongoing political battle over these census documents, here\u2019s a bit of important background. Although these subpoenas may yet shed more important light on the decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, the real battle over how next year\u2019s census will take shape is actually happening at the supreme court. Three lower court decisions have found the decision to add the question was unlawful, leading the Trump administration has taken the fight to the supreme court. Arguments in the case were heard in April and the court, now controlled by a conservative majority, is set to hand down a decision by the end of this month. The decision in that case is likely to be the most significant ruling in this court\u2019s term. The president\u2019s last minute intervention in the wrangle over documents related to the 2020 census has led Democrats to postpone their contempt vote until later today. The Trump administration has asserted executive privilege on documents related to the 2020 census. The move was announced just as the House Oversight Committee is about to vote on a motion that would hold the attorney general, William Barr, and the commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, in contempt of congress for failure to disclose the documents. The documents relate to a decision made by Ross and the Justice Department to insert a citizenship question in the 2020 census, which the census bureau itself acknowledges will reduce participation in the census next year. The census is a pivotal tenet in American democracy. It dictates the makeup of congressional boundaries. Numerous studies have indicated that including a citizenship question will reduce participation among certain minority communities, which could ultimately benefit Republicans in future elections. The president has sent his first flurry morning tweets and appears to be particularly irked by a resurfaced report relating to internal polling taken by his re-election campaign. Last month Politico reported that internal polling suggested Trump\u2019s support was slipping in three key battleground states in the midwest amid rising interest in Joe Biden\u2019s run for the Democratic presidential nomination. The New York Times reported on Monday that, following the leak to Politico, Trump instructed aides to lie about the polls findings. Now, it seems, Trump is suggesting that the polls never existed in the first place: As the day grinds into gear, here\u2019s a little more background on Trump Jr\u2019s expected closed door testimony. His expected appearance comes after months of wrangling between Republicans and Democrats in the senate. The president\u2019s son had refused to return to the senate, after his appearance in December 2017 but has now been subpoenaed by the Republican controlled committee. His testimony is expected to be limited in time and scope. CNN first broke the news yesterday and has more background on what Trump is expected to be asked about: The committee is interested in hearing again from Trump Jr. because of discrepancies between his testimony in 2017 and what other witnesses have told both the committee and the special counsel\u2019s office. Trump Jr. appeared before the Senate Intelligence, Senate Judiciary and House Intelligence Committees in 2017, and the release of the Mueller report prompted a new round questions about what Trump Jr. told the Senate Judiciary panel, which released a transcript of his interview. Trump Jr. testified he only told Kushner and campaign chairman Paul Manafort ahead of time about the Trump Tower meeting in which a Russian attorney promised dirt on Hillary Clinton. But then-campaign deputy Rick Gates, who pleaded guilty in the special counsel probe, told Mueller that Trump Jr. talked about a lead on negative information about the Clinton Foundation at a campaign meeting in the days before the Trump Tower meeting. Trump Jr.\u2019s testimony on the Trump Tower Moscow project has also been scrutinized, in which he said he was \u201cperipherally aware\u201d of the project. But Mueller\u2019s report says Cohen testified he discussed the project on multiple occasions with Trump Jr. and that the discussions were not just \u201cidle chit chat.\u201d Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of US politics today. Here\u2019s a rundown of events we\u2019ll be covering from Washington and elsewhere around the country: \u2013 Donald Trump Jr, the president\u2019s oldest son, is expected to testify in a closed door hearing before the Senate intelligence committee today. The hearing is expected to be limited in time and scope, and marks his second appearance before the committee after his first one in December 2017. \u2013 President Donald Trump is set to meet the Polish president, Andrzej Duda, at the White House early this afternoon. The pair will take questions at a joint press conference later in the day. \u2013 The attorney general, William Barr, and treasury secretary, Wilbur Ross, face a contempt vote in the House oversight committee today, over their refusal to hand over documents relating to the 2020 census. That vote will happen this morning. We\u2019ll bring you the news as it happens"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
