Steve is a columnist for Hi-Fi World magazine and runs the Digital Radio Tech site. I think of him as being on the extreme right of the argument, where Ofcom is on the extreme wrong. I'm not against digital radio -- I'd like it to succeed -- but I have two complaints. First, I think the UK should accept that DAB+ is the future (it is, after all, the new world standard), and that we should be openly planning migration to DAB+, not pretending it isn't going to happen. Second, I think sound quality matters, and we shouldn't be trying to move radio to a standard that sounds worse than CD or even FM radio. DAB as broadcast in the UK does sound worse than FM, and has much worse stereo, due to the bit-rates chosen. What's happened more recently is that internet radio has started to become a viable medium, and in this interview, Steve is arguing that the DAB lobby -- which basically controls the UK radio industry -- is ignoring it. He says: The DAB supporters [such as Pure and the BBC] face a bit of a conundrum here, because for the last few years they've mainly been promoting DAB on the basis that it provides greater choice. But a typical DAB listener can only receive around 35 stations (people in London receive more stations, people out in the sticks usually receive less), whereas there are 10,000 plus internet radio stations and thousands of on-demand streams, such as the radio programmes on the BBC iPlayer and podcasts. There's no contest: internet radio wins hands down on choice. Because of the low bit-rates used by UK DAB, the internet can also offer better sound quality. And the gulf is going to get wider in the future. Steve says: Internet radio has the big advantage that the streams can use modern audio codecs, such as WMA and AAC/AAC+, whereas DAB is stuck using the prehistoric MP2 codec that dates all the way back to the 1980s. But the main reason why so many internet radio streams now provide higher quality than DAB is because internet bandwidth has become dirt-cheap over the last couple of years. Furthermore, because the price of bandwidth is linked to Moore's Law, the price of bandwidth is expected to continue falling for another decade or more. So, the quality of internet radio will only improve over time, and it's basically inevitable that internet radio will outclass both DAB and DAB+ in terms of audio quality. DAB still wins on convenience, but internet radios have become easier to use, and that process will continue. Also, over time, pretty much every electronics device is going to be able to connect to the internet, so pretty much every device can be given some capability to work as an internet radio. One thing Steve doesn't go into is in-car internet radio, but I think this could become a critical issue. At the moment, hardly any cars have DAB, because DAB isn't widely used outside the UK. Steve says this \"led to the car and mobile phone manufacturers choosing not to integrate DAB into their products, because they will only integrate Europe-wide standards.\" So the problem boils down to how you make internet radio viable in cars on a pan-European basis. The obvious answer would seem to be Wimax (or if not, why not?). Wimax could also take broadband to rural areas, solving the government's universal broadband problem, and Wimax can easily be built into portable PCs, netbooks and mobile phones. As I've pointed out before, Intel is developing chip sets that do both Wi-Fi and Wimax, so that's a no-brainer. OK, now have a read of the Digital Britain interim report and see if you can find out where internet radio and Wimax are part of the government's vision of the future. Then you can ask Lord Carter why not. Watch some of the BBC's free advertising for DAB radios, then ask why it doesn't even mention that you can get internet radios or even DAB/FM/IR combo sets. Whether Steve Green is right or wrong, I really can't see any honest reason for not facing up to these issues and providing answers -- apart, possibly, from incompetence. * The interview had been reduced from four pages to three when I went back to it.
