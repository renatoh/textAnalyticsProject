The handkerchief has disappeared. A green number is likewise disposed of, and then both scraps of material are slowly extracted from an apparently vacant hand. The room emits a murmur of surprise and the bouncy public relations executive-cum-magician beams in triumph. Welcome to a very different style of business meeting. Gone are the days where brainstorming sessions were dominated by David Brent-types exhorting bored young graduates to \"think outside the box\". No more will such meetings be typified by streams of tired clich\u00e9s. Henceforth they will be sparkling events. Inspiration will zing off the walls like stardust, delegates will be stagger under the brilliance of their ideas, tills will ring in everyone's ears. In a word, they will be magic. That is if Nick Fitzherbert has his way. Fitzherbert is a PR man of 20 years standing, with numerous prestigious accounts and campaigns under his belt. But for the past 10 years he has also been a magician, a member of the exclusive Magic Circle and a master dissembler. He can produce rabbits out of hats and, if his publicity blurb is to be believed, vast vats of creativity - and hence profit - for firms. The key to increasing creative thinking is, Fitzherbert claims, to think like a magician. \"Creative thinking is hard for most people because our brain automatically clicks in to what we are familiar with,\" he says. \"But magicians don't think like that. We don't take anything at face value. We don't start by thinking things are impossible. It is our job to make the impossible seem real.\" Now Fitzherbert takes his ideas on the road. Having treated numerous businesses to day-long creativity sessions, he last week presented a breakfast briefing at the Institute of Public Relations in London. To my disappointment, the master magician was not wearing a cape, nor waving a magic wand. There were no Debbie McGee-style ladies in evidence. Rather, he was wearing a suit and surrounded by projectors and flip charts - the accoutrements of the business, rather than the supernatural, world. But the man works in PR and he knows how to put on a show. He bounded, grinned and laughed. He carefully positioned himself slightly to the left of the stage, explaining that the eye moves naturally from left to right. He cracked jokes and his audience of 40 PR execs laughed; he had digs at journalists and they laughed louder. And finally, he did the hankies trick. Much of what Fitzherbert preaches is common sense. Creativity, he says, starts with brainstorming. But, for the best results, you need to adhere to certain straightforward rules. Make sure you have a small, mixed group of people who feel their presence is needed. Define your problem; don't offer specific solutions which may limit the group's imagination; go for quantity of ideas, not quality - you will discard 95% but they may help inspire better ideas; get everyone involved in each other's ideas and encourage wild ideas. Most importantly, don't kill any idea. Stay positive at all times. So where does the magic come in? Fitzherbert works for a company called Magic Management, founded 10 years ago by a group of magicians from the Magic Circle. The company offers training and marketing services using the psychology of magic as its base. The company's founder, James Freedman, explains. \"Any communication will be memorable if an audience is emotionally engaged,\" he says. \"Magicians call this enchantment. We use it to persuade people of things even if, it has to be said, those things aren't true. We can make the impossible seem possible. These rules can be applied, to a greater or lesser extent, in business.\" While all this rings true, it hardly sounds new. I suspect that Magic Management is putting its own PR-style gloss on the art of public relations. \"You could say a lot of the rules exist in other disciplines,\" Freedman concedes. \"But what gives us the edge is that we are experts in convincing people of things that aren't true. We give our clients the skills so they can get their message believed.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
