Having instructed him to don his parka, wedge his Reni hat over his ears and shuffle down to Maine Road in order to find out what's the story (morning glory), we sat back to await news of which continental super-club's masterplan it was to nab out-of-favour defensive duo Richard Dunne and Steve Howey on loan with a view to a permanent move. Imagine our utter astonishment (well, mild surprise) then, when our kid reported back to say that the gruesome twosome had turned up for training as usual, man, and that the story in question was all about people at boardroom level saying their \"ta-ra chucks\" to the club. Sadly, our probe for further information was greeted with stony silence, an obnoxious indie sneer and a decidedly unambiguous V-sign. And, with that, our kid shuffled off to breakfast (pausing occasionally to look back in anger) on his daily ration of cigarettes and alcohol, leaving us to cobble together a story based on the following club statement. \"It is with regret the board of Manchester City announce that the chairman David Bernstein has tendered his resignation. Furthermore the club's managing director Chris Bird has also tendered his resignation. Both resignations have been accepted reluctantly - in the case of the chairman the resignation takes effect immediately, whilst in the case of Chris Bird this takes effect at a date yet to be agreed ... blah-de-blah ... both resignations have been accepted reluctantly ... yawn ... these resignations have neither been sought or welcomed by the board ... blether ... the board and major shareholders remain unified and committed to continue the development of the club ... waffle, drone ... together with the manager they intend to continue with existing policies for the benefit of our dedicated and loyal supporters,\" it sighed with, erm, resignation. Existing policies such as squabbling at boardroom level over the purchase of expensive strikers from Leeds that steadfastly fail to deliver? Considering it's Manchester City, the smart money says definitely, maybe. * * * * * * * * * * * * I, CLAUDIO Chelsea Village at Chelsea's of Chelsea is one of the world's friendliest communities. Its doors are open to all (unless it's that dreadful freeloader Homeless Mo from down the road again). Whether you're enjoying the space on the dance-floor at its ghost-town themed nightclub, or the one-to-one waiter service at dinner in the complex's eateries which are beautifully adorned with white elephants, you can do just as you please. And it's a place where all your dreams, however fanciful, can come true. Take the example of the cover star of this week's parish magazine, Claudio Ranieri. According to impossible-to-misinterpret quotes in the new issue of Village People, Claudio, the madcap Italian who runs the Village football team, wants to manage England next. And it's all because he feels so at home here. \"I have, er, how you say, lost my feeling of being Italian,\" said the pasta-eating, vino-drinking, wolf-whistling, horn-beeping, scooter-riding, mother-loving Anglophile. \"I am, er, how you say, a European.\" And that, of course, makes him perfectly qualified to succeed Svennis. \"I'd like one day to, er, how you say, be the manager of an international team,\" Claudio continued coquettishly. However, asked outright if he'd like to manage England, Claudio then seemed to draw back. \"My first choice is, er, how you say, a good international team,\" he teased. \"I am, er, how you say, a fan of teams who play well.\" D'oh. But Claudio, it's the England job. Are you sure? \"Er, how you say, why not?\" he resolved, breaking into one of his maniacally high-pitched pixie giggles. Why not!? He'd soon find out. * * * * * * * * * * * * A FATTIST STORY ABOUT RACISTS Like Rik Waller eating donuts on thin ice, the Fiver knows it needs to tread very carefully this afternoon. Another slow news day - and the threat of being sued into the gutter - dictates that instead of revealing the identity of the prominent high-profile Premiership star who has been trying to keep his name out of Sunday tabloids, we're left to spin a riveting yarn around Uefa's latest crackdown on racism in European football. Admirable, certainly, but a little restrictive on the humour front, for as everyone (bar fans of that smutty sloth Manning) knows, racism and humour don't mix. So, to the facts. Uefa's day-long \"Unite Against Racism\" conference rolled into London this morning, along with many of the movers and shakers of European football. And Garth Crooks. Having made light work of a complimentary full English, Uefa heavyweight Gerard Aigner stepped forward, loosened another notch on his Farah Sta-pressed, and addressed the delegates with a speech entitled 'Why tackle racism?' \"We have to be prepared to reflect on the duty we have to provide leadership in the social, educational and ethical dimensions to our work,\" he barked. \"This is why we have to tackle racism, xenophobia and other forms of discrimination and hatred.\" As Crooks stroked his chin sagaciously, Aigner dubbed racism and xenophobia \"an evil and a poison\" created and stimulated outside of football, but \"often given expression and public focus through our game.\" After adjourning for a gut-stretching 12-course lunch, Aigner returned to vow that by strengthening their disciplinary rules - giving them power to close stadia where racism is proved to occur - Uefa was making clear its intention to tackle the problem. \"We need to campaign and to educate, and ensure proper representation for minority groups at every level of the game,\" he added. \"That is exactly why we are here today.\" \"Here\", it's worth noting, being Stamford Bridge, home to many of the most notorious racist and xenophobic fans in British football. Ah, the irony. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"As an advertisement, our match with Villa on and off the pitch was about as attractive as a motorway pile-up\" - As an advertisement, this quote from Birmingham City managing director, Karren Brady will do nothing to improve Brum's chances in May's race to become European Capital of Culture 2008. * * * * * * * * * * * * EARWORMS Oh Mister Soft - The Softmints ad Seasons In The Sun - Terry Vamos YMCA - Village People Who Let The Dogs Out - The Baha Men We Will Rock You - Queen The Lion Sleeps Tonight - Various artists Dancing Queen - Abba To read an interesting study on the phenomenon of earworms (no, really) click here: http://webmd.lycos.com/content/article/61/67505.htm * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Chelsea's of Chelsea have been given the come-on by saucy Sevilla striker Antonito, who's looking for an invite to the Premiership party. Manchester United have found themselves a new Czech Republic starlet in 19-year-old Jakub Hottek. Women across the country are hoping for the new Patrick Berger (minus the hairband and the wife) rather than the new Karel Poborsky. Homeless Mo thinks paying Jean Tigana \u00a31m to leave Fayed's-formerly-of-Fulham would save him a small fortune on toothpicks. * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF Birmingham goalkeeper Nico Vaesen will be out for the rest of 2003 with a knee injury. The Belgian snapped a cruciate ligament in his right knee near the end of the match at Aston Villa on Monday. Liverpool's forever grimacing Stephane Henchoz faces a six-week lay-off after being told he requires minor surgery on his left calf. Meanwhile the Amazing Mr Em is also likely to be out for a fortnight with a hamstring strain. Fans who wear gas masks to Middlesbrough matches have been banned because of the current fears over chemical attacks, the club said today. Some supporters, particularly from Sunderland and Newcastle United, wear white chemical suits and dust masks over their faces in reference to Teesside's huge petro-chemical industry. \"These suits can incite crowd trouble,\" said the spokesman. \"Given the world situation we feel they are particularly inappropriate.\" Cleveland Police supported the ban, although admitted that wearing a suit or mask was not an arrestable offence. The footballer at the centre of kiss-and-tell allegations - known as Mr X to everyone apart from the millions aware of his identity - has been named on the BBC Celebdaq website, despite a high court injunction banning his identification. His name has now been removed from the website but the BBC still risks being taken to court for allowing the player to be named in the first place. Tottenham have agreed terms with Chinese international striker Qu Bo (pronounced Chew Bore - not Cue Bow). He will join Spurs for the start of pre-season training when the club hope to complete the formalities of a medical and obtain a work permit. Royston Keane has said that he would love to become manager of Manchester United when he retires from playing. \"It's a challenge that would really appeal to me, but I think the current manager will be here for a few years yet,\" he said. * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV &amp; RADIO ITV1: The Premiership (11pm) Firstly, an apology. Clearly, when writing that \"Egil Olsen could be out of the Blackburn line-up for up to four weeks\" in yesterday's Fiver, we meant Egil Ostenstad. Unless Olsen's signed for Rovers but is waiting for his wellies to be re-gripped. Sky Sports 1: FA Cup Classics (6.30pm &amp; 12pm) And so, to the job at hand. Yesterday, Dunny wrote of his depression at holding down a dead-end insurance job to pay off a student loan from a degree he didn't finish. Oh, and drink and drugs do nothing for him, and his home life is tedious. The two points may be connected. Could you help? Indeed you could. Futbol Mundial (7pm &amp; 12.30am) Joshua Hardie has been thinking out of the box. Out of his box, in fact. \"Drink and drugs,\" he suggests, \"they are the answer. You haven't tried enough. And not only do they work, they give women something to save you from, thus making you instantly more attractive. You don't actually say this is a problem, but I'm guessing it probably is.\" Gillette Soccer Special (7.30pm) \"To Dunny,\" begins straight-talking Brian Saxby of Newcastle-upon-Tyne. \"Pull yourself together and make a 'life list' of your positives and negatives to see how well off you are!\" You're On Sky Sports (10pm) Brian then saves him the bother. \"The Positives: 1. You have a job. 2. You have a home. 3. Your student loan is only 'largish' at worst. 4. You didn't graduate, therefore don't have to look at a photo of yourself in a stupid gown and hat. 5. You've achieved all of the above despite not having a degree. Pity the poor sods who needed a degree to achieve what you have.\" Football League Norwich City v Reading (1am) \"And the Negatives: 1. You're a quitter: you never really gave drink and drugs a proper chance. 2. And you can't spell 'largeish'.\" Sky Sports 2: Live Football League - Norwich City v Reading (7.30pm) Tony Erom from Cork also sought guidance. He can't blow a fat bundle between the pub and the bookies on the Cheltenham Festival this year because his boss is on holiday and he'll need to do some work. But you knew better... BBC Radio 5 Live: Sport On Five with Ian Payne (7pm) \"Avoid the dilemma while the boss is away by setting up a phone bet account and staying in the pub,\" suggests Kevin Denham. \"Or pay Dunny to run down the bookies for you. Who knows, he may win enough to pay off his student loan\". Talksport: Football First (7pm) Stuart Elvin has read the situation far more astutely, however. \"Surely if his boss is away the week of the Cheltenham festival, he won't have to worry about a thing and can amble from the pub to bookies whilst getting a junior person to do all the hard work,\" he writes. \"He could even install a telly in the office and set up a book.\" Newstalk 106: Off The Ball With Ger Gilroy (7pm) Indeed he could. So you see how it works: unfortunate folks write in with their problems, you provide a solution. Send your advice to Dear Fiver at the.boss@theguardian.com and - who knows - there might be a prize in it for you. By the same token, there might not."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
