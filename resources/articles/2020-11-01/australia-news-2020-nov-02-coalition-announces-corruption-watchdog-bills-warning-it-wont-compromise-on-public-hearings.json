Releasing two bills to establish the anti-corruption body on Monday, Christian Porter revealed the government would create new corruption offences and argued guilty public officials should be tried in court rather than have their careers \u201cdestroyed\u201d by integrity commissions. Despite announcing a six-month period of consultation, Porter warned opposition and crossbench parties there were \u201ccertain matters of principle\u201d the government would not compromise on. The proposed commission would consist of a law enforcement integrity division to oversee the department of home affairs, federal police, and other law enforcement and regulatory bodies; and a public sector division to oversee federal departments and agencies, higher education bodies, MPs and their staff. The oversight of judges could be added to the public sector division. The law enforcement integrity division could investigate corruption of any kind, would have the discretion to hold public hearings and could initiate investigations after referrals from the public. By contrast, the public sector division would only consider referrals from other agencies and regulators, could not hold public hearings and would be limited to investigating corruption that breached criminal offences. The integrity commission would have the power to investigate fresh matters on its own motion only where something was revealed in the course of an existing investigation. Labor\u2019s shadow attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, declared on Monday that the proposed commission was \u201cweak, secretive and compromised\u201d, signalling Labor was prepared to block it. Porter told reporters in Canberra the rationale for allowing public hearings on law enforcement was \u201cthere is a higher risk and a much greater threat from corruption inside law enforcement agencies in so far as they are the agencies that are meant to enforce the law\u201d. The attorney general said he would hate to see \u201cdeadlock\u201d develop if crossbench parties insisted on full public hearings and warned that the government would listen to feedback but \u201cstick strongly\u201d to its position against public hearings. Porter defended the higher bar to investigate public servants and politicians, noting the list of possible crimes that could spark an investigation was \u201cvery long\u201d \u2013 at 143 offences. \u201cIn my observation, they cover every conceivable type of serious criminal conduct that one might label corruption,\u201d he said. New offences will include repeated public sector corruption and concealing public sector corruption. But many seek to punish those that raise unmeritorious complaints, including disclosure of false or misleading allegations to a commonwealth investigative body and raising public sector corruption issues with no basis and with an intention to cause detriment. Porter accepted that the jurisdiction to investigate law enforcement might be slightly broader, but countered that for a public service of hundreds of thousands of people it was beneficial to create \u201cclarity as to what conduct is criminally corrupt, and what conduct might be misconduct of a lower standard\u201d. From 1 January, the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity will expand its jurisdiction to cover four tax, investment, prudential regulation and competition regulators, before morphing to become the law enforcement division of the new commission. The government has committed $106.7m in new funding to establish the commission on top of $40.7m of existing ACLEI funding. Porter would not be drawn on timing for the public sector integrity division, arguing it depended on when legislation passed parliament. He noted he needed to convince the crossbench the proposal was \u201cthe best-balanced approach\u201d to create the anti-corruption agency. Crossbench MPs and senators such as independent MP Helen Haines prefer a stronger model with public referrals and public hearings \u2013 which transparency advocates say deter corrupt conduct. Porter said blocking public hearings was necessary to avoid the \u201cpitfalls\u201d of state anti-corruption bodies that deny procedural fairness to witnesses and cause \u201cinnocent people [to] suffer unfairly\u201d. Despite limitations on public hearings and jurisdiction, Porter boasted the commission would have \u201cgreater investigatory powers\u201d than a royal commission including the ability to compel evidence, search and seize evidence under warrant, arrest people and tap phones. Cases from the public sector division would be referred to commonwealth prosecutors \u201cfor public trial and conviction or acquittal depending on how that trial transpired\u201d, he said. The Coalition first promised a national integrity commission in December 2018, at which time Scott Morrison revealed it had been in the works since January 2018. Continuing the government\u2019s practice of blaming the Covid-19 pandemic for delay, Porter said although he had draft legislation in December 2019 it would have been \u201ca terrible idea\u201d to conduct consultation on 400 pages of legislation \u201cduring the height of a pandemic\u201d. Porter rejected the view that there was some \u201curgency\u201d to improving scrutiny of politicians, arguing there were already 11 agencies with jurisdiction over criminal conduct and corruption in the public sector. Porter said the commonwealth integrity commission could investigate conduct before it came into existence provided the conduct was an offence at the time. He said full retrospectivity \u2013 proposed by the Greens and backed by Labor \u2013 was \u201cwrong ethically, morally and in principle\u201d. Dreyfus told reporters in Melbourne that if Australians have to \u201cwait for the election of a Labor government\u201d to get a proper integrity commission then \u201cso be it\u201d. \u201cIf this government manages to persuade crossbench members of the Senate that they should favour its inadequate model, then a future Labor government will certainly commit to giving Australia the proper integrity commission,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
