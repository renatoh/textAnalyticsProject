Can heady optimism ever have turned so fast to unpalatable dust for England's cricket supporters? Not so much for the fact of the Edgbaston defeat but the manner of it. In just a couple of days, Steve Waugh's Australians seemed to have laid waste even the concept of a genuine competition. Perhaps the answer to sanity for the remaining four matches is for Brits simply to lie back and enjoy them, revel in Australia's pre-eminence as a past generation did when Don Bradman's lot ravaged the shires more than half a century ago. So to Lord's once again this Thursday, and those with tickets for Sunday and Monday, so lip-smacking smug a month ago, are already planning contingency diversions in London. It seems like only last Saturday week - in fact it was the middle of May - that I basked in a Mound Stand box at a self-same and sunlit Lord's acclaiming the confirmation of the England team's assured renaissance in the summer's opening Test against Pakistan. Michael Atherton and Marcus Trescothick gaily posted a century for the first wicket, Nasser Hussain and Graham Thorpe another for the fourth and, after talking of Hutton and Washbrook and Graveney and May, our languid reverie turned to remembrance of Statham and Trueman as Darren Gough and Andy Caddick bounded in from each end to share 16 wickets. And England won by an innings, their third win at Lord's on the gallop, after which the fast bowlers were presented before us like emperors back from crusades, and they punched the air and scratched each others' backs like fraternal bear cubs. \"We've got that habit of winning,\" said the hale-cheeked Yorkshireman, \"and now we've got it we're really going to take some beating.\" Said the lank from Somerset with the Prince Charles ears: \"I wouldn't be half as good without Goughie and he wouldn't be half as good without me. Chalk and cheese we may be, but what a perfect match we make.\" Hey ho for dramatic irony. For boast read roast. Only eight weekends have passed since then, but that bonny breast-beating of merry May now resonates only as a grave and muffled funeral drum, and as a chastened England group make their way back to Lord's today I reckon they cannot have mustered for a more important Test match in yonks. Another pallid and wan, almost white-flag, job of spilled chances, wide long-hops, quaking (and quacking) batsmanship, and you fear not so much for the rest of this series but for most of this team's whole Test cricketing life. Stand-up comedians are already having to sit down complaining of overload as they replenish their gloating gag books. At Wimbledon in the media rooms and restaurants, it has been an annual wheeze of mine for some 30 years now to zap the television screens away from the tennis to catch the progress of the Test match. Mainly to annoy our earnest American confreres. As England's calamity began to untwine at Edgbaston this year, even the Yanks twigged the dolorous message and began first to sympathise, and then to titter. The laugh was on the limeys all right. Edgbaston really was a feeble show by England. I cannot remember worse - especially after all the winter and springtime bombast - nor such loose stuff being bowled. Can you credit that Mark Butcher, the most successful pie-thrower by far, wasn't remotely picked for his bowling? And judging by their drear ghosted post-match newspaper columns, Messrs Chalk &amp; Cheese, those two prophesying protagonists from Yorkshire and Somerset, seemed totally unaware of that impeaching irony - and you could only smile ruefully and remember the line of Arthur Mailey, merry maestro of a leg-spinner-turned-journalist: \"I used to bowl tripe. Now I write it.\" There are excuses for the lack of any defiant bottle at Edgbaston. The absence of Thorpe was a blow for sure. But injuries are a fact of team building, and where were the obvious ready-made replacements - ready, padded-up, indeed revved-up, \"the next cab on the rank\" as the estimable Damien Martyn (that very thing for Australia, and how) so descriptively put it? But to have English broadcasters debating, as he walked in to bat, whether Usman Afzaal was pronounced \"Ooz-man\" or \"Uss-man\" was shaming all round. And to talk of the captain and his dodgy digits definitely coming back for the third Test seems dotty in the extreme. His leadership may be potent in the pavilion and on the field, but at the crease his batsmanship is definitely not. His technique seems shot to pieces - that was a disastrously elementary no-shot leave - and it was always going to be dangerous to come to a Test match with no time at all in the middle. The Aussies must have been chortling - a free wicket - and will do so even more loudly if Hussain returns to Trent Bridge for the third Test with no decent innings behind him. What the captain needs is four weeks on the county grind and four big centuries at least. Simultaneously, is Duncan Fletcher's (presumably) deep-laid central-contracts stratagem and master plan crumbling before our eyes? Pre-Edgbaston, England's main batsmen were all ordered to rest and go nowhere near the middle for their counties. They looked as short of proper match practice and timing as they were of runs. Ditto post-Edgbaston. For batsmen, timing means runs and runs mean confidence. Ask those two assiduous practisers, Graham Gooch and Geoff Boycott. They'd demand county second XI matches before a Test match just to get into nick. Bowlers, too: they need match bowling to find rhythm and melody, get in sync and in the groove. Caddick and Gough looked distinctly over-rested and rusty in Birmingham, their bad-back back-up Craig White even more so. The Lord's Test is going to be crucial for the reputation of Fletcher and these strategies. For public consumption he seems content - to be sure, delighted - to be perceived as inscrutably detached, crouched and crusty as Old Father Time himself, happy only to utter sullenly bland and defensively muttered southern African cliches to the media, and then only if you are prepared to twist his hairy forearm. Fair enough, I suppose, but he could occasionally display a glimmer of gratitude forbeing granted - along with the captain and the selector David Graveney - the longest honeymoon period of any of his predecessors in just about any of our national sports. If Edgbaston was not a one-off aberration for Fletcher's England then I fear, and forecast, that wallfulls of sharp-edged bricks will be raining down in no time. But his players, they say, still dote on him, and however weedily retrograde the move was, Fletcher must have summoned impressively mighty powers to persuade the unyieldingly stubborn Atherton to resume the captaincy for Lord's. At least we won't get on Thursday morning the appallingly tacky comparison of Hussain at the toss-up in his gaudy sponsor-logoed baseball cap alongside Waugh, proud and dignified in his antique, treasured, and unsullied baggy-green. But heavens, by all that's wonderful, what if England could win an Ashes Test at Lord's for the first time since 1934? Sixty-seven Junes ago, having been slaughtered in the first Test, England came to a sunny Lord's and made 440 (Ames 120, Leyland 109). By the second evening, Australia stood at 192 for two. The Times said England \"bowled badly and the fielding was fumbling and slovenly\" but as the England team read that at breakfast in their King's Cross hotel, a heavy rainstorm began, and Hedley Verity, slow left arm, said: \"Boys, we might have a bit of fun today.\" On his way to Lord's, Verity's taxi ran over a black cat at the same moment as the sun came out, which he took as further omens - and by six o'clock on the treacherous sticky he had taken 14 wickets and England had won by an innings and 38 runs. Surely rain cannot also be England's only hope at Lord's in 2001."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
