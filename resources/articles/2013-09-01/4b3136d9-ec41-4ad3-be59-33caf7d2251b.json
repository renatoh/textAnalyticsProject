She might have seasoned her granita in the blender, served her chicken on the bone, and forgotten to turn on the oven for her roasted cabbage, but after literally months of primetime cooking Emma took the title in the final round - recreating a dessert from Ben Shewry so tricksy I'd have probably still been studying the recipe by the time it was meant to be on the table. I was pleased to see Emma win. She's been consistently strong throughout the competition \u2013 that tartare dish for her family looked amazing \u2013 so strong, in fact, she's dodged elimination rounds and looked on from the balcony in a charming capelet for much of the series. And while Rishi always had the poise and the confidence of a potential champion (and arguably, also the skills) Emma never quite seemed to believe that she might make it to the winner's podium. You could say that of all three finalists in fact: each was extremely likeable, and each had a distinctive approach to food \u2013 important when you're being asked to invest in people doing something that you can't actually judge because even with MasterChef's lower ratings, there isn't quite enough food to go round. Which is a shame, because I'd have paid proper money to taste some of those plates. Particularly from Samira's kitchen. Emma was a deserving winner, but Samira's dishes have been the ones I've wanted to eat throughout this show. (And of course, she's been a joy on camera with her dollops of attitude and raw determination.) Would she have put up a perfect Attica pudding? I doubt it. But after being sent home on a challenge involving pork sausage \u2013 seriously MasterChef? \u2013 only to come back and defeat Rishi, I was rather hoping she'd win through. Instead Emma took the crown, despite Matt's best efforts to send her into a flap over her gratin dish and George's best efforts to put everyone off with his leather bowtie, and Lynton watched his brilliant start slip away - even with a green mango salad that I wanted to reach into the television and devour. So what did you make of the judges' decisions? And indeed reports that Ten is planning to rest all of its MasterChef spinoffs in an attempt to rekindle the main show, erm, magic?
