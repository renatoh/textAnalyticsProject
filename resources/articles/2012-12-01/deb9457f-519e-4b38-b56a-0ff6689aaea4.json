She is dressed in the same smart blue uniform as the other girls and has been attending the same sex education classes, delivered by the city's branch of the Brook charity, all Wednesday morning. There is the odd stare, and knowing smile from the teachers, but that is probably because this tiny Year 10 student, known by her friends as Twiglet, is leading a couple of middle-aged men who are only too aware of their incongruity. The Belvedere pupils have had a couple of months to grow accustomed to the fact that the Mancunian in their midst is also an Olympian and Britain's leading all\u2011around gymnast at the age of 16. Tunney was still 15, and the youngest member of Team GB, when she competed in London and delivered clean routines to help the women finish sixth in the team competition \u2013 Britain's best result since 1928 \u2013 then became the leading home athlete with 13th place in the individual all-around final. \"As it's the Olympics you want it to go the best you can \u2013 and it did for me actually,\" she reflects. \"It was what I'd hoped. I managed to do all my routines clean on every piece and help the team get to the goal we wanted to achieve.\" She had timed her run beautifully, claiming an unexpected victory at the British championships two months earlier to secure her place in the team and two weeks in the Olympic Village. That would have been a daunting experience for most 15-year-olds. \"People always expected it to feel really weird but it wasn't,\" she explains. \"People used to say: 'You're the youngest one, aren't you?' and I was like: 'Yeah' \u2013 it wasn't a big deal. At the time, even now, I don't even think about what it will be like when I'm older looking back on it. When I do I'm sure I'll be more pleased with myself than I am now, you know what I mean?\" She has to be jogged by the helpful man from British Gymnastics to recall her encounter with Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. \"She came to watch the pommel horse final when Louis [Smith] and Max [Whitlock] were competing. She didn't know a lot about gymnastics so she was asking us questions about how it works and the scoring and stuff. She was really nice. You'd expect her to be a bit stuck-up but she wasn't.\" Tunney seems as un-stuck-up as it is possible to be, as you'd expect of a girl from Ashton-under-Lyne in east Manchester. She started gymnastics at the Tameside village club of Broadbottom when she was five, then on to Stockport and about five years ago to the City of Liverpool club \u2013 which has become the heart of the GB women's team thanks to the success of Beth Tweddle and her coach, Amanda Reddin, who was recently appointed head coach of the women's artistic gymnastics programme. Tunney had been commuting along the M62 to Toxteth from the age of 10. \"That was the worst bit, all the time in the car,\" she says. Then in September, after her London Olympics success and with Rio in 2016 in mind, Tunney, her family and her coaches took the decision that she would be better basing herself on Merseyside through the week. So she left Droylsden academy for Belvedere \u2013 Michael Gove would presumably approve of this story \u2013 and decided to drop down a year, retaking Year 10 so that she could begin a new set of GCSEs. \"I have to do maths, English, a science [biology] and a language \u2013 I'm doing French \u2013 and then for the ones I chose myself I'm doing media studies and PE,\" she says. \"We do quite a lot of theory in it,\" she says of the latter. \"For the practical lessons we have to do certain things, it's been quite easy decisions, because of the sport I do \u2013 I can do them based around gymnastics and trampolining.\" But she names media studies as her current favourite. \"Might be a bit useful as well.\" Six subjects are plenty to be going on with given her extra-curricular demands. Gymnasts train hard and often. \"After school I just walk down [to the City of Liverpool club] \u2013 it's only 10 minutes,\" she says. \"You get used to it. You start doing double sessions and days like that when you're quite young.\" She is living with the family of Claire Duffy, her coach, and is disarmingly matter-of-fact about the sacrifices she has been making for years. \"When I came to Liverpool the only people I really knew were from the gym. But because of all the training I never really get to come out and see my friends anyway, so it wasn't really such a big deal. Doing what I've done, going to the Olympics and stuff, you have to be dedicated and know you're not going to have much social life. But if you love your sport, you'll do that.\" She flew to Stuttgart on Thursday for a World Cup series event that will be followed by another in Glasgow next weekend, when Tunney and a couple of her London team-mates will make their first home appearance since the Olympics. \"It should be good,\" she says of Glasgow. \"Not the same as the Olympics but we know the support is there.\" Of the possibility of another Olympics, when she will be 19, Tunney says: \"I do think about it but then there's other things first \u2013 the Europeans [in Moscow next spring], the Commonwealths [back in Glasgow in 2014]. At the minute my goal is to get to them \u2013 once I do that then I can look towards Rio.\" So she will continue her unusual life, as an Olympian GCSE student and a Mancunian in Liverpool. She has even been persuaded to switch her vague football allegiance to Liverpool, having been brought up as a supporter of Manchester's Reds. \"I've been to Old Trafford though,\" Tunney says with a sparkle. \"I went with my dad when I was about six. But I fell asleep. David Beckham did wave at me, though \u2013 it was on TV and my mum was watching it and I was stood on my dad's shoulders.\" She is interrupted by the senior vice-principal \u2013 used they not to be called deputy heads? \u2013 with details of the biology lab where the photos are to be taken. \"OK, OK, thank you,\" Tunney says, nodding. Then, after he has disappeared: \"I've no idea where that is.\" The Belvedere academy has quite a character in its corridors."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
