David Pullman had been approached by David Bowie's manager with a plan to sell Bowie's music rights. Pullman suggested instead that \"Bowie bonds\" be issued - investments with a fixed rate of return, backed by future earnings. Bowie received $55m (\u00a333.6m) up front from the bond issue, and Pullman took a commission rumoured to be around 10% of each transaction. Investors received bonds that paid interest from the projected royalties from Bowie's first 25 albums over the next 15 years. The rights would return to the musician at the end of the period. The bonds have performed well in the last six and a half years, and currently hold an A3 rating - the seventh highest. However, this could be about to change. Moody's Investors Service has warned that the bonds' creditworthiness is to be reviewed. This, according to Moody's, is because of \"lower than expected revenues generated by the assets due to weakness in sales for recorded music as well as the recent downgrade of an entity that provides credit support to the transaction\". That entity is music publisher EMI, and the Bowie bonds have come under review as they were tied to the creditworthiness of EMI, which has been battered by the slump in recorded music sales. After the initial success of the Bowie bonds other musicians leaped onto the bandwagon, including James Brown, Ron Isley of the Isley Brothers, Iron Maiden, Ashford &amp; Simpson and songwriter Holland-Dozier-Holland. The model has been extended to cover other entertainment assets, for example the literary estate of John Steinbeck. Pullman, a graduate of Wharton Graduate School of Finance, worked on Wall Street in the 1980s as a trader in the then-booming mortgaged-backed securities market - bonds backed by mortgages. The \"Pullman process\" he applied to the Bowie bonds involved breaking down the back catalogue into individual songs, markets and formats to build a projected revenue model, in a process taking up to four months. Despite initial reservations on Wall Street, the Bowie transaction was named deal of the year by Euromoney in 1997. With more than $1bn in transactions to date, Mr Pullman has retained the respect of his peers. So why the possible downgrade? Most of Pullman's big name deals were completed between 1997 and 2000. Investors, already gripped by dotcom fever, were attracted by a new and exotic way of making money. With the end of the dotcom boom, it seems the man who fell to earth has taken a bit of a knock."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
