Their numbers, under the Conservatives, had plummeted, and those remaining felt the job had been reduced to filling in endless forms recording numbers of families visited and interventions made. The profession believed its role was being devalued, and suspected it was seen as a soft target when managers came to make cuts. The new government seemed to offer a brighter future. Labour set up endless schemes, such as Sure Start, health action zones and Primary Care Act pilots, the aims of which chimed with a health visitor agenda. It published a white paper, Supporting Families, which celebrated the work of health visitors. It even set up a new post of minister of public health, dedicated to the work that health visitors had been trying to promote for so many years. It is an apparent paradox, then, that the same government has drafted legislation which, some health visitors are warning, could herald the demise of their profession. The controversy is over the new regulatory body for nurses, midwives and health visitors: the Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC). This is the successor to the present UKCC, which is being scrapped after a lengthy consultation process. The government is tightening regulations and has simplified some of the UKCC's more labyrinthine processes. But health visitors are angry that they appear to be being snubbed by this new body. Nowhere in the draft legislative order are health visitors mentioned. They have even been left out of its title. A small, but high-profile, body of health visitors is leading the protests. Its view is that if health visitors are not named in the legislation, they will not retain their separate status and will be subsumed into nursing. Margaret Buttigieg, former director of the then Health Visitors' Association (HVA) and now an independent consultant, is appalled at the omission. She says: \"Although we have been assured that health visitors will be represented on the new council, nowhere are they mentioned in the draft order. One finds it difficult to accept that health visitors will continue as a statutory profession. \"We know from past experience how difficult it is to get health visitors' voices heard among such an enormous number of nurses. I did a piece of work for the UKCC last year on health visitor training and I found that health visitor lecturers were struggling against the odds to be recognised in huge schools of nursing. I found that very important skills, such as child protection and communication skills, were either missing from courses or their appearance on the timetables was so brief that they were of no use to anyone.\" Buttigieg is adamant that health visiting has to remain a separate profession. \"Health visiting is about primary prevention,\" she says. \"Practitioners search for health needs and influence policies. We have a very different role to that of nurses, and our greatest concern is that we will eventually be swallowed up into nursing, which is primarily concerned with illness.\" The soon-to-be-defunct UKCC has also complained to the Department of Health. Its main concern is a lack of consistency: health visitors will share equal billing with nurses and midwives on the new council, so why are they not mentioned in the draft order? Health department officials have hinted that they wanted to retain some sort of flexibility. This could mean health visitors in future being replaced by public health practitioners or public health nurses. The Community Practitioners and Health Visitors Association (CPHVA), the renamed HVA, has also mooted the idea of a \"public health practitioner\". Jackie Carnell, the association's director, says: \"There are two public health qualifications - school nursing and health visiting - and I think what might happen over time is that, like any other part of professional practice, the roles may evolve into a broader one. At the moment, the role is very specific. \"In Scotland, they have taken this model further. People train to become a public health nurse and they will choose to practise either in a community setting or a school setting. I certainly don't subscribe to the 'slippery slope' argument - I don't think this is going to be the end of health visiting as we know it.\" Carnell's scenario appals Sarah Cowley, professor of community practice development at King's College, London. \"Health visitors are not nurses,\" she says. \"We deal with the healthy population and we have an entirely different ethos to nurses. Health visiting is the only speciality in community practice that requires that you have an additional qualification - school nurses don't need one and district nurses don't need one.\" Cowley and other health visitors would like to see the profession totally divorced from nursing and its entry gate widened. \"I look around now and see people who have degrees in sociology, psychology, public health and health promotion and I think they would be brilliant in health visiting,\" Cowley says. \"But they don't get recruited because they have to spend three years doing nurse training. It doesn't make sense that we're stuck to the old ways.\" Her suggestion would also go some way towards bolstering health visitor numbers. Health visiting is an ageing profession with about one in four practitioners eligible for retirement in the next four years. It is perhaps this, rather than any government legislation, which poses the real threat to the profession. A day in the life Sally Hall has been a health visitor for 19 years and works in Gosforth. She says no two days are the same. This is a typical Monday for her: 8.30am: I have a meeting with my colleagues to discuss an out-of-hours health visiting telephone helpline. We discuss any problems we've had and try to resolve them. A newly-qualified member of staff has started so we exchange telephone numbers and I tell her my whereabouts for the week so she can call on me if she needs me. 10am: I start my visits. I see a mother with a 10-year-old and a three-year-old. The older boy has been receiving learning support in school and was feeling very stigmatised by this. His biological father was not making contact and the mother was recovering from a hysterectomy. There was also a suggestion that she was abusing alcohol. I refer the child for a hearing test to make sure that there is no other reason why he isn't doing well at school. I then chat to the mother about behaviour management techniques and I refer the boy to a literacy clinic. 11am: I go back to the surgery, where I pick up messages and work from the GP, midwife or practice manager. 11.30am: I meet a colleague to discuss setting up a session for children with bad eczema, who often go backwards and forwards to the GP. We think there has to be a better way to treat them. Health visitors can prescribe emollients and creams from a limited formulary. 12.30pm: Lunch. 1pm: I do a hearing-test session for 29 kids. It's very boring because you do the same thing all the time! 3.30pm: I run a clinic called Green Line, where I advise young people on contraception and sexual health. Setting up these sessions requires a lot of work behind the scenes to make sure things run smoothly. 5.30pm: I can't take paperwork home with me because of patient confidentiality so I have to enter everything we do into a computer database. It can be very time consuming. 6pm: Home."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
