The crucial episode in the shaping of Castro's political thought came in the mid-1950s, when he was in exile in Mexico and dreaming of seizing power in his native Cuba. There he met a young Argentine doctor, Che Guevara, who had just lived through the trauma of the CIA coup that ended democratic rule in Guatemala. The two had long conversations about how and why the CIA had managed with relative ease to overthrow the reformist government of President Jacobo Arbenz. Guevara recounted how CIA operatives had taken advantage of Guatemala's political openness to bribe newspaper editors, encourage opposition groups and build influence within the armed forces. That led Guevara to a transcendent conclusion. It was not possible, he told Castro, to impose a reformist political programme in any Latin American country within the framework of democracy, because the US would crush it. The only way to do so, the two men agreed, was to establish a dictatorship in which no opposition groups were allowed to function. After Castro seized power in 1959, with Guevara at his side, this is the course on which he led Cuba. The repressive rule he imposed on Cubans sharply restricted their civic and political freedoms. It also made his long survival possible. The CIA coup in Guatemala was not the only American intervention that shaped Castro's worldview. Like countless Cubans over the span of two generations, his political consciousness was decisively influenced by the legacy of the Spanish-American war of 1898. Cuban revolutionaries welcomed American soldiers who came to help them in that war because the US Congress had promised that after Spanish rule over Cuba was ended, American troops would withdraw and \"leave the government and control of the island to its people\". Once the Spanish were defeated, however, the US changed its mind and decided to turn Cuba into a protectorate. Cuban patriots never forgot that betrayal. \"This time the revolution will not be frustrated!\" Castro vowed in his first speech after winning his revolutionary victory in 1959. \"This time, fortunately for Cuba, the revolution will achieve its true objective. It will not be like 1898, when the Americans came in and made themselves masters of the country.\" Less than three years after he made that speech, Castro had to defend his government against a military invasion sponsored by the United States. His victory at the Bay of Pigs not only confirmed his belief that the US would never end its hostility to his regime. It also helped him become the world superstar of anti-imperialism and the idol of revolutionaries around the world. Years later, Castro further burnished his credentials by sending Cuban troops to Angola. There they fought against US-backed forces that sought to protect the ruling oligarchy in Angola and defend American allies in apartheid South Africa. During Castro's long rule, ordinary Cubans enjoyed better healthcare, education and overall standards of living than their counterparts in nearby countries where the US held decisive power, among them Haiti, the Dominican Republic, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua. They also, however, were denied basic political rights. Castro was what pop psychologists call a \"control freak\". He believed, like Louis XIV and many other absolutists, that only he knew what was best for his people. One important reason Castro embraced Marxism was that it gave him a theoretical framework within which he could justify holding power indefinitely. Another reason was that it gave him a bulwark against American intervention. His career was defined above all by his defiance of the United States. Ironically, though, it was the history of US intervention in Latin America that made him the tyrant he became.
