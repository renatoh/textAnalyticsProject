That is quite a leap of faith given Saints' recent history of at least one off-field scandal per season. Last year there was Ian Millward's shock dismissal for swearing, although it was the injuries sustained by Sean Long, Paul Sculthorpe and Darren Albert late in the season that scuppered their grand final chances. In 2004 Sean Long and Martin Gleeson were suspended for betting against the weakened team Millward sent to Bradford on Easter Monday and, although Saints had already won the cup in Cardiff, their league form never really recovered. The previous year, 2003, was a busy one even by Knowsley Road standards, with Keiron Cunningham fined and reprimanded for a positive drug test and the club docked two points for breaching the salary cap - points that proved crucial as they again failed to qualify for the grand final. Even in 2002, when they last reached Old Trafford and won a third Super League title in four years by beating Bradford in a thriller, Millward had courted controversy by sending another weak team to Valley Parade the week before a losing cup final appearance at Murrayfield. It is therefore a dangerous business relying on Saints to stay the course of a season without some serious disruption and the excitable suggestions that they could become the first team to go through a Super League campaign unbeaten have been silenced by the shock defeat at struggling Huddersfield two weeks ago. Yet the signs are that under Millward's successor Daniel Anderson, there is a new stability verging on serenity at the club. Anderson always comes across as calmness personified, with some highly dubious facial hair representing his closest brush with controversy so far, and he jokingly rebuked himself for leaping off his seat a couple of times in last week's cup tie, such was his pleasure at St Helens' best performance of the season. He also seems to have the rest of the year planned out to ensure his key players peak for big matches. That was why Long, Cunningham and Leon Pryce had been given a breather in the less consequential Huddersfield game and why Long is likely to be absent again from this Saturday's derby at Wigan, to ensure his fitness for the cup quarter-final against Catalans Dragons the following week. But it is not only on the field where Saints seem to have all bases covered. Their current average crowd of 12,812 is their best for decades, they have developed a significant new corporate support by pushing west towards Liverpool and the shaky financial foundations on which much of their previous success had been based have been considerably stabilised, largely thanks to the chairman Eamonn McManus and chief executive Sean McGuire. The one glaring weakness in the St Helens operation is Knowsley Road itself, where the main stand wobbles alarmingly when the atmosphere is bouncing and anyone driving through the main car park risks serious suspension damage. Even McGuire has described the ground as \"a tired old lady\" and McManus will not rest until he has delivered a new stadium to match those that generate vital revenue for Warrington, Hull and Wigan, with talks ongoing to develop the old United Glass site. All this optimism will surely have the St Helens stalwarts worried that something must be about to go seriously wrong. What price a shock Wigan win over Long-less Saints this weekend?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
