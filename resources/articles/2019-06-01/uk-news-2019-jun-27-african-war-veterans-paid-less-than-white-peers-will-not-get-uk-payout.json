Following months of silence since the Guardian and al-Jazeera first revealed the discriminatory policy, the defence minister Tobias Ellwood has privately told MPs there were \u201cno current plans to take forward any further investigations of this matter\u201d. Officials across three government ministries examined the issue after revelations that soldiers drawn from Britain\u2019s African colonies were paid an end-of-war bonus that was calibrated not only to rank and length of service but also ethnicity. White soldiers from those colonies received a gratuity worth triple that offered to black troops. In a letter seen by the Guardian, Ellwood said a full investigation would require \u201cextensive resources\u201d. He cited \u201ccompeting demands\u201d across government departments and the \u201cdifficulty in establishing an accurate factual records base\u201d. Ellwood added that the decision \u201cin no way diminishes how grateful the UK is to all those servicemen and women from the Commonwealth who served with Britain during the second world war.\u201d In the letter, the minister acknowledged that non-white troops had faced discrimination in Britain\u2019s armed forces. \u201cAs we look back in time, we often encounter disparities that would never be acceptable by today\u2019s standards.\u201d His letter was in response to a written question from Richard Benyon, a Conservative MP and former lieutenant with the Royal Green Jackets, an infantry regiment in which Ellwood also served. Labour strongly condemned the decision to shelve further inquiries. \u201cIt beggars belief that the government simply cannot be bothered to investigate how many black African veterans who faced this appalling discrimination are still alive, and compensate them while there is still time to do so,\u201d said Emily Thornberry, the shadow foreign secretary. \u201cWe need to hear from Boris Johnson and Jeremy Hunt as to whether they will reverse this shameful inaction.\u201d Fabian Hamilton, the shadow minister for defence and foreign and Commonwealth affairs, demanded \u201ca proper apology without delay\u201d. He said: \u201cThis was systematic and deliberate discrimination, and an unacceptable way to treat those who were an integral part of the war effort that kept our democracy safe from fascism and Nazism. This government\u2019s treatment of these veterans is a disgrace.\u201d Conservative backbenchers have also called for action. Tom Tugendhat, the chair of the foreign affairs select committee, who previously served as a lieutenant colonel in Iraq and Afghanistan, said: \u201cThe difference in pay between heroes who fought side by side in our common struggle against tyranny is clearly wrong \u2026 The government should apologise.\u201d Andrew Mitchell, a former cabinet minister, said: \u201cThere will not be many elderly African soldiers who served the crown at that time still alive. But those who are should be compensated and given an apology.\u201d Richard Benyon, who sits on the intelligence and security committee of parliament, urged the government to \u201crecognise that discrimination on the grounds of ethnicity when [the wartime] experience was exactly the same was totally wrong\u201d. He added: \u201cGiven that it is a very small number of people left alive, some recognition of that wrong \u2013 both verbal and financial \u2013 should be made.\u201d During the war Britain recruited \u2013 in some cases forcibly \u2013 more than 600,000 African men from across the continent. They fought in some of the war\u2019s bloodiest campaigns, including Burma where they clashed with Japanese imperial forces in dense jungle and torrential rain, sustaining significant casualties. Among the survivors was Muchara Ntiba, a Kenyan veteran now aged 97. Remembering fierce combat in the far east, he said: \u201cBurma was tough. Bullets were just raining on us.\u201d He described corporal punishment at the hands of superiors, despite the British army officially having outlawed the practice decades earlier. \u201cWe would give them the palms of our hands to be beaten,\u201d he said. \u201cAfterwards, even an attempt to hold something would be hard.\u201d Ntiba, who still suffers with back pain from a wartime injury, is among the last surviving African veterans of his generation. \u201cWe put our lives in danger for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe British government did not listen to our demands. We got out with nothing.\u201d The Ministry of Defence said the UK \u201cremains indebted\u201d to African servicemen and women, but said that the soldiers involved were employed by their respective governments, not the UK Army, making it difficult to establish the full facts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
