Mr Jupp\u00e9, President Jacques Chirac's most loyal lieutenant and for long his chosen successor, was given an 18-month suspended sentence earlier this year and barred from elected office for 10 years for a political financing scandal involving a fake jobs scam at Paris town hall. On the first day of his appeal hearing, Mr Jupp\u00e9, who has resigned as an MP and head of Mr Chirac's centre-right party UMP to fight his case, said he did not claim to be above reproach. \"I have doubtless committed errors, even faults through negligence,\" he told the appeal court in Versailles. \"But in all conscience, I never had any intention of breaking the laws of the republic.\" He said he had been \"profoundly shocked\" by the verdict, and \"refused to believe\" its most severe finding, that he had \"betrayed the trust of the French people\". Prime minister from 1995 to 1997, Mr Jupp\u00e9 was accompanied yesterday by a new lawyer, Jean-Ren\u00e9 Farthouat, who succeeded last year in saving a former foreign minister from prison in a huge Elf corruption case. At his trial in January Mr Jupp\u00e9 angered the judges by insisting, in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary and confessions, that he had not been aware of the scam in which Paris town hall and private companies paid the salaries of up to 175 activists from the RPR party, the predecessor of the UMP. Mr Jupp\u00e9, who ran the town hall finances for most of the 18 years from 1977 to 1995 when Mr Chirac was mayor of Paris, and was also general secretary of the RPR between 1988 and 1993 when the scam was at its height, was suspected of overseeing the entire scheme. But he was charged only in connection with the hiring of seven full-time RPR staff who were paid by Paris taxpayers between 1990 and 1995. A member of his legal team said: \"At the original trial the position was pretty much, 'Move along now, there's nothing to get worked up about.' This time we will try and give explanations to the court and stress that this is not a question of morality but of the law.\" Mr Jupp\u00e9 continued to insist yesterday that the seven fake jobs for which he was charged were genuine town hall posts. \"I had no part in these people's recruitment,\" he told the court. \"As far as I was concerned, they were doing an effective job for Paris.\" But none of the seven involved actually had an office at the town hall, and one of them, Farida Cherkaoui, who was in charge of Mr Chirac's trips and visits, has told the police that she worked for the RPR. Mr Jupp\u00e9, who is appealing with five of the 21 other people convicted in January, apparently hopes that the court will either overturn his conviction, or at least reduce the length of time he is barred from elected office. Asked by the presiding judge whether he thought he should be acquitted, he replied: \"I hope to convince the court.\" His conviction was a serious blow to Mr Chirac, upsetting carefully laid plans for his succession. Some commentators now argue that even if he is acquitted, he has been so weakened that he can no longer be seen as a credible candidate, certainly not against the right's new hope, the ambitious and popular finance minister Nicolas Sarkozy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
