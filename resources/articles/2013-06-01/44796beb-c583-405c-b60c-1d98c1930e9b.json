It may not have been Mumbai after MS Dhoni had seen his side to the World Cup but it was a flag-waving, horn-honking, joyful celebration that would have gone on for a while. India deserved to win the Champions Trophy because they were demonstrably the best side in the tournament. They played adventurous, vibrant cricket, full of youthful enthusiasm and massive skill. Dhoni led the side with the absolute authority of the eminence grise he has become in the absence of the old guard and with a perception and awareness that should be the envy of all aspiring captains. In the general m\u00eal\u00e9e that followed their win, it was hard not to escape the irony that, when it came down to it, the competition that ICC does not want but which many have come to love over the past few weeks, was settled by a match of precisely the length that is usurping ODI cricket. To all intents and purposes this was a T20 match (just a few rule changes), played in near-subcontinental conditions (save for the temperature and rain), in front largely of an adoring Indian crowd. No wonder the experience of Dhoni's team in playing in the Indian Premier League is put forward as a reason for their success now. Lost in all this, however, is the fact that not only did England reach the final, they did so in the sort of conditions that least suit their game, yet still came within five runs of winning the match: indeed with just under three overs to go, when they needed 20 runs from 15 deliveries with six wickets in hand and two batsmen well set, they were clear favourites. Unquestionably England blew their chances away, undone by their own nerves and Dhoni's assured captaincy that so pressured them. Yet at first it appeared it was his pace bowler Ishant Sharma who had cracked and lost his way. With Eoin Morgan in the ascendant, Sharma was clobbered for six and then sent down two of the widest wides in attempting to bowl to an offside field. Morgan then eyed up the vacant legside spaces beyond the inner ring of fielders, attempted to fetch another delivery from outside off stump, but could only help it to midwicket. Bopara then pulled the next ball from above his eyeline to square-leg and in two deliveries the chase had been derailed. No one who left the ground after the final can believe themselves to have been shortchanged in having the reduced match. But ICC got away with things massively, avoiding by minutes the huge embarrassment of having one of its major trophies shared. Had the match not taken place, it would have been slaughtered. The sheer folly of not having a reserve day, at least for the final but also for the semi-finals, loomed large. This does not necessarily in itself guarantee a farce-free tournament (in 2002, India and Sri Lanka contested the final in Colombo over two days, with the unfinished match from the first day restarted as a new game on the second, neither of which was completed) but with sensible regulations, there would have been considerably less scrambling by the tournament's technical committee who nonetheless agreed to extend playing hours by an extra hour. Meanwhile, for all its apparent success here, the future of the Champions Trophy hangs in the balance. This was supposed to be its swan song, to be replaced next time around by a Test championship, something designed to give more context to, and enthusiasm for, Test cricket. That concept has already been put on the back burner, and there must be a chance that the Champions Trophy, once treated with some disdain as nothing more than a fund raiser for the ICC development fund, will survive. There is, though, the matter of the World Cup to consider, along with what is perceived as an increasing lack of interest in ODI cricket generally with the rise in popularity of T20. The World Cup, though, while more inclusive than this eight-team tournament, is also extraordinarily unwieldy, with more than 60 matches, played over five or six weeks. It is too long to sustain interest throughout. There is the probability that the 2019 World Cup will consist of 10 teams only (with pre-qualifying), who will play a straight round robin against one another, and semi-finals to follow. In the meantime the Champions Trophy 2013 has largely dodged the weather to provide an excellent tournament and, through it all, the most scintillating of all the matches as its finale. There will be some at the ICC who are breathing a lot easier."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
