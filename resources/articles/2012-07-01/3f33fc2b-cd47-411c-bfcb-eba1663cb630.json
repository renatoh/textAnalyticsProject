On Monday afternoon Murray plays the talented young Croatian Marin Cilic, who is seeded 16 . Curiously, they are on second on Court No1 despite Murray's curfew-busting heroics on Saturday night, which attracted 8m viewers, a phenomenal 41.3% of the available audience. The order of play committee announce their findings at the end of play after consulting the BBC's schedulers as well as representatives of the ATP and WTA, who feed in information from the locker room about healing time for injuries and, occasionally, personal requests. How odd, then, to ignore the chance to build on a bit of Murray fever. He loved it probably as much as those watching. \"When the roof comes on everyone gets really excited,\" he said. \"None of the noise gets lost, it stays in the stadium. The atmosphere at the end was incredible.\" The world No4 would probably be as happy to play on the roof as under it, or up and down Church Road, before midnight or at dawn, and there is an audience building for him, slowly but inexorably, to rival the fervour for the tournament's long-time darling, Tim Henman. Putting him on in the middle of the afternoon while giving the lunchtime slot to Roger Federer against the Belgian Xavier Malisse, ranked 45 in the world, and the early\u2011evening place to the all-Serb showdown between Novak Djokovic and Viktor Troicki, smacks of indifference, at best. All that said, Murray knows but dare not say he has been afforded a clearer path to the semi-finals than he had hoped for at the start of the first week \u2013 big stage or slightly smaller, roof or no roof. Ivan Lendl cautioned against hubris. \"When the draw came out, you could see there were no easy opponents,\" Murray's coach of six months said. \"[Nikolay] Davydenko knows how to play tennis, he has been three in the world. [Ivo] Karlovic has won big matches and he was averaging 119mph between his first and second serve; I don't think I hit a first serve ever that hard. Baghdatis is also a good player, former finalist of the Australian Open. To me, it doesn't matter who your opponent is, providing he knows how to play tennis. These days you have to be at your best.\" Murray will not get ahead of himself, either, but there is no point pretending he has not been gifted a considerable opening in the draw created by the here-then-gone-the-day-after Lukas Rosol against Rafael Nadal, whom Murray was destined to meet in the semi-finals. He also comes to the fourth round after three contrasting victories in different conditions that demanded all his talents. He did not flinch in any assignment, even though there were wobbles. Murray has to beat the rising Cilic \u2013 who endured the second longest match in Wimbledon history on Saturday when he took 5hr 31min accounting for the stubborn American Sam Querrey \u2013 but he has won without fuss four of the six times they have met (with a defeat at the 2009 US Open and a walkover win in the other two), and has been familiar with his game since their teenage days. \"We played each other growing up in the juniors,\" Murray said. \"I have known him for a long time. He had some knee surgery but has come back well. He had a long match with Querrey and I'm hoping he will be tired. But guys have come back from long matches before, like Novak in Australia this year.\" Murray was relieved the referee let his match with Baghdatis go past the 11pm deadline imposed for noise abatement by Merton council. \"Mentally it's nice to be through to the next round,\" he said. \"If we had stopped at 4-1, yes, I am in a great position but you never know what conditions will be like if I would have had to come back [to finish the match] on Monday. It could have been very windy, the sun may be in your eyes, or whatever.\" Putting aside the questionable \"sun in your eyes\" excuse, Murray seems relaxed, content and at the top of his game. He got up from three heavy falls and endured the embarrassment of his reserve service ball popping out of his pocket three times. As Andrew Castle remarked in the quickest witticism of the tournament: \"For a player who has made millions on tour, you'd think Andy would have deeper pockets.\" Beyond Cilic there is the likelihood of matches against Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro in the quarters, then Jo-Wilfried Tsonga. He is 5-1 against both the ninth-seeded Argentinian and Tsonga, seeded fifth. He is also playing better than both of them. \"[Cilic] and Andy had tough matches yesterday,\" Lendl said, \"and I'm glad they both finished, otherwise it would have played havoc with the schedule. Now let's give it our best and see if Andy can come out on top again.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
