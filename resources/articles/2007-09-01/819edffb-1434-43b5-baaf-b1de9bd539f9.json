Over the next few days, opinion polls are expected to show the first signs of an upturn in Tory fortunes after months of trailing badly behind Labour. All the parties have started to move into election planning mode, amid rumours the Prime Minister could decide to go to the polls as soon as next month. His senior aides were moving to dampen down election fever this weekend, insisting that a date next year was still preferred, but the speculation has seen a burst of activity in Tory ranks in preparation for any early campaign. Cameron will this week encourage his party's modernisers by shifting the stress onto social policy and away from the more traditional Conservative strong suits such as immigration and crime. A long-awaited report on health and education, co-chaired by the former Health Secretary Stephen Dorrell, will be published on Tuesday. It will focus on how the poorest children are most exposed to disease because public health measures are not being implemented effectively. It will also point out that a child born in Newcastle is twice as likely to die before its first birthday as a child born in Winchester. The Public Services Improvement report will also say that children growing up in areas with failing schools need financial help to flourish. New measures to build more social housing will also be included. Polls in recent months have shown Labour maintaining an eight- to 10-point lead over the Tories, with the Lib Dems languishing at about 16 per cent. But an Ipsos Mori poll last week for the Sun showed a five-point lead, with 41 per cent of people saying they would vote Labour, and 36 per cent saying Tory. Two further polls this week are expected to show that the gap is narrowing, with Labour just three to four points ahead. Cameron's messages about Britain's 'broken society' and his tougher lines on immigration and crime appear to have helped his standing. Cameron's aides said their latest policy review would be used to remind the country of his 'modernising' message. Education proposals include a plan to provide extra central government funding for schools linked to accepting disadvantaged pupils. In an article in today's Sunday Telegraph, the Tory leader launches a proposal to require poorly performing primary school pupils to re-sit their final year in order to reduce failures at secondary level. Later this month, another Tory policy group, the Quality of Life review, will call for a series of 'green taxes' and a moratorium on new airport runways in London and the South East. In an interview for today's GMTV Sunday Programme , John Redwood will say: 'Over the last 10 years, the big success area has been the colossal growth in business and financial services and you wouldn't be able to achieve that without sufficient airport capacity.' A short election campaign would make it possible for Labour to go to the polls as early as October. But the timing might not be advantageous, as the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC) in Lisbon takes place on 18 October, when the EU reform treaty will be debated. Brown is likely to face renewed calls for a referendum on the treaty at the conference. The government's spending review, setting out the targets for the next three years, is also due to be produced that week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
