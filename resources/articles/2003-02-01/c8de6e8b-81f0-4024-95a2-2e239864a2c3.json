YOU DON'T SAY... Contrary to the evidence that lands snugly in your inbox every weekday at 5pm (What?), the Fiver isn't one to blow its own trumpet. But today is different, and not merely because we're standing in the corner of the Big Top at the Circus of Dreams disguised as a medieval bugler. Cast your mind back to Tuesday's Fiver and the following prediction: \"We're saying Becks to Arsenal and these clowns [Manchester United] down within two seasons\". So you can imagine the back-slapping, glass-clinking scenes in the Fiver bunker when today's London's London Evening Standard reported that Dave the Bearded Lady could indeed be on his way to Highbury for GBP30m. Toot! Parp! Whole gamut of assorted comedy trumpet noises! No matter that the Standard is basing its story on quotes Dave gave to them a week ago. \"I always look out for the London clubs,\" he said at the time, waxing his hormone-replacement whiskers. \"There's a possibility I could play for a London club one day.\" But while Alec-oco the Clown's nose grew redder at the prospect of having no one to practise his hilarious custard-pie drop-kicks on, Arsene Wenger was shocked and appalled that a story probably leaked by one of his own men had come to this. \"There is nothing true about [the Beckham bid],\" he wrote feverishly on the club website. \"If we want to buy a player, we talk to the club first and ask if the player is available.\" Shaking his head sadly, Wenger added: \"People are just trying to take advantage of a story which has come out of United.\" The Fiver wasn't even too bothered when circus horse Ruud van Nistelrooy played down rumours of a fracas between the clowns and the facial-hair freaks in the Circus of Dreams. \"I don't think anybody in the team was worried about the headlines in the papers this week,\" he joked as his hoofs formed a figure of eight in mid-air. \"I don't think anybody thought about it for longer than two seconds.\" The Fiver wondered briefly about the attention spans of your average footballer-cum-circus-performer, then carried on trumpeting. Honk! Pfft! Gwark! We're not put off that easily! * * * * * * * * * * * * TORY LEADER IS OAF SHOCK Cosily tucked between unfunny comedian Ben Elton and failed author Richard Littlejohn in the Fiver's would-love-to-clout-repeatedly-with-a-shovel list lies those purveyors of halitosis-enhanced pomposity - our nation's politicians. God they make us sick. Fortunately, most of what they say flies, like a Ronaldinho shank over a ponytail, straight over our heads. Until today, that is, when useless Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith mistook Mackems for Geordies and gave the all-round general impression of being an oaf. It happened like this: Duncan Smith was addressing businessmen in the Rite-Vent flue factory (nope, that's too easy) in Sunderland, when he decided to praise Rir Sobby Bobson's team for their Big Cup win against Leverkusen. \"Let me almost immediately take the opportunity, as I am here in Newcastle,\" he started, his foot involuntarily twitching towards his braying mouth, \"to say congratulations to [S]obby [B]obson, a man I do genuinely personally admire, but also to the team.\" And IDS wasn't finished there. Oh no. \"I am sure you all want to say congratulations for their excellent result I understand they had on Tuesday,\" he added, taking out his spade and digging like an extra from Auf Weidersehn, Pet. \"I wish them well as they progress in [Big Cup] - as every Tottenham fan is bound to do, I am sure we will be joining them there next year.\" Hmm. Not the best, that's for sure. But if you reckon the other lot is any better, think again. After all, when Tony Blair first came into power he talked about sitting on the Gallowgate - when we all know the Gallowgate was a terrace. * * * * * * * * * * * * QUOTE OF THE DAY \"I threw a boot at George Mulhall [Bolton's coach]. He questioned my commitment, which was a rather dangerous thing to do right after a game when I played. The boot was just coming off and it went flying across the dressing room. He ducked out of the way, fortunately for him\" - In Big Sam Allardyce's playing day, men were men. * * * * * * * * * * * * REDEMPTION SONG Like a pimple-faced virgin saving himself for that special girl, Alpay, was prepared to bide his time. Any day now, he kept telling himself, that call would come through from a man with a comedy Spanish accent, offering to keep the lumbering Turk in the manner to which he'd recently grown accustomed. After all, Alpay was the star of the 2002 World Cup, everyone told him so. So his mind was made up. \"Aston Villa could have offered to make me the highest-paid player in the UK and I still wouldn't have signed a new contract,\" he harrumphed last August, pulling off the rare feat of stamping his feet and digging his heels in at the same time. Tragically, the call never came. Emerging from the Villa Park confessional booth this morning, friendly Father Graham Taylor smiled at a job well done. \"We have had a chat with Alpay,\" he smirked, \"and he has told me he wants to get another chance. Pausing only to remove a freshly-baked humble pie from the oven, Father Taylor had a word of advice. \"He knows he will have to fight his way back into the side,\" he warned. \"I have a degree of sympathy because, if I went to the World Cup at the age of 29 and was voted in the top 16, then I would have been susceptible to what everybody was telling me.\" As a forgiving man, Father Taylor shouldn't lay the blame at any man's door, but then neither should he reveal confessional secrets. \"Alpay was led to believe by advisors and agents that Barcelona and Real Madrid were coming in for him,\" he chuckled, hooking a finger into his mouth and reeling himself in. \"They were saying, 'we've got this move and that move for you, son' and they hadn't. All they did was unsettle him.\" At which point, Olof Mellberg's nose and, inevitably, his jumbo chin were shoved in on the action. \"Alpay is a great player and we worked very well together last season,\" he chirped, attaching his comedy flower to his tracksuit top and heading off in the gullible Turk's direction. * * * * * * * * * * * * THE RUMOUR MILL Fulham want Big Mick McCarthy to take over in the summer. Robbie Earle is being lined up as the new chairman of Port Vale. Everton are rather keen on Ipswich's 19-year-old striker Darren Bent. * * * * * * * * * * * * NEWS IN BRIEF The PFA will demand a transfer embargo be slapped on Derby County if they fail to settle their pay dispute with Craig Burley. He claims he is owed \u00a3200,000. Leeds United's FA Cup quarter-final at Sheffield United on March 9 will be shown live on Sky Sports, with an 11.30am kick off. Fulham are waiting to discover the extent of the hamstring injury suffered by Alain Goma in last night's win over West Brom. Assistant boss Christian Damiano said: \"He has a muscular problem and we'll have to wait to see the medical staff.\" * * * * * * * * * * * * TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Five: Auxerre v Liverpool (7.35pm) We didn't just ask you for your stories of engagements, stag parties and weddings that went horribly wrong. We pleaded for them. But a night spent on our knees (grow up) has paid off. \"I have a wedding story for you!\" exclaims Nick Burcher. Jonathan Pearce's Football Night (12.25am) \"It features a bleeding bride, the instrumental version of Billie Jean at the wrong speed and a ruined wedding arch.\" Nothing unusual in that you might think... Auxerre v Liverpool for insomniacs (1.05am) \"My story concerns the wedding of Ros and Dave. I was an usher and also responsible for sorting out (and DJ-ing) at the disco, though this does not directly contribute to the events that followed.\" Get on with it, man! Dutch Football (2.35am) \"The evening went really well until a man who we shall call 'Primal Will' got involved. We were getting to the end of the evening and I put the last song on. Dave's new bride needed some fresh air and Dave took her (looking resplendent in her wedding dress) outside. Argentinian Football (4.05am) \"Ros was about to be ill and was bending over when Will went out to see if she was OK. He bent down to speak to her, drunkenly misjudged the distance (he'd been on turbo shandy's all evening) and accidentally connected his forehead with her nose - giving her quite a big nosebleed. Sky Sports 1: Football League Review (8pm, 11pm) \"I went outside to see what was going on and saw Will looking sheepish and drunkenly trying to explain that he didn't mean it. At this point he went back inside. The last song finished - and then from outside we heard something else start up.\" Spanish Football League Review (12am) \"I raced inside and found Will looking very pleased with himself and lots of people moving round the dance floor in slow motion. Instrumental version of Billie Jean at the wrong speed.\" British Eurosport: Euro Vase highlights (9.45pm) \"As the bride and groom went off for their evening together everyone formed the traditional arch. We put on Enrique Iglesias 'Hero' (he could be her hero, all very romantic) and Dave and Ros (with her head tilted back and tissue paper up her nose) proceeded up the arch.\" Radio 5: Sport on 5 with Ian Payne (7pm) \"I was waiting at the end for them. Halfway through the song the music suddenly changed. Primal Scream 'Moving On Up' came on at three times the volume of Hero.\" TalkSport: Football First (7pm) \"All Will could offer by way of explanation was a meek 'But everybody likes Primal Scream'.\" Newstalk 106: Off the Ball with Ger Gilroy (7pm) Well that story rather petered out, didn't it? The.boss@theguardian.com is sure that you can do better. We'll even open it up to bah mitzvahs, christenings and funerals too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
