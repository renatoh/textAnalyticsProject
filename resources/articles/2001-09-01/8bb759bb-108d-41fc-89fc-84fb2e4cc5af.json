Anxious investors were switching from shares to government bonds which yesterday hit levels last seen almost two years ago. The bond markets were also helped by mounting expectations that official interest rates around the world would be cut in response to the situation - a view that also increased demand for sophisticated derivative instruments. There were reports, however, that government bonds were regarded as too risky by some investors who were taking their money out of the markets entirely. Traders, many of whom left their desks in the City early, said much of the trading in bonds was a knee-jerk reaction to events in the United States. Philip Shaw, economist at Investec in London, told Reuters: \"Everyone is stunned. There is total chaos in the market. \"Apart from the knee-jerk reaction of selling equities and buying bonds, the market doesn't know where to go and how far to push prices.\" Shorter-dated bonds issued by the German government were among the most popular instruments. But traders warned that it was difficult to know how bonds would trade today if the US market reopens as expected. The absence of the big US investment banks - most of which were unable to trade from the their New York offices yesterday - was also regarded as influential. Traders said that the market in any bonds other than those issued by governments was more or less closed. Prices of bonds are inversely rated to their yield, so a fall in yield indicates a higher price for the bond. Government bonds saw their yields fall almost to two-year lows yesterday. The shortest dated bonds suffered the biggest falls in yields, a reflection of the concern in the market."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
