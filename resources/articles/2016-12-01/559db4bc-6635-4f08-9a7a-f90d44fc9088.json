South Australians will have $150 a year added to household bills, Victorian power bills will rise by $99, a typical New South Wales consumer will pay an extra $74 a year for their electricity, while Queenslanders will pay an extra $28, due to to the upcoming closure of Australia\u2019s cheapest \u2013 and most polluting \u2013 power generator. The Australian Energy Market Commission 2016 residential electricity price trends report found wholesale energy prices would jump 36% with the planned shutdown of Hazelwood in March. \u201cAcross the national electricity market the generation mix is changing \u2013 with the large-scale renewable energy target leading to substantial investment in wind generation,\u201d the commission\u2019s chairman, John Pierce, said on Tuesday. \u201cThis is contributing to the closure of coal-fired plants and increasing wholesale and retail prices.\u201d The federal energy minister, Josh Frydenberg, said the government was trying to keep prices down while maintaining energy security. Frydenberg said an increase in coal royalties in Victoria and an increased renewable energy target had forced Hazelwood\u2019s French owners Engie to shut the plant down. But the Victorian minister for energy and climate change, Lily D\u2019Ambrosio, said the federal government\u2019s lack of leadership on energy policy was to blame for the price rises. \u201cEverybody is sick of the lack of leadership and silly political games being played by the commonwealth, let\u2019s get on with it and do what we were elected to do,\u201d D\u2019Ambrosio said. D\u2019Ambrosio told ABC News 24 that while the report showed there would be initial price rises with the closure of Hazelwood, it also showed prices would moderate as more renewable energy came online. \u201cMore renewable energy actually puts downwards pressure on power prices for families and businesses,\u201d she said. In November, the chief executive of Engie Australia, Alex Keisser, said the 50-year-old Hazelwood plant was \u201cno longer economic to operate\u201d. \u201cEngie in Australia would need to invest many hundreds of millions of dollars to ensure viable and, most importantly, continued safe operation,\u201d Kesser said at the time. \u201cGiven current and forecast market conditions, that level of investment cannot be justified.\u201d The AEMC report also noted that electricity prices would be affected by the price for gas through gas-fired power stations, and was expected to play a larger role in the market in the future. \u201cAny future increase in the price of gas will result in higher input costs for generators, flowing through to higher costs in the wholesale electricity market,\u201d Pierce said. For 2016-17, the total average bill for the year is estimated to be $1,353 \u2014 a 4.4% increase from the year before. The Council of Australian Governments energy council will meet in Melbourne on Wednesday to look at regulations around new interconnectors, and efforts to ensure cheaper gas supplies. \u2022 Australian Associated Press contributed to this report"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
