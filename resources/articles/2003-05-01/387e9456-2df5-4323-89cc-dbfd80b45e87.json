You have been studying Macbeth for a couple of months for a test that you know is important. For the last few weeks your teacher has been making you think about the Macbeths. \"Are they all bad?\" she has asked. You've looked at the scenes. You've seen how the characters change. Lady Macbeth - seemingly a \"fiend-like queen\" at first, willing to dash the brains out of her babies, goes mad, perhaps with the guilt of it all. And Macbeth. Was he bad at first? Was he really a \"bloody butcher\" at the end, or more of a tragic figure? You've thought hard about these questions, revised thoroughly and can remember all the quotations. You are in the exam hall. It's Friday morning. The week of KS3 tests is nearly over. You open the paper and read the question, and, apart from the name in the first sentence, \"No one in real life wants to meet a villain like Macbeth\", it has nothing to do with Shakespeare at all. What are you supposed to do? The question goes on to ask pupils to contribute to a book taking a light-hearted look at fictional villains. Those who had studied Twelfth Night were asked to write about fashion on the basis that \"In Twelfth Night, what the characters wear and how they look affects the ways other characters look at them\". And those who had examined Henry V were asked to give a motivational pep talk - shades of Hal stirring the troops. The effect of these new, so-called \"writing tasks\" on the Shakespeare paper was to cause confusion and despair in exam halls across the land. Introduced this autumn and seen for the first time by schools in November, the new Shakespeare paper was met with howls of protest. In previous years the whole paper was dedicated to Shake speare. This year over half the marks are awarded for a writing task that appears first on the paper. Yet while pundits bemoaned the dumbing down of the bard, and mocked the feeble connections that the writing tasks made with the plays, no one had really considered the effects the new test would have on the pupils themselves. In the main it seems to have been somewhere between outrage and disbelief. I happened to be in a school in Hertfordshire as they were finishing the test. The teachers told of the extreme confusion that ensued when the tests began. The main problem seemed to be that despite having been told that the writing task would have nothing to do with Shakespeare, when the pupils turned over the exam paper they just couldn't believe it. In the end half the pupils wrote about the Macbeths anyway but on emerging from the exam hall panicked when others said they were wrong and should have written about anyone but the Thane of Cawdor and his wife. The pattern was the same in the central London school I visited in the afternoon and at the comprehensive of a deputy head I spoke to that evening. His pupils had been studying Twelfth Night. He described the manner in which his year 9 class erupted from the exam room to find him. \"All that Shakespeare,\" one reportedly exploded, \"And they just asked me about fashion. It was an insult to my intelligence. How was I supposed to write all that stuff about masks and dual identity?\" Another apparently complained, \"Do they think we're stupid or something?\" Now it is true that English teachers should have prepared pupils for the fact that half the English paper had nothing to do with Shakespeare. But give an English teacher Macbeth or Henry V and inevitably that is what they will concentrate on. It's where their passion lies. So although, undoubtedly, they told their pupils about the oddity of the paper, and had almost certainly given them the only other version of the exam that exists for the mocks, the play will have been the thing. And that is how it should be. As a teacher from Oldham wrote, in the fierce email correspondence that took off after the exams: \"The examinations officer and head of year 9 came to find me 20 minutes into the Shakespeare paper because some children were confused and one was even in tears: although we'd done our best to explain the format of the Shakespeare paper to the pupils beforehand, the invigilators were being asked over and over to explain what the writing task had to do with Shakespeare - and of course they didn't know, because it didn't have anything to do with Shakespeare. It was a disgrace . . . One child was so determined to make a link that she attempted to answer the writing question in Shakespearean language.\" At GCSE, this teacher's pupils will study Shakespeare through coursework and, if they can face it, through coursework again at A-level. Only at 14 do we insist on examining his plays in a timed test and a very poor test at that. Charles Clarke should screw his courage to the sticking place and change it. \u00b7 Dr Bethan Marshall is a lecturer in education at King's College, London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
