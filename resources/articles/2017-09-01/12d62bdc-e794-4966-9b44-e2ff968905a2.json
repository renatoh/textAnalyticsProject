The baby-faced forward spent last season on loan at Real Betis but has been forced to sit by patiently for a Chelsea debut ever since arriving at the club as a 15-year-old in 2012. A brilliant performance capped by the third goal as Michy Batshuayi also scored a hat-trick in this thrashing of a poor visiting side ensured it was worth the wait. \u201cI think Charly played very well,\u201d the Chelsea manager, Antonio Conte, said. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to work a lot to improve his physical impact with this league. Don\u2019t forget this league is very strong in the physical aspect. We are working a lot with Charly in this aspect to be ready to play in this league. For sure, he\u2019s a talented player, and he has to continue in this way. When there is the opportunity, the chance, to help us, he must do this.\u201d On the 13th anniversary of Brian Clough\u2019s death, the Chelsea pitch announcer had paid tribute to the man who led Forest to two successive European Cups before the match. But this powderpuff display in a competition Clough won four times was a reminder of how far they have fallen, having now failed to reach the fourth round since the year Old Big \u2019Ead passed away. Watched from the stands by their owner, Evangelos Marinakis, the Forest manager, Mark Warburton, made eight changes from the side that lost at home to Wolverhampton Wanderers on Saturday to leave them 10th in the Championship. Conte went one better, as only Gary Cahill and Cesc F\u00e0bregas retained their places after the stalemate against Arsenal at the weekend. Hazard formed an all-Belgian frontline alongside Batshuayi and the 20-year-old Musonda, one of four brothers to have passed through Chelsea\u2019s academy and the son of a former Zambia midfielder, also called Charly. But it was one of Chelsea\u2019s less vaunted prospects who opened the scoring in the 12th minute, as Kenedy \u2013 making his first appearance since being sent home from the pre-season tour to China \u2013 timed his run perfectly to meet Antonio R\u00fcdiger\u2019s deep cross at the back post to volley home. Batshuayi made it 2-0 six minutes later when Hazard\u2019s clever through ball from the edge of the area found its way to his feet via a deflection. A curling free-kick from the impressive Everton loanee Kieran Dowell that cannoned off the bar was the best Forest could muster in response, before Musonda effectively ended the tie five minutes before half-time as he drilled home F\u00e0bregas\u2019s pass from a tight angle before celebrating his goal with a full swan dive in front of the West stand. Chelsea picked up where they had left off after the break, with Hazard setting up Batshuayi for his second of the evening after a glorious long pass from F\u00e0bregas. The Spaniard then made way for the 17-year-old Ethan Ampadu, who joined from Exeter City in the summer having broken Cliff Bastin\u2019s record as the youngest player in the club\u2019s history, to make his debut. Another versatile teenager, Dujon Sterling, was also handed a late cameo at right wing-back for Chelsea as Forest attempted to salvage some pride, which eventually came via the last kick of the game from the substitute Tendayi Darikwa after Batshuayi had completed his hat-trick. But the night belonged to Musonda."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
