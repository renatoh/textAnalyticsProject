Sites like Friendster, Orkut and Ryze connect individuals with similar interests, and it is the opportunity for business as much as social advancement that is fuelling their popularity. For those at the start of their career, however, most networking activity is upwards not sideways - yet good networking skills are vital in a competitive job market. Odd, then, that they are in such short supply among graduates. New research from graduate publisher Hobsons finds networking at the bottom of a list of skills, with barely a quarter of respondents claiming to be good at it. But according to Benjamin Wright, co-author of Turn Your Degree into a Career (How To Books), fear of networking is not justified. \"I would define it as simply making contact with other people, then forming relationships,\" he says. \"It's not a dark art really - most of us do it. The key to doing it well is to ensure you brand yourself effectively within your network, and learn the tricks that will reinforce and develop it.\" For Benjamin, a high level of personal reputation management is important. So if you want to project yourself as someone with an interest in a particular field, ensure the image stays consistent. He cites the \"Farley File\" approach as a good one for networkers - James Farley was a US politician who kept notes on everyone he met so that when he met them again he had a head-start in resuming the relationship. \"Read trade journals relevant to the industry you are interested in, and note down the names of industry figures and their areas of interest. Then you can approach them for advice and refer to what you know about them. \"People don't always like being asked directly for a job; they're more likely to help if you show an interest in them.\" That principle applies online, according to personal branding consultant Gabriella Goddard. She says because new graduates don't yet have the \"street cred\" of a professional, they have an extra incentive to get a networking strategy right. Using the web to network means locating relevant discussion forums, lurking a bit, then starting to contribute, while staying consistent and professional throughout. \"Online etiquette dictates you don't sell yourself too hard,\" she says. \"People will see through that. Ensure your contributions are well written and high-quality - online, people only have your writing on which to make a judgement.\" When it comes to the real-time networking, good social skills are highly desirable. But if some of us are more naturally sociable than others, there are techniques that can be learned. \"First impressions count, so wear what you feel comfortable in but look appropriate for the setting,\" advises Gabriella. \"Communicating with strangers can be quite daunting, so think of the event as a big wedding. Set yourself a target of three people to talk to and use open-ended questions to show interest and keep the conversation flowing.\" Gabriella suggests the best preparation for professional networking is to start during uni versity. One form of academic networking opportunity on the increase is alumni services. At Warwick University, the graduate's association funds events which bring together alumni and current students. Gill Frigerio, manager of careers education and guidance at the university, says: \"Students find it so much more inspiring to talk to alumni than to read the results of alumni surveys. The events are particularly useful for showing career paths to those students studying less vocational degree courses.\" Trade associations represent another source of networking for graduates who know the industry in which they want to work. The Institute of Charted Accountants takes a proactive stance to graduate recruitment; it holds events at a number of universities, offering students the chance to meet representatives from accounting firms of all sizes. According to Louise Humphries, marketing manager for student recruitment and promotion: \"Graduate recruitment officers, or HR managers, usually bring along trainees to talk to students. This works well because the audience can more readily identify with peers and aspire to what they have achieved.\" By contrast, the Market Research Society aims to promote the research industry to graduates through R-Net, a networking group for new researchers launched last September. R-Net provides access to professional development opportunities in a informal environment and is already open to non-members from other related disciplines, such as marketing and PR. Carol Curran, head of membership and marketing services, says: \"There's a strong impetus for us to market the industry to undergraduates, because it's difficult for people outside to find out about research practice. \"It's always been very much a graduate-led profession and networking opportunities allow for better communication of what's involved.\" \"Old adage it may be, but 'It's not what you know, it's who you know' has never been truer.\" \u00b7jon@thenub.net"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
