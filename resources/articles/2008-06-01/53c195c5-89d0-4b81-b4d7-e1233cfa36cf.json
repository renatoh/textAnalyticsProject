And spurred on by the groundbreaking advances of the 90s, it is becoming big business. From tomorrow, you can have your own stake in it, too - if you have at least \u00a350,000 to spare. US company BioArts International is holding a global auction for five \"dog-cloning service slots\" whereby they will provide these wealthy dog owners with a carbon copy of their pampered pooch. Bringing cloning into the classroom provides wonderful opportunities for combining scientific, creative and ethical study - introducing cutting-edge science, posing knotty questions with no easy answers and allowing leaps of imagination into the unknown world of the future. The lottery of life Understanding cloning means understanding reproduction and the difference between sexual and asexual reproduction. The American biologist George C Williams likened it to a lottery: asexual reproduction means many tickets all with the same number, so reducing the chance of success (or survival), whereas sexual reproduction means fewer tickets, but with a variety of numbers, thereby increasing the chances of success. Wikipedia provides the nitty-gritty facts (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reproduction). Encourage students to research the pros and cons of both types of reproduction. Cloning leaves us equally intrigued and uneasy. A recent Food Standards Agency report revealed that consumers are strongly against eating cloned meat (www.theguardian.com/science/2008/jun/06/foodtech.food). However, cloning is a fact of life and occurs all around us. Gardeners are experts, making plant clones through leaf or root cuttings, and various creatures and creepy-crawlies reproduce asexually through their own version of cloning. But with more \"advanced\" animals, even after the breakthrough that brought us Dolly the sheep just over 10 years ago, it is still a precarious process. Students can investigate an interactive cloning timeline on the Clone Zone (http://learn.genetics.utah.edu/units/cloning/clonezone), as well as reading a useful outline on How Stuff Works (www.howstuffworks.com/cloning.htm). Ask them to create a presentation introducing and explaining cloning, perhaps using PowerPoint. Scientists have different interests in cloning, including medical advances, husbandry and restoring endangered/extinct species. For Best Friends Again, as the dog auction project is called, it's money. They may be offering a free Willy Wonka-style golden clone ticket, but the auction seems to be aimed at doting dog owners - with pots of money. Ask students to analyse the project's website for evidence of who it is aimed at and the persuasive techniques used (http://bestfriendsagain.com). The first-ever cloned pet was Little Nicky, a cat. Read an article on Little Nicky (www.livescience.com/animals/cloned_cat_041224.html), and encourage students to consider the ethical considerations of cloning. Is it right, for example, for rich pet owners to be able to spend tens of thousands of pounds on replacing a pet, when thousands of strays are killed for want of a home? Read the article, then debate the merits or otherwise of cloning pets. You might hold a vote on which reason gains most favour with the class as a whole. Move on to considering whether it is acceptable to use cloning to bring extinct species back to life. Show students some 1930s film footage of the thylacine (www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEdcMjcFASA) and let them find out more about it at www.oum.ox.ac.uk/thezone/animals/extinct/tiger.htm. Better known as the Tasmanian tiger or Tasmanian wolf, the last known example of this large carnivorous Australian marsupial died in Hobart Zoo in 1936. A glimmer of hope that the \"Tassie\" might breathe again has emerged with the recent news that scientists have brought a fragment of its DNA back to life in a mouse (http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/7408840.stm). Extinction Take students back in time by asking them to research an extinct animal such as the auroch, the passenger pigeon or the dodo from those listed at www.extinctanimal.com. Once they have dug up their facts, challenge them to recreate the animals, perhaps in the form of their own model or picture display. Finally, ask them to bring their animal to life in writing. In his short story about time travel called A Sound of Thunder, Ray Bradbury paints an exquisite picture of a living, breathing, terrifying Tyrannosaurus rex. Read Bradbury's description (www.scaryforkids.com/a-sound-of-thunder) and challenge students to portray the same sort of illuminating detail about their extinct creature. \u00b7 Teachers and students will find a complete lesson pack on cloning on the Guardian's news site for schools, www.learnnewsdesk.co.uk.
