Klopp was the opposing manager when Lovren made his home debut for Liverpool in August 2014 and excelled in a 4-0 friendly win over Borussia Dortmund. However, the \u00a320m recruit from Southampton has struggled to recreate that dominant form or secure a regular first-team place since then under competition from Sakho. Lovren is set for an extended run in the Liverpool side because the France international is sidelined for six to eight weeks with knee ligament damage. Before Saturday\u2019s visit to Manchester City the Liverpool manager has cited that pre-season friendly as evidence of the level the Croatia international can achieve. \u201cWith Dejan there will be absolutely no problem,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cThese two guys [Martin Skrtel and Lovren] are healthy and so everything is good. Dejan has done a really good job since I\u2019ve come in here. \u201cI saw his first game for Liverpool \u2013 it was against Dortmund when we lost by four. He was brilliant on that day. I\u2019d heard not the best things about him since but during my time here he\u2019s looked strong and everything is OK. As long as these two guys are feeling good then we don\u2019t have a big problem and Mamadou is not 20 weeks out; it will be earlier than that so that\u2019s good for us too.\u201d Klopp admits he is still evaluating the players he inherited from Brendan Rodgers and, despite being linked with a host of January signings, needs more time to decide who is, and who is not, wanted for the long term. The Liverpool manager said: \u201cTo make a final judgment on the players I need much more time. I know about the business. We will have possibilities to change some things in January and in the summer but in this moment we have made no decisions because we don\u2019t have to make them yet. We have time and we will see what is possible and what is not possible. We will see what\u2019s necessary and what\u2019s not necessary, that\u2019s how we work. \u201cThe players know that at one point in the season you have to make a decision about them. We are at a time when they can present positive arguments and say: \u2018OK, we want to work together\u2019. I don\u2019t need to say this to them, they know it. In this moment we have made no decisions so I have time to judge.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
