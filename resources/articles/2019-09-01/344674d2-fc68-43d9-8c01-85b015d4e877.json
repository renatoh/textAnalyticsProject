The eighth-seeded American won nearly 80% of her first-serve points, hit twice as many winners (38) as unforced errors (19), faced only three break points and overcame an second-set injury scare over 92 minutes of baseline war with the big-serving Croat, advancing to the quarter-finals at Flushing Meadows for the 16th time in her career and 11th straight in as many appearances. A nervy start on both ends saw Williams then Martic broken in their opening service games before trading holds deep into the set. Then in the eighth game Williams hit a couple of screaming forehand crosscourt winners on Martic\u2019s serve followed by a punishing backhand winner from the baseline to break the No 22 seed, consolidating it with a hold from love-30 and 15-40 down to take the opening set \u2013 the last break points she\u2019d face on the day. With Martic serving at 2-3, 15-30 in the second, Williams rolled her ankle on a net approach and took a nasty spill to the cement, making an advance call for the trainer after gingerly making it to her feet. She managed to win the next two points, sealing the first break of the set with a clean volley winner that wrong-footed Martic, before receiving treatment during a three-minute medical timeout. But unlike her shock Australian Open loss to Karol\u00edna Pl\u00ed\u0161kov\u00e1 when her game went to pieces after an ankle injury holding match point at 5-1, 40-30 lead in the deciding set, Williams landed the plane on Sunday in drama-free fashion. Serving at 3-4, Martic fought off four break points but Williams converted the fifth with a deft forehand volley winner at the net for a double-break advantage. Seven minutes later, the American painted the center service line with a 118mph ace on match point \u2013 her fastest of the afternoon \u2013 and raised both arms skyward in triumph amid roars from the Arthur Ashe Stadium crowd. \u201cI usually know if it\u2019s horrible early on,\u201d Williams said of the injury. \u201cI had a really bad ankle sprain in January. I was like, instantly, \u2018No, this can\u2019t happen. I\u2019m finally healthy.\u2019 But I\u2019ll see tomorrow. So far I\u2019m good.\u201d She added: \u201cI feel fine right now physically, and obviously my state is super intense. I\u2019m always incredibly intense. Just trying to keep moving forward.\u201d The six-time US Open champion advances to a quarter-final clash on Tuesday with China\u2019s Qiang Wang, who shocked No 2 seed Ashleigh Barty in straight sets earlier on Sunday. Barty was soon joined by the third-seeded Pliskova, who went down to Jo Konta in a three-set thriller. Both top seeds are on Williams\u2019 half of the draw, but the prospect of a clearer path to a 10th final here failed to move the needle with the 37-year-old. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to look at it that way,\u201d Williams said. \u201cEvery single match I have played, people come and they play their best. The women that I play are not generally playing at this level against other players in the locker room, so for me, I have to be the greatest whether it\u2019s against the second seed, the No 1 seed, or the 80th player in the world. I have to show up or else I\u2019m going to go home.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
