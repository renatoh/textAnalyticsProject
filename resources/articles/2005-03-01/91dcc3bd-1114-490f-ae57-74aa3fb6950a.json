Michael Sullivan, a former BBC and Sky News correspondent, says he was in the newsroom the day Mr Thompson sunk his teeth into the young Mr Massey's forearm. And according to him, it was not just a symptom of the macho atmosphere that was typical of many newsrooms at the time. \"It was not horse play or high-jinks. It was exactly as Massey said - after the morning meeting, he sat down at his desk. I happened to be casually looking in his direction - Massey was a junior at the time, working on the input desk which organises the camera crews. Suddenly Thompson turned on him and did exactly what Massey said and sank his teeth into him. \"There was no comradely, joking expression on his face,\" Mr Sullivan told MediaGuardian.co.uk. His account of the incident 17 years ago tallies with Mr Massey's colourful email recounting the incident in 1988. At the time Mr Thompson was an ambitious young executive who had been hand chosen by the then director general John Birt and destined for great things. The BBC yesterday played down the incident, which has been the subject of frenzied gossip within the BBC this week as the story was passed around by email, as \"high jinks and horseplay\". Mr Sullivan says he remembers talking to Mr Massey at the time and encouraging him to make a complaint. He says Mr Thompson's behaviour at the time was robust. The story emerged because Jeremy Paxman, the Newsnight presenter, was preparing to interview Mr Thompson for an internal BBC event and emailed the producer to ask if the incident - the subject of apocryphal tales in the corporation's newsroom - really happened. The producer, Mr Massey, replied in florid terms. \"It was late summer or early autumn of 1988 when he [Thompson] was the newly appointed editor of the Nine O'Clock News, and I was a Home News Organiser. It was 9.15 in the morning, in the middle of the old sixth floor newsroom. \"I went up to his desk to talk about some story after the 9.00 meeting we used to have then. I was standing next to him on his right, and he was sitting reading his horoscope in the Daily Star (I always remember that detail). \"Before I could say a word he suddenly turned, snarled, and sank his teeth into my left upper arm (leaving marks through the shirt, but not drawing blood). It hurt. I pulled my arm out of his jaws, like a stick out of the jaws of a labrador.\" Massey told his then boss, Chris Cramer, now a senior CNN executive, that he wanted to \"bring the whole BBC disciplinary process\" against Mr Thompson, but the incident \"lost momentum\" when Mr Massey was sent on a month-long assignment abroad. Yesterday Mr Massey was refusing to comment: \"I'm afraid I cannot help.\" But the BBC, concerned that it might be seen to victimise the producer for what it admitted was \"just gossip\" that was never intended for publication, said there would be no recriminations and that Mr Massey was expected to turn up for work as normal last night. After speaking to Mr Thompson, a BBC spokesman confirmed there had been an incident, but attempted to play down the story. \"There was an incident 17 years ago when Mark was editor of the Nine O'Clock News. Mark would have been about 30. There was a pretty robust atmosphere in the newsroom then. There was a lot of horseplay. People can recollect there were rows about allocation of camera crews. \"There was some high jinks going on and Mark leant forward and did something like a biting gesture. He thought it would be quite funny and it would defuse things but clearly it was hugely misinterpreted. \"Then he walked off, thinking nothing of it. Somebody went up to Mark and said that Anthony had taken it the wrong way. Mark apologised. \"Our view is that it was a long time ago, there was an apology at the time, and it was high jinks and horseplay.\" \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
