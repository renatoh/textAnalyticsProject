The underlying cause of the destruction was a derecho, a weather phenomenon that typically produces a row of storms spanning at least 100 miles. Unlike cyclones and hurricanes, which rotate, a derecho blows in a straight line. The August derecho blasted almost 800 miles across parts of Nebraska, South Dakota, and Iowa. Many homes were destroyed, especially in the town of Cedar Rapids, in which 90% of the buildings were damaged. Half a million people were without electricity in the immediate aftermath. In financial terms, the worst damage was to millions of hectares of growing corn and soybeans. Such powerful hail accompanied the wind in many places that a local climatologist compared it to machine-gun fire. The storm struck just as the crops were approaching maturity and the heavily laden plants were flattened. More than 300,000 hectares of harvest were lost. Destructive as it was, the midwest derecho was not the most expensive weather event in the US this year. Hurricane Laura, which struck Louisiana in August, caused about $14bn in damage."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
