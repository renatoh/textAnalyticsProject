Some rather more colourful expletives can be expected should Sunderland stumble again when Aston Villa visit the Stadium of Light on Saturday. \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest game of the season, so we mustn\u2019t fail miserably again,\u201d says Allardyce. \u201cThe last time we faced a big game [the 1-0 home defeat against Watford] we failed miserably, so we must hold our nerve against Villa. We have to make sure we win.\u201d The consensus is that R\u00e9mi Garde has virtually no hope of keeping bottom-placed Villa in the Premier League, but 19th-placed Sunderland have only four more points and look in danger of becoming cut off from the rest of the table. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to become proactive,\u201d says Allardyce who, shocked by certain players\u2019 haziness about basic defensive positioning, has resorted to some \u201cboringly\u201d repetitious training sessions. \u201cVilla will probably sit in and play on the counterattack. They\u2019ll try and frustrate us, so we\u2019ve got to make sure we take control of the game and break them down. We have 12 points and I think we\u2019ll need 38 to stay up. It\u2019s all about holding your nerve.\u201d Michael Gray, a former Sunderland left-back, has branded his old side \u201cmid-table Championship\u201d calibre, but Allardyce is adamant the survival quest is not a forlorn cause. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if I didn\u2019t think I could keep us up,\u201d insists Dick Advocaat\u2019s successor. \u201cIf that was the case I might as well pack my bags now. But we have to be more consistent. I see some very good performances and then I see some very poor ones from the same players. That\u2019s got to be cut out \u2013 and quickly.\u201d Sunderland\u2019s manager talks, rather wistfully, about wanting his team \u201cto be more like Watford\u201d, but it is only just over four years since Martin O\u2019Neill succeeded Steve Bruce on Wearside and immediately revealed a very different template. \u201cI want to see us playing like Barcelona,\u201d he told supporters. Back then many season ticket-holders still bought into the former chairman Niall Quinn\u2019s talk of embarking on \u201ca magic carpet ride\u201d, but a subsequent series of relegation skirmishes under O\u2019Neill, Paolo Di Canio, Gus Poyet and Advocaat has left locals grateful for small mercies. Along the way a director of football system was introduced and then scrapped by Ellis Short, the owner. But player recruitment remained almost uniformly poor. Other constants include frequent defeats against almost anyone except Newcastle \u2013 Sunderland have beaten their local rivals six times in succession \u2013 and the extraordinary loyalty of a crowd averaging well over 40,000. That startling run of success against Newcastle is suggestive of a team which can rouse itself when it matters \u2013 a suspicion borne out by the conclusions of the past two seasons. Once Advocaat replaced Poyet last spring Sunderland survived thanks to three wins and three draws in their final nine games, while a year earlier they managed four victories and a draw in their closing six fixtures. Considering that run featured wins at Chelsea and Manchester United, Poyet dubbed their great escape \u201ca miracle\u201d. He did not exaggerate; two years ago Sunderland became only the second team to escape relegation from the Premier League after being bottom on Christmas Day. By new year 2014, though, they had collected 14 points, two more than Allardyce\u2019s team now. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to start winning \u2013 and quickly,\u201d says a man who, having experimented with five at the back and variations of 4-3-3, is tempted to switch to a 4-4-2 configuration which would enable him to pair Jermain Defoe with Steven Fletcher in attack. \u201cI\u2019ve told the players they can\u2019t depend on another last-minute escape; there\u2019s unlikely to be another miracle.\u201d It does not help that Lee Cattermole is struggling with the after-effects of a back problem. The combative, influential midfielder has started every game in which Sunderland have accrued points this season but by the second half of Wednesday\u2019s 1-0 home defeat against Liverpool he seemed barely able to jog. With a trip to Swansea and a visit from Bournemouth beckoning, January could prove a watershed month for the top tier\u2019s eighth-best remunerated squad, but Allardyce\u2019s hopes of introducing new faces are hampered by Short\u2019s understandable insistence that new signings agree contracts containing clauses triggering 50% wage reductions in the event of relegation. More immediately, assorted injuries dictate that Sunderland must once again rely on the 36-year-old, increasingly creaky-kneed Wes Brown at centre-half. \u201cI treat every game now as if it\u2019s my last, so I\u2019m more than up for Villa,\u201d says the former England defender. \u201cIt\u2019s a game we can\u2019t lose. We\u2019re way off safety but beating Villa would be a big step forward.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
