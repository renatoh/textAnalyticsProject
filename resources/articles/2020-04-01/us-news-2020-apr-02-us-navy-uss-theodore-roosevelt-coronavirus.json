Thomas Modly, the acting secretary of the navy, said that Captain Brett Crozier had been relieved of his command of the nuclear-powered carrier because he had copied in too many people on an internal memo on Monday, in which he urgently appealed for members of his crew who had fallen ill to be allowed to disembark for medical care in Guam. By Thursday, 114 of the more than 4,000 crew had tested positive for Covid-19. Modly did not accuse Crozier of leaking the memo, but suggested he made it more likely that the letter would be leaked. He also accused Crozier of raising unnecessary alarm among the sailors\u2019 families, and exaggerating the threat to their lives. \u201cWe are not at war. Sailors do not need to die,\u201d Crozier wrote in his four-page 30 March memo to senior officers, which was reported by the San Francisco Chronicle. \u201cIf we do not act now, we are failing to properly take care of our most trusted asset \u2013 our sailors.\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said the Trump administration\u2019s decision to remove the commander showed \u201cpoor judgement\u201d. In his letter, Crozier said it was impossible to achieve social distancing and quarantine conditions on board the Roosevelt, and therefore the majority of the sailors on board should be disembarked for quarantine and treatment. Briefing the press on his decision on Thursday, Modly said accused Crozier of \u201cnot being careful\u201d about who would receive his note. \u201cIt was copied to 20 or 30 other people. That\u2019s just not acceptable. He did not take care and what that did is it created a little bit of a panic on the ship,\u201d Modly said. He stressed that he was not accusing Crozier of leaking the memo himself. Modly said that the navy had already begun mobilizing resources to help the crew in response to Crozier\u2019s earlier requests for assistance. \u201cHe was fully aware of the navy\u2019s response, only asking that he wished the crew could be evacuated faster,\u201d the acting secretary said. He pointed out that so far, none of the infected crew was so ill to need hospitalization, and contrasted that with Crozier\u2019s warning that sailors could die. \u201cNo one knows that to be true. It does not comport with the data we have right now on the ship,\u201d Modly said. He argued he was forced to act \u201cwhen I have a commanding officer who\u2019s responsible for a nuclear powered aircraft carrier, with all that lethality and all that responsibility, who exercises that poor judgment in a situation in a crisis like this.\u201d Modly and other officials had initially said that Crozier was right to air his concerns. On Thursday the acting secretary denied he had been under pressure from the White House to fire the commander. The Democratic leadership of the House armed services committee issued a statement saying that Crozier had not behaved \u201cappropriately\u201d but argued the dismissal was \u201can overreaction\u201d. \u201cIt is a destabilizing move that will likely put our service members at greater risk and jeopardize our fleet\u2019s readiness,\u201d the statement read."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
