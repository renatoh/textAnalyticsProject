A split-second later she\u2019s crashing to the ground (shouting expletives all the way) but just as quickly she\u2019s up again with an indefatigable sparkle in her eye, a mix between a soldier and an eager puppy. This is the part she was born to play: a foul-mouthed greedy slob exuding unearned confidence, faking her way though life leaving a path of destruction in her way. With Tatiana, a recently fired cocktail waitress who schemes with her friend into a free Hawaii vacation, Plaza has found her Ron Burgundy: the vessel of a true imbecile in which to pour her strange genius. Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates is very much an ensemble comedy, but much like A Fish Called Wanda earned Kevin Kline the Oscar, Plaza\u2019s ineffable style of comedy (which weirdly teeters between broad farce and muted disinterest) suits the material so perfectly she leaves the others in the dust. Not that it\u2019s a competition, though these dopey characters might actually prefer that. Mike (Adam DeVine) and Dave (Zac Efron) are two dimwit brothers who \u2013 as we\u2019ll see in a highlights video their father and mother (Stephen Root and Stephanie Faracy) just so happen to provide \u2013 can\u2019t attend a family function without causing destruction. It\u2019s thought that if they bring dates to their sister\u2019s upcoming destination wedding, it will keep them focused, sober and less likely to set anyone on fire with cheap fireworks. While the boys are walking, breathing ids, their love for their baby sister Jeanie (Stephanie Beard) is their achilles heel. For her sake, they\u2019ll try to find companions, and use social media and the Wendy Williams Show to aid them if needs be. (It\u2019s here that I mention that this is very loosely based on an actual incident.) In one of the screenplay\u2019s many nice touches, these two ultra bros spin being a kind older brother into something of a frathouse challenge. It\u2019s quite sweet, and perpetuates Zac Efron\u2019s persona as one of the wokest hunks in Hollywood (along with Channing Tatum). It also works in stark contrast to the Hangover series, which reveled in the bad vibes of toxic male attitude for no higher purpose. None of this is to suggest that this movie is any kind of masterpiece. It is a collection of setpieces, some better than others. Highlights include a nude MDMA romp with horses, a competition with Alice Wetterlund\u2019s cool cousin Terry (bisexual Fonzie, as Mike calls her) and Dave\u2019s sketchbook of alcohol-themed superheroes. There\u2019s a bit with Kumail Nanjiani as an erotic masseuse that didn\u2019t quite work for me, but points given for athleticism. Within these sequences, though, hide sparks of true hilarity. Plaza and Kendrick, both small in stature with outsized personalities, walking in slo-mo like tough guys, hurling enormous fruity resort-style drinks over their shoulders, is a meme waiting to happen. But director Jake Szymanski and writers Andrew J Cohen and Brendan O\u2019Brien don\u2019t rely just on the visual. There\u2019s a craftiness in the script that isn\u2019t always present in these performance-based, R-rated comedies. The movie hits pause to let a complex hotel screen door frustrate an already flummoxed father (\u201cThey meet in the middle!\u201d), an attention to detail born from something resembling real life. There are also jokes where you least expect them: Efron spends much of the film with a T-shirt reading \u201cBananas\u201d and only when you finally stop noticing it do you learn the ridiculous reason why. Efron\u2019s use of a fairly esoteric Rastafari expression seemingly out-of-nowhere nearly left me dead and when the mild-mannered husband-to-be (Sam Richardson) finally blows his stack shouting \u201cJesus Hussein Christ!\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe I hadn\u2019t been using this expression myself for the last eight years. I\u2019ll leave it to others to root around for any feminist messages in Mike and Dave Need Wedding Dates. There\u2019s certainly a theme of equality, in that Tatiana and Alice can be just as revolting and self-centered as Mike and Dave. (I don\u2019t think I need to tell you that what begins as a scheme ends in romance.) From where I sit, this sort of on-screen representation is positive. Any opportunity for Aubrey Plaza to crash onto a pool raft, wave her arms and bark \u201cGet the fuck away from me!\u201d to a bunch of startled kids is only bringing righteousness into the world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
