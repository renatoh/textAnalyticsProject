For example, the year begins with the latest instalment of outpost life from Annie Proulx. That Old Ace in the Hole (Fourth Estate) is joined in January by new novels from Lucy Ellmann, Joyce Carol Oates and Colum McCann, who has drawn on the life of Rudolf Nureyev for Dancer (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson). But perhaps one of the most talked about new year novels will be Dave Eggers's You Shall Know Our Velocity (Hamish Hamilton, February). Readers eager to see whether Eggers's highly original voice, first seen in his novelistic memoir A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius, will translate into fiction can also catch Eggers in an anthology of American short stories, The Burned Children of America (Hamish Hamilton, May), introduced by Zadie Smith. Moving forward through the year, February sees the arrival of a new novel by the poet laureate Andrew Motion, The Invention of Dr Cake (Faber), and another intriguing slice of domestic life from Nicholson Baker in A Box of Matches (Chatto &amp; Windus). Another novel hotly tipped for success is David Flusfeder's The Gift (Fourth Estate), a witty tale of male bonding and rivalry that no less a person than Will Self tells us is \"the best book you'll give yourself all year\". A compelling mixture of fact and fiction emerges in March with Gordon Burn's The North of England Home Service (Faber), billed as the author's third novel but none the less reflecting his talent for reportage and social commentary. This month also sees a new novel from Graham Swift, The Light of Day (Hamish Hamilton), centring on the relationship between a woman in prison and the private detective who visits her, and one from Shena Mackay, Heligoland (Cape), which focuses on the inhabitants of a strange modernist apartment building. Readers have also come to expect strangeness from Magnus Mills, whose novel The Scheme for Full Employment (Flamingo) reprises his interest in exposing the oddities of British life. But perhaps the quirkiest title of the month is Dan Rhodes's Timoleon Vieta Come Home (Canongate), the delightful story of a lost dog, his bereft owner and a heartless interloper that suggests its publishers - who also brought us Life of Pi - might be cornering the market in animal-inspired fiction. Andrew O'Hagan's second novel, Personality (Faber), is a somewhat less fantastic affair - although it concerns itself with daydreams and ambitions by introducing us to a junior singing sensation whose success on Opportunity Knocks seems to offer a way out of the secluded island life she has hitherto enjoyed, or endured. Oddly enough, Matt Thorne's Child Star (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson) covers the same sort of territory, although without the appearance of Hughie Green. April also sees the publication of Rachel Cusk's linked short stories on the subject of parenting, The Lucky Ones (Fourth Estate), and the debut novel from critic James Wood, which comes with the forbidding title The Book Against God (Cape). As spring and summer arrive, so too do novels by established talents Jane Smiley, G\u00fcnther Grass, Adam Thorpe and Rose Tremain, as well as a return from Canadian writer Barbara Gowdy, with The Romantic (Flamingo), and Australian Janette Turner Hospital, with Due Preparations for the Plague (Fourth Estate). One of the most striking newcomers of 2002, Tariq Goddard, publishes his second novel, Dynamo (Sceptre), which brings us the story of Stalin's effect on Russian football. Another highly impressive new voice to look out for is Monica Ali, whose first novel Brick Lane (Doubleday) is a vast saga told from the point of view of a young woman brought from Bangladesh to east London to marry. \u00b7 Alex Clark is on the judging panel for Granta's Best of Young British Novelists, issue, who are announced early next year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
