The club had no plans to bring in another player on deadline day but felt compelled to change their stance after Peter Odemwingie picked up a serious knee injury in the 1-0 victory over Manchester City on Saturday. Assaidi spent last season on loan at the Britannia Stadium, scoring four goals in 19 Premier League appearances, and Stoke had agreed a fee with Liverpool in the summer to make the deal permanent. But the player\u2019s wage demands were too high. It is understood that Stoke will pay Liverpool a loan fee rising to \u00a31m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
