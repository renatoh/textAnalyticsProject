Trump reportedly intends to form another task force that will work on trying to reopen the economy by the end of April. But White House health experts have cautioned against scaling back social distancing too quickly. Mike Pence said the treasury is on track to send Americans payments of up to $1,200 by the end of next week. More than 16 million Americans have submitted unemployment claims in the past three weeks as the coronavirus pandemic devastates the US economy. New York broke its record for the highest single-day coronavirus death toll for the third consecutive day. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced at his daily briefing that 799 New Yorkers died of the virus yesterday, bringing the state\u2019s cumulative death toll to 7,067. British prime minister Boris Johnson was moved out of the intensive care unit. Downing Street said Johnson is in \u201cextremely good spirits\u201d and remains in the hospital as he recovers from coronavirus. Fact check: The majority of states have less than 10% positive cases Earlier, Dr Deborah Birx, a coordinator on the coronavirus response task force, said that 63% of the states (31 states) had less than 10% of total people tested for Covid-19 be positive. A quick glance at data provided by the Covid Tracking Project, a collaborative, volunteer-run project that collects data from local health departments, shows that about 28 states plus US Samoa meet that threshold. While that\u2019s still a slight majority of states, a handful are seeing much more dire statistics. Out of people tested in New York, about 40% have tested positive. Surrounding states also have grim stats: Thirty percent of those tested in Connecticut and 47% of those tested in New Jersey were positive. Presenting this number doesn\u2019t necessarily paint an accurate picture of the spread of the disease in the United States since testing has been limited until very recently. In certain states like New York, where tests have been limited and the spread has been massive, requirements to getting tested are strict. In states that have seen a less intense outbreak, testing has been more widely available. The CDC is now recommending that all Americans wear homemade, non-medical masks while in public. But experts from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine told the White House in a letter sent yesterday that \u201cthe available evidence is inconclusive about the degree to which homemade fabric masks may suppress spread of infection from the wearer to others\u201d. Although any sort of fabric mask will block at least some of the larger respiratory droplets, \u201cthere\u2019s little evidence regarding transmission of small aerosolized particulates,\u201d the researchers wrote. Further studies will reveal what sorts of masks, and fabrics, offer the most filtration. White House health officials like Dr. Birx and Dr. Fauci have warned that masks are meant to supplement, not replace, other safety measures such as handwashing and keeping a 6ft distance apart from others. The coronavirus briefing has ended. Fact check: flu comparisons Mike Pence said that \u201cwe\u2019ve known from the beginning that this at least three times more contagious than the flu. And, I believe that fact alone has informed our projections and the modeling.\u201d But the president has often compared coronavirus to the flu, from the beginning. In late March, Trump complained about distancing measures on Fox News. \u201cWe\u2019ve never closed down the country for the flu,\u201d he said. On March 9, he tweeted, \u201cSo last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life &amp; the economy go on.\u201d On February 26, he said, \u201cI mean, view this the same as the flu. When somebody sneezes \u2014 I mean, I try and bail out as much as possible when they\u2019re sneezing. \u201c A moment for fashion, and recognizing the importance of the world \u201cglobal\u201d in \u201cglobal health\u201d: Fact check: Oil market Trump repeatedly said that the oil market lost 40% of demand due to the Covid-19 crisis, but multiple reports say that the drop in demand worldwide is around 25% to 30%. The drop is still massive, largely due to the global halt in flights, and has put major oil-producing countries on edge. Today, members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), excluding the United States, reportedly agreed on a cut in production to stop the steepening of oil prices. The US cannot force cuts on its oil manufacturers as easily as other countries, though countries like Russia are pressuring the US to consider taking measures to cut production. Dr Fauci, on what it could mean to \u201creopen\u201d the country: \u201cOften, people say re-open the government, like it\u2019s a light switch on-and-off for the entire country. We have a very large country with really different patterns of disease and outbreaks in different parts of the country. So, it\u2019s not going to be a one size fits all.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting here that the federal government doesn\u2019t have the power to \u201cswitch on\u201d the economy all at once. States, counties and cities ultimately have a lot of authority to enforce distancing measures for as long as they deem necessary. Coronavirus testing by age: Dr Birx presented the following numbers on testing nationally. People younger than 25: 200,000 have been tested of which 11% tested positive Age 25-45: 500,000 were tested, 17% were positive Age 45-65: 500,000 were tested, 21% were positive Age 65-85: 200,000 were tested, 22% were positive People older than 85: 30,000 tested, 24% were positive Dr Anthony Fauci provided some good news with the bad. This has been a very bad week in terms of the number of deaths, he said. At the same time, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing a rather dramatic decrease in the need for hospitalization\u201d in New York, he said. \u201cThat means what we are doing is working, and therefore we need to continue.\u201d More women than men are getting tested for coronavirus, but more men test positive for the virus, said Dr Deborah Birx. That suggests that men may not report symptoms or get help until they\u2019re much sicker, she said. Once they finally do get to a health provider, they already have the virus. She asked men to seek help as soon as they think they needed it, rather than waiting. Pence said that White House officials are looking at whether health workers can wear reusable cloth gowns, instead of disposable ones, which are running out. Hospitals may have to \u201crecycle gowns\u201d to stretch their supplies, Pence said. More guidelines are forthcoming, he said. Mike Pence says the administration is \u201con the timetable\u201d to send out the first round of stimulus checks by the end of next week. Many Americans will receive up to $1,200. Fact check: Testing again More from Trump on testing: \u201cDo you need it? No. Is it a nice thing to do? Yes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about 325 million people and that\u2019s not going to happen, as you can imagine. And it would never happen with anyone else either.\u201d Politico recently reported on a plan developed by two former FDA commissioners, Mark McClellan and Scott Gottlieb, to reopen the economy that hinged on widespread testing and a vast expansion of the United States\u2019 public health system. Serology or antibody tests \u2013 which can help detect if a person\u2019s immune system has faced off against Covid-19 and recovered from it \u2014 could also help public health officials know when to ease back distancing and reopen businesses. \u201cIt\u2019s really important to test for immunity,\u201d Robert Siegel, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University, told the Guardian, because people who are immune could return to work without endangering themselves or others. \u201cThey could more safely work as frontline healthcare providers,\u201d Siegel said. Fact check: US stockpile of hydroxychloroquine Trump said that the US has \u201cpurchased and stockpiled millions and millions of doses\u201d of hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malaria drug Trump has been touting as a game-changer in the fight against Covid-19. Medical experts, including the US National Institute of Health\u2019s Anthony Fauci, has said there is no clinical evidence yet that the drug can effectively treat the disease. Clinical trials have only recently begun. The US does have a hefty stockpile of the drug thanks to a recent donation from drugmaker Novartis, who said early last week that Sandoz, its generic drug division, will donate 30m doses of the medicine to the federal government. Novartis said in a press release that the doses of the drug will be used for controlled clinical studies to test the drug\u2019s effectiveness against covid-19. Fact check: Ventilator shortages \u201cWe\u2019re in good shape,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou\u2019re not hearing of people needing ventilators much.\u201d It is true that some states have ended up with more ventilators than they think they need. California has loaned 500 ventilators to states like New York. California hospitals managed to increase their stock from 7,500 machines to more than 11,000, according to the state\u2019s governor Gavin Newsom. \u201cThat has put less strain and pressure on the state\u2019s effort to procure additional ventilators,\u201d Newsom said. However, that doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t a national shortage. The US has roughly 173,000 ventilators, according to the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University. Experts from Harvard Medical School predict that the US could end up needing 31 times that number to treat coronavirus patients. Mayor Bill de Blasio of New York City said hospitals there would run out of the machines this week, and the number of cases continue to grow. Asked how the country could reopen without an effective national system for coronavirus testing, Trump responded that \u201cthere are certain sections of the country that are in phenomenal shape already.\u201d He didn\u2019t specify what those areas are. Public health experts have said that widespread testing is a key precursor to easing back social distancing measures. Trump also said that the US will soon be doing \u201cmassive testing\u201d, even though it\u2019s not necessary, wihout providing any further detail on what that entails. Fact check: Temporary hospitals Trump said that Army Corps of Engineers have built 21 temporary hospitals nationwide, making up an additional 17,000 beds. But according to a government press statement released yesterday, the Army Corps of Engineers has so far constructed 17 facilities, totaling 14,579 beds. Another 23 facilities made up of 8,571 beds are pending. Donald Trump said he\u2019s going to take a few questions from reporters before returning to negotiations on oil and air travel. His conversation with Vladimir Putin and Mohammed Bin Salman was \u201cvery good,\u201d he said. They\u2019re \u201cgetting close to a deal\u201d and \u201cgetting along very well.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to see what happens, but it was a very good call,\u201d Trump said. Fact check: Testing \u201cOur tests are highly sophisticated,\u201d Trump said, once again repeating a line that the US has done more testing than other countries. While the US has ramped up testing, it still lags behind other countries, including South Korea and Germany. South Korea has administered 486,003 tests, according to the Korean Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. With a population of 51.5m, the country has tested about 1 in every 113 people. Germany has done even better, testing every 1 in 90 people. Meanwhile, the United States, with a population of 329 million, had administered at least 1,951,044 tests, according to the Atlantic\u2019s Covid Tracking Project \u2014 so the US has tested about 1 in every 168 people. Fact check: hydroxychloroquine As usual, Trump is touting hydroxychloroquine, noting that drug companies are ramping up productions and that the US has stockpiled doses. In the week beginning March 30, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provided hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial drug that is also used to treat autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, with an \u201cemergency use authorization\u201d to use on coronavirus patients in some circumstances. Clinical trials to test the drug\u2019s effectiveness in treating coronavirus have begun across the world, and in the US. However, experts, including US public health officials, have warned that it is too early to know if hydroxychloroquine works. So far, the evidence that it\u2019s an effective cure for coronavirus is thin. An initial French study that appeared to have launched the Trump administration\u2019s obsession with the dug has since been discredited. The drug is considered relatively safe for people without an underlying illness, but it\u2019s unclear if it is safe for severely sick Covid-19 patients, who may have incurred organ damage due to the virus. The surge in demand for the unproven hydroxychloroquine also risks shortages of the drug for those who need it most. It is used to help patients manage the chronic autoimmune disease lupus, but some are already complaining the drug is harder to come by.

The president said he\u2019s looking into whether some parts of the economy can be reinstated sooner. Trump has taken the podium after a few delays. The president is expected to speak within the next half hour. While the press and the public has been focused on the coronavirus pandemic, Trump has pushed through his agenda, giving handouts to big business, appointing judges and rolling back regulations. My colleagues Emily Holden and David Smith report: The last time America was facing a possible economic depression, Rahm Emanuel, Barack Obama\u2019s chief of staff, observed: \u201cNever allow a good crisis go to waste. It\u2019s an opportunity to do the things you once thought were impossible.\u201d It is advice Donald Trump and his Republican allies appear to have taken to heart. Faced with not one but two crises \u2013 public health and economic \u2013 Obama\u2019s successor and his allies are advancing their agenda, whether in plain sight as a direct response to the pandemic, or under cover while the nation is deeply distracted. Trump touts his wall on the Mexican border almost daily and emphasizes national borders, even though the coronavirus paid them no heed. He has attacked voting rights, assailed federal watchdogs, shredded regulations and signed a bill that hands billions of dollars to corporations while resisting congressional oversight. CNN says that the vice president is not allowing top health officials to appear on the network, in order to pressure them to carry the president\u2019s daily coronavirus briefings. From CNN: Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s office reversed course on Thursday afternoon, after declining for days to allow the nation\u2019s top health officials to appear on CNN and discuss the coronavirus pandemic, in what was an attempt to pressure the network into carrying the White House\u2019s lengthy daily briefings in full. After this story was published, Pence\u2019s office allowed for the booking of Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Robert Redfield for CNN\u2019s Thursday night coronavirus town hall. Dr. Anthony Fauci was also booked for Friday on \u201cNew Day.\u201dTrump makes 86 false claims over two weeks, including whoppers about Bloomberg, Pelosi and Social SecurityPreviously, Pence\u2019s office, which is responsible for booking the officials on networks during the pandemic, said it would only allow experts such as Fauci or Dr. Deborah Birx to appear on CNN if the network televised the portion of the White House briefings that includes the vice president and other coronavirus task force members. CNN often only broadcasts President Donald Trump\u2019s question and answer session, which sometimes includes the health care officials, live on-air. Nine civil rights groups in the South have called for regional officials to issue protective measures for people who work at or are detained at correctional and juvenile facilities. \u201cGovernment officials to implement desperately needed protections against Covid-19 infection and deaths in correctional and juvenile facilities throughout the South, which disproportionately incarcerate Black individuals,\u201d the groups wrote in a statement. \u201cWith poor health outcomes, inadequate access to health care, and elevated poverty rates, the South, which incarcerates a larger portion of its population than any other region in the nation, is exceptionally vulnerable to a widespread outbreak of COVID-19 in its facilities.\u201d Hi there, it\u2019s Maanvi Singh, reporting from the West Coast. Joe Biden hold a wide lead over Donald Trump, according to a new CNN poll. The former vice president leads 53% to 42% among registered voters. The poll also found that voters trusted Biden more to handle the response to the coronavirus pandemic, healthcare and helping the middle class. Of those polled, 52% said they trusted Biden, compared to 43% tho trusted Trump to handle to the coronavirus crisis. That\u2019s it from me today. My west coast colleague, Maanvi Singh, will be taking over the blog for the next few hours. Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: New York broke its record for the highest single-day coronavirus death toll for the third consecutive day. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced at his daily briefing that 799 New Yorkers died of the virus yesterday, bringing the state\u2019s cumulative death toll to 7,067. Another 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment last week. More than 16 million Americans have submitted unemployment claims in the past three weeks as the coronavirus pandemic devastates the US economy. British prime minister Boris Johnson was moved out of the intensive care unit. Downing Street said Johnson is in \u201cextremely good spirits\u201d and remains in the hospital as he recovers from coronavirus. Trump reportedly intends to announce the formation of a second coronavirus task force. The task force will be working on trying to reopen the economy by the end of April, which could create tension with the White House\u2019s health experts, who have warned of a potential resurgence in coronavirus cases if social distancing restrictions are relaxed too quickly. Maanvi will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Senior White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said the US economy may be reopened on a \u201crolling basis.\u201d \u201cThe next month or two, we should be able to restart at least on a rolling basis,\u201d Kudlowtold Fox Business. \u201cOur intent here was, is to try to relieve people of the enormous difficult hardships they are suffering through no fault of their own.\u201d Trump reportedly intends to form a second coronavirus task force with an eye on reopening the economy by the end of April, which could create tension with the White House\u2019s health experts, who have warned against easing social distancing restrictions too quickly. The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports on the latest from California: While cases in California continue to rise, data is revealing promising points. For the first time in his daily press conferences, governor Gavin Newsom said, he could report that the number of patients admitted to ICUs dropped by 1.9%. He cautioned, however, that a modest, one-day drop could be a statistical blip. Hospitalizations ticked up 4.1% over the past 24 hours, to 2,825 patients. The racial disparities in deaths and Covid-19 cases that have surfaced in other states like Louisiana have so far not played out in California. While the data remains incomplete, with just over half of cases broken down by race, the trends so far track roughly with the demographics of the state\u2019s population. While the governor offered optimism and hope, he warned that the worst may be yet to come. \u201cThe peak we projected is different from the one advertised by academics in other states,\u201d he said. \u201cWithin California, we believe the peak extends into May, not in the next week or two.\u201d The Guardian\u2019s Mario Koran reports on the latest from California: In California, where coronavirus cases have topped 18,300, officials are offering relief to frontline workers in the form of hotel rooms for free or at \u201cdeep discount\u201d rates to provide lodging if they\u2019ve been exposed to the virus and don\u2019t want to return home, governor Gavin Newsom said at an afternoon press conference. United, Southwest, Alaska and Delta airlines have additionally promised to cover travel costs for healthcare professionals working on the front lines. \u201cThose are the four airlines that have met this moment\u201d, Newsom said. The governor also responded to fear expressed by Californians who said the state was giving away its precious stockpile of equipment to other states like New York and New Jersey. For the moment, there\u2019s enough to share, he said: California has 8,000 ventilators, about 32 percent of its stash, within its hospital system that aren\u2019t currently being used. \u201cWe thought it was the right thing to do, but also the responsible thing to do as American citizens to save lives\u201d, Newsom said of the effort to assist other states. After states use ventilators, they have agreed to send them back to California. Over the past month officials in California have cobbled together a healthy supply of ventilators, boosting its stash from 7,500 ventilators a month ago to the 11,750 it currently has. Trump lashed out against the Wall Street Journal after the newspaper published a critical editorial about his daily briefings on the government\u2019s response to coronavirus. \u201cThe Wall Street Journal always \u2018forgets\u2019 to mention that the ratings for the White House Press Briefings are \u2018through the roof,\u2019\u201d Trump wrote in a tweet, dismissing the newspaper as \u201cFake News.\u201d Trump\u2019s tweet came about an hour after Fox News ran a segment on the editorial, which expressed disappointment that the daily White House briefings had become \u201call about the President.\u201d \u201cThe briefings began as a good idea to educate the public about the dangers of the virus, how Americans should change their behavior, and what the government is doing to combat it,\u201d the Journal\u2019s editorial board wrote. \u201cBut sometime in the last three weeks Mr. Trump seems to have concluded that the briefings could be a showcase for him. Perhaps they substitute in his mind for the campaign rallies he can no longer hold because of the risks. Perhaps he resented the media adulation that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has been receiving for his daily show. Whatever the reason, the briefings are now all about the President.\u201d The White House distributed a fact sheet on coronavirus to reporters, who will now be tested for the virus before attending the daily briefing. The White House also said that it would only alert reporters of their results if a test came back positive. The White House press office announced today that it would start administering rapid coronavirus tests to reporters after one journalist, who was last at the White House on Tuesday, started developing symptoms. Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign will continue providing health care coverage for its employees through the end of October, even though the Vermont senator suspended his presidential bid yesterday. In comparison, former presidential candidate Mike Bloomberg is facing two lawsuits after he dismissed staffers eight months earlier than promised. One lawsuit accused Bloomberg of having \u201cdeprived [staffers] of promised income and health care benefits, leaving them and their families potentially uninsured in the face of a global pandemic.\u201d Joe Biden has released a new plan to \u201chelp ease the economic burden on working people\u201d amid the coronavirus pandemic. The presumptive Democratic nominee proposed lowering the Medicare eligibility age to 60 and forgive student debt from public universities for those making less than $125,000. \u201cI believe that as we are being plunged into what is likely to be one of the most volatile and difficult economic times in this country\u2019s recent history, we can take these critical steps to help make it easier for working people to make ends meet,\u201d Biden wrote in a Medium post detailing the plan. The former vice president specifically credited Bernie Sanders, who dropped out of the race yesterday, for helping to bring these proposals forward. \u201cSenator Sanders and his supporters can take pride in their work in laying the groundwork for these ideas, and I\u2019m proud to adopt them as part of my campaign at this critical moment in responding to the coronavirus crisis,\u201d Biden wrote. After Sanders announced his decision to suspend his campaign yesterday, Biden made a pitch to his supporters, pledging to address their priorities in his campaign. The effort reflects Biden\u2019s need to unify the party and win over Sanders\u2019 supporters in order to defeat Trump in November. Trump celebrated the news that Boris Johnson has been moved out of the intensive care unit, wishing the British prime minister a speedy recovery. The White House said it would start administering coronavirus tests to reporters attending the daily briefing after one journalist who was recently at the White House started showing symptoms. The White House Correspondents\u2019 Association said the affected reporter was last at the White House on Tuesday, and the person\u2019s test results are expected later today. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, the White House Medical Unit is going to conduct a COVID-19 test on all members of the press who plan to participate in today\u2019s task force briefing, including correspondents, photographers, and technicians,\u201d the White House press office said in a statement. The White House announced last week that anyone seeing Trump or Vice President Mike Pence would take a rapid coronavirus test to prevent them from catching it. Boris Johnson has been moved out of the intensive care unit, as the British prime minister continues to recover from coronavirus. Downing Street said in a statement, \u201cThe prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery. He is in extremely good spirits.\u201d For more updates, follow the Guardian\u2019s UK coronavirus blog: The Trump administration has carried out nearly 10,000 summary deportations or \u201cexpulsions\u201d since March 21, using emergency public health measures that have given US Customs and Border Protection broad authority to bypass immigration laws, CBP officials said Thursday, the Washington Post reports. The measures have allowed the agency to turn away most unauthorized migrants, sending them back across the Mexican border. The moves have dramatically slashed the number of detainees held in border stations, where they fear the coronavirus could spread, the officials said. CBP currently has fewer than 100 detainees in custody, down from nearly 20,000 at this time last year during last year\u2019s border crisis, officials said. Since the implementation of the rapid expulsions, unlawful border crossings have dropped 56 percent, said acting CBP commissioner Mark Morgan. Morgan also acknowledged that the United States has all but closed its borders to asylum seekers who are fleeing persecution, including those who attempt to enter legally at US ports of entry. \u201cThose who are undocumented or don\u2019t have documents or authorization are turned away,\u201d Morgan said. Democratic lawmakers have accused the administration of defying U.S. laws and exceeding the authority of the coronavirus public health order, but Morgan defended the emergency measures as a necessary step to stop the spread of the disease. Congressman Neal Dunn has tested positive for coronavirus, becoming the second members of Florida\u2019s congressional delegation to contract the virus. Dunn\u2019s office said in a statement that he was not feeling well on Monday and received a coronavirus test, which just came back positive. \u201cCongressman Dunn is feeling great and currently quarantining himself at home per CDC guidelines and working on Phase IV of the Administration\u2019s response to this pandemic,\u201d his office said in a statement. \u201cHe expects a full recovery soon.\u201d Dunn\u2019s diagnosis comes about a month after fellow Florida Republican Mario Diaz-Balart became one of the first two members of Congress to test positive for coronavirus. The first lady\u2019s office created a video urging Americans to wear face coverings in places where social distancing is difficult, such as grocery stores and pharmaries. \u201cRemember, this does not replace the importance of social distancing,\u201d Melania Trump says in the video. \u201cIt is another recommended guideline to keep us all safe.\u201d The CDC has recommended that Americans wear face coverings to help limit the spread of the virus, and some cities like Los Angeles have ordered residents to use them. The coronavirus pandemic has created some surreal scenes on Capitol Hill, reflected in these photos showing reporters questioning Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell while practicing social distancing and wearing masks: Less than three months ago, reporters were crowding around senators to question them about the impeachment trial, but those frantic huddles have become dangerous in the age of coronavirus: Here\u2019s where the day stands so far: New York broke its record for the largest single-day coronavirus death toll for the third day in a row. Governor Andrew Cuomo announced at his daily briefing that 799 New Yorkers died from the virus yesterday, bringing the state\u2019s total death toll to 7,067. Another 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, according to the labor department\u2019s latest report. More than 16 million Americans have filed unemployment claims in the past three weeks. Mike Pence\u2019s office is blocking health experts from appearing on CNN in an effort to pressure the network to broadcast the daily White House briefing in full. CNN has only been carrying Trump\u2019s portion of the briefing live before cutting to analysis and fact-checking of the president\u2019s comments, which have frequently included falsehoods. The blog will have more coming up, so stay tuned. Nearly 50 emergency room doctors from New York City\u2019s public hospitals have written an open letter to residents, urging people not to \u201ccut corners,\u201d when physical distancing, hand-washing and self-isolating. \u201cEvery day, our emergency departments are overflowing with patients newly infected with COVID-19, many starving for oxygen and on the brink of death,\u201d the doctors wrote. \u201cMany are older, but some are young. Many have pre-existing medical problems, but some do not. While we\u2019re constantly searching for new treatments and better ways to care for our patients, too many are dying despite our best efforts. These patients are also our friends, families, and colleagues,\u201d said the letter. The bullet point letter repeated many of the public health messages of recent days. The disease is more contagious than previously thought, mimics the flu, can be spread asymptomatically, for example. It urged people to wash their hands, to assume they have Covid-19 if they show any symptoms at all, however mild, and to isolate from family members. Millions of people are already taking these measures \u2013 but not diligently enough to stop the surge of patients coming to emergency rooms. \u201cMany of you have taken the steps above to protect yourself and others and we thank you. You are literally saving lives. But many of you have not \u2013 or continue to cut corners. This virus does not respect what we do \u2018most of the time,\u2019\u201d the doctors wrote. \u201cFellow New Yorkers, we need to do more!\u201d House speaker Nancy Pelosi criticized Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell for trying to pass a coronavirus relief bill without holding a vote. In consultation with the Trump administration, McConnell tried to get the bill, which would have allocated $250 billion in additional funds, approved by unanimous consent. But Democratic senators objected to the proposal, calling for an extra $250 billion for hospitals and state and local governments. The bill was not able to pass, and senators won\u2019t have a chance to take it up again until the pro forma session on Monday. House minority leader Kevin McCarthy called the Democrats\u2019 objection \u201cdisgusting,\u201d but Pelosi said the fault lied with McConnell for not conferring with Democrats about the bill. Pelosi said treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin had \u201casked for a quarter of a trillion dollars in 48 hours with no data,\u201d and McConnell had honored that request. The House speaker dismissed McConnell\u2019s efforts today as a political \u201cstunt\u201d and called for more bipartisan deliberations over the timing and content of the bill. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, in his daily briefing, just said that the effects of the coronavirus outbreak on the New York economy are expected to be \u201cmore devastating\u201d than the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks \u201cby far\u201d. New York state is bracing for a hit to its revenues of between $10 billion and $15 billion, with the focus being on the business ghost town that currently is New York City - the city that never sleeps, the crossroads of the world, etc - which is eerily still with non-essential businesses closed and folks on \u2018stay home\u2019 orders. New York governor Andrew Cuomo expressed cautious optimism about signs that the state is flattening the curve of coronavirus cases. However, the governor warned that the state\u2019s progress could be undone if social distancing practices are relaxed too quickly. \u201cRemember, the 1918 Spanish flu came in three waves,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWe\u2019re on the first wave. Everybody is assuming, well, once we get through this, we\u2019re done. I wouldn\u2019t be so quick to assume that. This virus has been ahead of us from day one.\u201d New York broke its record for the largest single-day coronavirus death toll for the third consecutive day, governor Andrew Cuomo announced at his daily briefing. New York recorded 799 deaths from coronavirus yesterday, bringing the state\u2019s total death toll to 7,067. New York has lost about the same number of people to coronavirus as the UK. Cuomo said the state would be bringing in additional funeral directors to help deal with the surge of deaths. As the state mourns the loss of several thousand New Yorkers, there are also signs that social distancing is flattening the curve. Yesterday, the state recorded the lowest number of new hospitalizations since the crisis started. The number of ICU admissions and intubations are also down. \u201cWe are saving lives by what we are doing today,\u201d Cuomo said. New York governor Andrew Cuomo is holding his daily briefing on the state\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis. The governor noted it has been 18 days since the state\u2019s \u201cstay at home\u201d order went into effect, even though it may feel like \u201ca lifetime\u201d ago. Cuomo also said hospitalizations in New York are currently lower than many projections initially predicted, applauding healthcare professionals and other first responders for their work. \u201cWe\u2019re flattening the curve so far,\u201d Cuomo said of social distancing measures, emphasizing that New Yorkers cannot get complacent now. The Guardian\u2019s David Smith and Emily Holden report: Faced with not one but two crises \u2013 public health and economic \u2013 Trump and his allies are advancing their agenda, whether in plain sight as a direct response to the pandemic, or under cover while the nation is deeply distracted. Trump touts his wall on the Mexican border almost daily and emphasizes national borders, even though the coronavirus paid them no heed. He has attacked voting rights, assailed federal watchdogs, shredded regulations and signed a bill that hands billions of dollars to corporations while resisting congressional oversight. \u201cMost Americans are not tracking these at all,\u201d said Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota. \u201cThe crisis has created a blizzard condition in which information and criticism is not breaking through. It\u2019s a perfect storm for Trump to push his agenda. You can hear ideologues saying: this is our moment, do not delay.\u201d Just as George W Bush\u2019s administration exploited 9/11 to expand government powers and threaten civil liberties such as freedom of speech and due process, Trump\u2019s White House scents political opportunity in a national crisis. The office of Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the White House coronavirus task force, has blocked CNN from access to health experts in an effort to pressure the network to carry the full daily White House briefing. CNN reports: Pence\u2019s office has declined to allow the nation\u2019s top health officials to appear on CNN in recent days and discuss the coronavirus pandemic killing thousands of Americans, in an attempt to pressure the network into carrying the White House\u2019s lengthy daily briefings in full. Pence\u2019s office, which is responsible for booking the officials on networks during the pandemic, said it will only allow experts such as Dr. Deborah Birx or Dr. Anthony Fauci to appear on CNN if the network televises the portion of the White House briefings that includes the vice president and other coronavirus task force members. CNN often only broadcasts President Donald Trump\u2019s question and answer session, which sometimes includes the health care officials, live on-air. After Trump leaves the podium, CNN frequently cuts out of the White House briefing to discuss and fact-check what the President had said. A CNN executive said that the network usually returns to such programming because of the extensive length of the full briefing that includes Pence, which can run in excess of two hours. Many news organizations, including the Guardian, have taken to fact-checking the president\u2019s briefings in real time, after Trump repeatedly made misstatements about the federal government\u2019s response to coronavirus. The Guardian\u2019s Sam Levine reports: Georgia is moving its presidential primary for a second time. The state\u2019s presidential primary contest election, originally scheduled for March 24 is being pushed back from May 19 to June 9. All of the state\u2019s other statewide contests, which include partisan primaries and judicial races, are being moved to the June date, Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, said in a statement. Raffensperger noted the decision came after Georgia Governor Brian Kemp extended a state of emergency in the state to May 13, which would cover almost every day of in-person voting allowed for the May 19 contest, Raffensperger noted. The secretary of state said, \u201cThis decision allows our office and county election officials to continue to put in place contingency plans to ensure that voting can be safe and secure when in-person voting begins and prioritizes the health and safety of voters, county election officials, and poll workers.\u201d Raffensperger previously began mailing applications for absentee ballots to 6.9 active registered voters in the state. He said Thursday that applications would continue to be accepted for the June 9 primary, even if the voter had requested it for the contest on May 19. Raffensperger faced criticism for his efforts to facilitate vote by mail from Georgia House Speaker David Ralston. He said efforts to make it easier to vote by mail \u201cwill be extremely devastating to Republicans and conservatives in Georgia.\u201d After the comments, Raffensperger announced he was setting up a task force to watch against voter fraud with mail-in ballots. The Senate failed to pass a bill allocating an additional $250 billion to the small business loan program created by last month\u2019s stimulus package. Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell tried to pass the bill by unanimous consent, but Senate Democrats objected because they are calling for an extra $250 billion for hospitals and state and local governments. McConnell objected to Democrats\u2019 proposed amendement to the bill, making it impossible to pass the bill by unanimous consent. The Senate has now adjourned until Monday, when McConnell will have another chance to push the bill through as businessowners fear the program will soon run out of funds. Joe Biden holds a 4-point lead over Trump in a new national poll, which comes a day after Bernie Sanders suspended his presidential campaign. According to the Monmouth University poll, Biden attracts the support of 48% of registered voters, while Trump stands at 44%. The result is similar to Biden\u2019s 3-point lead over Trump in a poll released last month. With Sanders dropping our of the race, such head-to-head polls between Trump and Biden have taken on a heightened level of significance as America looks ahead to the general election in November. However, national polls do not reflect the state-by-state nature of presidential elections. Hillary Clinton famously won the popular vote in 2016 but lost the electoral college, handing Trump a victory. Wisconsin continues to count ballots after its chaotic primary on Tuesday, which was disrupted by long lines and fears of spreading coronavirus at polling sites. More than a million absentee ballots have been returned, but the question remains whether turnout overall decreased due to people avoiding in-person voting. Some Wisconsin voters said they never received their absentee ballots, which left them with an undesirable choice between not voting at all and risking their health by voting in person. A Wisconsin state senator said yesterday that one post office found three large tubs of unsent absentee ballots the day after the primary. Senate Democrats are introducing their own coronavirus relief bill in an effort to get more funds for hospitals and state and local governments. In consultation with the Trump administration, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is trying to quickly pass a bill allocating an addition $250 billion to the small business loan program created by the stimulus package. The program was originally given $350 billion, but that money appears to be rapidly dwindling. Two Democratic senators, Ben Cardin and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, are now introducing their own bill to give additional funds to hospitals and state and local governments, as well as the small business loan program. But the conflict is unlikely to produce anything other than a messaging war, considering Republicans control the Senate and can push through their smaller bill, which Democrats are unlikely to oppose. When acting Navy secretary Thomas Modly traveled to Guam to criticize Captain Brett Crozier to his former crew members, it cost taxpayers approximately $243,000, according to a new report. Modly resigned earlier this week amid an uproar over his comments about Crozier, who raised concerns about the spread of coronavirus on his ship, the USS Theodore Roosevelt. Crozier was later removed from his post. Modly said that Crozier was either \u201ctoo naive or too stupid\u201d to command the ship if he did not think his letter expressing alarm would be made public. The acting secretary resigned a day after his comments came to light. USA Today reports: Modly flew aboard the C-37B, a Gulfstream business jet modified for military use. The per-hour cost of flying it is $6,946.19 per hour, according to the Navy official who was not authorized to speak publicly. Flight time for the Guam trip was about 35 hours for a cost of $243,116.65. The Guardian\u2019s Dominic Rushe and Michael Sainato report: More than 6.6 million Americans lost their jobs last week with 16 million jobs gone in the last three weeks as the coronavirus pandemic brought the US economy to a standstill, the US labor department confirmed on Thursday. Millions of Americans filed for unemployment benefits again last week as shutdowns across the US led employers to lay off workers in nearly every corner of the job market. Economists had expected 5.25 million Americans to file for unemployment benefits for the week ending 4 April. In the previous two weeks the shutdowns cost close to 10 million people their jobs. Layoffs that started in the restaurant and leisure industries have now spread to include manufacturing, construction and even healthcare. Job losses are rising in every state and economists are predicting the unemployment rate will soon reach 15% or higher, levels unseen since before the second world war. The largest increases were in California (up 871,992), New York (up 286,596), Michigan (up 176,329) and Florida (up 154,171). But while the numbers are stark, economists cautioned it was too early to say what the long-term impact of Covid-19 will be on the economy. \u201cThese figures don\u2019t reflect a lack of demand,\u201d said Dean Baker, visiting professor and senior economist at the University of Utah. During the last recession in 2008 unemployment reached close to 10% as the economy fell into recession. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t in our control. This is literally in our control,\u201d said Baker. \u201cWe are deliberately shutting down the economy.\u201d Trump is reportedly planning to form a second coronavirus task force focused on reopening the US economy. The Washington Post reports: The taskforce will be made up of a mix of private-sector and top administration officials, including chief of staff Mark Meadows \u2013 whose first official day on the job was last week \u2013 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and national economic adviser Larry Kudlow, a senior administration official said. Meadows is likely to lead the taskforce, though no official decision has been made, two senior administration officials said ... The economic taskforce \u2014 which will be separate from the main coronavirus taskforce, despite having some overlapping members \u2013 will focus on how to reopen the country, as well as what businesses need to rebound amid catastrophic conditions. The goal is to get as much of the country as possible open by 30 April, the current deadline Trump set for stringent social distancing measures. News of the second taskforce \u2013 and the late April deadline \u2013 comes as health experts like Dr Anthony Fauci urge caution in declaring the virus to be defeated as encouraging signs indicate the US is starting to flatten the curve of cases. Good morning, live blog readers. There have been some promising signs in recent days that the US is starting to flatten the curve of its number of coronavirus cases, even as the death toll continues to climb. New York, the state with the most coronavirus cases, is seeing a decline in the rate of hospitalizations, and a frequently cited model decreased its projected number of overall deaths in the country to 60,000. At the daily White House briefing yesterday, Donald Trump sounded bullish on the perspective of soon reopening the economy, as reports indicate that he hopes to be able to relax physical distancing restrictions by the end of April. \u201cAspirationally, I said let\u2019s see if we can do it at Easter, but I said it would be very tough, and I was criticised for that,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to be very far behind and some of these models are looking like Easter\u2019s going to be a very important date anyway because of the curve. It\u2019s hitting the top and it\u2019s starting to come down.\u201d But this morning, Dr Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert, was hesitant to say that New York has flattened the curve, emphasizing that several days\u2019 data will be needed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to junmp the gun on that,\u201d Fauci said when asked whether New York had flattened the curve. \u201cBut I think that is the case.\u201d He added, \u201cI\u2019m always very cautious about jumping the gun and saying, \u2018Well, we have turned the corner.\u2019 But I think we are really looking at the beginning of that, which would really be very encouraging. We need that right now.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
