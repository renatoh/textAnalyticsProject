But they create extra casualties in the process, some of them the kind of people squeezed out of stabilising low-skilled jobs by the demands of efficiency. When MPs debated the growing pressures on mental health services last night they were discussing casualties as surely as if they were debating Iraq. At issue between the government and a cross-party coalition was the Commons second reading of the star-crossed mental health bill, Labour's attempt to update the 1983 legislation, which has been repeatedly stalled by medical and civil liberty concerns for almost 10 years. The latest bill has been picked over since Christmas by the House of Lords. Peers have imposed six major amendments designed to protect vulnerable people from what critics call mental health Asbos - too sweeping and too restrictive to be other than counterproductive. Patricia Hewitt, the health secretary, sought to persuade sceptical MPs on both sides that ministers have listened to the experts, but that they, not the Lords, are right. Ms Hewitt will reverse the changes - if MPs allow it when they get down to detail. So this was an unusual parliamentary row: neither side impugning the other's motives, both agreed on what they wish to achieve, the protection of individual citizens at risk from themselves or others because of mental illnesses which can increasingly be treated, if not - an important difference - cured. Ministers deny that they are \"broadening\" the definition of mental disorder. Far from \"turning doctors into jailers\" by abolishing the old \"treatability test\" - which required there to be a beneficial treatment before someone could be detained against their will - the proposed rule would (until the peers reversed it) have prevented people with \"incurable\" personality disorders being turned away. At the centre of Ms Hewitt's remedy is the community treatment order (CTO), which provides for compulsory treatment not in hospital but at home. Critics warn that the CTO's draconian powers will frighten off some people in need of help and be used to keep out of secure hospitals others who should be in them. It is designed primarily to address the \"revolving door\" problem, patients who are discharged from hospital when they start to feel better and promptly stop taking their medication. As a result they suffer relapse and end up back in hospital. Each year 1,300 mental health patients commit suicide, 50 murder. But a more familiar argument lurks below the surface: not enough money, despite the vast sums Labour has put into mental health."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
