The greatest compliment I've ever received is being described as The George Best of Scrabble. The best curries are in Bradford, especially at the Akbar Restaurant. They have naans the size of your chest. In a fire the object I'd save is my World Scrabble Championship trophy, a silver Tiffany bowl. If I do nothing else in my life, at least I've got that. If I die tomorrow I'll always be known as the first ever British person to win the WSC. But my ambition is to be the first person to do it twice. The Iguassu Falls, on the border of Brazil and Argentina, is the most beautiful sight. They're not as well known as Angel, Niagara or Victoria, because they're not the highest and they're not the widest, yet they cover the most area. The immenseness and rainbow reflections are mindblowing. Se\u00f1orita is just one of six anagrams of Notaries. I hope Scrabble will take off like snooker. Every week I hear about someone coming out of the closet as a player - Robbie Williams, Sting, Christina Aguilera, Avril, Kylie ... Alison Steadman calls it 'the greatest game ever invented'. There should be Celebrity Scrabble. The Scrabble-playing celebrity I'd like to coach is Dido. I recommend a hammam - a body massage in a Turkish bath by a Freddie Mercury lookalike - as long as you make gestures to make sure he doesn't wash and massage your gonads. My friend was very traumatised. You aspire to play the perfect game, but I don't think anyone has ever really managed it. Well, I might have played one. It involved nine moves by me and was featured in an article entitled 'Game of the Gods'. Women seem to blame bad luck more than men. Not many people know about Shock Corridor, but it's my favourite film. It involves a guy investigating a murder in a mental hospital by entering as a mental patient. Does he get to the bottom of it, or does he end up a permanent patient? I think it says a lot. Roughly 160,000 words are allowed in Scrabble. A typical person's vocabulary is 20,000 and I probably recognise 100,000. Nigel Richards from New Zealand knows the lot, but his endgame strategy is fallible. It's time to leave the Civil Service, like I did, when you're doing a statistical table of the number of animals killed in fires in 1986, and of the total, 95 per cent are maggots which had died in one particular fire. The last word in Webster's - Zyzzyva - is absolutely useless. For a start there's only one Z in Scrabble. My favourite word definition is Taghairm: a western Scottish Highland word meaning 'divination, especially inspiration, sought by lying in a bullock's hide behind a waterfall'. I would like to have sex under a waterfall. I'm told it's always amazing. I like coincidences and synchronicity in Scrabble. If 'dick' is played, you may see 'cock' on the same board. I've missed 12 flights, 10 coming back to England. I'd like my epitaph to be 'Late As Usual But He Produced'. The highest scoring move isn't necessarily the best move and sometimes there isn't a best move. I believe in never taking longer getting to and from anywhere than being there. Except for Queens Park Rangers matches. I'd rather learn a new word than find out the meaning of a word I already know. Definitions can come later. I only knew Onager as an anagram of Orange; then I went to London Zoo and saw an onager is an Asian wild ass. The most likely seven-letter word and eight-letter words in Scrabble are Etaerio and Aeration. When I've thought about how the brain stores words, letters and letter arrangements, I've concluded it's like a turntable with loads and loads of little thin flashcards. It says something about Americans that they only go with words in Webster's, whereas the World Dictionary incorporates Webster's and Chambers. I would have won the American Scrabble Championship in 1989, if it wasn't for playing the word Hicatee (a West Indian freshwater turtle) from Chambers. So people outside America know too much. Douglas Adams used to go on about the meaning of life being 42. But I think it's 24."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
