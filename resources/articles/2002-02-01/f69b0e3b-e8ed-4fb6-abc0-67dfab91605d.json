Two of the guest bedrooms look out on to the newly-renovated, walled-in rose garden in which we have planted over 630 roses. In the summer guests can sit outside in the rose garden for breakfast. If guests are staying for dinner we talk to them over a complimentary pre-dinner drink. I only produce the best food - my sausages are served on the Orient Express and in the Ritz Carlton in London. Need I say more! Sarah-Jane Ormston, Barnard Castle. I travel regularly in this country and rather than stay in hotels I prefer 'friendly' B&amp;Bs, but I've found that it's very hit and miss. I've learnt to avoid a B&amp;B that advertises a \"friendly and warm welcome from your hosts\". That usually means they grab the cheque on arrival and aren't seen again. \"A full continental breakfast\" is often two pieces of toast, a bowl of cornflakes and one mug of coffee. But there are gems around too, often in farmhouses. Anthony Green, by email. In 18 years I have never had a nylon sheet in the house, let alone on a bed! We are 'no smoking' and I, alone, do all the cleaning, changing beds and the boring old ironing and not forgetting the good old English Cooked Breakfast. Where I am at odds with some fellow providers, and where I take issue with your article, is that Bed and Breakfast in a family home is, and should be, exactly that - Bed for the night and Breakfast in the morning and then it's check-out time. I do very much consider that my home should be mine from around 10.30 a.m.- 4.00 p.m. This is not to say I am inflexible or like the landlady you remember who told guests \"out at 9.00 and no return until 6.00\", regardless of the weather. To sum up, you should expect what you pay for, but don't expect more. K. Poulter, by email. I read your article with interest and some depression - I well remember B&amp;Bs as you describe, but those experiences are from 40 years ago when I was in the Navy, having to stay in various strange places. The depression comes from realising that they still exist. We run a small B&amp;B in Shropshire and, whilst I am not sure if we are part of the 'secretive passing on scraps of paper at dinner parties' league we are most certainly not part of the 'in at 10pm out at 9am' brigade either. John Sharplin, Shropshire. I suspect that travellers' standards vary depending on what they know of a country's prosperity. So a holiday-maker in Cuba will probably be pleased at the smallest luxury, having expected none. There are better comparisons to be made if you wish to show B&amp;Bs for what they truly are. Their real competitors are the cheap motels springing up everywhere, and the traditional 2 star hotels found at our seaside resorts. You should try a few of these - Scarborough would be a good start. Most have breakfasts whose bacon consists mostly of water and whose individual cartons of marmalade have orange peel extracted by a feeble sweep with a blunt zester. The motels score zero for charm and the resort hotels are usually in dire need of a facelift. Richard Thorpe, by email I have to agree with Jeannette Hyde in her opinion on British B&amp;Bs. I spent many nights last year staying in B&amp;Bs in Wales and the Borders whilst walking the Offa's Dyke Path and only found one good one. The misconception seems to be that we love them because we are welcomed into the bosom of the owner's family and share priceless conversation round the kitchen table, gaining real insights into the area and discovering how people at the grassroots think and feel. Nothing could be more fanciful. They show you your poky room furnished in classic British B&amp;B chintz and leave you to it until breakfast time when they are offended if you don't eat a huge greasy pile of disgusting food glorified by the name \"full English\", or in Wales, \"full Welsh\". However, in Stratford-upon-Avon, I have, at last and after many tries, found quite a good B&amp;B - run by a Frenchman. Keith Carter, by email. The article was an absolute insult to all the hardworking people involved in this section of the hospitality industry. I have been doing B&amp;B for 15 years not for the money, but the fun of it, as many other colleagues do likewise. You will find that a lot of people doing B&amp;B for the fun of it are doctors, solicitors, teachers, social workers. We are all, no matter what we do (or did), very professional in our work - not as you would like to think of us: Dragons, sending guests out in the rain? Curlers in? Slippers on to greet the guests? Cigarette in the mouth? Teeth out?? What nonsense. Marie Cruickshank, Nairn, www.scotlandmadeeasy.co.uk What a load of twaddle. If you're throwing down the gauntlet then I'll gladly pick it up. Come and stay here for a night or two (for less than 50 quid) and you'll change your mind. Or I'm a Dutchman. Jayne Quinn, Denehurst Guest House, Windermere. This silly article on B&amp;Bs can't go unchallenged. Would you recycle old anecdotes in this way about any other sector of the business you cover? Do you really think the only way to find a good B&amp;B is to pass on scraps of paper at dinner parties? I spent many years working in Europe and elsewhere as a foreign correspondent for Reuters and I have stayed just about everywhere, from flop house to five star. I can assure you that one of the few great tourism pluses the UK has over its neighbours is the B&amp;B tradition. Restaurants, hotels, pubs, railways, cafes and roads all tend to be much better value elsewhere, but in my experience no other country has any equivalent to our B&amp;Bs in range and quantity\". John Morrison, by email. I was taken aback by the tone of your article in Sunday's Observer regarding B&amp;Bs. You refer to an experience when you were seven years old. Believe it or not, and despite the crumbling social fabric of this country, times have changed where the B&amp;B industry is concerned. There are some splendid B&amp;Bs the length and breadth of the country. Front doors are often open at all times of day/night or, if not, keys are provided. I can't recall whether cotton sheets are consistently the order of the day but nylon ones are certainly not in evidence. Jenny Sheridan, by email. Based on my personal experience, the very name of the B&amp;B has also become to me synonymous with ruched nylon net curtains with matching bed covers and greasy breakfasts with cold toast. Nicky Roberts, Somerset. What a load of badly researched nonsense. B&amp;Bs are no longer Back Packer's doss houses but where the rich and famous prefer to stay, not for cheapness but for quality of food, rooms and service, all closely controlled, some under the AA or the RAC or VisitScotland banners. You are living in the past... Wallace &amp; Doreen Wood We have had similar, awful experience to Jeannette's (tilting beds, banging waterpipes, and the ubiquitous nylon sheets). However our faith was restored by a recent visit to a lovely little B&amp;B in Derbyshire. We were served the best roast chicken dinner that we've ever eaten, followed by homemade fruit crumble. Liz and Francis Grasso, Sheffield. As in the Lake District, tourism on Exmoor has suffered as a consequence of foot-and-mouth - there is no compensation for cancelled bookings, unfilled rooms, and unsold goods. Staying with friends who run a B&amp;B, we have been appalled, but not altogether surprised, by the gross ignorance and indifference of so many city folk. When people stayed away from the countryside those running visitor attractions, shops, and holiday accommodation lost out too. We know of several who went out of business altogether. To imply that it is virtually impossible to find decent and reasonably priced B&amp;B accommodation is, therefore, not only misleading and inaccurate but grossly irresponsible as well - especially at a time when the rural economy needs all the help it can get. Lesley Wardill, Exmoor While some B&amp;Bs are truly awful, so are some of the guests! I've had the coffee pot, the electric kettle, the hairdryer, the towels and a pillow nicked. I've had sick on the carpet, used tampons under the bed and a bed-wetter who made the bed so sodden that it was unusable and I had to buy a new one. I've had female guests make passes at me, and a couple of power-dressed businesswomen who threatened me with accusations of attempted rape if I didn't let them have the stay \"on the house\".
