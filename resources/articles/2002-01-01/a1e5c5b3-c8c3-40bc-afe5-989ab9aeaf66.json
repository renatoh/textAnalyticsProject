His predecessors did not fare so well. By the time United finished their 1950 summer tour of the United States, it seemed that the flight of British players to Bogota had come to an end. It had begun, sensationally, with the clandestine defection of two Stoke City players, Neil Franklin and George Mountford, seduced by the Santa Fe club with an offer of \u00a350 a week - several times the then maximum wage in English football. It was both a shock and a scandal, above all because Franklin, then the elegant England centre-half expected to play in the imminent World Cup finals in Brazil, had not only ruled himself out of the side but had lied to the Football Association, telling them his reason for withdrawal was because his wife was going to have a baby. But neither he nor Mountford, an outside-right, found it easy to settle; nor, indeed, did the other British players who followed them. All returned with their careers in ruins. Franklin never played for Stoke or England again, sliding down the league to Hull City. Then, suddenly, and unexpectedly, off went Charlie Mitten to south America. The move was possible because, at that time, the Colombians were not members of football's international governing body, Fifa. They had thus been able to attract some of the main Argentine talents, notably to the Millonarios club; Santa Fe turned, for a time, to English players. In the event, Mitten played long enough in Colombia to make plenty of money, after which he calmly came home. There would be no place for him with Manchester United, his local club - and one with which he had been since his teenage years, though he had actually been born in Rangoon. However, after serving a none too onerous suspension, he joined Fulham, with whom, though somewhat heavier than in the past, he played for several impressive seasons. His pace might have been diminished, but his renowned balance, cool ball control and notable left foot - adept alike for crosses, shots or penalty kicks - were fully functional. The second world war cut important years out of Mitten's career, though once it was over he established himself as a salient member of the United attack so successfully deployed by Matt Busby, who had just taken over a team without a stadium, Old Trafford having been badly bombed during the war. The forward line was composed of Jim Delaney, the supposedly brittle-boned Scottish international, Johnny Morris, a quick little inside-right, Jack Rowley, a forceful centre-forward, Stan Pearson, and Mitten himself. Of these, Mitten, Morris and Pearson were all developed by United. Altogether, Mitten played 161 games and scored 61 goals in his four league championship seasons with United. During those years, the club did not win the championship itself, but were impressive winners of the FA Cup in 1948, beating Blackpool 4-2 in the final at Wembley, after initially falling behind. Perhaps the most famous match they played in that tournament was against Aston Villa, in Birmingham in the third round. Aston Villa scored straight from the kick-off, but by half-time United were 5-1 ahead. With nine minutes left, Villa had pulled it back to 5-4, but a fine move between Rowley, Delaney and Mitten ended with Jones, in Villa's goal, turning Mitten's drive over the bar, and Stan Pearson scoring from the corner. By the time he left United, Mitten had played for England just once, in an unofficial charity international against Scotland at Maine Road, Manchester, in August 1946. He was never given a full cap; there was intense competition for his role. In his first season for Fulham in 1951-52, having been amnestied after the south American adventure, he made 16 appearances, scoring half a dozen goals, but could not save his new club from relegation to the second division. The following season, he played 40 times for another six goals, forming a notable left-wing pair with the precocious young inside-left, Johnny Haynes. Nine goals in 41 games came in season 1953-54, six goals in 36 games in 1954-55, and just four goals in 21 games in 1955-56, with promotion still elusive. In 1956, Mitten became manager of Mansfield Town, and did well enough to land a plum post in 1958 at Newcastle United, bringing on Ivor Allchurch, Len White and George Eastham, before he was sacked when the club was relegated in 1961. He then became player-manager of non-league Altrincham. As his trip to Colombia might have suggested, Mitten was always a betting man; indeed, it was rumoured that he dealt in horses while in south America. Back in England, greyhounds were more his style, and he took charge of Manchester's White City greyhound stadium in the 1960s, later running a sports promotion business in the city. He was married, with two sons and a daughter. \u00b7 Charles Mitten, footballer and manager, born January 17 1921; died January 2 2002"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
