The deal was done by some fairly crude diplomacy - agreeing that half the current garment surplus could be written off against next year's import quotas. But behind technical trade jargon and tabloid headlines about bra wars and trouser mountains lay a sharp reminder of the sheer weight of the Chinese economy, which now accounts for almost one third of world growth. Mr Blair, holding the EU's rotating presidency, was right to call on Europe to adopt economic reforms in the light of the global manufacturing reach of China - now the union's biggest trading partner - and India. The dispute showed this was no abstraction. Peter Mandelson, the Brussels trade commissioner, who zig-zagged his way to the agreement, made no secret of his unhappiness with the quotas on Chinese clothes that were demanded by France, Spain and Italy to protect their shrinking textile industries. Retailers opposed the measures, and were happy to seek alternative jeans and T-shirts from Bangladesh and other low-cost producers. Still, what Mr Mandelson called \"a serious glitch\" has been fixed, so there should be no Christmas shortages of underwear gift sets. The row was an illustration, too, of the way that European countries too often put short-term commercial advantage ahead of a wider agenda and make it harder for the Brussels commission to do its integrationist job. The EU insists it wants a \"strategic\" relationship with China, just as it does with Russia, but there is a sense that individual member states do not really mean it. That is unfortunate because Europe is better placed than the US to build constructive ties with Beijing, not only because of the lure of lucrative deals with Airbus, Siemens and the like, but also because it deals in \"soft\" rather than hard power that has the capacity to encourage and influence internal change in China. That has brought tension with the US and Japan over whether to lift the arms embargo imposed after the Tiananmen massacre - rightly still in place. Europe should aspire to a role commensurate with its weight and ambitions, but should not ignore American strategic concerns over Taiwan and military spending. Nor should it underplay concerns about Beijing's human rights violations, at home and in Tibet. In engaging with \"peacefully rising\" China, as on other issues, Europe must stick to its principles, think multilaterally and globally - and get its own act together."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
