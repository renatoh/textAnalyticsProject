In a speech in Northampton on Thursday, the Labour leader will condemn Boris Johnson for attempting to set out his legislative agenda despite being well short of a governing majority, and using the traditional Queen\u2019s speech ceremony as a \u201ccynical stunt\u201d. The Labour leader is expected to say: \u201cOn Monday, we will be treated to the farce of Boris Johnson\u2019s Conservative government, amid full pomp and ceremony, setting out an agenda to parliament that it has no intention or means of delivering. \u201cHolding a Queen\u2019s speech before an election is a cynical stunt. Johnson is using the Queen to deliver a pre-election party political broadcast for the Conservative party. \u201cThis government isn\u2019t going to put any legislation before parliament. It has a majority of minus 45, a 100% record of defeat in the Commons and is seeking a general election which will end the parliamentary session the Queen is about to open.\u201d Corbyn will also use his speech \u2013 his first since the party\u2019s autumn conference in Brighton \u2013 to set out his own electoral agenda. Despite rejecting calls for a general election on terms pushed by the Conservatives, Corbyn is to say the party is \u201cchamping at the bit\u201d to go to the polls \u2013 as long as a no-deal Brexit is taken off the table. Labour has said it will not agree to an election until it could be certain that Johnson would adhere to the Benn act, which requires him to request an extension to article 50 on 19 October in case a deal cannot be reached with the EU before then. He will say: \u201cIt wasn\u2019t long ago that Johnson was pretending not to want an election. Now he is pretending that it\u2019s Labour that doesn\u2019t want one. \u201cSo let me address this directly: prime minister, we can\u2019t trust you not to break the law because you\u2019ve got form. We can\u2019t trust you not to use the period of an election campaign to drive our country off a no-deal cliff-edge that will crash our economy, destroy jobs and industries, cause shortages of medicine and food and endanger peace in Northern Ireland. \u201cSo it\u2019s simple: obey the law, take no deal off the table and then let\u2019s have the election. We\u2019re ready and champing at the bit. There\u2019s only one reason it hasn\u2019t happened yet \u2013 we can\u2019t trust you.\u201d Various pre-announced pledges now appear to be forming the core of the party\u2019s electoral strategy and will be highlighted by Corbyn as he suggests there could be a Labour government Queen\u2019s speech within months. He will say the party\u2019s next manifesto will be the \u201cmost radical, hopeful, people-focused programme in modern times\u201d. A \u00a310 an hour minimum wage, a fracking ban, ending rough sleeping, free personal care and prescriptions \u2013 which may cost up to \u00a36bn a year and \u00a3700m a year respectively \u2013 and scrapping tuition fees, which will cost up to \u00a38bn a year, will all be mentioned. The spending pledges of the shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, are estimated by some to cost up to \u00a370bn \u2013 more than \u00a320bn more than their fully costed manifesto for the 2017 snap election. Taxing higher earners and closing down loopholes are among the ways Labour has suggested paying for dramatically increased levels of public spending. On Brexit he will reiterate Labour\u2019s promise of giving voters another referendum on a Brexit deal. He is set to say: \u201cWe might be just weeks away from the first Queen\u2019s speech of a Labour government. \u201cAnd in that Queen\u2019s speech, Labour will put forward the most radical, hopeful, people-focused programme in modern times: a once-in-a-generation chance to rebuild and transform our country \u201cThis is the real thing, not the pale imitation offered by Johnson and his Conservative party.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
