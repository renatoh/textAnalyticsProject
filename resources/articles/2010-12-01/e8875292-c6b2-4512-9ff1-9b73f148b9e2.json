Now, with Andsnes about to step down as director, they have taken the 2010 lineup on tour. Their four-concert Wigmore Hall residency was a mini-festival in its own right. On Sunday, from the two-handed Debussy's Cello Sonata that opened the morning to the closing performance of Honegger's searing Second Symphony, played by a conductorless 22-piece string orchestra, the playing glowed with an easy intimacy. Or \u2013 in the case of Andsnes and Marc-Andr\u00e9 Hamelin's exhilarating crash through the two-piano version of The Rite of Spring that Stravinsky made for the Ballet Russes \u2013 crackled with gung-ho virtuosity. Several of the highlights showcased Swedish clarinettist Martin Fr\u00f6st, whose playing was nothing short of revelatory. Mesmerising in Berg's Four Pieces (Op 5), his constantly inventive eloquence made Mozart's familiar Clarinet Quintet seem quite new. Two works were written especially for Ris\u00f8r. Bent S\u00f8rensen's Schattenlinie brought together Fr\u00f6st, Andsnes and Tomter for five fragile, beautiful miniatures in which the sonorities of the clarinet, piano and viola were delicately merged, every note carefully chosen. The centrepiece of the evening was Rolf Wallin's Under City Skies, a half-hour work for viola, strings and surround-sound in which Tomter's viola solos and the propulsive orchestral rhythms emerged from disembodied city sounds, mythologising the mundane: high heels clacking on pavement, town hall bells, chirping sparrows, a car ignition. The viola soars but always returns to earth; the work might be a Lark Descending or, Wallin suggests, a grimy flipside to Berlioz's Harold in Italy. And, according to Wallin, the car was a Mercedes: nothing in the Ris\u00f8r festival is less than classy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
