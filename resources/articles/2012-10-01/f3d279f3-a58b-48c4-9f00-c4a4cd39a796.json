Hello Small Talk. You're fighting Audley Harrison on Saturday. How's the training going? All the hard work's done really so it's just a matter of doing the maintenance. Keeping healthy and staying injury free. Audley's getting on a bit now. We take it you're confident? I am yeah but he can also present me with a few problems. He's not the fighter that won the Olympic gold medal because, as you say, he's 40, but he still presents a danger. I'll have to be professional. What have you been up to today? I've been doing this photoshoot with Jamie Carragher in the gym. And who do you reckon was better looking? Me of course [laughs]. He's got more of a bent nose than you hasn't he? Yeah, I've got a proper boxer's face but I was still better looking than him. So go on then, what's your day been like? Small Talk likes the humdrum stuff \u2026 Well, I got up and had my Shredded Wheat and a cup of tea, dropped my son off at nursery \u2013 much to his displeasure. He didn't want to go in and was crying. Then I did my last big training camp and hung around for a bit while I waited for Jamie Carragher. I had my lunch. A tuna salad. Not enough to eat really but I had to do the shoot with him so didn't have time to get much. Then I came home and waited while my kit for the Audley fight got delivered. Does it look good? Yeah, it looks smart. Has it got your nickname on it? You're the Power Ranger aren't you? No. Are you messing? [Small Talk shuffles some blank pieces of paper around nervously] Erm, no, that's what it says on Wikipedia \u2026 Is that on there is it? Yeah, it also says that your fourth professional fight was against the former Leeds centre-back Lucas Radebe \u2026 Oh eh, I'm gonna' have to have a little look at that. That's funny that is though. The Power Ranger? That's a good one. [Returns to describing his day] So I had another cup of tea and sorted out some tickets and that with people who owe money for them for the fight and then picked the little 'un up from nursery and just came in and called you really. And Small Talk appreciates it. So you're unbeaten as a pro. What was your record like in the schoolyard? I didn't have many fights outside of boxing but when I did I won them because I made sure I wasn't fighting anyone who was a proper hardknock. I had a few little scuffles on the playground when I was a kid. And in seniors I had a few on the field by where my mum and dad live. A big gang of lads were waiting for me and my dad made me go over to have a fight with two of them. That was character building. Your dad sent you over to have a fight on a field where 30 lads were waiting for you! Yeah, a mate of mine went to St Edward's College and we were in Cardinal Heenan and a gang of lads from West Derby waited for him and gave him a bit of a beating. The next day the lads were there waiting for him again. So I had a little scuffle with them and kicked them up the arse kind of thing. The next night there were about 30 of them waiting on the field and they sent someone over to my mum and dad's house. A little messenger to say that they were waiting for me. I ignored the knock and went back upstairs on the PlayStation and my dad was like: \"Who was that?\" and I'm like: \"Erm no one\". And he said: \"Get some old clothes on\" and he made me go on the field with him and the dog. The adrenaline was pumping and I had a fight with the one they used as bait to get me out of the house. And then I beat up the big bully in the gang too. That was the end of it then. We bet. So we take it you were already boxing by this point? I'd just started but it helped me out. I bust the lad's nose up a bit. You're 6ft 8in tall aren't you? Yeah. Small Talk's got a mate who's pretty tall and he's used to stick when we were out in town. \"Did you fall asleep in a growbag?\" and all those gems. Can't imagine you get much of that? Yeah I do. The only people who say things are the ones who don't know who I am. The only thing they say are: \"You don't look that big on the telly, lad\" and that. But you learn to take the jibes and grow into yourself as you get older. What's the first thing you'll binge on after the Harrison fight? I'm quite lucky. Because I'm a heavyweight I can generally eat most of the things I want. I'll have a full English the next morning. And I love a sly piece of cheesecake after my tea in the week to keep the calories up when I'm training. What's your poison? I went to Las Vegas in July. A good little five-day break with my mates. I had a good go over there as far as drinking was concerned and I haven't had a drink since. So that's 12 weeks without a drink. After the fight I'll probably have a couple of bottles of Corona though. You're a big Liverpool fan aren't you? Do you go to Anfield much? I used to but I prefer to watch them in front of the telly now because going to the match is a bit of an uncomfortable ordeal because of the small seats and the size of me. There was a time when I was more willing to put up with the discomfort for 90 minutes but not now. Sounds like you're a bit dejected. What do you make of Brendan Rodgers? I kind of feel sorry for him because he's passionate about what he believes in. He's a good coach and a good manager but the job is a difficult task. Patience isn't something that's readily available at Liverpool FC. We want everything yesterday. Obviously he wouldn't want anyone feeling sorry for him but the task is monumental. But I'd love to see him succeed. There are promising signs. They look like they're starting to believe in what he believes in which is half the battle. You lived in Anfield when you were at primary school. Did you used to sneak into the match at three-quarter time? We'd be minding cars and then when the gates opened you'd run inand stand at the back at the Kop. We wouldn't even know what the score was but it was great to watch for a bit before we ran back down to collect the money. You're the second Small Talk interviewee to have minded cars outside Anfield. David Fairclough was the first. Did you make much money doing it because we don't think he did? We didn't charge a fee, we just took what they gave you. Sometimes you'd get a generous fella who'd give you a pound. Sometimes you'd just get 10p or something. The thing is round there I was a bit of a softie \u2026 Really? Yeah, the bigger kids would rob your fare off you or say they'd minded the car. Anyway, seen any films recently? I watched Ted at the pictures. Any good? Yeah it was good but I'm a big Family Guy [written by Seth MacFarlane, the Ted director] fan so I already knew the jokes so I was prepared for it a bit. Who's you favourite Family Guy character, Stewie? Nah, Peter Griffin. Do you model yourself on him? A bit dysfunctional \u2026 I'm probably a bit like him, yeah, a bit soft with the kids and that but I've been watching Boardwalk Empire, the Sopranos, even though I've seen them all anyway. When you watch boxing films do you think \"that's not realistic\" \u2026 Nah, I don't try to be too critical because they are just movies. I don't want to be a jobsworth you know. I take it as it is. I love the Rocky films and they're very unrealistic. What music are you listening to at the moment? I've got a massive variation of music. Honest to God, the spectrum of music I listen to is mad. When I'm training I'll have the dancey stuff on like Calvin Harris but I throw a few 80s songs in as well \u2026 What like Wham? Nah, not stereotypical 80s stuff. I like Tears for Fears, a bit of Go West, Flock of Seagulls \u2026 You're not going to walk in to the Pet Shop Boys against Audley are you? No, it's You'll Never Walk Alone for all my fights. What's your favourite vegetable? You know what I love with my roast dinner? Carrot and turnip. Mashed up. That's lovely. I like asparagus as well. Makes your wee smell funny though? That's why I like it [laughs]. Cheese or chocolate? Chocolate. Cadbury's. I love those Star Bars. Small Talk's never had one. Read any good books recently? The last good book I read was four years ago on holiday. My mate gave me the Art of War the other day. He spent a few weeks in prison and read it so he came out and gave it me. It's by Sun Tzu. So he read a book about the planning and conduct of military operations to reform himself? I think he did, yeah. Oh, actually, I read a good book by Donald McRae. He works for the Guardian doesn't he? What's it called? It's about boxing? Is it Dark Trade, the engaging, sympathetically rendered, emotionally direct boxing book? That's the one. We're sure Donald will appreciate the plug. Anyway, do you believe in ghosts? No, I've probably convinced myself I've seen one when I was a kid but I've never seen one and don't believe in religion or anything like that so no. What about time travel? If you could go back in time, when would you go back to? I'd suit being around in the 50s. Post world war two. Would you be a teddy boy? Greasy slicked-back hair and the like \u2026 No. As a boxer I'd be the typical throwback who is an honest fighter. And after the fight I'd put a suit on and a skinny tie and go out for a jolly with everyone congratulating me. Sounds like jazz would be involved. But more importantly, who'd win a fight between a lion and a tiger? Ooh [Laughs]. I'd go with the lion. It's one of my favourite animals. It reminds me a bit of myself. A big strong specimen who's fairly lazy and laid back and likes to sleep a lot. Can you tell us a joke \u2026 [David tells a joke that can't be published]. Can you tell us another joke \u2026 [David tells a joke that only really works verbally but here it is anyway]. A fella walks into a bar with a giraffe and orders two pints of lager. The fella drinks his pint of lager. The giraffe drinks its pint of lager and then collapses on the floor in a heap. The barman says: \"You're not going to leave that lyin' there are you?\" The fella says: \"It's not a lion, it's a giraffe\". Cheers David.
