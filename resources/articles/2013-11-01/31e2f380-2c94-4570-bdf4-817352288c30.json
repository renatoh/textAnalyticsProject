Battered, bruised and heartbroken, their heads drooped and their words felt hollow. Yet in the aftermath of this cruellest of defeats there was optimism in their despair and significant backing for their coach. A decision on Steve McNamara's future is unlikely to be made until the emotion of Saturday's defeat by New Zealand fades. The Rugby Football League appointed McNamara three years ago and his contract will soon expire, yet after a tournament blighted for England with controversy and discipline problems, he can feel proud of their semi-final performance. There were 20 seconds on the clock when Shaun Johnson danced through their defence to silence Wembley and secure the Kiwis a place in the final, against Australia on Saturday. It was the most dramatic of denouements and a difficult one to take. McNamara, who in the summer was linked with a position in union as defensive coach at Bath, said he would not want to relinquish the role of coach. Whether the RFL attempts to extend his contract, even in a part-time capacity, is a matter for conjecture. A statement from the organisation on Sunday read: \"The RFL will now instigate a detailed review of every element of England's operation and performance that will be concluded in the coming months.\" A dejected Sam Burgess, who was a colossus for England and scored what had looked to be the winning try, said McNamara had been fantastic throughout the World Cup despite the controversial alcohol-related incidents at the beginning of the tournament. \"Steve is great. I have had him all through my career since I was about 17. He is a great man and will make his own decisions. He has been fantastic throughout this tournament,\" said Burgess. \"It's tough to look forward at the minute. This is very hard and I just want to congratulate everyone involved. Moving forward, England is strong. We have got some great talent coming through and hopefully it continues to grow. \"It's hard to find words to describe the feeling within the group. I thought we faced a lot of adversity as a team, defended our line on repeat sets. We had a lot of strength and belief there. Sometimes you don't get what you feel you deserve.\" Ryan Hall, who almost gave England an unassailable lead only to slip at the vital moment, added: \"I think Steve has helped us endless amounts. His attitude and his willingness to help this England team speaks volumes. \"It would be great if he had another shot because I think he deserves it. He's had a lot to deal with and I think he's dealt with it very well. We've made a lot of progress. He is a great coach and I love working with him because he has brought some very good games out of myself.\" It was a sentiment echoed by Kevin Sinfield, the captain who led courageously from the front. Sinfield might have missed a crucial conversion after Kallum Watkins had scored England's second try of the afternoon, following the opening score from Sean O'Loughlin, but his role in both their second-half tries was exceptional. Sinfield admitted he would not have the chance to play in another World Cup but would not be drawn on his international future. \"That's not for now,\" he said. \"In the next couple of weeks I am sure what has happened will sink in. I think we have made huge strides over the last three years and over the last six or seven weeks. The squad, our support, everyone involved with English rugby shows that there is a future. \"Thanks to all the fans because their support over the last six weeks shows that England rugby internationals have a future. Certainly they didn't deserve the result in the end but we have got to carry that with us. We gave it everything we had but to be so close but so far away in the end is horrible. \"I think there is an international calendar for the next four or five years when there will be internationals against southern hemisphere teams. That's so important because we have seen how good the World Cup has been and I think on the back of this the support has been tremendous. The RFL have done a fantastic job. Hopefully it is something we can build on and really transform our sport into something that is watched and celebrated nationally.\" In the end, though, New Zealand showed the quality and resolve of true champions. Twice Roger Tuivasa-Sheck crossed the line, the first of his scores being the try of the tournament following a wonderful reverse offload from Dean Whare, and when George Burgess was penalised for a late high tackle on Sonny Bill Williams there was a sense of inevitability when Johnson shimmied his way over the line in the dying seconds. Johnson said: \"[It was] a bit of a blur really, to be honest. I just know I got a pass. I looked up and saw a bit of space on the left edge so I went around that side. I saw someone come at me and was able to beat them and scored.\" Stephen Kearney's side go on to defend their title in Manchester against their southern hemisphere rivals. For England, though, the World Cup dream is over."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
