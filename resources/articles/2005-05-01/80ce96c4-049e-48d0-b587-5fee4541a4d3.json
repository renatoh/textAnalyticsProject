Bulfinch's mythology www.bulfinch.org Suitable for KS3/4/5 pupils &amp; teachers An online edition of Thomas Bulfinch's indispensable guide to myth, legend and fable. The site is easy to use and intelligently presented, allowing users to cross-reference names, stories and places, while the search facility is accurate and extensive. A perfect introduction to the history of mythology. Magic Tales www.magictails.com/creationlinks.html Suitable for KS4 /5 pupils &amp; teachers An information gateway that provides excellent links to a number of creation myths from around the world. Almost all the key stories are covered here (Norse myth is particularly worth a visit) and although the bulk of this site is devoted to ambient music and new age healing, the links provided are reliable and well chosen. Teacher XPress www.teacherxpress.com/f.php?gid=20&amp;id=22 Suitable for KS1/2/3 pupils &amp; teachers Ignore the terrifying music and explore this online museum of myth and fable. While it's not the prettiest site, its selection of stories and pictures is useful and eclectic. Pupils are invited to write their own endings to a number of traditional stories, and to predict the outcomes of existing stories. Rich in Shropshire tales, Canadian myths and stories from India, the site is a good starting point for a storytelling project. Primary resources www.primaryresources.co.uk/ english/english7.htm Suitable for KS1/2/3 pupils &amp; teachers As a collection of lesson ideas and teaching resources, this online database is a little inconsistent. The best materials include the Tales from Camelot pages, which encourage students to engage with stories such as the Sword in the Stone. Lesson ideas are informed by the demands of the literacy hour. Templates for the original myths are available for download, as is an interesting scheme of work for Aesop's Fables. Lyndsey Turner The book Ten Days to Zero, by Bernard Ashley Orchard Books Price \u00a34.99 Age 11-16 yrs Bernard Ashley has been published since the 1970s and the recently reissued The Trouble with Donovan Croft (OUP), his first novel, proves that the trademark intensity of his writing and his finger-on-the-pulse plotting were there from the start. Ten Days to Zero is a brilliantly constructed thriller, and its publication is timed to perfection. The current preponderance of sofa-based interviews with smiling politicians provides a backdrop that feels more contrived than the fictional world Ashley has carved from his in-depth knowledge of current affairs, policing policy, international and local politics, not to mention the dynamics that drive relationships in school, between friends, and between pupils and their teachers. Hopping through various formats - from transcribed tapes to police briefing notes, a rookie journalist's CV and the confidential minutes of a prime minister's meeting - the reader is drawn into a narrative web that is utterly absorbing. There is a filmic quality that will appeal to less committed readers, but Ashley doesn't pander to them. Lindsey Fraser \u00b7 Win a copy of Ten Days to Zero for your school. We have 10 to give away.

The CD-rom MediaStage Immersive Education at www.immersiveeducation.com Price - single user licence: \u00a3350 + VAT Age 14-16 yrs This CD-rom allows students to use sets, props, lights and characters in their production. Characters can be made to stand, sit or walk, and speak using the students' voices. Text can be typed in and converted to speech. The program promotes practical skills and provides opportunities for students to demonstrate their awareness of theory. It is designed to complement technology rather than replace it, so it can resolve difficulties experienced in producing an authentic set, including lights and sound. There are nine units of work, split into four main activities (six for film and TV) and an evaluation suggestion for each activity. English teachers could use sections to consolidate elements of the key stage 3 syllabus. It would also lend itself to aspects of GCSE drama, such as set design. Creating a performance is relatively easy with the features available at the click of a button: five different cameras to move between scenes, advanced graphics, a range of props, 14 characters and four spotlights. This is an outstanding product. For a full evaluation of this program, see www.teem.org.uk. Win a copy of MediaStage for your school. We have 3 single user licences to give away. See below.
