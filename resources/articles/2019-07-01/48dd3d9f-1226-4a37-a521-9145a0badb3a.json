That intriguing comment comes in the middle of an answer about whether or not those players who experienced Premier League football for the first time with Wolves last season, when the Midlands club blazed a trail by taking 16 points off the top six, finishing seventh and qualifying for Europe for the first time in 39 years \u2013 they face Crusaders in the first leg of their second-round Europa League qualifier on Thursday evening \u2013 will be better for the experience. \u201cWe started this season trying to develop, trying to improve. We are not going back trying to repeat the same things we did last pre-season. It doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d Nuno says. \u201cAfter two years of working we are the same people, we know everything. We have to go and look for better solutions, trying to anticipate. I will not give you clues but football is gonna change. \u201cThe football you see now and are reflecting on this season, I will not say next season, but in two seasons\u2019 time, is gonna change. I will not tell you, but there are normal effects of when teams sit, they affect naturally the rest of football. If you consider that \u2026 I am already telling you too many things. This is what we are trying to anticipate. All the managers are quite clear on how they want their teams to play, and how to perform. What I am trying to build and improve is, I know, I suspect, going to change.\u201d Asked whether a new cycle is coming, Nuno replies: \u201cI know a new cycle is coming.\u201d So is he talking about other ways of playing, through different systems? \u201cMmm, OK. You look at that, you look at systems, tactical aspects. But I\u2019m telling you, for sure, in two seasons the football in the Premier League will change.\u201d As with a game of chess, Nuno seems to be thinking a few moves ahead. \u201cIt is a lot like chess,\u201d he adds. \u201cI think all the managers, for sure, we have to anticipate. The best way, it is chess. I tried to put myself inside the other managers\u2019 heads. It is a good exercise. If I played against Wolves, what would I do?\u201d Does he ever win in that scenario? \u201cNever,\u201d replies Nuno, with a wry smile. Nuno has a reputation for being a man of few words when it comes to press conferences and it would be easy to form an opinion on him based on some of those awkward exchanges before or after matches. As anyone who is a regular visitor to Molineux will know, his programme notes are just as brief and would struggle to fill the back of a postcard. Small talk of any description is not really Nuno\u2019s thing. Yet the reality is that, in the right setting, the 45-year-old can be fascinating and engaging company. A couple of weeks ago, the former Valencia and Porto manager sat down with half a dozen journalists at Compton, Wolves\u2019 training ground, and spoke candidly for more than 45 minutes across a wide range of topics, taking in everything from the mental cross-examination he puts himself through after a disappointing performance to the unwavering belief that he has in his own philosophy. \u201cEverybody knows how we play, everybody can see. It is the most important thing, an identity,\u201d Nuno says. \u201cWhen things don\u2019t go so well, what are you gonna grab? Stick to it. It is like Coca-Cola, they never change the recipe. Diet, full sugar, no caffeine, maybe. But the recipe is always there.\u201d Nuno changed the system last season after Wolves picked up only one point from a possible 18, but not his \u201cidea\u201d \u2013 something he talks about a lot. The 3-4-3 that had previously served Wolves so well needed another layer, or an \u201cextra line\u201d as Nuno puts it, to give Wolves \u201cthe capacity to go higher on the pitch\u201d. Deploying R\u00faben Neves in a slightly deeper role was the solution. His overriding message, though, is that the basis of his approach \u2013 seizing the initiative defensively and stealing possession in areas that leave opponents unbalanced and exposed \u2013 will always remain the same. \u201cThe idea never changes,\u201d Nuno adds. \u201cI always look at the way I want to be in the game, even if I don\u2019t have the ball I can be in control of the game \u2026 my defensive process has to be organised and strong enough to control the game. How I do that? By creating trigger points on where I want to recover the ball.\u201d Interestingly, Nuno takes no credit whatsoever for the decision to pair Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez and Diogo Jota up front midway through the season and the way that those two dovetailed so beautifully thereafter. \u201cThat is luck,\u201d he says, almost dismissively. \u201cOne day I went: \u2018Let\u2019s try.\u2019 Quality and talent of the players and dedication, belief \u2013 the way they believe in what you say and propose, it is always about that. You can have the brightest of ideas you can imagine, but if your players don\u2019t believe \u2013 pah.\u201d Presumably, though, it is Nuno who engenders that belief? \u201cThey give to me, honestly. It is the other way around.\u201d When it goes wrong, however, it is Nuno who shoulders the blame. So much so that his family would like to see him smile now and again. \u201cThey say I should enjoy it more. They say: \u2018Even when you lose you shouldn\u2019t be so down.\u2019 But how can you not be down? When the team doesn\u2019t play good you go home and you say: \u2018Why? Why? Why? Why?\u2019 And you go around the \u2018why\u2019 and the \u2018how?\u2019 It\u2019s very hard to enjoy.\u201d One of the few occasions when Nuno did have genuine reason to feel low was after the FA Cup semi-final defeat against Watford in April, when Wolves threw away a 2-0 lead with 11 minutes remaining. Yet even then there was much to admire about the way his players responded, taking 10 points from their last five matches to secure seventh spot. \u201cIt was a tough moment. It can disrupt a season and create problems but we reacted very well,\u201d says Nuno. \u201cAfter the result at Southampton [the week after Watford], the way we performed with steel and making our grief, if you can say that \u2026 we had a moment to gel and put the past behind you and look forward. The boys did fantastically.\u201d Although the transfer window has been frustrating so far for Wolves, pre-season has been rewarding in other ways. Wolves defeated Newcastle 4-0 before beating Manchester City on penalties in Shanghai on Saturday to win the Premier League Asia Trophy. That competition may rank low on their list of priorities this season but it meant a lot to Fosun, the club\u2019s ambitious Chinese owners, and Nuno recognised that afterwards. The Portuguese handed his winners\u2019 medal over to Guo Guangchang, Fosun\u2019s chairman, as soon as he walked off. The pursuit of more silverware starts with Thursday\u2019s first leg against Northern Irish side Crusaders. It is the first European tie that Wolves have taken part in since 1980, when they lost 3-2 on aggregate to PSV Eindhoven in the old Uefa Cup, and the fact that it is a 30,000 sell-out says everything about the mood around Molineux these days. \u201cThis is what we work for,\u201d says Nuno, smiling. \u201cWe work to give joy to the fans. If the fans are not happy, what\u2019s the point?\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
