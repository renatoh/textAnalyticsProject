The former Everton manager has been lined up to return to the role he performed in similar circumstances during the 2017-18 season, with West Ham just one point above the relegation zone after four successive home defeats and just two wins in all competitions since late September. Pellegrini was informed of the decision to sack him despite holding his post-match press conference following the loss to an under-strength Leicester side featuring nine changes from their defeat to Liverpool on Boxing Day. West Ham left the pitch to a chorus of boos from the few home supporters that remained and the news that Pellegrini had been sacked was delivered less than 90 minutes after the final whistle. \u201cWest Ham United can confirm that Manuel Pellegrini has left the club with immediate effect,\u201d read a club statement. \u201cJoint-Chairmen David Sullivan and David Gold, along with the Board and everyone at West Ham United, would like to place on record their thanks to Manuel for his service over the past 18 months.\u201d Sullivan added: \u201cIt is with great disappointment that we\u2019ve had to make this decision. Manuel is a gentleman and it has been a real pleasure to work with someone of his calibre. However, it has become clear that a change is required to get the club back on track in line with our ambitions this season. We felt it was necessary to act now in order to give the new manager as much time as possible to try and achieve that goal.\u201d Having been allowed to leave at the end of his six-month contract in May 2018 after guiding West Ham away from trouble, Moyes is likely to demand a longer deal this time if he is to return. Chris Hughton, Tony Pulis and Bournemouth\u2019s Eddie Howe understood to be among others under consideration, along with Enzo Maresca, Pellegrini\u2019s Italian assistant. The Chilean \u2013 who was appointed as a replacement for Moyes and guided West Ham to 10th in his first season in charge \u2013 is likely to be followed out of the club by the sporting director, Mario Husillos. The first\u2011team coach, Kevin Keen, has been lined up to take charge for the crucial game against Bournemouth on New Year\u2019s Day. The 66-year-old had 18 months left on his contract and West Ham are expected to pay him up to \u00a310m in compensation to seal his exit. Asked after the Leicester defeat if he would still be in charge for Bournemouth\u2019s visit to the London Stadium, the former Manchester City manager seemed resigned to his fate. \u201cThat\u2019s a question I can\u2019t answer,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t depend on me. I must continue working the way we are doing and try to recover our trust in what we are doing.\u201d Pellegrini also admitted that the disastrous run of form that has seen West Ham slip from fifth place at the end of September into a relegation dogfight had been down to a lack of confidence among the players. \u201cWithout any doubt they lack confidence,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know the players can perform better. The only way to do it is to have one clear idea, and not make changes. When we get a result here the players will have more confidence. \u201cThe fans deserve better results and a better performance from the team so I understand their reaction completely. I must continue working. We need to find a way to recover our trust and win our next game.\u201d But that task will now fall to someone else."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
