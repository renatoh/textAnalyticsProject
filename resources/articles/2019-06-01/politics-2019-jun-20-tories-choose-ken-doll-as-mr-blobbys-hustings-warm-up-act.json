Here was the Tory party laid bare. A respectability that was barely skin deep. Values and probity jettisoned in the venal pursuit of power. Prior to Cheryl Gillan, the acting chair of the 1922 Committee, announcing the result, Michael Gove\u2019s team had been quietly confident he had the numbers. He hadn\u2019t. Jeremy Hunt had squeezed home by two votes. Gavin Williamson, Boris Johnson\u2019s campaign manager, had seen to that. Johnson had never wanted to go into a re-run of the referendum psychodrama with Gove during the hustings of the party members. A man who knew exactly where all his bodies were buried and would look forward to their exhumation. He wanted Ken Doll Hunt. One of nature\u2019s natural followers who could be relied on to give him an easy ride. The next few weeks would now be a coronation march. Ken Doll, the former head boy of Charterhouse and one of British Airways\u2019 top long-haul cabin stewards, might feel he has been underestimated all his life. But the priapic Mr Blobby had never underestimated him. He had known all along exactly how useless Ken really was and was determined to exploit it to the full. Ken had never found an audience he couldn\u2019t underwhelm. Familiarity breeds contempt. As the leadership race entered its end game on Thursday morning, there was none of the hustle outside committee room 14 that there had been during the previous rounds. Many MPs who had formerly been desperate to be noticed and asked how they had voted had now chosen to take the day off to go to Ascot. They all knew it was going to eventually end with Mr Blobby as prime minister so they might as well let someone else vote for them by proxy. Andrea Jenkyns arrived with her two-year old son, Clifford, who had been delegated to vote on behalf of his father, Jack Lopresti. The tellers initially looked dubious until Clifford explained that he had a higher IQ than his mother and father combined. Team Saj had advanced down the corridor en masse only to stop outside the door for a group photo. It all had an end-of-term, demob-happy feel. Javid knew his time was up and he hadn\u2019t embarrassed himself by coming fourth. He could now quite happily switch allegiance to Mr Blobby, safe in the knowledge he was guaranteed one of the top jobs in the next cabinet. One that Johnson had already promised to two other people. The battle to become the next chancellor looked like it was going to have to be settled with an arm-wrestling contest between Javid, Matt Hancock and Liz Truss. Otherwise it had been business as usual. Ken Doll exuded mild panic. His voice said he was quietly confident, his eyes screamed: \u201cBrace, brace.\u201d Gove tried not to look too shifty. Always tricky as not even his shadow really trusts him. Mr Blobby maintained his sphinx-like silence when asked in an interview with the Evening Standard to clarify his remarks that he was going to do for the country what he had done for London. Which presumably means that he intends to waste a lot of money on vanity projects and do bugger all. Theresa May came and went with the same \u201cnone of your business\u201d bantz that wasn\u2019t bantz. She can misjudge the mood of any room. She was determined to end her time in office the way she had started it. As a Maybot. The first count produced a few surprises. Though Javid went out as expected, Gove narrowly leap-frogged Ken Doll into second place. The main talking point though was that there had been two spoilt ballots. Overall the biggest percentage point gain of any candidate. Maybe there was still hope for the country after all. Some thought that Walking Rory Stewart was responsible for one of them. The other probably belonged to Dominic Raab. AKA The Esher Ripper. There was blood round the edges, its throat had been slit and the body had been buried under three feet of concrete. It was deja vu all over again in the afternoon for the final shootout between Ken Doll and Gove for the privilege of being Mr Blobby\u2019s warm-up act for the three weeks of hustings before the Tory party members. Most of whom were over 55 and had voted for the Brexit party in the EU elections. Living the democratic dream. The atmosphere was slightly more febrile, but only just. Most were relieved it was all but over. Soon they could get back to their lives and come off the temazepam. Some MPs scuttled away, others stayed to offer the gravest of verdicts. The Tory party was at a period of existential crisis. So was the country. We were so divided that even the union was in doubt. Now more than ever, we needed a leader who could bring everyone together. But despite all this, they were still going to vote for Mr Blobby. There may be multiple Mr Blobbies but it didn\u2019t really matter which one we got. We either got the clown who lied or the liar who clowned. \u201cI\u2019m just off to slit my wrists,\u201d one MP whispered to me. Pass the razor blades. \u2022 This article was amended on 21 June 2019 because an earlier version called the 1922 committee the 1992 committee. This has been corrected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
