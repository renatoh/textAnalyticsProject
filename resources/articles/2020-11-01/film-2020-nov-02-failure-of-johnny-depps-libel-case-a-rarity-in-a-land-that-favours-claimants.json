The actor\u2019s decision to sue the Sun\u2019s publisher, Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Group Newspapers, over its claim that he was a \u201cwife beater\u201d, led to the very public airing of dirty laundry in a London courtroom and a conclusion that the newspaper\u2019s accusation was based in fact. But the wider legal and media implications of the case could be more to do with the fact that attempts by Depp to undermine the account of his ex-wife Amber Heard, the Sun\u2019s key witness, failed to pass muster with the judge. Mark Stephens, a media specialist at the law firm Howard Kennedy, welcomed the fact that attempts to undermine Heard\u2019s account by portraying her as a hoaxer or a gold digger had failed: \u201cIf those gendered tropes had been successful, they would have been replicated. The fact they have been picked apart forensically, in those circumstances, is complete vindication.\u201d He said it was one of a series of recent cases which show courts increasingly understand the nuances of domestic abuse: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a series of cases where men have been suing women to silence them over abuse. I hope this emboldens victims and news organisations to speak up to cover this abuse.\u201d At other Fleet Street titles there appeared to be admiration that News Group Newspapers had fought the case to the end, given the legal bills for both sides will run into the millions. An early settlement could have substantially reduced the financial risk but would have been taken as a vindication of Depp. News Group Newspapers declined to comment on whether it had had an opportunity to settle the case before trial. Media law trainer David Banks said the Sun had taken on a substantial risk by fighting the case, especially since it was required to prove the fundamental claim that Depp was a wife beater: \u201cTruth has always been a difficult defence \u2013 and if you mount it and lose, the consequences are dreadful.\u201d One key factor is that Heard was willing to subject herself to cross-examination in a London courtroom during a pandemic, even though this meant requiring security to arrive at court and facing a barrage of verbal and online abuse. \u201cIt could quite easily have gone another way if you had gone to court with a witness that wasn\u2019t as prepared to go into the witness box and take that kind of punishment,\u201d said Banks. \u201cIn lots of circumstances like this a lot of titles like this would still be trying to settle it. The Sun are happy today but I imagine they are delighted and relieved.\u201d Although the UK still has a reputation as a country that favours libel claimants over publishers, changes to libel laws approved by parliament in 2013 have changed the environment. Potential damages have been reduced and there are increased incentives to settle libel cases before they reach court \u2013 which is why the Depp case was such as a rarity. Stephens said the long-term impact could be a public debate on how Heard was treated in court: \u201cThe precedent is really around how we cross-examine victims of abuse \u2013 and secondly how we prevent witnesses at court cases being abused and attacked on their way into court.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
