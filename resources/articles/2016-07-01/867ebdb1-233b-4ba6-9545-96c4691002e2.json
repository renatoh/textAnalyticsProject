In his first interview since taking office, Erik Solheim told the Guardian it was vital that supranational decisions continued for problems such as pollution and wildlife crime which crossed borders, and could not be dealt with by states acting alone. He said: \u201cThe UK can relate to the EU\u2019s climate decisions and be covered by them, just as Norway and Switzerland are. Norway brought its emissions into the Emissions Trading System (ETS) and adopted nearly all of the EU\u2019s environmental law. You can coordinate closely with the EU even if you\u2019re outside it.\u201d Pledges made by pro-Brexit ministers to scrap the birds and habitats directive \u201cin the heat of the campaign\u201d should not set the tenor of post-Brexit environmental policy, he said. \u201cIt is very, very important to defend these regional environmental mechanisms as there is no way we can protect migratory animals like birds in just one habitat. You need global or regional agreements and I\u2019m absolutely confident that the UK will remain committed to this, whatever happens.\u201d Maintaining environmental progress that the EU had driven forward would require \u201chuge coordination in Europe, which will have to be done by the EU,\u201d he argued. Populist opposition to regional cooperation agreements championed by the international community has spread far beyond the UK. Many analysts see echoes of the Brexit campaign\u2019s mobilisation of globalisation\u2019s victims in the appeal of the US presumptive presidential nominee, Donald Trump. Asked about Trump\u2019s pledge to bin the Paris climate agreement, Solheim said there was a \u201chuge danger\u201d in politicians taking anti-scientific positions on climate change when it suited them. \u201cThose who want to fight against the Paris agreement do so at their own peril,\u201d he said. \u201cThey will lose jobs and not be at cutting edge of new technologies. Those who want to fight for the old instead of embracing the new will lose.\u201d Trump has also welcomed the Brexit vote as a \u201cgreat victory\u201d in a binary battle between \u201cthe people\u201d and \u201cthe elites\u201d. But the disintegration of the EU would be a \u201ccatastrophe\u201d for conservation efforts, and could threaten Europe\u2019s very survival, Solheim said. \u201cThere is no doubt that if the EU had not been created, someone would have needed to invent it. Europe cannot survive without the EU. We need decisions which are supranational, and if the EU were to completely disintegrate, that would be a catastrophe for Europe. It is not going to happen.\u201d The EU is thought to have the world\u2019s largest body of environmental legislation. In the aftermath of the UK\u2019s leave vote, figures such as the billionaire financier George Soros warned that the EU\u2019s disorderly demise was now \u201cpractically irreversible\u201d. Solheim pinpointed one key lesson from the Brexit campaign: \u201cEnvironmental issues need to be framed in a way that is much closer to people\u2019s hearts and cannot be abstracted.\u201d \u201cPollution is an issue that is affecting you, your children and the planet in the here and now,\u201d he added. As director of the United Nations Environment Programme (Unep), Solheim will be prioritising action on pollution, protection for the world\u2019s oceans and green fund-raising from big financial players. A former Norwegian environment minister and socialist politician, Solheim has had a distinguished career. He also served as a diplomat who negotiated a truce in fighting between the Sri Lankan government and Tamil Tigers in 2002. Before arriving at Unep, he spent three years as head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (OECD) development assistance committee, and will bring a financial acuity to the UN\u2019s conservation work. One way of addressing fears of investor flight to Frankfurt and Paris diminishing London\u2019s status as a global money hub, would be to declare it a \u201cgreen financial centre,\u201d he said. Clear statements of commitment to EU environmental policies, such as the ETS, by the \u201cmain actors\u201d in the Labour and Conservative parties would help to address investor uncertainty in the here and now, he said. Like Norway, the UK could remain a member of the ETS and subscribe to virtually all of the EU\u2019s climate and environment legislation, while keeping the ability to launch independent diplomatic demarches. \u201cNorway has utilised the space of not being an EU member to pursue peace initiatives in different parts of the world which would probably have been more difficult if it was in the EU,\u201d he said. \u201cIt allows the space to take global leadership on some issues.\u201d Norway and the UK were \u201clike twins\u201d in many ways, he added."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
