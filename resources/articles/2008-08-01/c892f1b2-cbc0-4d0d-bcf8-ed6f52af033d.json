Armando Iannucci, who has made a string of acclaimed comedies for the BBC, said Britain needed its own rival to HBO, the American cable network that has become synonymous with distinctive, intelligent drama and comedy. He said a new, subscription-funded channel would free the BBC from its regulatory shackles and unleash a torrent of creativity. US subscription networks have been able to invest in slow-burning, complex dramas without the twin pressures of chasing ratings because of their advertisers, or justifying commissioning decisions to licence-fee payers. \"What I feel is missing from our screens is a channel that encourages adventurism and experimentation, backed by money,\" he told an audience of broadcasting executives at the MediaGuardian Edinburgh International TV festival. \"A channel that becomes home of the best programme-makers, the best writers, the best directors and most visionary producers and format creators, a channel that becomes a brand for what is new and surprising but not compromised by the pressures of advertising or too tightly targeted an audience.\" The likes of HBO, Showtime and Comedy Central have become home to what is often lauded as some of the best television in the world, with recent hits including The Daily Show, Mad Men and Curb Your Enthusiasm. \"Uninhibited by the need to placate advertisers, the subscription networks have been given the opportunity to experiment, but on a big rather than timid scale,\" said Iannucci. He said they had also raised the bar for their major network rivals, resulting in a wave of original, high-concept shows such as Heroes, Lost and Prison Break. Those shows have also tended to sell well around the world and attract committed, loyal followings who will shell out for DVD box sets and related merchandise. Iannucci, whose hit The Thick of It mocked the world of politics, passionately defended the BBC but said it was inevitable its funding would be cut in the coming years and that \"whatever the BBC says and does, it will get it in the neck\". \"Let's take a wager that the BBC brand is the best TV brand in the world, that people will pay for that brand,\" he said. \"Let it hold on to all of its free channels and radio stations, but let it also build a new subscription service that will provide the very best in what the British television industry, the best in the world, can do.\" The programmes could eventually be shown on the free-to-air networks, and help could be made available for those who couldn't afford to subscribe, he said. A survey conducted by the BBC during the last debate about the level of the licence fee found that three-quarters of the viewing public wanted new services to be funded by subscription. Iannucci, who has his own comedy unit based at the BBC's TV Centre, said channel controllers in the UK had become overly prescriptive in recent years about the formats they required and the audiences they wanted to target, instead of trusting creative talent. At the BBC, he said, producers were in danger of being squeezed between a mass-market BBC1 and lesser-resourced digital channels such as BBC3 and BBC4. He said his plan for a subscription channel would help the BBC fight back against its critics. \"There's too much at stake, too vital a contribution to our culture, to let its critics start to pull it apart now. I want it to fight back with all the energy and resources it has. More specifically, I want it to plug a gap I still see in the British TV market, one which, once filled, can give the individual programme-maker the impetus to make the distinctive, the surprising, the lavish, the intimate, the experimental, unhampered by the constraints the BBC normally has to operate under.\" He admitted he wasn't \"going to begin to pretend how the economics of this would work\" and the idea would be likely to raise further complaints from rivals already up in arms about the BBC's increasingly aggressive commercial arm. During another festival session yesterday, Time Out founder Tony Elliott attacked the BBC for being \"out of control\" following its purchase of travel guidebook publisher Lonely Planet. Iannucci also echoed an earlier call from Peter Fincham, ITV's director of television, who delivered the keynote MacTaggart lecture at the festival on Friday, not to confuse myriad new-media outlets with a diminished desire from viewers for high-quality programmes to watch on them. Broadcasters such as BBC, ITV and Channel 4 are coming under pressure as the historical models that have supported them collapse, leading to some of the optimism generated by Fincham's rallying cry draining away over the weekend as their futures were debated. But for programme-makers, Iannucci said it was a \"profoundly exciting moment in television for the creative talent\" because their work was now available to a global audience. He said he was amazed at the upsurge in interest in British comedy in the US, which has partly come about because it is now easy for US executives to sample it online. US hits The Wire (HBO) Sprawling, Shakespearean crime tale set in Baltimore and sporting a huge cast. Regularly cited as a favourite show by television executives addicted to the DVD box sets. Now in its fifth and final season. The Sopranos (HBO) Another regular contender for \"greatest show ever\", the tale of a New Jersey mafia clan ran for six series between 1999 and 2007, when it came to an ambiguous end. The Daily Show (Comedy Central) Jon Stewart's caustic take on the daily news has introduced a new satirical tone to America's news landscape. Battlestar Galactica (Sci-Fi Channel) Ronald D Moore's remake of the 1970s science fiction show has won several Emmy awards and was rapturously received by critics as an allegory of American foreign policy. Mad Men (AMC) Critically acclaimed drama tracking the changing attitudes of 1960s America through the eyes of fast-talking Madison Avenue ad men."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
