Labour, the Liberal Democrats, the SNP, the Greens and Plaid Cymru all expressed concern about the prime minister\u2019s relationship with Trump, with Nicola Sturgeon saying he should \u201csup with a very long spoon\u201d in dealing with him. Jo Swinson, the Lib Dem leader, was applauded for a speech condemning Trump for his comments on women and religious minorities, while Richard Burgon, Labour\u2019s shadow justice secretary, accused Trump and Johnson of \u201cconspiring\u201d together. Asked by an audience member whether the special relationship should stay special under Trump, Swinson said: \u201cIt seems like there\u2019s three people in the special relationship. Boris Johnson, Nigel Farage and Donald Trump. \u201cWe obviously have a hugely important relationship with the US. But make no mistake, the current occupant of the White House is not somebody who shares our values. \u201cThis is someone who has boasted about sexually assaulting women, whose policies are discriminatory against people from different religious backgrounds and is separating parents from their children at the border. And we should be very careful with that relationship. The last thing we should have done is roll out the red carpet for a state visit.\u201d Burgon delivered an even more hard-hitting attack on Johnson and Trump, saying: \u201cLook at the Muslim ban that Trump brought in. Look at the caging of migrant children. Look at the way he threatens war. \u201cOf course, he wants to conspire with Boris Johnson and the leader of the Brexit party in order to get his fat cat friends access to the NHS.\u201d Farage interrupted with \u201cnot true, lies, open lies\u201d, and later launched into a defence of Trump as \u201cour most important friend in the world\u201d. When challenged by Swinson over Trump\u2019s comments about sexually assaulting women, talking about grabbing then by the pussy, Farage said: \u201cIt was crass and it was crude and it was wrong. And men say dreadful things sometimes. But if all of us were caught out after a night out with a drink then none of us would be here. I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve lived the purest life of anyone and never said a word wrong about anyone.\u201d In the spin room where cheerleaders for the parties were preparing to defend their bosses\u2019 performance, there was disbelief and a fair amount of shock across the political spectrum when Farage defended Trump saying that \u201cmen say dreadful things sometimes\u201d. Si\u00e2n Berry, the co-leader of the Greens, said: \u201cWhat about all those rallies where people are shouting \u2018send her home\u2019?\u201d He replied: \u201cListen, American politics is in many ways more divided than ours \u2026 you are so anti-American that your hatred comes above our national interest.\u201d Adam Price, the leader of Plaid Cymru, hit back at Farage\u2019s defence of Trump, saying: \u201cIt can never be acceptable for a man to talk about grabbing a woman\u2019s pussy and if you think it is you should be ashamed of yourself.\u201d He added that it was wrong for the prime minister to have referred to gay men like himself as \u201cbum boys in tank tops\u201d and Muslim women in burqas as looking like letterboxes. Rishi Sunak, the Conservative representative, tried to stay out of the fray, saying Johnson was right to have a good working relationship with the US leader as well as EU leaders. \u201cThe relationship we have with America is incredibly important for keeping us safe. That is not something to turn your nose up at,\u201d he said. But he jumped in to try to defend Johnson\u2019s record on LGBT rights, claiming Johnson was the first senior Conservative politician to support same-sex marriage. Elsewhere in the debate, the politicians retrod familiar ground on the issues of the NHS, Brexit and security. Sunak accused Labour of making \u201cbaseless allegations\u201d by claiming that the health service is for sale to Trump. \u201cThe real risks to the NHS are your reckless plans for the economy, Richard, which will mean there isn\u2019t money to invest, and silly plans like the four-day week,\u201d Sunak said. Burgon replied: \u201cIt is not Labour\u2019s policy to have a four-day week in the National Health Service.\u201d John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has said that a four-day week would apply across the whole of society including the NHS as a target to work towards over the next decade."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
