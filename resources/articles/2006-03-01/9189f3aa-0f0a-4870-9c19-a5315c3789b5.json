Nacho, a six-month-old tabby, crept out of his owner's house in Bristol on Sunday and slid into a neighbour's Vauxhall Astra. When he failed to come home that night, his owner, Natalie Roberts, began to worry. \"He doesn't usually go any further than the end of the garden,\" said Miss Roberts, 24. \"The next morning I went to work, fearing he may have been hit by a car.\" The RSPCA telephoned to say that Nacho had turned up in Liverpool, where her neighbour had driven a friend. He was discovered after passers-by heard meowing from the bonnet. Miss Roberts was traced through her pet's microchip. \"He had burns on his tail, which will need an operation, and some other small burns, but apart from that it's like it never happened,\" she said. Nacho may have had a motive for running away. \"He was due to be neutered this week,\" she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
