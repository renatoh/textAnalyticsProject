That was just another role compared with this. Maxxx is the passion project that the London-born Fagbenle has long wanted to make. After several false starts, it has finally made it to our screens, in a primetime Thursday evening slot on Channel 4, with the full series available to watch on All 4. Fagbenle writes and stars as the title character, a washed-up boyband member who ekes out a living for himself and his adopted teenage son, Amit (Alan Asaad), with demeaning PAs in backwater nightclubs. Maxxx attempts to evade this bleak reality by abusing all manner of prescription pills and holding steadfast to the belief that he could win back his supermodel ex (played by a real-life supermodel, Jourdan Dunn), if only he were allowed to relaunch his music career. To do that, though, he is going to have to find a way of collaborating with Tamzin (Pippa Bennett-Warner), the uptight, bean-counting manager to whom he has been assigned by record company exec Don (Christopher Meloni). The excesses of celebrity culture are easy pickings for satirists, and this show\u2019s immediate problem is that so many others have been there before. Surely, between them, The Comeback, BoJack Horseman, Entourage and The Other Two have already milked dry every miserable, surreal experience of the post-famous and the fame-adjacent? Counting in Maxxx\u2019s favour, however, is an evident willingness to squeeze these familiar characters and set-ups for every last drop of comedy. The industry party that Maxxx attends at Don\u2019s house, for instance, is a burlesque bacchanal showcasing costume designer Joanna Hir\u2019s flair for lewks that teeter enjoyably on the brink of AbFab absurdity. No one would ever wear that in public \u2026 or would they? Maybe we\u2019ve just been going to the wrong parties? The series has also been cast with thoughtful consideration for the under-utilised skills of Fagbenle\u2019s fellow frustrated thesps. The relative newcomer Assad gets to showcase his talent as Maxxx\u2019s sweetly loyal, possibly queer-identifying son (\u201cDad says I don\u2019t mash enough gash,\u201d he innocently informs Tamzin). At the other end of the experience scale, there is Meloni. He spent 12 years looking stern on Law &amp; Order: SVU and is now finally able to let it all hang out \u2013 literally, in that kilt \u2013 as the larger-than-life Don. Bennett-Warner must also be enjoying sending up her usual typecasting as a prim, highly educated professional (see BBC One\u2019s Roadkill) and the ever-welcome presence of PhoneShop\u2019s Javone Prince is just a treat for everyone. Maxxx himself also offers a lesser-seen comic perspective (at least in the current context of a British television industry still chasing the next Fleabag, meaning every white woman with self-esteem issues can get a six-episode commission). He is a good-looking, mixed-race man on the wrong side of 40 (\u201cI\u2019m half white, actually \u2026\u201d he corrects one lascivious older women who is intent on fetishising a black man). He is a single parent in a stalled career and deep, deep in denial about all of it. Still, Maxxx\u2019s narcissism has some justification since, as becomes apparent in later episodes, he is a talented songwriter \u2013 albeit with neither the taste nor the integrity to fight for his better creative instincts. (Fagbenle himself is a multi-instrumentalist who performed at the Royal Albert Hall before his acting career took off). As a comic creation Maxxx is not as gloriously daft as Jamie Demetriou\u2019s Stath in Stath Lets Flats or as pathetically deluded as The Office\u2019s David Brent; he\u2019s not, therefore, nearly as funny, either. But there is reason to trust in Fagbenle\u2019s feel for his own character: he has been developing Maxxx since he was a baby Comedy Blap, after all. As the series progresses, what we lose in belly laughs might be made up in poignant moments or savage satirical insights. In one of those aforementioned false starts, episode one first aired on E4 back in April, before being pulled in a flurry of confusing press statements. Perhaps this primetime reschedule reflects Channel 4\u2019s belated appreciation of Maxxx\u2019s challenge to at least one lazy showbiz assumption: not everything produced by people of colour is youth-skewed and \u2013 to use the dreaded euphemism \u2013 \u201curban\u201d. Certainly not if Cheltenham Ladies\u2019 College scholar Tamzin and her naff new act have anything to do with it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
