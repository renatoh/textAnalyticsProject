As well as the opportunity to get involved, this is a chance to address a key problem affecting many young people: gangs. If only the Montagues and Capulets in Romeo and Juliet could have been persuaded to divert their energies into a football competition or a mini-Olympics. Absurd? Particularly in doublet and hose, perhaps. But today such activities are being used to break down the barriers of suspicion, harboured grievance and territorial divisions that affect young people in tough inner-city areas. Sport Relief funds are helping to support such initiatives. Ask pupils what \"gang\" suggests. It is likely that the main images conjured up will be of a highly organised unit, with distinct hierarchies, dedicated to criminal activities and prepared to assert its authority through violence. The victims of gang warfare may also crop up. Yet recent research sponsored by the charity Leap suggests that only a minority of groups function in this highly antisocial way. Working out where such images come from might prove interesting, too. Films and television present this negative model over and over again, and newspaper reporting frequently uses the term \"gang\" as shorthand for all sorts of groupings. Invite students to suggest other \"associations\" that could be described as gangs. Nor are gangs inevitably male. Recent research at one south-east London girls' school revealed patterns of allegiance and violence that shadowed the structure of local boy gangs. Another term to unravel is the word \"enemy\". Such an activity is key to the reconciliation work that Leap undertakes. \"It is often the case that the enemies young people are defending themselves from have more in common with them than differences,\" explains Jessie Feinstein, the charity's gangs worker. \"Many gangs are very mixed ethnically. Getting young people to recognise that their enemies are almost identical to themselves can be a crucial step in reconciliation work.\" Follow Leap's lead by discussing with your pupils what benefits might arise from being a member of a gang or street group. Friendship, belonging, excitement, status, self-protection and even family history might emerge. It has also been suggested that group/gang membership can provide young people with the kind of unquestioning loyalty and support they do not get from chaotic home circumstances. This, too, requires exploring. Leap refrains from attacking gang membership in its youth training. Instead it gets young people to explore the costs - this is an activity that could be revealing in most schools or classes. At its most extreme, gang membership is dangerous. It can tie the individual to a pattern of responses over which they cease to have control, which may mean protecting other gang members' antisocial behaviour. Membership can also mean having horizons permanently reduced to the few streets the gang considers its own. \"This is why getting young people from the different groups away on residential trips together is crucial,\" explains Jimmy Wilson, the integration officer for Fare, who works with the gangs of the Easterhouse estate in Glasgow. Get students to consider how membership of a sports team might supply many of the benefits that come with being part of a group or gang. As well as the need to work cooperatively and be physically strong, and the possible admiration attendant on success, there is also a target to overcome - not an \"enemy\" but an \"opponent\". \"Sports can also offer young people the chance to interact with positive adults,\" says Anthony Gentle, Lewisham mentor and youth American football coach. \"American football is all about strategy and problem-solving - when things go wrong the emphasis is always upon finding out why.\" Ask students to work out the kinds of physical and social skills each sport offers. What sports would they recommend as most likely to break down barriers between rival groups of young people? The success of Fitzrovia Youth in Action suggests football is ideal as a bridge-building sport. Over the past few years the project has managed to create a borough-wide seven-a-side competition that requires gangs to travel from their patch to venues in other territories. Ensuring the games go smoothly has involved recruiting and training lots of local older young people as stewards. This combination of sport and targeted youth work ensures the benefits of the competition extend beyond the tournament itself. This lesson is written for key stage 3 (age 11-14) but can be adapted for other ages. Key stage 2 (age 7-11) The Easterhouse estate in Glasgow has been affected by gang conflict for more than 50 years. Charity Fare recently organised a highly successful mini-Olympics there, involving 17 schools. It also conducts in-school training with primary school pupils, catching them just before the age when they typically graduate to gang membership. Use art, poetry and biographical writing to help pupils explore their childhoods and any experiences of community conflict. Put students' geography skills to work mapping their local area, marking the places where they feel vulnerable or that are considered contested ground. Conduct a school gang audit and carry out a detailed local history project getting pupils to unravel the past development of their communities. Unravelling the past can help children see how relative current territorial patterns are. With such understanding comes the possibility of perspective and choice. Another tactic is to use circle time to introduce a series of philosophical discussion topics concerning identity, conflict and loyalty. Key stage 4 (age 14-16) In its reconciliation work in schools, Leap uses a variety of drama techniques to help boys explore their choices. By asking students to use frozen tableaux showing the before, during and after of a variety of situations, it is possible to get them to reflect on alternative courses of action. Similarly, forum theatre techniques, involving an audience pausing scenes to pose questions to characters, have proved very effective. This gives young people the chance to explore what it is to say \"no\", and to have that experience to call on, should a similar situation arise. Another key issue is getting students to reflect on the consequences of their actions, particularly violence. A study of media depictions of violence could be an effective way of addressing this issue.
