The chancellor is unhappy with the prime minister\u2019s decision to set out plans to spend up to \u00a327bn on education over three years, including building new schools and paying teachers higher wages. He is understood to believe May should not be binding the hands of her successor with big spending commitments. The Press Association initially reported Hammond was on the brink of quitting over the row between No 10 and No 11 in what would be an extraordinary move just weeks before the prime minister leaves office. A senior government source told the Guardian Hammond was \u201cfrustrated\u201d and may have threatened to resign but he was unlikely to do so. \u201cIt\u2019s not that he doesn\u2019t recognise there are pressures,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe believes strongly that decisions on long-term spending should be made by the next person. They will have pressures relating to their Brexit proposal and need to be able to consider bids in the round.\u201d No 10 is asking Hammond to free up money from the \u00a327bn \u201cwar chest\u201d he set aside in case of a no-deal Brexit to fund the plans. A Downing Street source told PA: \u201cIt is a fact though that school funding in England is at its highest ever level \u2013 rising from almost \u00a341bn in 2017-18 to \u00a343.5bn by 2019-20. \u201cBut while there\u2019s more money going into our schools than ever before, we know they face budgeting challenges. \u201cThe education secretary has been clear he will back headteachers to have the resources they need to deliver a world-class education.\u201d May\u2019s tenure in No 10 will end next month, and she has already sought to define her legacy with pledges to tackle climate change, mental health and modern slavery. On Monday, she set out plans for new teachers to receive training on how to spot the signs of mental health problems in youngsters, under a plan to overhaul society\u2019s approach to the issue."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
