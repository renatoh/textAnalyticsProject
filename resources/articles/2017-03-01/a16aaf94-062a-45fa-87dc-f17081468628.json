MPs on the Commons public accounts committee (PAC) say schools in England are facing the most significant financial pressure since the mid-1990s, with school leaders having to find \u00a33bn in savings by 2020. Meg Hillier, the Labour chair of the PAC, accused the government of collective delusion about the scope for further efficiency savings and warned: \u201cPupils\u2019 futures are at risk if the DfE fails to act on the warnings in our report.\u201d The scathing report accuses the Department for Education of failing to understand the plight of England\u2019s schools, which have already had to cut staff, maintenance costs, IT investment and pastoral services to meet rising costs. The report casts doubt on claims saying schools can save \u00a31.3bn by better procurement and \u00a31.7bn by using staff more efficiently, and urges officials to go out and talk to school leaders rather than rely on desk-based statistical analysis of school spending. The government has been under sustained pressure over school finances as concern has grown among parents as well as head teachers. Funding per pupil is projected to fall by 8% in real terms by 2020 as schools face increased employer costs, cuts to the education services grant, plus the introduction of the apprenticeship levy from next month. Wednesday\u2019s report accuses the department of failing to learn lessons from the NHS where, it says, unrealistic efficiency targets have damaged the finances of NHS trusts as they try to meet growing demand at the same time as reducing costs. \u201cGovernment must not allow this to happen in schools,\u201d said Hiller. \u201cThere are troubling similarities in its approach \u2013 similarities the DfE is unwilling to recognise. Grand plans drawn up in Whitehall are dangerous if they are implemented without regard to real-world consequences, and we will expect to see measures to address our concerns as a matter of urgency.\u201d Among its recommendations the report calls on the department to monitor how schools are making savings and look at the impact on class sizes, curriculum and pupil-teacher ratios. It also wants the government to assess the cost implications for schools of the apprenticeship levy. An education department spokesperson said: \u201cWe will study the report\u2019s recommendations and respond in due course. We have protected the core schools budget in real terms since 2010, with school funding at its highest level on record at more than \u00a340bn in 2016-17 \u2013 and that is set to rise, as pupil numbers rise over the next two years, to \u00a342bn by 2019-20. \u201cThese protections, and the wider investment in the school system, mean that spending per pupil will be over 50% higher in real terms in 2020 than it was in 2000, as set out by the independent Institute for Fiscal Studies.\u201d John Pugh MP, the Liberal Democrat\u2019s education spokesman and PAC member, said that more than 250 head teachers had written to him in the last month warning that unless extra money were found standards would fall. \u201cTory ministers must be the only people left who haven\u2019t spotted the crisis in schools funding, or worse \u2013 they\u2019re choosing to ignore it,\u201d he said. \u201cIf ministers think they can find these savings without harming educational outcomes, they\u2019re in cloud cuckoo land.\u201d The shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: \u201cWhen even the Conservative-dominated PAC says that the DfE \u2018does not seem to understand the pressures that schools are already under\u2019, and that funding cuts could \u2018threaten the quality of education and educational outcomes\u2019, it\u2019s hard to see why anyone else would have any confidence in their management of our schools.\u201d Malcolm Trobe, interim general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, said: \u201cThe PAC is entirely right to conclude that government underfunding is putting standards at risk. The DfE has buried its head in the sand over this issue and resorts to repeatedly stating that school spending is at record levels when it is fully aware that this is only because of rising pupil numbers.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
