Yet 400 years ago, it was the lowly tongue of an insignificant backwater on the edge of Europe. Unlike French, Italian, Spanish or even Dutch, it had no cultural prestige, and was useless overseas. Anyone who aspired to real civility, or to travel or trade with mainland Europe, had no option but to learn its languages. How English men and women of the late 15th to the early 18th century went about doing so is the subject of John Gallagher\u2019s fascinating new book, a welcome attempt to show that the history of language encompasses much more than just the history of words. It\u2019s always difficult to reconstruct an essentially oral practice from written evidence, but Gallagher trawls through an immense variety of printed and manuscript sources to capture the voices of soldiers, servants, captives and beggars, as well as students, tourists and diplomats. The teaching of languages in this era took place largely outside traditional educational institutions: at home, with a tutor; alongside the formal curriculum at Oxford and Cambridge; at the royal court; in London, with its numerous immigrant communities and language schools; and when travelling in mainland Europe itself, an increasingly fashionable educational experience for rich young Englishmen. Even when they used a printed guide, most people learned languages not by silently reading texts, but out loud, by practising conversation. To speak a foreign language competently was always as much about navigating cultural and political hierarchies as it was about grammatical correctness. That was why conversation manuals provided ample instruction not just in the niceties of pronunciation, but in continental rituals of greeting (\u201cI kisse your hands Sir / and I yours, at your service Sir\u201d), or how to dress down your Spanish servant (\u201cBlockhead, doest thou bring me my doublet before my shirt?\u201d), patronise your French inferiors (\u201cHo farmer, tell me \u2013 go I well here by to go to Paris?\u201d), or insult your Italian enemies (\u201cpoltrone, forfante, cattivo, buggiardo\u201d). Hence, too, an obsession with avoiding \u201clow\u201d and \u201cbad\u201d conversation, and of travelling to places where the apex varieties of foreign tongues were thought to be found: the \u201cbest\u201d French was supposedly spoken in the Loire valley, the best German in Leipzig, the best Italian in Rome or Tuscany. Learning languages was also increasingly valued as a social accomplishment for young women. By the late 17th century there were many boarding schools for girls that provided instruction in languages, alongside needlework, music, deportment, table-manners, dancing, writing, accounting and \u201cpastrywork\u201d \u2013 sometimes the entire curriculum was taught in French. Yet female speech always remained inferior. In the model conversations of language manuals, women were overwhelmingly silent or subordinate. A Spanish primer of 1591 included such useful phrases as \u201cshe is a proper woman but she hath great buttocks\u201d, and a favourite dialogue for students to practise was a conversation between a traveller at an inn and the chambermaid he was trying to seduce. Gallagher\u2019s stress on the social dynamics of language is refreshing and compelling. It\u2019s understandable but a pity that he leaves aside Latin as a language of conversation, and provides only tantalising hints about the prevalence and learning of non-European languages. Given his stated desire to inspire a greater awareness that the histories of England, Europe and empire are all essentially polyglot, he could also have made more of the fact that \u201cEnglish\u201d itself was far from uniform in this period, and that Britain\u2019s indigenous history has never been monoglot. At its highest levels, medieval society and government was often trilingual (French, English and Latin), while even after 1700 people in different parts of England (let alone Britain) continued to speak widely varying dialects. He does, though, provide some moving glimpses of what it might have meant to acquire English as an immigrant. Successive waves of French and German-speaking refugees fled to England over these centuries, and many other continental Europeans came over voluntarily. Conversation manuals aimed at such audiences had a different purpose: not just getting by temporarily in a new language, but fitting in permanently. The crash course in native values to be found in their pages emphasised hard work, honesty, godliness, diligence, loyalty, gratitude and the necessity of accommodating one\u2019s self to English tastes in food and drink (\u201cA: What Dish is that Madam? / B: This is an English Pudding \u2026 / A: Truly \u2019tis not unpleasant. But I fear it is heavy to the Stomach\u201d). If this learned, imaginative and enlightening book has a hero, it must surely be John Florio (1553-1625), the son of an Italian refugee and his English wife. He was born in London, grew up an exile in Switzerland and Germany, then returned to England as a young man. This European Englishman was a superlative translator of Montaigne, and an influential acquaintance of Shakespeare. He was friends with the brilliant polymath Giordano Bruno, a spy for Queen Elizabeth, language tutor to the Stuart royal family, and a pioneering grammarian and dictionary maker. Hard working, broad minded and cosmopolitan, he was scathing in his critique of his insular, monoglot compatriots. \u201cWhat a shame is that!\u201d, if one only spoke English and could therefore understand nothing of the wide world beyond, he wrote in 1578, \u201cwhat a loss!\u201d Indeed. We could do with more of his spirit right now. \u2022 Learning Languages in Early Modern England is published by Oxford (\u00a360). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com or call 020-3176 3837.
