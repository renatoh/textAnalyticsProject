What we did have, though, was a great team spirit. England had a lot of good ball players but we knew that, if we got in among them and made it difficult for them to knock the ball around, they would make mistakes. \"Out of all the home internationals the games against England were always the ones that you wanted to win. It was nice going back to Fulham after the game and give the directors and chairman a bit of stick because everyone thought it wasn't a case of if England would win but by how many. I keep reminding friends and family that the last time we played England we won and I think the Welsh lads who played that night are very proud of it.\" Jeff Hopkins Centre-back \"We knew it was the last of the home internationals and played with a point to prove. I think the feeling within the Welsh FA was that England didn't need the game as much as Wales did. It was as if we were seen as second-class opponents so there were some amazing scenes afterwards when we won. The boys were really pumped up in the dressing room and there were Wales committee members in tears. \"I have got a video of the game, which I still watch every now and again, and I've also got Tony Woodcock's shirt. He was a really difficult opponent and I was a bit nervous when I found out I was going to mark him. But as soon as we were out on the pitch it looked like we were the team.\" Mickey Thomas Left-midfield \"It was intimidating for the England lads coming to the Racecourse Ground, especially with me running around kicking everyone. I remember kicking Sammy Lee a couple of times. We hammered England on the night and definitely should have won by more. Mark Hughes has obviously got more reason to remember the game than most for scoring the goal, and I swapped shirts with him at the end of the game. I've still got it somewhere. It was like our World Cup playing against them.\" Joey Jones Left-back \"Although the 1-0 scoreline sounds close, from what I can remember we were far better than England that day. Wales teams always had the passion and the commitment and the side we had then was particularly hard-working, but we also had some genuinely great players. \"We were like a club team: everybody got on well and I'm sure that helped on the pitch. It was a great occasion and it makes it better that it was the last time the teams met because people say you are only as good as your last game.\" England David Armstrong Left-midfield \"We always knew that we were going to be in for a real hard battle and Wrexham wasn't one of the easiest places to go. It's quite intimidating really when the old Welsh dragons start having a go at you. We were going into a cauldron effectively. \"The game was a real battle but we expected that because we'd come up against most of their players every week in the First Division. Wales really got stuck into us and thoroughly deserved to win on the night.\" Alan Kennedy Left-back \"I was the cover for Kenny Sansom at the time, but Bobby Robson decided to give me a run out, for which I was eternally grateful. We played against a Welsh team inspired by Mark Hughes. I think he got away from Mike Duxbury and hit a great shot past Peter Shilton's right-hand side to score. \"At Liverpool the players were all very patriotic. There was a lot of mickey-taking when we got back after the game; even the Scottish lads joined in. 'The minnows of Wales beat the giants of England' was how Rushy described it.\" Alvin Martin Centre-back \"I had played against Mark Hughes a couple of times at club level and I spoke to people in our squad about him so I knew we were going to have our hands full at the back. Everybody was aware of his reputation because of how he had taken to the top level of domestic football. Mark was running the channels and was tenacious as he always is, chasing balls down. \"But we were expected to win and in that way I would say that nothing has really changed. Twenty years on England will go into the game with Wales on the same footing as we did then.\" Paul Walsh Striker \"It should never be an anticlimax playing for England but it felt a bit like that because you were playing an international match at Wrexham. We were playing at better grounds for our club sides every week. My game before was at the Parc des Princes against the magnificent France team that included Michel Platini, and that's what I call an international. \"I remember thinking before the game that it had been a really long season and I felt quite jaded. I don't think I played that well and it wasn't a particularly memorable match, especially as we got beat. On the back of that game I made the biggest mistake of my career. I was supposed to play for England in the Under-21 final in Seville but I asked David Pleat to speak to Bobby Robson and tell him that I was too tired after playing so many games. He did, and the next day the Sun back page said: 'Robson boots out Walsh.' I never played for England again.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
