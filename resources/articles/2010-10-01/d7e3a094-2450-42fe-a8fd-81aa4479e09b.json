Melvyn Bragg had just finished reading aloud from Ted Hughes's previously unpublished poem about his first wife Sylvia Plath's suicide, when it became clear to millions of listeners that the heartbreaking last line of the poem, \"your wife is dead\", had overwhelmed Bragg's usually poised demeanour. As he told the Observer later: \"I felt as if I'd been punched in the stomach.\" During the agonising moment of radio silence, more eloquent than any words, that followed, the interviewer John Humphrys was unable to probe further into the abyss of grief opened up by this poem. Not for the first time, nor probably for the last, Hughes was casting his extraordinary spell over an audience which, for two generations now, has been brought up on The Hawk in the Rain, Crow and The Rattle Bag, as well as on the lyrical volcano that is the tale of Ted and Sylvia, one of the great love stories of the 20th century. There are many ironies in play here. First, there's the unquenchable afterlife of a tragic relationship with which Hughes himself spent half a lifetime grappling, as with a demon. Throughout his career, Hughes was tormented by the vociferous fans of Plath who wanted to hold him to account for Plath's suicide in the winter of 1963, and also for the way in which he administered the posthumous publication of her oeuvre. In death, as in life, Sylvia troubled him still. The furore aroused by the New Statesman's publication of this Last Letter is both a tribute to the radioactive power of the Plath-Hughes poetic legacy and a reminder of Hughes's contemporary status. More than 10 years after his death, Ted Hughes the poet, so often teased and parodied in his lifetime, is emerging as one of the towering literary figures of the past century, to be spoken of in the same breath as Eliot, Yeats, Auden and Larkin. He has become the once and future king of the English literary imagination. Here's a second irony: in the week that the Larkin estate published its long-awaited volume of the poet's letters to his muse, Monica Jones, the statuesque, charismatic Hughes (always an object of Larkin's sardonic jesting) stole the headlines with just 150 lines, from the tortured, guilt-stricken self-questioning of \"What happened that night? Your final night.\" The collision of love and work, the tectonic plates of any writer's career, creativity mingling with everyday life, is the San Andreas fault of literature. When two writers are involved who happen to be great contemporary poets, artistic equals, the material that explodes out of the depths is bound to be incandescent, exhilarating, unearthly and passionate. For Hughes, honourably acquitting himself as a poet, writing about Plath inevitably had its mythologising dimension. Plath was, unquestionably, a mesmerising, perhaps even slightly mad, figure who was only too willing to play her part in any drama. \"She wrote her early poems very slowly,\" Hughes once said of their early days together in the 1950s. It was, he said, \"as if she were working out a mathematical problem, chewing her lips, putting a thick dark ring of ink round each word that stirred her on the page of the thesaurus\". If her beginnings were slow and desk-bound, Plath was soon soaring beyond her lover's reach. It was a tragic match and their relationship turned sour. By 1963 the instability that had dogged Plath's whole life was becoming painfully dominant. The question that feminist critics have endlessly debated is: was she so obsessed with her dead father that her suicide was almost predetermined, or did Hughes's behaviour, particularly his decision to leave her for another woman after six years of marriage, push her to the edge ? Who will ever know? In Last Letter Hughes himself gets sucked into the vortex of the condundrum, declaring that the explanation for suicide is \"as unknown as if it never happened\". So Plath's suicide remains a mystery that has already inspired one masterpiece (The Savage God by Al Alvarez, the Observer's former poetry editor) and numberless words of exegesis. In the aftermath of his wife's death, followed by the suicide of his lover, Assia Wevill, Hughes himself went to ground, living in Devon, writing about the mysteries of nature and keeping his counsel. It did not do him much good. \"My silence seems to confirm every accusation and fantasy,\" he once wrote. With Promethean stoicism, he held his ground. \"I preferred [silence], on the whole, to allowing myself to be dragged out into the bullring and teased and pricked and goaded into vomiting up every detail of my life with Sylvia\". But he was still wounded, and tormented. Starting in the 1970s he began to address his Letters to Sylvia, exploring every aspect of their love. For years no one knew about these poems, and he himself was wrestling with guilt. I remember once awkwardly broaching the Sylvia question with him at a conference after several glasses of wine and being touched and amazed at the flood of loving recollection released by a simple \u2013 and tactless \u2013 inquiry. He was, in his prime, as compelling a figure as Plath: an unforgettable physical presence with fathomless reserves of feeling and humanity, and a gentle Yorkshire voice that seemed to remake every sentence it uttered. It was said at the time, on good authority, that the Queen fancied her poet laureate. Then came Birthday Letters, the literary sensation of the 1990s \u2013 at once a revelation, but also an attempt by Hughes to nail shut a Pandora's box of prurient, often vicious, speculation. It's easy to forget the vehemence of the oppo-sition. The poet's readings were sometimes interrupted by cries of \"murderer\"; the American feminist poet Robin Morgan published The Arraignment which began with the lines \"I accuse/Ted Hughes...\" Birthday Letters was his riposte. Written over a period of more than 25 years, it was concerned with the psychological drama that inspired Plath's greatest poems and ultimately led to her death. This, at last, was Ted Hughes's own account \u2013 although it was incomplete. In a letter from 1995 he described to a friend the poems he had withheld from the collection as being \"too personal to publish\". Having explored the trajectory of Plath's short life, Hughes stopped short of revealing the circumstances of the suicide itself, about which there had been endless gossip. In fact, he had been wrestling with the horror of that lost weekend in the frozen midwinter of 1963, especially the horrifying, almost macabre, detail that Plath had reassuringly burned her suicide note, which had reached Hughes prematurely, in front of him. Daniel Trilling, deputy culture editor of the New Statesman, which published the Last Letter, says that \"when I read that passage I felt my flesh creep. It was an unforgettable moment\". Trilling and Bragg studied the manuscript, in several drafts, where they found it \u2013 in a \"blue school-style exercise book\" containing several other poems that also appear in Birthday Letters. But the only person who knew of this poem's existence, because Hughes had given her a typed fair copy of it, was the poet's widow, Carol. This is where the final, redemptive, chapter of this story begins. Carol Hughes, who has chosen never to comment to the press about her husband, has had a very difficult role to play after Hughes's unexpectedly early death in 1998. Quite apart from grappling with the ongoing Sylvia question, there was the scale of the Hughes archive, millions of words in Hughes's distinctive, jagged hand \u2013 drafts, diaries, stories, notes \u2013 a mountain of paper, containing, it is fair to say, evidence of a turbulent and complex emotional life. For any literary estate, the question of what it is right to publish is always fraught, often controversial. The second Mrs Hardy simply burned her husband's correspondence with her predecessor, enraging generations of scholars. Hughes himself had been criticised for his destruction of Plath's last journal. Carol Hughes, however, has always tried to do her best by her husband's work, on its own terms. She had long known about this \"last letter\", and what it revealed. Biding her time, she had been puzzling about how to release it to the literary world. Melvyn Bragg insists that he \"did not discover it. I was asked to guest edit the New Statesman, and wanted to include an unpublished Hughes poem,\" he explains. \"Matthew Evans [a former chairman of Faber, Hughes's publisher] put me in touch with Carol, who directed me to Helen Broderick at the British Library, armed with a specific file reference. Carol knew exactly what she wanted me to find.\" Trilling takes up the story. \"Last Letter has a literal meaning for Carol. She is very aware of what she's done. I think her conduct has been remarkable. She accepted what's there; she didn't shy away from it. Yes, she was controlled \u2013 but in a loving way.\" Bragg believes that Carol Hughes is relieved the poem is in the public domain at last. \"She took incredible care over the publication, and was very scrupulous about the presentation of Ted's work.\" he said. \"She has a very strong sense of his legacy. She wanted to do the very best that she could by his memory.\" So, in the strangest, and most moving way, Hughes's poetry continues to sponsor love. It also gives closure. As Trilling observes, \"in the magazine, we describe it as 'Final'. That was a description agreed by all concerned.\" Already Carol Hughes's bold decision is gaining respectful recognition. Carol Ann Duffy, the poet laureate, says that the new poem is \"a bit like looking into the sun as it's dying. It seems to touch a deeper, darker place than any poem he's ever written.\" Time will tell if Sylvia Plath's spirit has finally been laid to rest."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
