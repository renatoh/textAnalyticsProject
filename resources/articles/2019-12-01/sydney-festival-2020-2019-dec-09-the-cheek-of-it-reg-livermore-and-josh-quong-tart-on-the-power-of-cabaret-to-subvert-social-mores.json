Reg Livermore and Josh Quong Tart on the power of cabaret to subvert social mores", "bodyText": "Reg Livermore\u2019s 1975 one-man show, Betty Blokk-Buster Follies, upended Australia\u2019s theatre establishment - and held a mirror up to a changing world. Few productions have shaken up the story of Australian theatre quite like this one. When the raunchy cabaret, the handiwork of Livermore, a then-fledgling performer who\u2019d previously starred in The Rocky Horror Show, premiered at the Balmain Bijou in 1975 it played to sell-out audiences over its eight-month season before touring around the country. Despite animosity from the media, the one-man show - which starred Livermore as Betty Blokk-Buster, a German maid who headed up a troupe of down-and-out characters such as the Football Ballerina and Vaseline Amyl Nitrate - connected powerfully with Australians, reflecting and challenging their social mores. Ahead of Betty Blokk-Buster Reimagined, a new production that will premiere at the Sydney Festival in 2020, we speak with Livermore and the show\u2019s star Josh Quong Tart about the significance of Betty Blokk-Buster - and what the show means now. Cabaret, a form with roots in 19th-century France, draws on bawdy humour and marginalised characters to hold up a mirror to middle-class audiences. Why do you think it is subversive? Reg Livermore: I never considered what I was doing as cabaret as such. I was actor-driven and the predicaments of my characters were important to me. They weren\u2019t funny predicaments, but I was able to find the dark humour in them. In 1975, [Australians] hadn\u2019t found the means to express themselves. People would get on the phone just so there was someone on the other end! People said to me, you changed my life. I don\u2019t know if I did that! But you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on in the dark, how people are receiving the information they are being given. [Betty Blokk-Buster] touched people in so many ways. Josh Quong Tart: I\u2019m completely into cabaret as a form because it is about music and characters. It holds a mirror up to the world. Betty Blokk-Buster came hot off the heels of The Rocky Horror Show and people had never seen that raunchiness, that sense of telling it how it is. The audience didn\u2019t just want Betty. They needed her. It\u2019s been 45 years since the original Betty Blokk-Buster. Since then, Australia has become more progressive. But in some ways, society is more polarised than ever. What makes the production relevant now? Livermore: That\u2019s up to the people who are creating it! They are much younger than I am and their experience in the theatre [represents] such a different moment. There might be a nod to some of the stuff I wrote - but who knows where they will take it? Quong Tart: It was a different time back then. It was a time when the homosexual community were beaten up in the streets! Mary Rachel Brown, who\u2019s one of the writers, who\u2019s remarkable, put it well. She says that Betty has been zipped up in a vacuum-sealed bag for 45 years. She\u2019s now been let out and going: \u201cWhat the hell is going on?\u201d Indigenous people still aren\u2019t in the constitution! There\u2019s the drought! And then, there are all the international issues. The world has been sideswiped in every direction. We are using some characters and songs from the original [because] Reg created a show for everybody. We are in a very different world but our primary goal is to entertain. What are the highlights of playing Betty? Josh, how will you interpret a character that is such a major part of Reg\u2019s legacy? Livermore: When I was asked by Eric Dare to do the show, I decided that it was a sideshow alley of life\u2019s battlers - they were survivors and they were proud. And because it was like a circus, I needed a ring mistress. I think Betty was a one-time showgirl in the Weimar Republic. She would give a Nazi salute and there was a big cricket scoreboard that rolled on behind her with instructions for the audience. But she was there to make people happy. [Josh] is an all-round great performer who is prone to moments of wildness, which will stand him in good stead. Quong Tart: Betty sets up the show, she has a very important function and that is to get the audience to be an active participant in the show, she gives, no, she \u2018demands\u2019 participation. It sets up a hell of a night out. Reg is a legend. Reg told me that the spirit of the show is important, that is what we are trying to capture with this \u2018reimagined version\u2019 so I want to do something that will make him proud. How do you hope audiences will respond to Betty Blokk-Buster in 2020? Livermore: There are people for whom the memory of it is quite precious, so I hope that it is a jolly good show and that people get a buzz out of it. Quong Tart: I\u2019m so excited to be getting in that room with the full band. When the costumes, the lighting, the music and the material come together, it will be incredible.
