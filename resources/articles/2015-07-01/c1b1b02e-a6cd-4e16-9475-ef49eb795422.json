Fans and press in attendance were treated to a new full-length trailer for the action film, directed by Francis Lawrence, who has directed three installments for the billion dollar-grossing series. i09 called the action showcased in the trailer \u201csimply beyond epic\u201d, while Cinema Blend said the promo promises a \u201cfull-on battle movie that will be full of tremendous energy and excitement\u201d. The trailer indicated that Part 2 will be significantly different in tone from Part 1, which dealt with the politics of war and featured little of the action that distinguished the first two Hunger Games movies. Like the novels by Suzanne Collins, on which the films are based, Hunger Games is set to go out with a bang. Before the panel\u2019s moderator, Conan O\u2019Brien, took to the stage with Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Willow Shields, director Francis Lawrence and producer Nina Jacobson, to present the trailer, Hall H at Comic-Con was greeted by a video message from District 13, that featured heroine Katniss Everdeen, in a red, armored outfit. The video has since been made available online. The cast and crew took questions following the screening of the trailer. When asked about saying goodbye to a character that\u2019s made her a worldwide star, Jennifer Lawrence said, \u201cI don\u2019t really feel like [the end] has happened yet. It\u2019s such a huge part of my life. These movies changed my life. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever say goodbye. Katniss is a part of me.\u201d The new full-length trailer for Part 2 is expected to be online soon. The final Hunger Games movie opens in the US on 20 November."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
