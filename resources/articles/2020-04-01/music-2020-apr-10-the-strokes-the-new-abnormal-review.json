At least, that\u2019s the impression frontman Julian Casablancas seems keen to impart on the band\u2019s sixth album. \u201cAll my friends left, and they don\u2019t miss me,\u201d he moans, like Toby Young for the ageing-hipsters-with-directional-mullets crowd. Elsewhere he\u2019s an \u201cugly boy\u201d, a bad decision maker who wants \u201cnew friends, but they don\u2019t want me / They\u2019re making plans while I watch TV.\u201d In truth, likability has never been the Strokes\u2019s strong suit \u2013 in fact, their rich-kids-of-New-York insouciance, uncooperative interview technique and seemingly seconds-long ascent to an indelible position in the rock\u2019n\u2019roll firmament made them actively unsympathetic figures: where was the suffering, where was the struggle? In later years, this lack of amiability seemed to bleed into the internal workings of the band itself. Their first post-hiatus album, 2011\u2019s Angles, was beleaguered by a splintered recording process; 2013\u2019s Comedown Machine was accompanied by a media blackout partly occasioned by intra-band arguing. Which makes The New Abnormal the first Strokes album in 14 years that has been fully endorsed by its creators. And, initially at least, it shows. Opening track The Adults Are Talking is dazzling, the spiralling momentum of its chorus offset by guitars about seven ways, from angular rattling to phone-dial chiming to sweetly inquiring riffs that appear to converse with one another. Brooklyn Bridge to Chorus\u2019s droll new wave, with its kazoo-like riffs and sultry spoken word, is amusingly camp and in parts strangely beautiful, while Bad Decisions, which interpolates Dancing With Myself, possesses a gut-punch nostalgia. Throughout, Casablancas\u2019s voice is gratifyingly elastic, swerving between flutey falsetto, dissolute rasp, tremulous yell and pouty sprechgesang. Yet what begins with taut, engaging pop eventually starts to sag. At the Door\u2019s synth-pop dirge is dreary, while Ode to the Mets provides a decidedly unspectacular finale. It\u2019s the kind of drop-off in quality that suggests old indifference dies hard, but it\u2019s certainly not the whole story: The New Abnormal proves that when they put their minds to it, that old magic is still well within the Strokes\u2019s grasp."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
