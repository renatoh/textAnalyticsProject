Tom Shinner, 33, director of policy and delivery coordination at the Department for Exiting the EU, was in charge of coordinating the domestic policy implications of Brexit across government departments to ensure a smooth exit from the EU. His departure comes as industry leaders are questioning whether the UK will be as prepared for no deal in November, which lead contender to be prime minister Boris Johnson says will happen \u201cdo or die\u201d unless the UK gets a new deal in Brussels. As fears in Ireland grow over the increasing likelihood of no deal, there have also been personnel losses with two key members of the Brexit team moving on. It is understood that Shinner is leaving the civil service altogether to go into the private sector. His departure comes hot on the heels after Karen Wheeler, the official in charge of \u201cfrictionless\u201d Brexit border planning including emergency plans for Dover and Northern Ireland in the event of no deal, left her post in Her Majesty\u2019s Revenue &amp; Customs. A former aide to the ex-Brexit secretary David Davis once said Shinner was so pivotal to no-deal planning that if he left his job Brexit would not happen. \u201cThere is actually a Mr Big of no deal in Whitehall, very clever and very well paid, who was so integral to the process we joked that if he was hit by a No 53 bus on Parliament Square, Brexit wouldn\u2019t happen!\u201d, former Conservative Party MP Stewart Jackson wrote in the Times in an article sources said was a reference to Shinner. DExEU said Shinner\u2019s departure would not affect the \u201chigh standards\u201d of delivery at the department as no-deal planning had been so advanced ahead of 29 March, the original Brexit Day, with work continuing apace. In a statement to the Guardian, it said: \u201cTom Shinner joined the department when it formed in July 2016 and since then has led the teams coordinating across Whitehall the government\u2019s domestic policy and delivery preparations to leave the EU. \u201cHe will hand over after three years in post, and later this year will leave the civil service to take on a new opportunity in the private sector. \u201cCareful succession planning has been put in place to ensure the department maintains its high standards of delivery.\u201d Last month Joe Owen, the Institute for Government\u2019s Brexit programme director, predicted that \u201cmany of the 16,000 civil servants working on Brexit will now be looking for a change of scenery\u201d. In Dublin two of the most senior members of the Brexit team at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are leaving, affecting operations ahead of a possible no deal, which the Irish taoiseach, Leo Varadkar, thinks is now looking more likely. Rory Montgomery, the second secretary general at the department, who was the overall lead of the EU division and Brexit, is retiring while Ronan Gargan, the director of the EU-UK unit, is moving to Hungary to become Irish ambassador. Gargan was one of the key personnel involved in the daily behind-the-scenes Brexit work in Brussels and in Dublin and his departure has been described as a big loss by insiders. A spokesman for DFA said: \u201cAs part of the normal posting diplomatic rotations within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, a number of people will be moving on from their current roles and taking up new positions or retiring.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
