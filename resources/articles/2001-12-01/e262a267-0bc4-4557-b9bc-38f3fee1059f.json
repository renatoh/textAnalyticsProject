Instead he will serve the disputed one-match ban imposed on him by an International Cricket Council match referee Mike Denness in Port Elizabeth a fortnight ago. And, while Sehwag sits it out as England and India take the field, the rest of the cricket world, for the time being anyway, can breathe a little easier. That the Board of Control for Cricket in India, and in particular its volatile president Jagmohan Dalmiya, has been prepared at last to acknowledge the ban and so allow Monday's match to proceed with the official sanction of the ICC, represents a massive feather in the cap of the senior administrators of the world body and in particular its chief executive Malcolm Speed. Dalmiya may claim that his magnanimity has averted a crisis in the game and that Indian cricket has gained what he calls \"brownie points\" from the whole shenanigans but he knows that he has come off second best to a body of which he himself was once president and which has long been regarded as toothless. It has certainly grown some molars and a few incisors now. All involved in the negotiations, in which numerous phone calls and faxes passed between Speed, the ICC president Malcolm Gray and Dalmiya, understand that the consequences of India not climbing down from their view that Sehwag had previously served his ban in a match deemed unofficial by ICC and was therefore eligible to face England, were potentially disastrous. Had he been selected, the match, as with India's previous game against South Africa in Centurion, would have been deemed unofficial and England would have packed their bags, struck their tents and come home. The future of next summer's tour of England by India then would have been in doubt and the financial ramifications for both countries catastrophic. It was, as the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board Lord MacLaurin said yesterday, a \"victory for common sense\" but it was also a victory for hard-nosed negotiation by the ICC, which refused to be intimidated by Dalmiya's threats. \"A situation like this must never happen again,\" said England's captain Nasser Hussain who, while always believing that the Test would go ahead, was grateful that the adminstrators have left centre stage. \"It would not happen in any other sport. Administrators administrate; players play. That's the way the world works. The ICC runs the game and the sooner everyone realises that, and the ICC realises that and runs the game, the better.\" Speed was delighted when he announced the resolution of the problem at Lord's yesterday, just as Dalmiya was doing simultaneously in Calcutta. In addition to confirming that Monday's Test was now official because Sehwag was not to be selected in India's 12 for the match, Speed revealed that the ICC is preparing to address many of Dalmiya's grievances by setting up a referees commission, the members of which will be appointed by Gray, which will investigate the whole way in which the Port Elizabeth Test was conducted (Denness disciplined six Indian players during the game and, while the decisions will not be challenged, the commission will seek to judge whether due process was served). The commission will also question whether a disciplined player should have a right of appeal and whether the match referee should be allowed to explain his decisions to the media - and if, indeed, the referee should be subject to a code of conduct. \"The commission will be reporting to the ICC by the end of January,\" said Speed, \"with the executive board meeting in March.\" It will comprise two eminent former players and will be chaired by an eminent legal person because there are certainly some legal issues that need looking at. Among their tasks will be to examine the Port Elizabeth Test and advise the executive board whether Denness acted in accordance with the procedures as laid out in the code of conduct, especially those relating to natural justice. Speed is not one to indulge in triumphalism but he was clearly delighted that the game's ruling body had not been seen to back down in the face of intimidation and that it had been vital, for the good of the game, that it had not done so. \"Some interesting precedents have been set here,\" he said. \"The major one is that the ICC has stood by the referee, upheld his decisions, has cancelled the status of one Test match and was fully prepared to do so to others. \"Secondly, though, it has been demonstrated that the ICC is prepared to take a common-sense approach. All organisations should be prepared to look at their procedures and, if a mistake has been made, then they should make sure that it doesn't happen next time. But I am satisfied that Mike Denness got it right.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
