A solitary Southampton goal, brilliantly set up by Wayne Bridge and finished off by substitute Marian Pahars, sentenced them to their first defeat of the season. It was unsatisfactory because for the first third of the game Wanderers looked comfortably the better side. But, as the weather deteriorated, Southampton found their feet and secured their first points of the campaign. Bolton almost caught the Saints on the hop as early as the sixth minute when Per Frandsen's quick free-kick was deflected past Jones in the Southampton goal only to hit the post and roll to safety. Wanderers, their confidence high, generally looked the more composed side. For the first time this season they played a 4-3-3 formation with Bo Hansen on the right and Henrik Pederson on the left supporting striker Michael Ricketts. The Saints defence was pegged back for long periods near their penalty area. And there was always the threat of Frandsen, given a roving role in midfield. On the relatively few occasions Southampton managed to make progress their best work came via Matt Oakley and Jo Tessem but Kevin Davies was uncharacteristically subdued and the threat of James Beattie up front was nullified by Gudni Bergsson and Mike Whitlow. Curiously, as the weather became more northern in character, Southampton began to flourish. Urged on by Richards, Bridge and Oakley they began to supply better balls to Beattie and for a while the Bolton defence looked unsteady. Frandsen limped off with an injury to his right ankle and Nicky Southall took his place, who was quick and energetic but perhaps lacked Frandsen's ability to read the game. Ricketts, who had made little impact on Richards, was replaced by Dean Holdsworth and immediately Bolton came within a whisker of taking the lead. After a goalmouth scramble the ball fell to Hansen whose low hard shot from the edge of the area came back off Jones's left hand post, while Beattie brought a fine save from Jussi Jaaskelainen with a left foot drive. The game had now swung Southampton's way and they made it count. Bridge picked the ball up near the half-way line and raced down the left wing. At the by-line he rolled the ball back into the path of Pahars, who whipped it into the back of the net. A fine goal to settle an otherwise rather grim game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
