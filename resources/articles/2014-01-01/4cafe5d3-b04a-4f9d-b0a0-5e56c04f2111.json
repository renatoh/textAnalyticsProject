In I, Malvolio, written and performed by Tim Crouch, he is being given the stage. But is this Twelfth Night character happy to finally be taking centre stage, or is the whole thing just too uncomfortable to bear? Flittering between the character of Malvolio and a character of himself as performer, Crouch is masterful. With direction by Karl James and Andy Smith, his performance is demanding: he rolls over and speeds through words, insisting his audience keep up. With the house lights on through the performance, Crouch is constantly watching and reacting, intricately controlling the space. Each late entry, each unexpected or perhaps inappropriate laugh is a chance for him to go off script \u2013 but you wonder if even these moments have been tightly crafted, too. We laugh at him, and then he tells us off for laughing at him. As the audience sits quietly after a sad, introspective moment for Malvolio, he berates us. It was supposed to be funny, he tells us. Won\u2019t we keep up? Crouch\u2019s text offers much for those familiar with Twelfth Night, observing the weaving of plot strands into the plight we follow here of Malvolio. \u201cIf this were played upon a stage now, I could condemn it as an improbable fiction,\u201d he proclaims, before admonishing the \u201cintellectuals\u201d for thinking themselves so smart for laughing at the reference. But I, Malvolio still stands stunningly as its own piece, unfolding to become less about Shakespeare\u2019s work and more about the audience witnessing this play. Our Sunday matinee audience shouldn\u2019t be having fun, he tells us, and really should be at home reading the Bible. Of course, as he says this, the performance we are watching is crude, crass, and a downright joyous celebration of theatre. Here, Crouch is a performer at the top of his game, sharing a text that plays as much with intelligence as slapstick. Even as the work ends, there is no way of knowing who gets the last laugh. Is it the audience with grins stretched across their faces? Is it Crouch? Or is it Malvolio himself?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
