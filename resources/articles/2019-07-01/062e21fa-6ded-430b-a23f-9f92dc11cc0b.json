John Bostock reported his symptoms of what he called \u201csummer catarrh\u201d, including \u201cirritation of the nose, producing sneezing, which occurs in fits of extreme violence\u201d. Strangely, though, Bostock only found 28 similar cases, mainly among the privileged classes, even though far more people in those days worked outside surrounded by grass. But in recent times, hay fever has reached epidemic proportions, with about one-fifth of the UK population thought to be affected, according to NHS figures. Fuelled by rising temperatures and higher levels of carbon dioxide, the pollen and growing seasons are becoming longer, which means hay fever symptoms last longer \u2013 the grass pollen season, which used to end in late July, now carries on well into August in some areas. And the increased loads of pollen in the air pile on misery for those affected. Air pollution from traffic also plays a large role. Pollutants such as nitrogen oxides and ozone can attack the pollen grains, bursting them open and releasing more of the highly allergic proteins that trigger hay fever. Ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide pollution also attack the membranes in the respiratory tract, making people more susceptible to the pollen. In fact, many people who have never had hay fever before are experiencing the symptoms."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
