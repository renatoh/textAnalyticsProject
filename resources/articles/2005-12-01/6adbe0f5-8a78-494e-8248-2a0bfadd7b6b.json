Back then, Steps' Tragedy topped the charts, Manchester United were on the way to a fortuitous treble, and I was working for Motor Cycle News in Kettering. Unhappy days. Warm-up Both players look nervous as they step on court. \"Surely I am not alone in hoping that Andy Murray gives Tim 'one hell of a beating' as the Norwegians would say,\" says Ed Rooney. \"PS, I'm from Glasgow, funnily enough.\" First set Henman* 0-1 Murray Henman saves the first break point, but a fine Murray pass gives the Scot an immediate break. \"You think Kettering is bad, you should try living in Darlington,\" says Eddie Mitchell. \"One word: dump.\" Henman 0-2 Murray* Murray holds his serve easily. Henman's returns are all over the place. \"Surely it's not the Ed Rooney emailing in during the warm-up?\" asks Abe Froman. Henman* 1-4 Murray Henman holds. The key point came at 30-30 when Murray attempted an audacious drop shot from the baseline. It danced along the net cord before falling short. Meanwhile, Ed Rooney writes: \"To be recognised by the Sausage King of Chicago is very flattering,\" he writes. \"However, I'm not the Ed Rooney but another one altogether.\" Henman 1-5 Murray* Henman curls his face in frustration. His tactics - mixing his game up, trying to chip and charge Murray's second serve -are right, they're just being shockingly executed. Murray holds from 15-30 down. \"Any sign of Murray getting his hair cut before Wimbledon?\" asks Kevin in London. \"He looks like the fifth member of Queens of the Stone Age.\" I'd take that over Henman's wannabe-accountant look, Kevin. Second set Henman* 2-6, 2-1 Murray Henman strikes his ground strokes with venom on the way to winning to 15. The best game of the match. \"Is it me, or is Andy Murray rugged in a cute sort of way?\" asks Amy Loft. It's just you, Amy. Henman 2-6, 3-3 Murray* Another comfortable service game from Murray. Meanwhile this from Jenny Thomas. \"Thank God Amy finds Andy Murray cute. I thought I was the only one.\" Pass me the sick bucket. Henman 2-6, 4-4* Murray Another easy hold for Murray, who's generally dominating the tempo. \"Remember in your adolescence when your Dad went to crack you and you realised that, if it came to it, you could have your Dad?\" says Daniel Herman. Er, no, Daniel. \"We're watching the tennis equivalent. Smack him Murray.\" Third set Henman* 2-6, 7-5, 1-0 Murray Henman wins his fourth game in a row, this time to love. \"It's a pleasure to see Andy Murray is continuing that fine Scottish tradition of being able to snatch defeat from the jaws of near certain victory,\" sighs Craig Jeruzal. Henman 2-6, 7-5, 2-2 Murray* Murray holds his serve to love. He's stretching his calf muscles now, mind. Meanwhile, Andy Walker writes: \"Henman's revival had me worried. But I realised the Hen-choke would be that much more enjoyable after he's given himself a way back into the match.\" Henman 2-6, 7-5, 4-3 Murray* Henman holds to 15. The tennis is still nervy and scratchy, but Henman is only two games from victory. Meanwhile, this from Laura Stuart. \"All these references to the Ashes ... Is covering the tennis whilst we go on about those enchanted days a bit like when your new boy/girlfriend keeps going on about how wonderful their recent ex was? We'll never recapture the magic, you know.\" Tiebreak: Henman* 2-6, 7-5, 6-7 (4-7) Murray A frothy Henman forehand gives Murray an early mini-break, and the nerveless young Scot doesn't look back. Brilliant stuff. Make no mistake: we've just witnessed the changing of the guard."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
