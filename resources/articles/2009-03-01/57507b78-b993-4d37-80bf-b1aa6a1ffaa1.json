Boyd was sent home from the club's Murray Park complex before training yesterday. It is understood the manager was unhappy with his player's reaction after being dropped to the substitutes' bench for the Scottish Cup match with Hamilton on Sunday \u2013 a matter he made clear in a private meeting. It is now unlikely that Boyd, who has scored 24 times in the campaign, will feature for his club in the final at Hampden Park although he did return to the training field today. It is not the first falling-out the striker has had this season, after controversially announcing he would not play for Scotland while George Burley remains in charge. \"Guys have been falling out with managers for 100 years,\" said McCoist, Smith's assistant. \"It is something that has happened, it is between Kris and the manager, but the fact Kris was at training today would suggest it is maybe not as massive as a lot of people are making out. I have no doubt the two of them will sort it out. \"I spoke to the manager this morning. He said, 'It's between me and Boydy and that's the way it will stay'.\" McCoist highlighted matters at Celtic in December as a point of reference. The winger Aiden McGeady served a two-week internal suspension and was fined \u00a330,000 after a spat with his manager, Gordon Strachan. \"If you look at Celtic and Aiden, they beat us 1\u20130 and never played him,\" he added. \"You are not going to tell me there was any negativity there. He [McGeady] has come back, got back in the team, got his head down and worked hard; that's how you should react when things happen like that.\" While McCoist admitted he doesn't know whether Boyd will face Celtic, he believes Smith does not as a rule put personal differences in front of potential success. \"The manager is intelligent and shrewd enough not to make a judgment to the detriment of his team,\" said McCoist. \"He [Smith] wants to win and has been in the game long enough to know he'll do that by picking his best team.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
