You may not have immediately thought of video installation art, but here is an exhibition to prove that they do that as well. It is an opportunity to tap into the modern Finnish psyche, to find out who these people are and what they are really like. Pretty intimidating, actually, at least as they appear in Heta Kuchka's overtly hostile party scene, in which a hip crowd of bright young Finns scowl at you contemptuously from around the room. Kuchka entitles the piece Do You Really Have To Stare at Me? which seems a bit uncharitable - it's an artwork, so of course we have to stare at it. Still, you shuffle from the room checking to see whether you left your flies undone, or maybe went in wearing the wrong sort of trainers. Laura Horelli's contribution promises \"a fresh feeling for your relaxed space\", which seems a welcoming prospect after the previous piece, until it turns out to be a Japanese advertising slogan for a toilet seat. Horelli hilariously stages little scenarios in which young Japanese people recite a litany of marketing phrases in faulty English. \"Clean kitchen make everyday delicious\" announces one, in wholehearted endorsement of a sponge. Gradually the surrealism of the language deepens: \"I love drinking, I love eating, I love temperature\", says one. \"Squeak natural meet my squirrel\", responds another. Actually, I may have misheard the last but the accents on the soundtrack become increasingly difficult to decipher. Heli Rekula's Skein is a work that should appeal to students of gender semiotics, crochet enthusiasts and playful kittens. Big fluffy balls of wool come bouncing down like harmless hail stones, before two women begin winding them up with languorous, erotic intensity. You might interpret this as a metaphor of a close-knit relationship, otherwise you could accept the curator's view that the work highlights \"a power-inscribed activity in which two parties struggle for selfhood\". All new Finnish video art, it would seem, is darkly obsessed with its struggle for selfhood. Or as Sartre almost put it, Helsinki is other people. \u00b7 Until May 18.
