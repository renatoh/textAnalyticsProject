Dr. Richard Clayton, computing and security expert from Cambridge University, offers his insight into the IWF's decision to block it, and what the implications are for other websites peddling the Scorpions' Virgin Killer. (Note: The ban was in place at the time of recording, although it has now been lifted) On the flip side, the team take a look at the output of the second Social Innovation Camp, the event where geeks gather to change the world with the web. Jemima leads us along the garden path. In addition, we cover the rest of this week's news and hear your views from the blogs.
