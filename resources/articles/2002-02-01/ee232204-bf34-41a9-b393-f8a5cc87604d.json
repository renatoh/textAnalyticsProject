While admitting that Nats wanted an increase in fees paid to Nats by airlines, its chairman, Chris Gibson-Smith, said he was not seeking more government money. Unnamed banking officials also denied press reports that the four banks involved in the part-privatisation were about to foreclose their loans. The transport department said: \"The stories in the Guardian and the Independent are not true. There is no question of Nats being put into administration and the banks have not demanded compensation from the department.\" A banking source added: \"There is no way that Nats is going bankrupt. Their business plan has had to be redrawn after the events of September 11, but the banks are comfortable with their position. The Nats business is extremely viable. The banks would not be involved if they did not think Nats was a viable proposition.\" There have been persistent reports that Nats has run into financial difficulties since the September 11 attacks in the US. The drop in air travel has led to a sharp fall in revenues as Nats makes money by charging airlines for using UK airspace and landing in Britain. Today the Guardian and Independent newspapers both reported that four banks - Abbey National, Barclays Capital, Halifax and Bank of America - were threatening to foreclose their loans and were demanding compensation from the transport department. The Nats board met today in London but described it as a routine meeting that was not attended by representatives from the banks. After the meeting, Mr Gibson-Smith said: \"September 11 caused an unprecedented and, by definition, unforeseen fall in air traffic and, therefore, revenues. The Nats board acted as soon as the consequences became clear. We undertook a complete review of costs and implemented significant savings of \u00a3200m over four years without compromising safety in any way.\" Despite these reassurances, opposition politicians lost little opportunity to express alarm at Nats's difficulties and to berate the transport secretary, Stephen Byers, already under fire for his handling of Railtrack. \"This is yet another Stephen Byers blunder,\" said Theresa May, the shadow transport secretary. \"Following on from problems on the railways, it now appears he is facing severe problems in aviation. He has to find a plan to ensure Nats stays afloat and he has to find it fast,\" The Liberal Democrat transport spokesman, Tom Brake called on the government to make a decision one way or another: \"It can underwrite Nats' investment plans, providing a fallback if the banks pull out, or Stephen Byers can take Nats into administration. That would allow a not-for-profit model to be considered. The present situation, in which Nats is hanging by a thread, is bad for passengers and bad for airlines.\" The government insisted on the partial privatisation of Nats last July by selling a 46% stake to a consortium of seven airlines that includes British Airways and Virgin Atlantic in the teeth of strong public opposition. The civil aviation authority, the regulatory arm of the airlines business, warned at the time that Nats would run into problems in hard economic times because of its weak financial structure. The banks put up a \u00a31.4bn debt facility, \u00a3700m of which was used by the airlines to buy their stake; most of the rest reportedly been spent. The government retains 49%, while employees hold 5%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
