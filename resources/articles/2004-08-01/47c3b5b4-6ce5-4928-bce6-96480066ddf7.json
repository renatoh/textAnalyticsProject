After all, the commission itself is due to be downgraded if Europe can ever agree on its new constitution. The newly appointed commission of 25 is also larger, and thus potentially even more unwieldy, than the often criticised 20-strong body under Romano Prodi which it replaces. And individual politicians rarely make quite as much difference in executive posts as they like to think. So why the excitement about this latest Brussels carve-up? There are two main reasons. The first is structural. Precisely because the Barroso commission contains one representative from each of the 25 member states, it embodies a wider and more diffuse set of European interests than its predecessor. This institutionalises a major change in the balance of power within the body charged with maintaining the European project. In the past, the commission's composition favoured the larger nations, which each provided two commissioners to the smaller nations' one, and the founding nations, which have always wanted deeper integration than the later joiners. Each of these weightings advantaged the Franco-German axis. Today, that is no longer the case. France and Germany are now but two among 25. The second main reason is political, and is illustrated by Mr Barroso's actual appointments. The new commission president, a former Portuguese prime minister, was absolutely explicit this week that European economic recovery is the key to re-energising the widely unpopular EU, and that economic reform is in turn the key to recovery. Mr Barroso is himself an economic reformer. And he has awarded most of the key economic portfolios to men and women who are reformers too, including Ireland's Charlie McCreevy in charge of the internal mar ket, the Netherlands' Neelie Kroes-Smit at competition, the Spanish socialist Joaqu\u00edn Almunia at monetary affairs and our own Peter Mandelson at trade. Germany's G\u00fcnter Verheugen takes charge of industrial policy, but Mr Barroso has resisted the German government's wish for Mr Verheugen to be made a first-among-equals \"super commissioner\" for economic policy. Time will tell whether Mr Barroso's words and appointments are matched by his own and his colleagues' deeds. But it would be short-sighted not to see this as a potential watershed for the EU. It feels like the waning of the old era, dominated by those who want more integration and resist the dilution of old assumptions at every turn, and the waxing of a new era, dominated by those who see integration and reform more pragmatically. Typically, Britain's Europhobe tabloids neither covered the Barroso announcement on their front pages nor commented on it; good European news does not fit their agenda. Interestingly, serious papers like the Daily Telegraph and the Wall Street Journal were more impressed. That in itself may alarm some of our readers. But they should keep their nerve. European economic reform does not mean the dismantling of the European social model. It is inconceivable that a reformed EU will not continue to offer greater respect for and protection of social rights than either the US model or the British. That is why those who warn, very understandably, that the EU will not command popular support here unless it can address its sluggish economic growth and high unemployment should welcome these early signs of a change in the European wind. It would be perverse of such critics to set themselves against EU economic reform when that is what they have been demanding all this time. These are, of course, early days, but the Barroso commission should be seen as an opportunity, not a threat."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
