The Carla set, for solo piano, is the more explicitly jazz-rooted, while the Peacock set reflects her unique worldview. She embraced Zen Buddhism, 60s psychedelia, collaborated with artists from Albert Ayler to Salvador Dal\u00ed to David Bowie, and, in the 1970s, pioneered new synth/vocal techniques for the fledgling Moog. Bley's unplugged trio \u2013 with Austrian trumpeter Franz Koglmann and Annette Peacock's first husband Gary Peacock on bass \u2013 doesn't mimic or cover its subject's work. Instead, it takes up the free-improv invitation of her melancholy, minor-key miniatures. The beautiful Touching opens and closes the set. Koglmann's long, abstract brass swoops introduce flying piano figures on Cartoon, and his pure, yielding tone caresses the subtleties of the haunting Albert's Love Theme. Peacock's avant-pop connections, however, shouldn't fool anyone into thinking this is anything other than a mostly low-key, acoustic free-jazz conversation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
