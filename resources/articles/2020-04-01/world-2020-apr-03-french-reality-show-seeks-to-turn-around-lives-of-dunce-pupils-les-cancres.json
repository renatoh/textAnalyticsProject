Pupils are encouraged to compete for the best marks and grades that will allow them to study at prestigious grandes \u00e9coles and subsequently become part of France\u2019s professional or political elite. Now a new television series aims to show all need not be lost for those who fall by the academic wayside. Les Cancres (The Dunces) features a group of high-school pupils who are coached by French celebrities who also struggled at school, some of whom left without obtaining their baccalaur\u00e9at - the bac - the multi-subject exam that is the equivalent of A Levels. The first two episodes, made by RMC Story, feature French-Moroccan stand-up comic Gad Elmaleh and rapper Black M. Businessman Adrien Aumont, co-founder of the crowdfunding site KissKissBankBank and novelist C\u00e9cile Ladjali also feature in the series along with Jo\u00ebl Boura\u00efma, a sports coach for Kim Kardashian and Kanye West. \u201cAnything is possible, that\u2019s the message we\u2019re trying to get across \u2026 but that doesn\u2019t mean anything is easy,\u201d Boura\u00efma said. \u201cOf course, part of it is luck, but more important is work and determination, that\u2019s how the celebrities we feature on the programme succeeded.\u201d C\u00e9cile Ladjali added: \u201cI\u2019m a former dunce and I was told I\u2019d be a sales person in a clothes shop \u2026 in the end I have a doctorate, I\u2019m a novelist and also a professor.\u201d In his 2010 book, On Ach\u00e8ve bien les \u00c9coliers (They Shoot School Kids, Don\u2019t They?) author Peter Gumbel asks: \u201cWhy is France the only country in the world that discourages children because of what they cannot do, rather than encouraging them to do what they can?\u201d \u201cThe whole French hierarchy, political and business, is predicated on people who have done well at school and who go on to the grandes \u00e9coles. More than anywhere else, it is the bac that is going to determine what your career choices are. It\u2019s very difficult to make a success of life in France if you don\u2019t have it,\u201d Gumbel told The Guardian. \u201cThe marking system is not designed to encourage students or improve their work, it about competing. How you do at school follows you for life and it\u2019s very hard to break away from that. If you don\u2019t have the bac you\u2019re considered on the heap.\u201d The students in the first Les Cancres included Lucille who failed to turn up for her baccalaur\u00e9at exam. \u201cMy mother cried and said I\u2019d finish up in a soup kitchen or the job centre\u201d. Lucille said. She has now changed schools and is hoping to take the exam. Nicolas Cennac, the documentary producer said the aim of Les Cancres was to \u201crepresent people who have a different experience at school but who have enormous gifts\u201d. He said his aim was to avoid stigmatising the pupils while at the same time not \u201cglamourising\u201d failure. Among leading French personalities who have succeeded without passing their baccalaur\u00e9at are actors Catherine Deneuve and G\u00e9rard Depardieu, singer Vanessa Paradis, billionaire Fran\u00e7ois Pinault, president of the luxury group Kering, fashion designer Jean-Paul Gaultier and multiple Michelin starred chef Alain Ducasse. Emile Zola failed the exam twice. On Friday, the French education minister, Jean-Michel Blanquer, announced that for the first time the baccaluar\u00e9at exams would not take place this year but pupils would be awarded the diploma on the basis of \u201ccontinued evaluation\u201d of their work at school. It is the first time the exam that was created in 1808 and has been sat every year since, even through the Nazi occupation, has been cancelled. French pupils are being expected to follow a full programme of online classes during the closures. Gumbel said the French education minister was \u201cin a tight corner\u201d because the French system was not adapted to home working. \u201cIn France teaching methods don\u2019t lend themselves well to being done online. Normally the teacher is at the front of the class talking and everyone else is taking notes. It doesn\u2019t work when it has to be interactive.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
