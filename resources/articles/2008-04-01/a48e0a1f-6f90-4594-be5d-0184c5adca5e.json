The hard-serving American, who topped the rankings for nine weeks from November 2003, has suffered perhaps more than any other player from being labelled a one-slam and a one-shot wonder. However, he has recently been looking readier to earn that chance than for a couple of years. The 25-year-old Roddick reached yesterday's fourth round here - one win from a likely meeting with the 12-times grand slam winner - with a 7-6, 6-4 win over Ivo Minar of the Czech Republic and followed it up with some well-rehearsed quips. These were needed because Roddick followed his victory in the Dubai Open last month by announcing his engagement to a 20-year-old model, Brooklyn Decker, and now had to fend off inquiries about his private life. \"I think I lost half my fan base today,\" he said, which almost did the trick, though Roddick has long been more concerned at how ambivalent some of his support has been. \"Sometimes I tell people that I'm the best bad tennis player of all time,\" he said after impressive victories over two other current grand slam champions, Novak Djokovic and Rafael Nadal, in the Middle East. \"I don't care about the coverage I get but I do believe I'm a pretty good player and maybe that's not represented a lot.\" Roddick does indeed have a bigger repertoire these days. He hit plenty of pace-controlling backhands and forceful forehands against Minar, a dangerous qualifier who almost beat Federer three years ago. Indeed, when Minar twice had Roddick at deuce at five-all in the first set, an upset seemed by no means impossible. When Minar broke back to 4-4 in the second set Roddick hit a ball angrily into the distance - earning a code violation- and the outcome, despite his gasp-provoking serving, was in doubt to the end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
