As images of US tanks moving towards Iraq from Kuwait appeared on TV screens, the FTSE-100 bounced up sharply. It shrugged off earlier losses as traders anticipated a swift conclusion to what is shaping up to be a one-sided conflict. The index closed up 18.1 points, or 0.5%, at 3,765.4. The figure was well off the day's peak of 3,828.3, but still its highest close since January 20. Paris and Frankfurt also ended slightly higher. Until the news of US military movement on the Kuwait-Iraq demilitarised border, the FTSE had been lower for most of the session after a four-day rally that tacked on 15% to UK shares. However, professionals warned of rough times ahead. \"Only the very brave to play the market: other investors should sit tight,\" said Damion Larkin, the head of advisory services at the Share Centre, an investment advisory service. Banks, drugs and oil shares were among the leaders in a broad-based rally. Oil and Shell, the big energy companies, both gained 1.5% as crude prices rebounded from a four-day fall on the expectation of the start of conflict in Iraq. In volatile trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrials average was off 35.8 points, or 0.4%, at 8,158.6 as investors braced themselves for the uncertainties of war. Technology shares fell on disappointing sales from software maker Oracle. The world's second-largest software maker slid by 6%, raising worries about the corporate outlook with war around the corner. The Dow has surged more than 8% in the last week on hopes for a short war, but worries remain about risks including Iraq torching its oil wells, terror attacks or a longer than expected campaign. In a rare move, the US Federal Reserve last night said that it could not gauge the economy's prospects due to uncertainties caused by imminent war in Iraq. But the Fed, which held interest rates at 1.25%, said that it was on \"heightened surveillance\", Fedspeak for its willingness to cut interest rates at short notice. US rates are already at their lowest for decades in an attempt to overcome sluggish growth in the world's largest economy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
