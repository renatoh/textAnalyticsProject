The Italian newspaper ran the headline above a story featuring the former Manchester United players whose teams face each other in Serie A on Friday. Roma\u2019s Smalling said the front page was \u201cwrong and highly insensitive\u201d while Internazionale\u2019s Lukaku said the paper was \u201cfuelling negativity and racism\u201d. \u201cWhilst I would have liked to spend the day focusing on the big game tomorrow, it is important that I acknowledge that what occurred this morning was wrong and highly insensitive,\u201d said Smalling in a statement on Twitter. \u201cI hope the editors involved in running this headline take responsibility and understand the power they possess through words, and the impact those words can have.\u201d Smalling also thanked Roma for their support. The club had earlier on Thursday tweeted their disgust of the front page. Lukaku also made a statement on Twitter. \u201cInstead of focusing on a battle between two teams Corriere dello Sport comes with the most dumbest of headlines I have ever seen in my career,\u201d he said. \u201cYou guys keep fuelling the negativity and the racism issue instead of talking about the beautiful game that\u2019s going to be played at San Siro between two great clubs. Education is key. You guys of Corriere dello Sport should do a better job at that.\u201d Inter did not reference the newspaper article but tweeted: \u201cFootball is passion, culture and brotherhood. We are and will always be against all forms of discrimination.\u201d The paper rejected strongly accusations of racism, on Twitter labelling its treatment by accusers as a \u201clynching\u201d and in Friday\u2019s edition defending its long-held stance against discrimination. The paper\u2019s director, Ivan Zazzaroni, produced a remarkable defence, saying it was \u201cinnocent\u201d and that the article by the journalist Roberto Perrone had \u201cbeen made poisonous by those who have poison inside them\u201d. Lukaku\u2019s Italian agent, Federico Pastorello, said he was \u201creally ashamed to read\u201d such a headline. \u201cWe are trying to protect our clients from this huge problem [racism] because it\u2019s not only a newspaper but it\u2019s a problem you can breathe in the stadium, in social media, on the street,\u201d he told Sky Sports News, adding that Lukaku was not happy with the headline but that \u201che\u2019s strong enough to face it\u201d. The Fare network, which works against discrimination and for social inclusion in football, also tweeted, saying: \u201cThe media fuels racism every day. This is today\u2019s edition of Italian sport daily Corriere dello Sport.\u201d Fare\u2019s executive director, Piara Powar, said: \u201cPart of the problem we have with Italy and countries like that at the moment is people do not know where to draw a line. They don\u2019t know what is the right or wrong thing to do, what is appropriate or inappropriate and what might be racism and what might be acceptable. \u201cWould they ever take two white Italian players and say it\u2019s \u2018White Tuesday\u2019? They wouldn\u2019t and this is the issue. Why would you pick out two players who are black and highlight their race as a way to build up to the match? It crosses the line of acceptability.\u201d In the article the newspaper appeared to attempt to highlight the league\u2019s racism problem. \u201cIn the faces of those idiots who boo, tomorrow everyone must instead go \u2018oooh\u2019 like children. It will be a Black Friday, but this is not an end-of-season sale,\u201d the article said. It went on to describe Lukaku and Smalling as \u201ctwo giants of colour\u201d. Zazzaroni\u2019s defence of the front page and the article added to the anger and dismay in Italy and abroad. \u201cSocial media? \u2026 Full of noble grudges and cut-price indignation,\u201d it read. \u201cA kind thought a day keeps the doctor away. These days armies of right-minded people flock to the web to whitewash their beautiful souls. You locate the racist of the hour and off you go, in two strokes of the keyboard the stain has gone, you feel a better person in a better world. White, black, yellow.\u201d It continued: \u201cDenying the difference is the age-old stumbling block of the racist anti-racist. The mental slum inhabited by part-time moralists, who suddenly are always on duty. \u2018Black Friday\u2019, for those who want to and are able to understand it, was only ever praising diversity, taking pride in diversity, the magnificent wealth of diversity. If you don\u2019t understand it, it\u2019s because you can\u2019t do that. It is an innocent article, perfectly argued by Roberto Perrone, that has been turned to poison by people who are full of poison.\u201d Lukaku and Smalling have made successful starts to their careers in Italy. Lukaku has 10 goals in 14 Serie A games with Inter top of the league, one point ahead of Juventus. Smalling has been an ever-present since his debut against Atalanta towards the end of September and has scored two goals and provided one assist. Serie A has again been plagued by racist incidents this season, with Lukaku himself and the Brescia forward Mario Balotelli among those racially abused by supporters during games. An Italian TV pundit was sacked for saying the only way to stop Lukaku was to give him \u201c10 bananas to eat\u201d. Last week all 20 clubs in Italy\u2019s top tier signed an open letter which called on \u201call those who love Italian football\u201d to unite to try to eradicate its \u201cserious problem with racism\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
