The mail-order bride agency she signed up with in her native Kyrgyzstan had matched her with a fat, balding man in Seattle more than twice her age, but the attractive 18-year-old was determined to make her US marriage work. In early letters home to her parents - both music teachers - in their tiny flat in the Kyrgyzstan capital Bishkek, she praised her husband for his intelligence and smart dress sense. Two years after their wedding, Anastasia was dead, strangled and buried in a junkyard by her husband. Anastasia had had no idea that Indle King Jr was a violent thug divorced from a first overseas bride who testified in court how he had beaten her regularly and pounded her head against a wall. 'For this family, the promised land became the devil's land,' said Seattle prosecutor Jim Krider before King, 40, was jailed for 29 years last year. Now the booming mail-order bride industry has come under the spotlight and two Washington state politicians plan to introduce legislation to offer greater protection for 4,000 to 6,000 women, mainly from former Soviet bloc countries and the Philippines, who come to the US each year for marriage. 'We want to ensure that any person coming here for that reason is getting a better idea of what they are getting into,' said Democratic Congressman Rick Larsen, who plans to place the Bill before the House of Representatives this week. A key component of the Bill, which will be simultaneously presented to the US Senate by Washington Senator Maria Cantwell, will be the introduction of compulsory background checks on Americans who apply for US visas for foreign fianc\u00e9es. Clients of US-based marriage introduction services will also have to answer questions about their marital history and disclose any past abuse. All information would be made available to the potential spouse overseas. Larsen and Cantwell are still shaping the final provisions of the Bill, but it will also include a requirement to ensure that all foreign-born fianc\u00e9es are notified of their rights. The final proposal would restrict the number of visa applications an American can make for potential overseas partners to one in any 12-month period. There is currently no limit. 'It's what I call the wife lottery,' said Larsen. 'Some people have had up to five visa applications in at a time.' Most introduction services operate on the internet. An estimated 300 agencies operate in the US alone offering overseas introductions, a 50 per cent increase on four years ago. 'These internet matchmaking services offer images to men and women that are inflated,' said Leslye Orloff, director of the Immigrant Women's Programme at the New York-based women's rights group, the Now Legal Defense and Education Fund. 'They market compliant, docile, controllable women and in any mismatched relationship there will be expectations that set the couple up for marital problems.' Those in the industry say they have no objection to the introduction of compulsory background checks, but remain unconvinced of the need for legislation. 'It's clear that it is designed to work against matchmaking services,' said Natasha Spivack, of the Encounters International agency in Maryland, which claims to have brokered almost 250 marriages. 'There are real abuses, but we need to look at it realistically, and since so much time has been put into this legislation it should be fair and require checks on the women as well.' Larsen insists that the Bill does not seek to curtail the industry, but to provide better education and protection. He knows it cannot bring back Anastasia but might prevent a similar tragedy. As Anastasia's mother, Alevtina, said: 'If our family had known about this problem we would never have agreed for our only daughter to come over here. What happened was probably due to our naive perception of the world.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
