John Fahey The First Noel Tiring of the fact that no one wanted to buy albums of experimental American primitive guitar music, but they bought White Christmas every year, John Fahey recorded an album of Christmas instrumentals. It was, by a margin, his bestselling record. Atypical of his work, but beautiful. 49. The Sonics Don\u2019t Believe in Christmas The Sonics believed some folks liked the taste of straight strychnine, so of course they didn\u2019t believe in Christmas. What happened when they stayed up late to try to catch a glimpse of Santa? \u201cWell, sure enough, don\u2019t ya know / The fat boy didn\u2019t show.\u201d Cheeky so-and-sos. 48. Emmy the Great &amp; Tim Wheeler Christmas Day (I Wish I Was Surfing) Sounding much more like Ash than Emmy the Great \u2013 and the loudest, most raucous thing on their 2011 Christmas album \u2013 this is a song that sounds joyous, but is really about the desire to escape, to anywhere that isn\u2019t cold. So long as it\u2019s not alone. 47. Little Joey Farr Rock\u2019n\u2019Roll Christmas Rock\u2019n\u2019roll and rockabilly are a treasure trove of Christmas novelty numbers (try Marlene Paula\u2019s I Want To Spend Xmas with Elvis), but we\u2019ve only got room for one. So, given Christmas is all about the kids, bless their souls, let\u2019s have a song by an actual kid who promptly disappeared from the pop world. 46. Lou Rawls Santa Claus Is Comin\u2019 to Town One imagines this would be the soundtrack to Don Draper\u2019s Christmas \u2013 as creamy as eggnog, with a supple swing that\u2019s nagging but not unobtrusive, it\u2019s exactly the sound of an idealised Christmas from the 60s. Rawls made a ton of Christmas albums, but his first from 1967 is the best. 45. Ronnie James Dio, Tony Iommi, Rudy Sarzo &amp; Simon Wright God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen How would Christmas sound reimagined by Black Sabbath? Almost exactly as you would imagine, to be honest. The most oddly foreboding of all the big Christmas songs suits the grinding and roaring. And it helps, naturally, that it contains a reference to \u201cSatan\u2019s power\u201d. 44. Saint Etienne I Was Born on Christmas Day From fire and brimstone to prosecco and chocolate, bursting with optimism for the winter: \u201cGetting groovy after Halloween / Mid-November, got back on the scene / I\u2019m so glad that I just got my pay / I was born on Christmas Day!\u201d A song as sweet as a selection box. 43. The Free Design Close Your Mouth (It\u2019s Christmas) Probably the song that goes on in Don Draper\u2019s apartment after Lou Rawls, when the hip young kids have arrived. \u201cGet to know the people in your house,\u201d they sing. \u201cYou might like them.\u201d Draper knocks back a whisky, raises an eyebrow and shakes his head. 42. Sally Shapiro Anorak Christmas A gorgeous bauble from the mid-00s wave of Scandinavian music that crossed electropop with the feyest indie. Sally falls in love on a Tuesday before Christmas, \u201cat a gig with a band that we both liked\u201d. But will she end up by herself \u201cor in the perfect kiss\u201d? 41. Solomon Burke Presents for Christmas The king of rock\u2019n\u2019soul pitches himself somewhere between a revivalist preacher and Santa Claus: \u201cWe want to give out a present to everybody this Christmas! All around the world for every man, woman, boy and girl!\u201d he exclaims in the intro. One of the few artists whose spoken sections routinely rival the songs (track down a copy of Soul Alive! if you don\u2019t believe me). 40. Joy Zipper Christmas Song Blank-faced and affectless, here\u2019s Christmas for the shoegazers from the duo briefly toasted at the start of the last decade. Kevin Shields and David Holmes produced, and you can bet Beach House were listening. 39. Neil Halstead The Man in the Santa Suit Truthfully, this version is only here because the Fountains of Wayne original \u2013 an homage to the Kinks\u2019 Father Christmas \u2013 isn\u2019t on Spotify. But what a perfect, sad song: \u201cAnd he\u2019s a big red cherry / But it\u2019s hard to be merry / When the kids are all laughing / Saying: \u2018Hey, it\u2019s Jerry Garcia.\u2019\u201d 38. The Everly Brothers Christmas Eve Can Kill You The Man in the Santa Suit is a laughfest compared to this Everly Brothers number from 1972, about a hitcher alone the night before Christmas. Organ and pedal steel sound like the wind whistling through the trees as our hero trudges on: \u201cThe sound of one man walkin\u2019 through the snow can break your heart.\u201d 37. Santo &amp; Johnny Twistin\u2019 Bells Do we need cheering up? I think we do. Thank goodness, then, for the twangy guitars of Brooklyn duo Santo &amp; Johnny, the gaudy, overlit shop window that contrasts with the stark loneliness of the Everly Brothers. 36. Run-DMC Christmas in Hollis Hip-hop hasn\u2019t been a huge source of Christmas songs, but Run-DMC were on top of it back in the first golden age. What would you do if you found Santa\u2019s wallet on Hollis Avenue? It\u2019s a perennial question. Run decides its best to post it back; he is rewarded for his honesty. 35. Shirley &amp; Dolly Collins The Gower Wassail Two of the greatest British folk voices combine for a drinking song that, if we\u2019re honest, is unlikely to be ringing out in pubs this Christmas. The asceticism of the British folk tradition can be a useful astringent amid the sleigh bells and tinsel. 34. Tracey Thorn Snow in Sun Originally from Scritti Politti\u2019s sublime 2006 album White Bread, Black Beer and reworked by Thorn on her gorgeous album Tinsel and Lights \u2013 which is enough to qualify it as a Christmas song \u2013 here is a featherlight breath of winter to freshen your face. 33. Mahalia Jackson Go Tell It on the Mountain You can\u2019t really have Christmas without acknowledging that someone significant was born on 25 December \u2013 and not just Bob Stanley of Saint Etienne. The queen of gospel wants you to spread the news far and wide, and she imparts her message with due gravitas. 32. Big Star Jesus Christ Big Star\u2019s Third is the least likely album to contain a Christmas song, but amid the desperation and despair was this huge burst of fervour. Did Alex Chilton mean it? Was it a joke? Its effect is magnified by the music that surrounds it on the rest of the album. 31. Calexico Green Grows the Holly Gorgeous and stern, and undoubtedly the best adaptation by an Americana band of any poem written by Henry VIII. The horns bloom, like the flowers of the song, turning something indisputably English into a desert lament. 30. Jimmy McGriff Winter Wonderland McGriff opens with a squall of organ that doesn\u2019t lead you to believe Christmas is coming anytime soon, then takes Winter Wonderland at such a leisurely pace that it takes a moment to recognise it. (If you like this, try Jimmy Smith\u2019s Christmas \u201964 as well.) 29. Sharon Jones &amp; the Dap-Kings Ain\u2019t No Chimneys in the Projects When you live in poverty, certain logistical problems come to mind. Namely, if you\u2019re in a big public housing block, how does Santa get the presents underneath the tree? A fabulous addition to the long line of socially conscious soul and funk Christmas music. 28. Sons of Heaven When Was Jesus Born? We all know the answer, but when it\u2019s posed this beautifully, in such impeccable close harmony, the obviousness of the question can be forgiven. There are many versions of this, but it\u2019s a hard song to do anything but beautifully. 27. Thea Gilmore Listen, the Snow Is Falling Yoko Ono\u2019s is the original version and Galaxie 500\u2019s rendition is more celebrated, but Thea Gilmore gets the perfect ratio of iciness to wonder \u2013 it sounds like a Christmas tree, if such a thing were possible. The 2009 album Strange Communion is highly recommended. 26. The Temptations Rudolph The Red-Nosed Reindeer Oh, wrap yourself in the blanket of those glorious voices! Motown took Christmas seriously, with the result that you could probably do this list entirely from Motown tracks. This one gets selected because what is really a fairly dismal song is transformed by a perfect arrangement. 25. Clarence Carter Back Door Santa Pure Christmas filth. Back Door Santa can \u201cmake all the little girls happy / While the boys are out to play.\u201d But don\u2019t mistake him for Father Christmas: \u201cI ain\u2019t like old Saint Nick / He don\u2019t come but once a year.\u201d I dare you not to dance, though. 24. Ramones Danny Says Merry Christmas (I Don\u2019t Want to Fight Tonight) is better known as a Ramones Christmas song, but the sublime Danny Says gets the nod, qualifying on the grounds that the desperate, lonely band are stuck on the road deep in winter and \u201cit ain\u2019t Christmas if there ain\u2019t no snow\u201d. 23. Cristina Things Fall Apart No matter how bad your Christmas is, it\u2019s not as bad as Cristina\u2019s. Mind you, given it\u2019s the early 80s New York art underground, she was probably forbidden from liking something so bourgeois. Even a party can\u2019t cheer her: \u201cI caught a cab back to my flat / And wept a bit and fed the cat.\u201d 22. Joni Mitchell River Joni Mitchell is bereft, too, on this gorgeous piano ballad, when Christmas just makes her mourn her relationship and flee Laurel Canyon for her home in Canada, where there might be a frozen river she could skate away on, away from everything. 21. David Banner The Christmas Song Completing the mini-run of joyless Christmases, here\u2019s the most joyless of all \u2013 when the only way to pay for Christmas is to rob and deal and kill. The climactic \u201cjingle bells, jingle bells, jingle all the way\u201d is not intended as cause for celebration. 20. Lindstr\u00f8m Little Drummer Boy Hans-Peter Lindstr\u00f8m takes almost 43 minutes to assemble a Christmas song \u2013 from electronic squiggles, through the martial drumbeat, to the melody coming in at eight minutes. It then spends a further 25 minutes warping and mutating, picking up and discarding musical phrases, before exploding orgasmically in its final 10 minutes or so. 19. William Bell Every Day Will Be a Holiday It doesn\u2019t actually mention Christmas, but gets counted \u2013 and not just by me \u2013 as a Christmas song because of the little horn lift from Jingle Bells, for it being about being lonely waiting for his baby to come home (presumably for Christmas), and because its B-side was Please Come Home For Christmas. It\u2019s also a fabulous piece of Stax soul. 18. Belle and Sebastian O Come, O Come Emmanuel On the 2000 charity album It\u2019s a Cool Cool Christmas \u2013 which was pretty strong \u2013 Belle and Sebastian took on the most beautiful of all the Christmas hymns. Something so delicate suited them. Also recommended: El Vez merging Feliz Navidad and Public Image. 17. The Staple Singers Who Took the Merry Out of Christmas? The Staple Singers are worried: too many wars, too much space exploration means people are \u201csearching for light and can\u2019t seem to find the right star\u201d. Jesus isn\u2019t just another baby boy, they warn. So show some respect. Glorious. 16. The Watersons Sound, Sound Your Instruments of Joy Just listen to the voices: this is Christmas as it must have sounded when it was a religious festival in the depths of winter, rather than an excuse to rack up debt. Make your own fun! Maybe weave an Action Man out of three pieces of straw! And yet it\u2019s so beautiful. 15. Eartha Kitt Santa Baby We\u2019re into the start of the big songs now, and Eartha Kitt\u2019s contribution is the precise opposite of the Watersons\u2019 vision of Christmas. She wants a sable, a convertible, a yacht, a platinum mine \u2026 She wants every sensation. And what\u2019s Jesus got to do with anything? 14. Otis Redding White Christmas Who knew the most famous Christmas hit of all could be so emotionally wrought? Where Bing Crosby sounded as if he was fondly pondering his Christmas, Otis sounds like he\u2019s breaking into a sweat trying to will it into existence through sheer force of desire. 13. The Pretenders 2000 Miles Sometimes simple is best: Robbie McIntosh\u2019s guitar playing on the Pretenders\u2019 1984 hit is a model of folk-rock restraint, taking from the Byrds, and offsetting Chrissie Hynde\u2019s voice and lyric with a sense that everything, somehow, is going to be OK. 12. Bob Seger and the Last Heard Sock It to Me Santa \u201cSanta\u2019s got a brand new bag!\u201d hollers Bob Seger, who was a Detroit R&amp;B shouter years before he became a heartland American beard rocker. Sock It to Me Santa is a fabulous explosion \u2013 garage rock and soul brought together into something made for the best bar in the city on Christmas Eve. 11. Wham! Last Christmas A big Christmas hit that was unlike previous UK seasonal singles \u2013 it wasn\u2019t wrapped in sleigh bells, there was nothing consciously novelty about it. Perhaps George Michael had been paying close attention to some of the great US Christmas soul singles, because this was a heartbreak song that just happened to be set in December. 10. Darlene Love Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) A Christmas Gift to You from Phil Spector codified the sound of Christmas: maximal, filled with signifiers of the season (there is nowhere sleigh bells can\u2019t be draped). Darlene Love\u2019s Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) was the standout on a record on which the quality didn\u2019t drop from start to finish. 9. Wizzard I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday Roy Wood\u2019s enduring contribution to the season owed a huge debt to Phil Spector \u2013 there\u2019s almost certainly a kitchen sink section at work somewhere in the mix \u2013 but it transcends imitation by its sheer verve. It was recorded in summer, with the studio air conditioning turned down to make everyone feel wintry. Attention to detail, right there. 8. Slade Merry Xmas Everybody Christmas 1973 brought not just Wizzard but the most enduring of all British Christmas singles. Forty-six years later, people still bellow \u201cIt\u2019s CHRISTMAS!\u201d in Noddy Holder\u2019s face, which, apparently, gets a little wearisome. The whole thing was Jim Lea\u2019s mum\u2019s idea \u2013 why didn\u2019t Slade have a song they could release every year? She got her wish. 7. Donny Hathaway This Christmas It wasn\u2019t a hit at the time, but took off when it was included on a 1991 reissue of the 1968 Atco compilation Soul Christmas. To which you can only say: why did it take the world so long to notice? It\u2019s a Christmas song that stands up regardless of the season. And according to the publishing body Ascap, it\u2019s now the 30th most performed Christmas song of all time in the US. 6. Tom Waits Christmas Card from a Hooker in Minneapolis Probably not one to play when you\u2019re unwrapping the presents. A character study that begins grimly, then offers hope, as the narrator says things are getting better \u2013 before ripping the rug away without ceremony. Do you want to know the truth of it, she asks: \u201cCharley, hey, I\u2019ll be eligible for parole come Valentine\u2019s day.\u201d 5. Marvin Gaye Purple Snowflakes A song so beautiful it\u2019s almost otherworldly \u2013 Marvin Gaye\u2019s flawless falsetto, the unexpected chord changes, the sense of mystery. Yet it\u2019s wrapped up in the most comforting of Christmas imagery \u2013 chestnuts roasting, blankets of white \u2013 without ever explaining why the snowflakes are purple. 4. The Waitresses Christmas Wrapping Like Cristina\u2019s Things Fall Apart, Christmas Wrapping was originally written for the Z\u00e9 label\u2019s 1981 compilation \u2013 the most punching-above-its-weight Christmas comp ever. It\u2019s a fabulous stream of consciousness, during which Patty Donahue talks herself from wanting to miss Christmas to knowing she can\u2019t miss Christmas, that bursts into joy at its horn refrain. 3. Low Just Like Christmas Low\u2019s 1999 Christmas EP \u2013 released as a \u201cgift\u201d to fans \u2013 was one of the most unexpected seasonal delights: ascetic indie band embracing the season without irony. Its lead track was a joy, the discomfort of touring reminding them of when they were young, and it feeling just like Christmas. Just two verses, and a repeated refrain \u2013 perfect. 2. The Pogues Fairytale of New York There\u2019s almost nothing left to be said about Fairytale of New York, a song that has been impossible to avoid for more than 30 years. Such is the strength of the songwriting and the grace of the performance that, despite the overexposure, it feels fresh every single time. That a scrappy folk-punk band produced something that will endure as long as Christmas itself is a real Christmas miracle. 1. Mariah Carey All I Want for Christmas Is You The best Christmas songs should only work at Christmas. They should make you feel festive, in the same way that the 174th repeat of The Snowman does. They should work anywhere \u2013 in shopping centres, in bars, pumping out of PAs in gig venues after the band has gone off, on the radio in a cafe, in your home or on your headphones. All I Want for Christmas Is You is all of those things. It\u2019s a shameless pastiche of Phil Spector that\u2019s so brazen and joyful and simple \u2013 it took Carey and Walter Afanasieff only 15 minutes to write \u2013 that it transcends its lack of originality. It\u2019s the rare modern Christmas song that has become a standard, and deservedly so."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
