At first, I thought this was because I looked stressed out, or sick - although I felt quite all right. Almost two-and-a-half months later, I think I know why people keep asking: it's because the NHS is a huge obsession for the British. No, I haven't needed the health service, but I have read a lot of stories about it. Not enough doctors; poorly performing doctors; doctors paid too much; premature babies dying unnecessarily because of mismanaged reform of neonatal units; unacceptable standards of food in hospitals; mental health units being closed down; hospitals failing to meet government targets for tackling superbug infections; investment in NHS computer systems that don't work, and so on. Hopefully, not even half of those media stories are true. Brits may be proud to have a health system free for everyone, but they rarely stop complaining about how badly it performs. In Germany, we don't live in a health paradise either, and people do worry about the sustainability of our health system. But we Germans, on the whole, do not worry about the quality of our healthcare, which we consider to be very good. We are willing to pay for medicine and healthcare services in return for maintaining that high quality. In England, it seems to be just the opposite: nobody has to pay, but they moan all the same. My impression is that things for free are rarely assigned value in British society. But then life in Britain, especially in London, seems to be a matter of money. Making money. Making more money. I read that a huge percentage of the wealth in England belongs to just a few per cent of people. Such a huge gulf between the rich and the poor would cause a social revolution in Germany. Although the wealth gap is widening in my country, it feels that there is more social mobility. It is hard to imagine, in a Britain obsessed by class and money, a working-class boy like Gerhard Schr\u00f6der, the former German chancellor, becoming prime minister. Work is another obsession. But this seems intimately connected to the money thing - and to another obsession, housing. Your job does not bring enough money? Well, just take another one. But then affording even necessities such as housing, especially in London, is a struggle. In Britain, high earners even in their 20s aspire to buy their homes; renting, which is common in Germany, is regarded as the oddest thing in the world. If you don't earn lots of money, then you must share not just flats but rooms. Yes, rooms! Have a look at the Gumtree website - as I did when I searched for somewhere to stay in London - and you'll find many adverts offering these. Polish people, and other migrant workers from EU accession countries, it appears, commonly share rooms, four or five beds together. (By the way, I was shocked when Gordon Brown, a Labour prime minister, declared his aim for the next term of government: \"British jobs for British workers\". If any leading German politician said this, there would be a huge row about nationalism.) So far, so bad? Well, of course there are also aspects of the English society I did, and still do, enjoy. For instance, English society seems to be a strongly caring one - another obsession, I think. \"Mind the gap\" is just one of those \"caring\" impulses you are confronted with in daily life. Getting on and off a tube train in London, you'll hear this friendly demand over the public address system over and over again. Everywhere you go, whatever you do, someone tells you nicely how to behave and survive: how to queue correctly; how to store the food in your fridge; not to scream at the staff in your bank; not to smoke in public. You British are so very helpful! \u00b7 Susanne Lang is a journalist for Tageszeitung, a Berlin-based newspaper.
