United went down after they failed to beat Wigan Athletic on the final day and Carlos Tevez scored the winner in West Ham United's 1-0 win at Manchester United, after the Argentinian was allowed to play despite being partly owned by a third party. Following the Yorkshire club's relegation Warnock left United in acrimonious circumstances, and he no longer speaks to Kevin McCabe, the owner. The Rangers manager, whose team kick off at home to Bolton Wanderers on Saturday, said: \"The toothache is gone but now the driving thing before I finish [as a manager] is to stabilise the club in the Premiership. I don't want to manage anywhere else. It is my desire to prove people wrong that drives me on. It has been since I was a player. When I [was the subject] of free transfers I wanted to prove the manager wrong for letting me go. \"When I got sacked at a football club I wanted to prove them wrong. And, without a shadow of a doubt, I was disappointed at the way I left Sheffield United and the people that I knew there. I felt that I had something to prove to them really.\" Warnock accepts QPR, who are among the favourites to go straight back down, will be \"turned over\" on occasion this season but points to Blackpool's approach last season. \"Last year was a very illuminating time for me watching Blackpool play,\" he said. \"I know they got relegated but they epitomised playing without fear. They weren't worried about getting turned over. The teams that have been promoted will get turned over here and there. But there shouldn't be a fear factor in the Premier League. It's a privilege to be here.\" With Thursday's signing of the Brazilian defender Bruno Perone subject to international clearance, Warnock has lifted the number of QPR recruits this summer to six. The 24-year-old has agreed a one-year deal following a trial and the manager said: \"Bruno has fitted in very well in the time he has been with us. When the time comes I am sure we will be able to put him in the team with confidence.\" Jay Bothroyd, DJ Campbell, Danny Gabbidon, Kieron Dyer and Brian Murphy have also joined and Warnock is intent on further strengthening. \"We want one or even maybe two more players before the end of August,\" said the 62-year-old. \"When the 25-man squad comes out I'm looking at one or even two Premier league players on loan. We've lost Wayne Routledge from last season [and] Jamie Mackie has been out injured, although we're hoping he gets the go-ahead to join in now.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
