Exhibited in Sin Fronteras at the Palacio de la Magdalena PhotoEspana, Madrid\u2019s annual celebration of photography, offers an extensive programme of exhibitions to suit all tastes. The work of established figures such William Klein, Berenice Abbott, and Manuel \u00c1lvarez Bravo is on display alongside shows introducing young, emerging European photographers. The subjects of the exhibitions are equally diverse, ranging from rare Soviet photobooks to snapshots bought on eBay, from collective projects decades in the making to solo undertakings completed in months.

Portraits by Diana Markosian await the hang at Casa de America International Women\u2019s Day march, Madrid, 2019 by Donna Ferrato. From the exhibition Holy at C\u00edrculo de Bellas Artes Among the many highlights is a comprehensive overview of photography projects by Stephen Shore, Josef Koudelka, Lewis Baltz, Sophie Ristelhueber and Raymond Depardon, who were officially commissioned to chart the changing landscapes of Europe from the early 1980s to the present day. Two exhibitions celebrate Donna Ferrato\u2019s tireless work in combating domestic abuse. And the late Leila Alaoui\u2019s sympathetic portraits of The Moroccans are displayed to sober effect at Casa \u00c1rabe. From the series Like by Eduardo Nave, at Galer\u00eda Juan Sili\u00f3 We are here, Seclin, 2001, from the series Lille Metropolis by Ralph Hinterkeuser, at Museo Ico Esauira, 2012 by Leila Alaoui from The Moroccans at Casa \u00c1rabe At the heart of the festival are five exhibitions of art photography, gathered under the heading deja vu because of their dependence on antecedent traditions, ideas and works, which reflect on the current nature, limits and possibilities of the medium. Elina Brotherus, for example, produces work that engages with the legacy of conceptual art of the 1960s and 70s. Clare Strand makes painted versions of tabloid photographs. Patrick Pound and D\u00e9lio Jasse reinterpret archival material to radically different ends. Laura Letinsky and Sharon Core use the still life as a means of raising questions about genre, tradition and reproduction.

Included here are rarely seen early paintings as a student of Fernand L\u00e9ger, uncompromising street photography, iconoclastic fashion work, starkly abstract scientific studies, painted contact sheets and vivid film work.

Photograph: JJ Guillen / EPA Javier Vallhonrat Poliptico 4, 2017, at Real Jard\u00edn Bot\u00e1nico For more than 10 years, Javier Vallhonrat has explored, studied and photographed the Maladeta glacier in the Pyrenees. The duration of the project, the intensity of its focus and the rigour of the fieldwork are evident in the imposing and magisterial works on show. Aerial imagery outlines the development of the Maladeta over time. And ground level pictures, assembled as collages, reveal the scarred surfaces of the glacier. Their presentation suggests tectonic plates perhaps, and the fragmentary nature of Vallhonrat\u2019s subject Tienda negra, 2016 Perfil, 2016 Elina Brotherus At Least One Egg, 2016, at Fern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez Centro Cultural de la Villa Elina Brotherus exhibits a body of work that follows the protocols and strictures of conceptual artists of the 1960s and 70s, especially the Fluxus group. Her photographs are records of her staged enactments of proposals, or \u201cscores\u201d, issued by the group as guides for artistic practice. Self-expression, artistic freedom and autobiography are thereby reined in. Like all good conceptualists, Brotherus appears impeccably deadpan throughout, though she did confide that there was plenty of off-camera laughter between shoots. Flux Harpsichord Concert, 2017 Orange Event, 2017 Patrick Pound All photographs from the archive of Patrick Pound, at Museo L\u00e1zaro Galdiano Collector Patrick Pound curates an exhibition of vintage photographs of diverse subjects thematically unified by the show\u2019s invisible focus, air. Flags, wind instruments, hot air balloons and wind-blown hair abound in a playful show that attests to Pound\u2019s wit and imagination \u2013 and to the power of Google image searches and eBay. A wind instrument; and a steamer Wind-blown hair and flags flying Offland From The Mermaid Madonna series, by Eirini Vourloumis at Centro Cultural Galileo Offland showcases eight young European photographers, among them Eirini Vourloumis and Myrto Papadopoulos, whose work addresses, to varying degrees, themes of imagined Arcadias, refuge and identity. Papadopoulos\u2019s understated yet compelling pictures focus on Greece\u2019s Pomak minority and the women left behind by husbands who have emigrated to northern Europe for economic reasons. Vourloumis\u2019s poignant series The Mermaid Madonna draws parallels between historically remote episodes of migration from Turkey to the island of Lesbos in the Aegean. Suzanne 16, plays with her phone, while her family go to pick up chestnuts to sell in the local market, Thrace, Greece, 2017, by Myrto Papadopoulos Untitled, Lesbos, Greece, from the series The Mermaid Madonna by Eirini Vourloumis De\u0301lio Jasse All photographs from The Lost Chapter, 2018, at Fern\u00e1n G\u00f3mez Centro Cultural de la Villa D\u00e9lio Jasse exhibits two bodies of work, Lost Chapter Nampula \u2013 1963 and Nova Lisboa. Both combine documents salvaged from a Lisbon flea market with archival photographs of the family lives of Europeans in colonial Africa. Official stamps and lettering overlay and often obscure the monochromatic domestic scenarios. Jasse gives potent pictorial form to the integration of institutional forces, personal lives and colonial history"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
