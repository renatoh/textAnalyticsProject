In the 11-year history of the championship there have been seven clean sweeps, with France compiling three, Wales two, and Ireland and England one apiece. And that's the way it will stay for now. England came to Dublin looking to win their first for eight years and were sent packing by an Irish side that rediscovered at last \u2013 and about four games too late \u2013 the intensity and rhythm that earned them the slam of '09. Nobody rose to the occasion on the England side. Having been jolted in the last of their run of three games at home by Scotland, England looked as if they had opted for analysis in the week, rather than cranking themselves up for the savagery of a game in Dublin. Details not dog. Donncha O'Callaghan and Paul O'Connell have grown in stature as the championship has gone on. Here they eclipsed the partnership of Louis Deacon and Tom Palmer, who had been unruffled until this point in the supply chain. James Haskell had made many yards for England; here he was smothered by any of the combination of David Wallace, Sean O'Brien and Jamie Heaslip \u2013 sometimes all of them. Ben Youngs and Toby Flood, long before the yellow card shown to the scrum-half, had looked uncertain and imprecise. It was a day of exposure and pain. So, there was no grand slam. England are left wondering how the steam went out of a campaign that started with breathtaking audacity. This is no year in which to go from good to indifferent. What their defeat did produce was an invitation to Wales to go out, beat France by 27 points in Paris and take the title. Jamie Roberts gave a performance that announced that it is never too late to make a return to form, but the Welsh \"thank you\" for the opportunity to challenge for the title was probably a little muted. About as loud in fact as the gratitude expressed by the member of the analysis unit when Shaun Edwards took against him. The defence coach was left at home and the Welsh challenge went the way of England's, the bathos of the day hardly lifted by the handing over of the silverware in Dublin. Cups have been received less sheepishly. Without a clean sweep to celebrate, the Six Nations may be judged rather feebly in comparison with the Tri Nations of the southern hemisphere. But it still managed to produce a quite extraordinary event, Italy's defeat of France. From being mocked as almost as bad a conversion into a kicker as his brother Mauro into a scrum-half, Mirco Bergamasco stroked over his penalties. On shoulders that could hardly bear any more weight, Sergio Parisse hoisted yet more load and thundered into France. Andrea Masi went from wandering minstrel of the back line to ground-eating full\u2011back, scorer of tries against France and Scotland. But above all, Italy posed as a collective picture of joy in Rome after beating France. The embraces offered to the coach, Nick Mallett, by his players spoke of a rare bond between conductor and orchestra. Will Marc Li\u00e8vremont ever be clamped to the bosom of his French players? Once the words \"cowardice\" and \"betrayal\" have passed your lips in the analysis of a performance, it takes some kind of apology to swing the changing room back your way. France crave consistency and yet chop and change their players at every turn. The management apparently insist on imposing a style template, where the game is split into neat quarters, on players that have been bred to react instinctively to what they find before them, no matter where or when. On the northern Celtic edge, there was also much agonising. Scotland are no doubt doing the forensics on the hole they fell into between their high hopes before round one and their home win over Italy. Never has so much lineout ball been won, by locks Richie Gray and Alastair Kellock, and wasted by backs all the way down the line. As the Celtic performances grew tighter and tighter \u2013 Wales won three on the trot by refusing to keep the ball \u2013 everything became condensed into the question of confidence. May there not be a little more to it than that? Wales, Scotland and Ireland will play in World Cup groups that are not going to be navigated by cutting dreamy patterns of daring and adventure. Wales have Fiji and Samoa in their group, and are more likely to chance their arm against South Africa than the islanders of the South Pacific. A kicking game that allows Samoa and Fiji to counterattack on home soil \u2013 this is not just a home World Cup for New Zealand, but also for everyone that learned to play there \u2013 may appear risky, but Wales may fancy it more than a free-for-all. Ireland have the slight advantage of having two minnows in their pool \u2013 how weird to be calling Russia and the USA that \u2013 but if Australia are undeniably their toughest opponent, there is the hottest property in the market of emotion-laden rugby to face. Italy. The Six Nations has reshaped World Cup prospects. England have Scotland in their group, as well as Argentina, Georgia and Romania. Did anything happen at Twickenham last week to make the Scots dread playing England on neutral soil? As one tournament closes its doors, the next opens silently on well oiled hinges. European rugby moves on, not so well lubricated but still vibrant and engaging. Not good enough for a grand slam, but rumbling self-consciously towards the World Cup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
