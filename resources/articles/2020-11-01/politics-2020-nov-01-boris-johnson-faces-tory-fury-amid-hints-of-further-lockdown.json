The prime minister will tell parliament that without the draconian new measures, which will come into force across England on Thursday, deaths from coronavirus over the winter could be \u201ctwice as bad or even worse\u201d than in the first wave. He will promise the government will \u201cseek to ease\u201d restrictions when the measures are due to expire. However, cabinet minister Michael Gove made clear on Sunday they could be left in place if they have not yet brought the infection rate down sufficiently. Gove said: \u201cWe\u2019ve got this four-week period, during which we\u2019re going to review progress, but of course we\u2019ll always be driven by the data. We will always take a decision in the national interest, based on evidence.\u201d Pressed by Sophy Ridge on Sky News about whether that meant the measures could be extended, he said \u201cyes\u201d. Sage member Jeremy Farrar, the chair of the Wellcome Trust, echoed Gove\u2019s caution, saying it was important not to be too \u201cfixed\u201d about the 2 December end date. If the infection rate, hospital admissions and other key metrics had not fallen far enough by then, he said, the measures should be extended. \u201cMuch better to do that than remove these restrictions and then have to impose even more draconian restrictions over Christmas or soon into the new year,\u201d he told BBC One\u2019s The Andrew Marr Show. The latest official data showed that on Sunday, 23,254 people were tested positive for Covid-19 in the UK. A further 162 people had died within 28 days of a positive test. Johnson will set out his plan to parliament after a chaotic weekend that saw his dramatic announcement brought forward after it was leaked on Friday evening, causing shock among his own backbenchers. Amid forecasts that the economy could take a hit of up to 10% as a result of the new curbs, the Bank of England is poised to announce a fresh cash injection into the economy later this week. The City had been expecting a resumption of Threadneedle Street\u2019s quantitative easing programme even before the new lockdown was announced, but now sees a fresh support package as inevitable. The Treasury plans to announce more generous support for the self-employed following the continuation of the furlough scheme for employees, but no further measures from the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, are currently planned. Gerard Lyons, who was chief economic adviser to Johnson when he was mayor of London, said the lockdown was \u201cterrible news\u201d for the economy, which he said could shrink by up to 10%. \u201cThis lockdown will ensure that a large section of the economy will be in a moribund state and will require huge new stimulus and help,\u201d Lyons said. Sunak had previously resisted a nationwide shutdown amid fears about its economic cost, but signed up to the plan in the face of the risk of hospitals being overwhelmed within weeks without action. \u201cIf you have an NHS that\u2019s not going to function, people are not going to be running off shopping, they\u2019re going to stay at home. The economy gets crumpled anyway \u2013 and people lose faith in government,\u201d said a Whitehall source. Sunak\u2019s abrupt decision to extend the furlough scheme, which pays 80% of workers\u2019 wages in affected businesses, was met with fury among northern mayors, who repeatedly urged him to take the same approach when cities including Manchester and Liverpool were facing tough tier 3 restrictions last month. \u201cThis morning millions of people woke up knowing the prime minister of this country believes the north is worth less than the south,\u201d Steve Rotheram, the Liverpool city region mayor, said. \u201cQuite frankly, the government has treated us with contempt again.\u201d Andy Burnham, the mayor of Greater Manchester, called for an end to the government\u2019s \u201cdifferential treatment\u201d of people on low wages and \u201cpeople in the north versus people in the south\u201d. Conservative MPs also lined up to criticise the government\u2019s approach on Sunday. Sir Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Westminster Hour that he will vote against the government\u2019s lockdown measures in the vote on Wednesday. Former Brexit secretary David Davis said he feared the lockdown would last until the spring, as the virus resurges. \u201cIn March, Boris said let\u2019s hope this will only last four weeks, and it lasted four months. My firm belief this time is it will last six months. Because when it gets to 2 December and R is still 1.5, which it will be, because this lockdown will hold less well than the last one, then it will have to continue.\u201d He said only countries that have aggressively pursued a \u201ctest, trace and isolate\u201d approach, including drastic measures such as closing borders and separating those testing positive from their families in isolation wards, had managed to control it successfully. Another former cabinet minister said they believed ministers had been left with little choice but to act, but the \u201cshambles\u201d of the weekend \u201ccould cost us dearly in the polls\u201d. Former minister George Freeman said he would support the government \u2013 but only on the basis of a clear strategy that would see more power handed to local leaders to balance health and economic risks in their areas in the future. MPs will be given a vote on the measures on Wednesday, before they come into force \u2013 but they are likely to pass with Labour support, even if a significant number of Conservatives rebel. The shadow health secretary, Jonathan Ashworth, will urge the government to use the four-week lockdown period to fix the shortcomings in the test-and-trace system. He will call for much more extensive \u201cretrospective\u201d contact tracing to identify the source of outbreaks, and urge the government to use new rapid saliva-based testing kits to carry out weekly screening of high-risk workers. These should include NHS staff, as well as other at-risk workers such as those in education, transport, retail and hospitality, Ashworth will suggest. \u201cCoronavirus is growing with ferocity and urgent action is needed to bring the R below 1 nationwide which is why Labour urged Boris Johnson to use the opportunity of the half-term holiday for a time-limited \u2018circuit break\u2019,\u201d he said. \u201cThis didn\u2019t happen, and test and trace have been overwhelmed. Controlling Covid-19 depends on fixing tracing, ensuring the quick turnaround of tests and introducing regular, weekly testing to identify the 70% of carriers who may not have symptoms but can still spread the virus.\u201d Speaking to MPs, Johnson will stand by his decision not to lock England down earlier as scientific advisers recommended in September \u2013 a choice Labour claims will have cost lives. \u201cI know some in the house believe we should have reached this decision earlier, but I believe it was right to try every possible option to get this virus under control at a local level, with strong local action and strong local leadership,\u201d the prime minister is expected to say."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
