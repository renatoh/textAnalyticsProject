Hollick, the former owner of Express Newspapers and ITV franchises including Meridian and Anglia, says promises by newspaper groups that they can self-regulate should not be believed. \"The historic pattern of national papers being disgraced and called to account, and then promising to regulate themselves more effectively, has been repeated so often, and with such disappointing and even tragic results, that the public can never again be asked to accept mere promises,\" he said in a submission to the inquiry that has just been published. Hollick, who retired as chief executive of United Business Media in 2005, had a relatively brief fling with the newspaper industry having acquired Express Newspapers, including the Daily Express, Sunday Express and Daily Star in 1996, before selling the group to Richard Desmond four years later. Hollick said Lord Justice Leveson has exposed \"some of the ugly and unacceptable methods that have been used by some newspapers,\" adding that the \"victims\" of these lapses in ethical standards have \"the right to expect protection from such abuse and the right to swift, effective and affordable redress\". \"Not only has the Press Complaints Commission failed as a regulator and consequently lost the trust of the public, but it is also clear that the whole idea of self-regulation of the industry must now be abandoned,\" he added. He proposed a new statute to facilitate a reformed watchdog, which would have the powers to provide an alternative dispute resolution service, offering those who feel they have been libelled or have had their privacy invaded a cheaper path to justice than the courts. He also proposes that difficult cases be referred to Ofcom."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
