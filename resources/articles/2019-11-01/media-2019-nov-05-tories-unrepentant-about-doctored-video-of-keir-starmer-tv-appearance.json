In the Tory version of an interview with ITV\u2019s Good Morning Britain, produced by the party for its social media channels, Starmer is shown unable to speak after being asked about Labour\u2019s position on the EU, with his face appearing under the caption \u201cLabour has no plan for Brexit\u201d. In reality, the shadow Brexit secretary did provide a lengthy answer regarding his discussions with other EU countries over the past three years and insisted: \u201cA customs union and single market alignment and protection of workers\u2019 rights and environmental rights and consumer rights is something that can be negotiated.\u201d The Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan said that Starmer\u2019s answer may have been \u201cunconvincing\u201d but the way the video was edited by the Tories was \u201cmisleading and unfair\u201d. Speaking on Wednesday at a campaign event in Lambeth, south London, Starmer said political parties should not get involved in doctoring videos of their political opponents. \u201cI actually saw it as an act of desperation. It is only when you think things are not going well that you get involved in those sorts of activities. \u201cI think this particular matter has backfired for the Conservatives because they have spent all morning trying to defend what they did,\u201d he told the Guardian. After being called out on the party\u2019s decision to edit the video, the Conservative party failed to apologise and appeared to revel in the extra attention. Its press office encouraged more people to watch the original \u201ccar-crash interview\u201d on Good Morning Britain. Morgan tweeted in response: \u201cYou doctored the end of the clip you originally put out, to make it look like @Keir_Starmer had no answer to my question. In fact he answered immediately. You could have had plenty of fun with that interview anyway \u2013 why fake it?\u201d In response, the Tory party tweeted a new video with the comment: \u201cFair point @piersmorgan. Is this version better?\u201d The new film is almost identical to the original, but instead of misleadingly showing Starmer blinking and licking his lips as he fails to respond to Morgan\u2019s question, it instead freezes the frame on his face and zooms in. The Conservative chairman, James Cleverly, told BBC Breakfast the video was \u201cobviously edited\u201d and denied it had been \u201cdoctored\u201d, saying the difference mattered because the words had different connotations: \u201cThe idea that people couldn\u2019t see that it wasn\u2019t a shorter form of video, that\u2019s not a credible position to put forward.\u201d Starmer said Cleverly has been caught out. \u201cI know Cleverly has tried to laugh it off as satire but he knows what he was up to,\u201d he said. The incident highlights the difficulty in reporting on misinformation and online duplicity during a general election. The extra attention given to misleading social media posts often creates a feedback loop, with algorithms on Twitter and Facebook responding to the high levels of user engagement by pushing it into more people\u2019s feeds. This has led to fears that there is very little to be lost by political parties reinforcing lies and deceptive material in a media environment where the aim is often to get attention at all costs and by any means. After the misleading edit of the video was highlighted by the BBC journalist Daniel Sandford, the video attracted almost a million additional views."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
