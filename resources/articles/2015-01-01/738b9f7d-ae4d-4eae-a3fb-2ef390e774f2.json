Pulis was said to be delighted that Francis, manager at QPR and Tottenham in the 1990s, \u201chas agreed to extend their partnership into a seventh year and a third Premier League club\u201d, according to a statement on the West Brom website. Francis\u2019s position was not spelled out but Dave Kemp will be assistant head coach. Jewell joined Pulis last Tuesday as a joint assistant alongside Kemp, but the 50-year-old has had second thoughts. The club said Jewell had decided \u201che will not be continuing his recent assistance on a more formal basis\u201d. Pulis, appointed as Alan Irvine\u2019s successor on new year\u2019s eve, said: \u201cGerry and I have worked well together at both Stoke and Crystal Palace and it was always part of my plan for him to join me at Albion. I value his insight and experience of the very highest levels of our game and I\u2019m delighted that he is now on board.\u201d Francis, 63, said: \u201cI\u2019m happy I have finalised a deal. I like the setup. Albion have a good training ground, good facilities. But just as was the case at Stoke and Palace, it\u2019s vitally important for the club to retain Premier League status. \u201cWe\u2019ve had three decent results, but there\u2019s a lot of work to do with the side and Tony is obviously looking to strengthen if he can. But I\u2019m looking forward to the challenge.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
