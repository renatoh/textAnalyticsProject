He's as thin and as jittery as a whippet. Even his glasses seem too big for him. He's after a wee settler, but he's a quid short of the necessary, until he finds me, his long-lost \"brether\", in the bar of the Tron Theatre in Glasgow. When Peter Mullan walked in half an hour later, escaping the drizzle of the Gallowgate, where the city's gibbet once did brisk business keeping the gadgies in their place, we were discussing the decline of the prison breakfast - a cup of scalding atomic tea that won't cool quick enough for the morning-after thirst, a half-cooked plastic sausage and an ember of black pudding. Ronald, a silver-service waiter in his time, is indignant about the slide in standards. \"Fair play to the polis for laying it on like, but black pudding at six in the morning. Man, that's punishment.\" Mullan - the only man to have combined a Golden Lion for best director at Venice and best actor at Cannes with an intimate knowledge of conditions inside Barlinnie prison - nods his assent. It's privatisation again. And so it goes on for half an hour or so, Ronald telling jokes to get him to the next round - \"Why do penguins keep fish in their mouths? Because they've got no pockets.\" I know what Mullan's thinking. Another rivet in the social stereotype of Glasgow as the city where kids are weaned on Special Brew. Not that Mullan - actor, activist and director of Orphans and The Magdalene Sisters, two films that burned with a very un-British fire - is the type to sign himself up to municipal make-over campaigns. He is preoccupied with the fate of the 1,000 refugees who have fallen foul of a new Home Office crackdown and who will find themselves on the streets of Glasgow this Christmas. The sandwich shop across the road is advertising free soup but, as Ronald has discovered, you have to spend \u00a34 first. Mullan is sore about the tricks that capitalism plays. He has been paid only 40% of his salary for The Magdalene Sisters, despite the $20m it has taken at the box office, and he is not likely to see much more. He turned down \u00a3900,000 worth of work on a string of films including Gangs of New York and Pirates of the Caribbean so he could go out to promote The Magdalene Sisters and become, in effect, a champion and counsellor to thousands of women across the world who were locked up by the Catholic church for the crime of catching the eye of unsuitable men. The last Magdalene laundry, where women were made to scrub away their sins - real and perceived - closed only seven years ago. \"It was the washing machine, not principle, that did for them,\" Mullan says, drawing on another cigarette. And it's principle, not money, that's galling him. \"They have you over a barrel. When the Catholic League of America want [The Magdalene Sisters] banned, and there are women from Rio to Roscommon pouring their hearts out to you, they know you will get on that plane and do it for nothing. I would have done it anyway... but it's been a hard lesson for me when the mortgage needs paying. Deferred payment is a racket.\" But that is not what is putting a knot in his guts today. It's the \"hypocrites\" in City Hall that have him riled. The city fathers can't wait to be rid of the refugees, he says, having done \"sod all\" to stop attacks on them in the tower blocks of Sighthill, where many were housed temporarily. \"The poor always end up fighting the poor. You go into the refugees' flats and they are spotless. They are good people, there's no crime. They couldn't use that excuse to turf them out. Now those smug cunts of councillors will get their excuse at last, because when you make people destitute, there are consequences - some poor bugger will break into somewhere. It's self-fulfilling.\" Many on what remains of old Red Clydeside are equally furious, but fury never fed anyone. Members of the homeless pressure group Positive Action in Housing, where Mullan helps out, are putting up evicted families. He can't and it kills him. \"To bring someone into your home with your kids [he has three], it's really fucking tough. I have mates who have done it, and it's really taken it out of them. But the older I get, the more I realise that the only way forward is at the grassroots. There is no use spouting crap.\" Instead, Mullan is trying to raise money for a bail fund for the inmates of Dungavel, where refugees and their children are locked up as they await deportation. \"I have not met anyone who is not appalled by what is happening inside Dungavel. But when you ask them for a pound they say, 'Naw, sorry mate.' It takes a very strong brain to resist the absolutes, the myths that the media and the politicians peddle - the idea that if you are too kind, where does it all end? That not to help someone is somehow a good idea.\" He is not long back from Malibu, where he took the \"missus and the weans\" when he was shooting Criminal, a remake of the Argentinian stamp heist Nine Queens. The film's producers, Steven Soderbergh and George Clooney, impressed him. \"Instead of stealing stamps, they go for dollar bills. The only reason I took it was that I thought it was a brilliant take on the American dream - the mad, destructive, obsessional pursuit of these bits of paper. \"Clooney's a dead good guy - they both are. I mean, there is something in there. The daughter and the missus both fancy him and I wasn't too proud to ask for an autograph. The indignities families put you through, heh?\" In fact, good is what Mullan is all about; it has been the grail that has taken him from missionary schoolboy Catholicism through teenage razor gangs to a very particular socialism forged from the Irish anti-materialism of his childhood. If there is a thread that links all his work as an actor and director, it is the search for good in the face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Not everyone has always seen it that way. The New York Times, for instance, described Orphans, his dazzling directorial debut, thus: \"The milk of human kindness hasn't merely soured in Mullan's transcendently nasty comedy. It has so poisoned the air of Glasgow that its clammy atmosphere seems charged with petty malice...\" Halliwell's immortalised the putdown in its film guide, something of which Mullan is hugely proud. FilmFour, who gave him \u00a314,000 to write the script (\"my biggest payday\"), got it equally wrong, giving the film a pitiful distribution when it didn't turn out to be the Trainspotting II they were looking for. \"Scots film was very cool right then - you tell me how they thought a surreal, allegorical comedy about a family going mad with grief was going to morph into a hip flick? They said there was no audience for it.\" But Orphans confounded them all. Six years on it has become a cult movie, arguably the most original and underrated British film of the past two decades. It made more at the box office than the rest of FilmFour's output that year combined. \"The real laugh,\" Mullan says, \"is that Orphans, when you really look at it, is not a surreal family drama at all but a pure socialist analysis of the situation we find ourselves in.\" The Magdalene Sisters brought the full opprobrium of the Vatican down on his head. For a few months, the Curia, Rome's shadowy civil service, went into Inquisition mode. In Italy, priests were sent out with video cameras to film audiences going into cinemas. \"'We know who you are,' they were saying. 'Do you know that you're committing a sin by watching this film?' When it opened in Ireland, we were waiting for the big backlash, and they said absolutely nothing. And the film was huge there: one in three people have seen it. By the time we arrived in Scotland, they had changed their tune. The church took out full-page adverts recommending that every Catholic in the country see it. And by the time I got to America, the Sisters of Mercy of the Americas, who ran a lot of the laundries, sent me this huge apology to be handed on to the survivors of the Magdalenes. Now the church has not survived 2,000 years without being clever, so they're probably thinking, 'We'll let him win this battle, but he won't win the war.'\" It is about this time in an interview that you ask about all those juicy autobiographical titbits that drive an actor. In Mullan's case, I'm going to have to ask about the day he put rat poison in his father's tea. And no, it was not a joke. Mullan's father - who survived the war against the Japanese and returned home to \"a family of cheeky brats who had no conception of what he'd been through\" - was both tortured and a torturer. \"He was never physical with us - but we became right physical with him as soon as we were old enough, because he was physical with my mum. Prior to that, he was a master of the dark arts - now, I can see he was just a drunk.\" Mullan's attempted patricide was \"totally pathetic. I decided in a moment of melodrama that I would put rat poison in his tea, and when I took it through and asked him to drink it, he just laughed. Because he knew that I never made him tea.\" For Emily Young's film Kiss of Life, in which he plays an aid worker who runs off to Bosnia while his family collapses at home, he drew on the Spanish civil war veterans he knew from home. \"When I got to know some of these old guys a bit better, I asked them why they did it. To get away from the wife for a few years, they told me. I loved the way they admitted that. They were honest about it, and I admired them even more for it. Nobody is that bloody noble.\" Mullan has spent the last year working his \"bollocks off\" on a string of low-budget films like Young's to buy himself three months to write his next film. But he's got big LA agents now, ICM. Wouldn't it be easier just to take a few big Hollywood paydays for the odd cameo? You're not exactly making it easy for yourself. \"I know, I know,\" he says. \"Listen, if I went over there, I would probably be hanging from a bridge within a fortnight. I mean, if those big-money roles came at the right time and they weren't too kind of shameful, I'd do it....\" It's not as if there has been any shortage of offers. As an actor, he can instantly ground a film, as he did with Young Adam and The Claim, playing men who have lost something essential deep down, and know it. But that kind of power - the rawness that had one Edinburgh director calling the police after he asked Mullan at an audition to \"Go on, scare me\" - has to come from somewhere. He talks about reaching inside for those strange mixed emotions: \"I love that laughing and crying at the same time. Orphans flipped people's heads, because they were expecting gritty realism. But it's completely anti-naturalistic.\" He says it takes a \"real genius\" like Ken Loach to make naturalism work. \"When I try it, it's fake.\" He blushes a bit, and shifts in his seat. \"Listen... Just before the breakdown [after his father died], I used to dress up as my old man, and I knew it was kind of crazy, but I didn't know what I was being crazy about. \"In retrospect, I don't know how much of it was acting and how much of it was exhaustion. But after the breakdown, acting made sense to me. Even when I was 14 and involved in that gang business, really it was acting by another name.\" The police arrive and stride through the bar \"with purpose\", as Mullan puts it, towards the auditorium where a panto is in progress. A racket starts up in the foyer. \"Jesus,\" says Mullan, \"please may it not be Ronald...\" \u00b7 Kiss of Life is out on January 2."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
