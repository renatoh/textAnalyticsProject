Two away victories at Leeds and Blackburn, either side of two triumphs at Goodison Park against Charlton and West Brom have seen Everton rise to fifth in the Premiership. The Barclaycard Awards Panel crowed: \"Since taking over at Goodison Park David Moyes has transformed the fortunes of Everton. \"His ability to organise and inspire both young and seasoned professionals alike has lifted his team to fifth in the Premiership.\" Moyes said that confidence had been the key to his side's resurgence. \"It's good to win this award, it shows we've had a decent start to the season which we hope to continue,\" he said. \"I think the main difference at Everton this season is that the players have more confidence and belief in themselves to play good football and that's what they're doing. \"We're also working very hard as well, the players know that the team is more important than the individual. \"This award is a tribute to the whole team who have worked so hard and the fans that have been right behind us. My goal at the start of this season was to get Everton playing decent football and steer clear of relegation and I certainly think we're moving in the right direction.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
