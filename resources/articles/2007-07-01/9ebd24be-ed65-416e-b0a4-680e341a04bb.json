The design worked but, just like Concorde, high oil prices got in the way of the dream. Only a few giant hovercraft were ever built, given patriotic red-and-white liveries and names such as Princess Anne. For 30 years they dashed back and forth across the Channel, more quickly than Eurotunnel manages today - the record was 22 minutes. The journey was dressed up as a flight, with stewardesses and boarding cards, to attract a public not used to air travel. It offered a rapid passage that memorably mixed the smell of fuel and salt spray. At Boulogne, passengers passed the hulk of a giant French boat, a showy design that never worked and was soon scrapped. When the last journey was made in 2000, passenger travel by hovercraft seemed on the way to becoming a thing of the past. Smaller vessels still travel to and from the Isle of Wight, however, and next month, for two weeks only, a new experimental route opens across the Firth of Forth, from Edinburgh to Gordon Brown's much-mentioned home town of Kirkcaldy. Cynics might suggest that the operator, Stagecoach, is trying to woo the new prime minister. But the service suggests that this British invention might have a future. Setting off on a beach and floating over the waves, the hovercraft is a strange and rather wonderful way to travel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
