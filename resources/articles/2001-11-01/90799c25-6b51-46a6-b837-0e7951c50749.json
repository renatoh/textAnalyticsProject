Palace will today go to court to force their errant manager to serve a nine-month notice period and if the south London club are successful, Birmingham are ready to abandon their interest. As a result Bruce could find himself on what the Palace chairman Simon Jordan calls \"gardening leave\" for the rest of the season. Jordan is playing hardball after Bruce, just 19 games into the job at Selhurst Park, decided he wanted to move to their First Division promotion rivals. The 40-year-old was promptly relieved of his managerial duties though he remains on the payroll. Now Jordan is seeking an injunction which would ensure that the terms of any move are dictated by Palace and do not harm the club's promotion push. The stumbling block is the inability of the clubs to agree compensation. Jordan is understood to be demanding \u00a31m. He described City's offer as \"derisory\". Said Jordan: \"I feel a little bit sorry for Bruce now because it has been made known that Birmingham want to talk to him but the club is not prepared to negotiate beyond a derisory figure. The ball is in Birmingham's court.\" However if Palace's action is successful it is understood that Birmingham will look for an alternative replacement for Trevor Francis, who was fired four weeks ago. Results have not gone well for the caretaker managers Mick Mills and Jim Barron, so the club may well look for another outsider. The Preston manager David Moyes is the main name in the frame. Many fans will applaud Jordan's attempt to teach Bruce a lesson. The chairman himself tried to suggest more high-minded motives. \"We are trying to keep him [Bruce] to his contract because of the damage he could do to the club by leaving and joining one of our competitors,\" he said. \"If Bruce were to join one of the other clubs in a position to stop us from winning promotion that could put us at a disadvantage. It could lead to him unsettling our players and backroom staff. I am trying to ensure we suffer minimum damage.\" If he stays, Bruce is likely to be on paid leave for the rest of the season. Jordan was equivocal on whether he would have him back as Palace manager. \"I would have to assess why that u-turn has come about, if it happened, and gauge how genuine it was,\" he said. Any job at Birmingham would be Bruce's fourth in just over a year. Previously he left Sheffield United in 1999 to escape bickering directors; at Huddersfield he was sacked by the chairman Barry Rubery who accused him of \"wasting \u00a33m of my money\"; and the Wigan owner Dave Whelan, who employed him at the tail-end of last season, said Bruce \"sacked nine players then walked out\". After quitting Palace, Jordan said: \"Bruce has done me a favour by letting me know what he is like just a few months after he took the job.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
