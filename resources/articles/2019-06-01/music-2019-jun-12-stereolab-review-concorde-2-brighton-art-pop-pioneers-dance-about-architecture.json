Not for any of the reasons you might expect \u2013 especially if you\u2019ve read some of the fairly tense recent interviews given by the band\u2019s central musical partnership, Tim Gane and Laetitia Sadier, but because their tour bus broke down in the small hours, somewhere in France, causing a mad scramble to actually make the gig. \u201cWe are compromised,\u201d announces Sadier gloomily from the stage, \u201cbut we are here.\u201d In truth, if you didn\u2019t know the background, you wouldn\u2019t realise there was anything wrong. Stereolab sound fantastic, locking into grooves that feel both insistent and lissom. It also provides an opportunity to ponder what a strange niche Stereolab have carved out over their 19-year career. For all the influence they exerted \u2013 lauded by everyone from Deerhunter to Tyler, the Creator \u2013 you\u2019re never far from a reminder of how unlike other bands they were and are. \u201cThis is a song about architecture,\u201d offers Sadier, introducing Baby Lulu. A voice in the crowd repeatedly requests a favourite song: \u201cJohn Cage Bubblegum! John Cage Bubblegum!\u201d He gets his wish at the end of the encore, but before that Stereolab play what you might loosely call the hits, French Disko and Ping Pong, the latter provoking the least likely audience singalong imaginable: \u201cIt\u2019s alright cause the historical pattern has shown / How the economical cycle tends to revolve / In a round of decades.\u201d The cocktail of Neu!-derived motorik pulse and Velvet Underground-ish drone found on the earliest tracks they play, 1993\u2019s Lo Boob Oscillator and Crest, might be the most influential aspect of Stereolab\u2019s sound \u2013 it\u2019s become a standard alt-rock trope, deployed by more mainstream bands than Stereolab as a kind of shorthand for \u201cwe are more arty than you might have thought\u201d \u2013 but for all their hypnotic power, it\u2019s the later, more airy songs that really hit home tonight. With their arcane influences and lyrics inspired by situationism and socialist philosopher Cornelius Castoriadis, Stereolab\u2019s music has a tendency to look dry as dust on paper, but they rarely stint on pop melodies. The jazz inflections and easy-listening funk of Miss Modular and Brakhage float beautifully by: as strange and beguiling as ever, as are the band who recorded them. \u2022 Touring the UK &amp; Ireland until 25 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
