Ministers, in their ideal world, got a positive 3. Instead, we might need to subtract 2 from 1 and end up with a negative 3. More money, yes, was pumped in to the health service, though today's struggle to understand where it went is indicative of how unmanaged the system was and remains. In health, the origins of the spending increase - pushing the UK up to the EU average of 9% of GDP - are bound up with the Blair-Brown rivalry. But the fact is the taps were turned on full (excessively?) in 2002 and the money still flows, at least until next April. Was the system ever capable of delivering? What if ministers themselves, their preoccupations and changing priorities, reduced rather than increased system capacity? Those are questions for the Blair-era inquest. Let's focus the reorganisation story on the Department of Health, where last month Hugh Taylor took over as permanent secretary, ending the long interregnum after the departure of Nigel Crisp. Here - where else? - are to be found the brains behind the second term of our equation: reorganisation of the business. Historians say the department as it is was born in 1983, with the report to Margaret Thatcher from business adviser Sir Roy Griffiths instituting top down management of the NHS - previously administered, rather than managed. It has since become de facto DNHS, the department for the NHS, rather than a department concerned with health in the widest sense (though the cut in smoking must be chalked up to its credit). To do health in the round, the DH would have to be a big player in Whitehall, stimulating and influencing such departments as trade, culture, local government and of course education and the Treasury. On behalf of the Nuffield Trust, the non-profit health policy group, Scott Greer of the Constitution Unit at University College London has been peering at the DH's entrails. It has become, he argues, the paradigmatic Blairite department. It's small, it works through delivery agencies, is responsive to central direction and is filled with managers and specialists rather than civil service generalists. That's what the Blairite recipe was, but has it delivered? \u00b7 The DH is nowadays scarcely a Whitehall department. Most top officials come from NHS backgrounds and the lower ranks of the senior civil service - where Whitehall types might be found - has been drastically thinned out in recent years. \u00b7 It has been rocked by \"change\" - with headquarters staff cut by a third, the highest Gershon savings target, reorganisation of its arm's length bodies, as yet incomplete, plus the impact of relocation in the wake of the Lyons report and staff transfers to create NHS Employers, now part of the NHS Confederation. Some ascribe the generosity of the GPs' 2004 contract, see page 30 to this outsourcing of prime functions. \u00b7 It faced swings in policy and implementation. From Frank Dobson to Alan Milburn, John Reid and Patricia Hewitt, priorities have bobbed and weaved: power was to be shifted locally, foundation hospitals created (all trusts should become foundation, said Milburn), IT revamped in NHS Connecting for Health, the workforce reorganised through Agenda for Change, primary care trusts merged and strategic health authorities - the linchpin of command and control - redone, together with payment by results, reconfiguration, new contracts. Was the department's knowledge base for such far-reaching change adequate? \u00b7 The DH has been internally restructured, with big gaps (Scott Greer says) in strategy, policy and in the relationship of the commercial directorate to its spine. Ministers' responsibilities \"do not connect well\" with internal structure. \u00b7 The shape of the DH is surely what No 10 and the Treasury have willed. It's not just the intense interest in health displayed by Blair and his units. The Treasury secured from the DH delivery on decentralisation, efficiency and arm's-length bodies. For Treasury officials to say, as they now do, that they took their eye off the health ball looks odd in that context. The DH is in the throes of a capability review, one of the series instigated by Sir Gus O'Donnell, the cabinet secretary. Its findings can be anticipated. It has a high turnover of staff with pared-down middle management, poor morale (shown in staff surveys) and a habit of bringing in outsiders, with the result of further depressing departmental staff's sense of self worth. Institutional memory has eroded, Greer argues: the fate of the department and its ministers is to repeat the mistakes of the past. The challenge for the DH is to commission not just NHS management but also the work of the various regulatory and value-added bodies, such as the NHS Institute. Capability reviews have consistently found that Whitehall is poor at managing arm's-length bodies; departments don't think about which model is appropriate (executive agencies, non-departmental public body) and assign the management of arm's-length bodies to junior and badly trained staff. Too much time is spent by the arm's-length bodies themselves in managing their relationships with Whitehall - this was the finding of a useful study published by the recruitment firm Veredus in December. Greer asks what \"policy\" expertise means for the DH these days if not the capacity to manage the system. Commentators have wondered about senior officials' understanding of what the system now is - much more than the NHS. The health system has become more complex still with the introduction of private sector suppliers of hospital care, non-emergency surgery and diagnostics, to add to existing contractual relations with private and non-profit suppliers of social care, mental health services and so on. The quest for quality in healthcare means there can be no simple commissioning model, with the commissioner walking away during the contract. One of the tense frontiers of the next few years will surely be the purchase regulatory bodies have on private firms. Is the DH up to speed? \u00b7 This article appears in the new edition of the Guardian's Public magazine."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
