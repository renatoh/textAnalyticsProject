The Lions prop was allowed the dignity of being seen to go on his own terms by making a statement following the decision to delay the naming of the side to play Tonga on Saturday until this afternoon. Wales had been due to announce their team yesterday, but after the management's three-hour meeting on Sunday, they gathered again at the squad's Vale of Glamorgan base yesterday morning. The captaincy was on the agenda after the spiritless displays against Argentina and Ireland in the past month and the No8 Scott Quinnell will assume the leadership. Young had been told that he was going to be dropped from the side to face Tonga but that he would probably be recalled as captain against Australia at the end of the month. But he decided he had had enough and resigned on the spot. Too emotional to hold a press conference, he got in his car and drove home, an inglorious end to an international career that spanned 14 years and earned him 54 caps, three with the 1989 Lions. He spent six years from 1990 in rugby league. The 34-year-old Young had intended to give up the captaincy in January in order to concentrate on holding down his place in the side. He had been asked by the Wales coach Graham Henry at the end of last season to carry on playing until the 2003 World Cup, and although the three-time Lion initially agreed, public criticism after the Argentina defeat prompted him to change his mind. \"I can take the flak but it affects my family,\" said Young, who has three young sons. \"I do not want it weighing heavily on them any more. They have come second to rugby for too long and now is the right time to put them first. Expectations in Wales are always high, often unrealistically so, and the criticism has been intense in recent weeks.\" Young's contract with Cardiff runs out at the end of the season. He wants to take up coaching and has been asked to remain with the national squad as a scrummaging adviser. \"Dai has a huge amount to offer and he will still bring his experience to bear,\" said the Wales manager Alan Phillips, who packed down alongside Young when the prop made his international debut during the 1987 World Cup. Last summer Young made history by becoming the first player to tour with the Lions in three different decades. He ended up captaining the midweek side, which became known as Dai's Driftwood, and remonstrated with the tour management at the way the non-Test players were being treated. Young's departure takes the spotlight off Henry - for the moment. The coach has come under increasing fire after a run since the 1999 World Cup during which Wales have lost seven of their 12 matches at the Millennium stadium, with four of their victories coming against Italy, Samoa's reserves, the United States and Romania. Young is the third experienced Wales player to retire from international rugby in the past two months with the Lions centre Scott Gibbs stepping down before the international against Romania last September and the hooker Garin Jenkins last week. Wales were desperately short of leaders against Argentina, and with Neil Jenkins and Mark Taylor out until the new year with injuries, they will field a relatively inexperienced side against Australia. Henry has called the Newport second-row Ian Gough, who has yet to start a match this season following a shoulder operation last May, into the squad for Tonga with changes likely on the wing, in the centre and in all three rows at forward. Wales's disenchanted fans, meanwhile, are voting with their feet. Last night only 12,000 tickets had been sold for Saturday's match."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
