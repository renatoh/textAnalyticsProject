All Blacks Aaron Mauger, Joe Rokocoko, Tony Woodcock and Dan Carter scored tries as England eclipsed their previous heaviest loss - a 29-11 reverse by South Africa in 1997. It was their sixth straight defeat - their worst losing sequence for 34 years - and save for a few rousing spells in the second half, the performance was just as bad as the scoreline suggests. Jamie Noon, who had an early score ruled out by the television match official, Ben Cohen and Shaun Perry crossed - and England could take some consolation from the three-try haul. Lethargic defence proved their Achilles heel, Woodcock's try the result of some feeble tackling with a line of England players watching when the initial break was made. But their downfall was not all of their own doing, with New Zealand in irresistible form to underline their status as the world's number one ranked side. The outstanding Carter enjoyed a sensational afternoon, kicking 21 points and keeping the All Black attacking machine purring with some typically astute decision making Man of the match Carter, who replaced hamstring victim Nick Evans in the original line-up, set-up Perry's try. But he did little else wrong as New Zealand racked up a record number of points from a visiting team at Twickenham. The All Blacks now travel to Lyon where they will play the first of two Tests against France, who should prove tougher opposition, while England must regroup before next Saturday's clash with Argentina."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
