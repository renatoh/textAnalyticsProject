Graeme Souness' side will launch their campaign in the third round in Slovakia on Sunday when they take on ZTS Dubnica, who will visit St James' Park the following Saturday. However, the winners will then face the side which comes out on top in the clash between Spanish giants Deportivo and Croatian side NK Slaven Koprivnica in the semi-finals, and there is potentially another tough tie for the victors. If Newcastle make it to one of three finals, they could face Marseille, who play Swiss side Young Boys in the third round, or Italian outfit Lazio who meet Tampere United of Finland. Souness is refusing to look too far ahead however and said: \"I am not thinking beyond the first game in Slovakia on Sunday because it would be wrong to do so. \"I have been in football long enough to know that the minute you start taking your eye off the ball, you can be punished. \"There are no easy games in football and our only focus must be the Dubnica game. In the normal run of things, we would be seen as obvious favourites to win, but they are four weeks ahead of us in terms of fitness levels which is an advantage for them. \"We must concentrate on the job in hand and not start talking about who we might or might not play in later rounds - let's just try to get through this tie first, that has to be my take on things.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
