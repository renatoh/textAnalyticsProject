As of 11pm on Sunday, 5.3m people had signed the petition, making it the most popular to have been submitted to the parliament website. The previous highest total of 4,150,260 was for a 2016 petition calling for a second referendum should the initial poll not provide a definitive enough result. The petition continued to grow following Saturday\u2019s march, which organisers claimed saw more than a million people take to the streets of London. The woman behind the petition, Margaret Georgiadou, said on Saturday she had received death threats. Georgiadou tweeted that on Friday night she had received three such threats via telephone. She also said she had deleted her Facebook account after receiving a \u201ctorrent of abuse\u201d. There have been conspiracy theories about the petition on both sides of the debate, with some saying crashes on the site since the petition launched on Thursday were a plot to prevent further signatures. Others claimed that a small proportion of signatures from overseas IP addresses \u2013 including one from North Korea \u2013 meant the petition had been hijacked by bots. In fact, 96% of the signatures were from the UK. On Saturday\u2019s march, protesters waving EU flags and carrying placards weaved their way from Hyde Park Corner to Parliament Square. MPs lined up on stage to address the crowds and call on the government to provide a \u201cpeople\u2019s vote\u201d on Brexit. Labour\u2019s deputy leader, Tom Watson, accused the prime minister of having lost control of the Brexit process and said he could only back her deal if \u201cyou let the people vote on it too\u201d. The former Conservative MP Anna Soubry, now a member of the Independent Group, urged her parliamentary colleagues to \u201cput your country first, get into the lobbies and vote for a people\u2019s vote\u201d. Also addressing the crowds, the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, called for article 50 to be withdrawn. \u201cIt\u2019s time to give us, the British people, a final say on Brexit,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
