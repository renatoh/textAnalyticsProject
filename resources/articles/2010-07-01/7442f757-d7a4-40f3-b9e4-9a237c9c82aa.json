Where Brown ordered a politically correct ornamental pen holder made from the timbers of the Victorian anti-slavery ship HMS Gannet, Samantha Cameron just popped out to her old shopping grounds in Notting Hill. Her husband handed over a painting by ex-hoodie Ben Eine, some scented candles for Michelle Obama from perfumier Miller Harris, and for the kids some pink and purple Hunter boots. A devastated Johnnie Boden must be tearing up his catalogue at failing to make the list. The Camerons' choice of the ultra-contemporary Eine and his painting 21st century city, a collection of spray- painted, multicoloured letters on east London doorfronts, valued at \u00a32,500, shows Cameron's continued willingness to hug a hoodie who has gone astray. In an interview with the Observer, Eine admitted spraying walls, the kind of vandalism of which the Eric Pickles of this world so much disapprove: \"I started out in the world of graffiti when I was about 14, because I wanted to be part of that hooded tracksuit gang thing. I did it pretty hardcore for 20 years \u2011 I've been arrested 15 or 20 times, and the last time I had a close escape from prison.\" The picture will look great in the Roosevelt room, alongside the staid portraits of Lincoln. Samantha Cameron, exhausted with a fourth child due in September, was not herself present to hand over the present, or to receive presents from the Obamas. In a complex diplomatic tit for tat, the Obamas returned the gift with a picture of their own: a signed colour lithograph by the Nebraskan artist Ed Ruscha, entitled Column with Speed Lines. This apparently resembles a single column government building with horizons in red, white and blue, the colours of the US and UK flags. A spokesman said: \"It represented an important moment in the contemporary US art movement and will be given a prominent position in the UK art gallery.\" Other presents to the Camerons were a gift basket for Samantha including a baby blanket, a silver necklace adorned with White House charms for his daughter Nancy, and a personalised DC United football kit for Elwen. Obama apparently forgot the kids and sent an aide out at the last minute to the club's shop for the strip yesterday morning. DC are presently dead last in their conference on 12 points, having won 3 of 17 matches. Still, the exchange is an improvement on Obama's gift to the previous prime minister; in what looked like a rushed trip to the supermarket, the Obamas gave the Browns 25 DVDs which turned out to be unsuitable for UK players. Overall, Cameron has been trying to turn the special relationship into something more natural and less neurotic. He has in effect lectured the British press not to get so hung up on whether the premier is afforded a full press conference, a spray, drop-by, or whatever else the American lexicon of presidential meets and greets produces. The argument is that Britain and the US have a natural relationship of mutual interest, but neither party should be accused of adultery if they start forming relationships with other partners, especially the power-players to the east. Cameron has been a figure of modest interest in Washington. For all his eastern seaboard political connections, Brown (after the glamour of Tony Blair, the best exponent of US foreign policy) hardly registered on the US popular psyche. Cameron feels at least iPod, if not iPad generation: relaxed appearances on the networks, dinner with Washington Post columnists, and meetings with all the key congressional leaders \u2013 though he did find himself engulfed in the BP controversy as soon as he arrived. American politics has in the past two months been transformed into a form of marine engineering, with politicians on both sides criticising BP. Cameron has found himself in the awkward position of defending BP and its share price at a time when its corporate reputation in the US rivals that of the worst Wall Street bank. When he planned this visit to Washington, presenting himself as the fresh face of modern liberal conservatism, he could not have envisaged he would be in the dock for decisions taken years ago by Blair, Brown and Alex Salmond. But no one ever said politics was either logical, or fair."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
