Southgate drew on those memories, describing it as one of the more difficult experiences of his professional life and \u201cprobably as big as you can get\u201d to highlight he would be willing, if necessary, to leave out Rooney at a time when England\u2019s record scorer is struggling for form and has lost his place at Manchester United. However, he also gave Rooney another vote of confidence after a section of the Wembley crowd briefly booed the England captain in Saturday\u2019s 2-0 win against Malta. Southgate\u2019s belief is that Rooney\u2019s importance to the squad is not fully understood outside the England camp and there was no clear indication of the player being removed from the side for \u2019s game in Slovenia. \u201cI think he commands that respect,\u201d Southgate explained. \u201cWhen he makes his observations and he speaks up, it\u2019s clear that he talks with authority but also insight. His knowledge is of a very high level, not just of the game but the dynamics of the group and the things they can learn and improve upon. It\u2019s impossible to feel that really unless you are inside it.\u201d He opted to play Rooney alongside Jordan Henderson as the central midfielders in a 4-2-3-1 formation against Malta but now wants Eric Dier to return to the starting line-up. Dier was left out against Malta because he has had hamstring problems and England\u2019s management did not think it was right to involve him twice in four days. Rooney has not started any of United\u2019s last three matches but Southgate described himself as \u201cvery pleased\u201d with the player\u2019s performance against Malta. \u201cI think at this moment in time that\u2019s irrelevant,\u201d Southgate said, in response to questions about Rooney\u2019s reduced role at Old Trafford. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 30% of the Premier League eligible for England. Of that, some don\u2019t want to play [for England]. Some aren\u2019t good enough to play and we\u2019ve got a captain who is desperate to lead on and off the field and continues to make an outstanding contribution to that group of players. That was why he was selected. What\u2019s happening at Manchester United, for this week, is not as important.\u201d Southgate did, however, say that \u201cthe longer a situation goes where you are not playing with your club, it becomes more difficult\u201d and, with three games remaining in his spell as caretaker manager, he bristled to a question asking if he would dare remove a player of Rooney\u2019s status. \u201cI\u2019ve got to make decisions which are right for the team and, whenever you select a team for England, you\u2019re going to leave out some players. You look at the bench [against Malta] and there are guys who are playing every week in the Premier League, so you have to be prepared to do that (make tough decisions). That\u2019s part and parcel of the job.\u201d The England squad fly out on Monday and Jordan Pickford, Sunderland\u2019s 22-year-old goalkeeper, has been called-up after Tom Heaton pulled out with a minor injury."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
