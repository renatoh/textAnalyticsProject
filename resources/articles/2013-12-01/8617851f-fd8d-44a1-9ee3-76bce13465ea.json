Here's who comes out on top, and who doesn't. Winners Bipartisanship: For the past five years, \"A Democrat and a Republican walk into a bar and come out with a deal\" has been either a distant wish or a bad joke. Sure, 80% of Americans wanted the two parties to stop sniping and work together, but it's still unsettling to see it actually happen. Conservative groups like the Club for Growth and FreedomWorks are complaining , but they're unlikely to block the deal before the House and Senate vote at the end of this week. Deficit hawks: If you believe the US budget deficit is a bad thing, this deal is for you. It will cut the deficit by another $65bn over the next two years. The sequester: Don't be fooled by the language in the agreement that says the sequester is over. The widely loathed automatic spending cuts \u2013 endorsed by many Republicans who hate the deficit \u2013 are still going strong, although it is now wearing a more tailored suit of targeted cuts instead of the willy-nilly, loosey-goosey cuts of the past two years. There is, however, $23bn in federal spending that is now being added to the sere sequester budget. The sequester would have allowed the federal government to spend only $967bn next year; this budget deal boosts the budget to a more generous $1tn. Social security and Medicare: The social welfare programs that people earn through paycheck contributions won't get slashed. That's a big nod to Democrats and the White House, who refused for three years to agree to any deal that would cut those programs \u2013 particularly at a time when an aging population will require the government to pay more in social security and Medicare than ever. Still, it was not a win without sniping. In its March agreement, the budget committee noted that social security will run a $1.3tn deficit over the next decade, and predicted darkly that the social security trust fund is on a path to destruction, and that by 2033, all benefits would have be cut by 25% at least. That's left unsaid here but it's still the elephant in the room. The Pentagon and government defense contractors: The sequester would have fallen almost completely on defense spending in 2014. This deal spreads the pain to other government sectors, and splits the cuts in 2014 evenly between defense and spending. Over the next three years, the defense sector will still get more than half a trillion in spending every year. Big oil: The US and Mexico can drill jointly for oil in the Gulf of Mexico, as they agreed in Los Cabos in 2012. That's a huge win for big drilling companies that waited for the agreement to be approved. Losers The grand bargain: It's easier to agree if we don't tackle hard issues that divide us. This deal also doesn't bode well for 2014. As Paul Ryan noted to reporters, \"Elections have consequences \u2026 [it's] naive to think we're going to get a grand bargain when we're so far apart.\" Medicare: Medicare is both a winner and a loser of this deal. The new budget agreement avoids big cuts to the actual payments to seniors \u2013 but it's not such great news for doctors who take Medicare. Those healthcare providers will have to treat Medicare patients for less money for a longer time. Those Medicare doctors had a 2% cut to the payments the government gives them. The sequester would have kept those cuts in place until 2021; the new budget deal extends the cuts to 2023. That cuts $28bn from the deficit over the next 10 years, but hospitals loathe the new agreement. The unemployed: At the end of December, benefits will run out for 1.3 million jobless workers. This budget deal doesn't mention them at all, and it doesn't extend their benefits. It's not going to be a merry Christmas for all the people who are losing unemployment insurance while there are still few well-paying jobs to be had. Everyone on food stamps: All 47 million of them. What's happening to their payments? Congress is still considering cuts and this around this deal there are only the sound of crickets. Dead people getting pensions: That's all over as part of the budget deal's anti-fraud provisions. The new budget deal restricts access to the government's Death Master File and expands the ability of officials to cross-reference requests for government coverage against the names of the dead. The deal also strikes against Medicare fraud. Young people getting pensions: The federal government will avoid raising the amount of money it puts into the pensions of its younger workers, by cutting cost-of-living adjustments to keep those payments up to date with inflation. Travelers: The deal includes higher airline fees, which take the place of widespread tax increases on the general population. The fees cover the government's cost of providing aviation security; before, only 30% of that cost was covered by a tax on travelers and now 43% of the cost will be, according to the House budget committee. Inmates: Anyone in jail won't get social security payments. And yes, that was illegal already, but somehow it happened often, as this government study showed. Big oil: Yes, Big Oil is both a winner and a loser in this deal, although its losses aren't so great. While it gets the Gulf of Mexico, the industry is going to make less money from its drilling agreements with the US government. Here's how that works: usually oil companies prepay royalties to the government, then charge the government interest for the extra time \u2013 sometimes that interest charge was double or more what the companies were paying in royalties in the first place. Now oil companies are going to have to cap the interest payments they're charging the government on prepayment royalties to 110% \u2013 which is still absurdly high, so imagine what they were charging before. Oil companies are also going to have to cough up actual cash to the government; they can't pay their royalties by dumping oil into the nation's Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as they did before."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
