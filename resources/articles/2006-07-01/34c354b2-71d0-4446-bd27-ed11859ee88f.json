His omission from the team for the League Cup final in March had been the final straw, he confirmed. \"What happened, happened. It was very disappointing for me.\" But at least the Dutch striker now has the opportunity to link up again with David Beckham, another casualty of Ferguson's ire. \"I missed him,\" he said after posing for photographers. Madrid's president Ram\u00f3n Calder\u00f3n welcomed the man he called \"the goal machine\", who signed a \u00a33.4m per year contract."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
