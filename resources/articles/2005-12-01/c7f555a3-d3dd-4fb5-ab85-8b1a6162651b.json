Redknapp stepped down as Pompey manager 12 months ago following a dispute with Mandaric, then sparked controversy by taking charge of bitter rivals Southampton. But the 57-year-old remains a firm favourite with Portsmouth fans who haven't forgotten that it was he who steered the club to promotion to the Premiership in 2003 and built an exciting team devoted to attack - the antithesis of the cagey 4-5-1 formation deployed by his most recent successor, Alain Perrin. \"We are going to approach Southampton right away and ask them for permission and then hopefully talk to Harry,\" said Mandaric, who will, reportedly, offer Redknapp a six-month contract with the option to extend if the club avoids relegation. They currently lie 18th in the Premiership and have not won a home game all season. \"We're not ruling anything out. We will bring the best candidate and we're not ruling Harry out of the situation. I'm quite aware he's very popular with the supporters. I'm not ignoring this because the supporters are very important. It's always a professional relationship with Harry and we had some great times together. I don't have a problem with Harry and that's the main reason I'd like him to come back here.\" Reports this evening suggested that Saints chairman Rupert Lowe had refused permission to speak to Redknapp. However, a club spokesman said: \"Nothing has been confirmed as yet, as Rupert Lowe is in a Football League meeting.\" The fact that Redknapp has not been successful at Southampton seems only to have endeared him further to Pompey fans - with two-thirds of the 4,000 respondents to a survey conducted by the Portsmouth News saying they want him back. But it appears he would be the chairman's fourth-choice: Mandaric offered the post to Warnock, and was refused permission to talk to Rangers' Alex McLeish and Crystal Palace's Iain Dowie. Warnock, who celebrates his own 57th birthday today, had been targeted to succeed Frenchman Perrin, who was sacked last week. However, United's plc chairman Kevin McCabe this morning confirmed that Warnock will continue his six-year reign at Bramall Lane. \"We are delighted that Neil Warnock's future remains with Sheffield United - this is a club with enormous potential determined to satisfy the Premiership aspirations of fans, players, coaching staff and its team manager,\" said McCabe. \"It is true to say I wish the Portsmouth saga had not started but in the end the outcome in this case demonstrates the importance of the relationship between a chairman and a team manager. Warnock himself, added: \"I had a chat with Milan [Mandaric] last night and sorted it out. I think all the speculation has not done anybody any good. It was a mutual thing, my heart would not have been in it and I wished him all the best.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
