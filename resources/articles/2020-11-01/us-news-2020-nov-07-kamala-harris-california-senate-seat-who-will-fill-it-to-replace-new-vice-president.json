California law allows the governor to appoint a replacement to serve the remainder of Harris\u2019s term, and speculation over whom Gavin Newsom will nominate has been swirling for months. A range of politicians have been pitching themselves for the position \u2013 Newsom this summer joked with a reporter who asked if candidates had approached him: \u201cYou may be the only one who hasn\u2019t \u2013 unless you just did.\u201d Top contenders include Alex Padilla, California\u2019s secretary of state, and Xavier Becerra, the state\u2019s attorney general, either of whom would be the first Latino senator from California if appointed. Representatives Karen Bass of Los Angeles, who was a contender for the vice-presidential nomination, and Ro Khanna, who represents the Silicon Valley area, have also been singled out as strong candidates by political strategists. \u201cThis is going to be a huge, huge challenge for the governor because he\u2019s got an embarrassment of riches,\u201d said Nathan Barankin, Harris\u2019s former chief of staff. Newsom\u2019s decision could shape the US Senate for years, as whoever fills the seat would face re-election with the huge advantage of incumbency. And California senators can wield an outsize influence in Washington, said Aimee Allison, who heads She the People, a national network seeking to elevate women of color to political leadership. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing that was clarified during the Trump years it is that the policy and political leadership coming from California have been key in providing resistance,\u201d said Allison. As a freshman senator from the nation\u2019s most populous state, Harris played a key role in the hearings of two supreme court justices, and brought her sharp, prosecutorial style to interrogations of several Trump administration officials. Whoever takes her place in the Senate next could help shape how the US legislates on \u201creparations, the housing crisis, immigration\u201d, Allison said. Newsom will probably seek to appoint an ally in Washington, Barankin said. However, it is unlikely he will find a candidate with whom he shares the same bond he has with Harris. Newsom and Harris came up together in California politics \u2013 he was the mayor of San Francisco while she was district attorney, and he served as lieutenant governor while she was the state\u2019s attorney general. \u201cGoing through this common political and public life experience at the exact same time binds them together,\u201d Barankin said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
