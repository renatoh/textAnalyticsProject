Somehow, though, there weren't as many funny lines as there should have been. Rainn Wilson (from the US version of The Office) plays Fish, a drummer with a heavy-metal band who was humiliatingly fired from the group in the 1980s. Twenty years later, an embittered Fish is working in a call centre, living with his married sister and dreaming of what might have been. His sister's son and his friends have formed a whingeing, indie band called ADD, and need a drummer, so ageing badass Uncle Fish gets the job, somehow energises the band and gets them breathtakingly close to rock'n'roll stardom - at which point disaster strikes. It all looks good and there's a decent cast but nothing really takes off."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
