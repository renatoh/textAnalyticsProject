The force seemed to be emphatically with the Tigers after they came from 10-0 behind to earn a 16-14 lead at half-time, with their England scrum-half Rangi Chase outstanding. But they lost their way horribly after that, with Chase offering little after being harshly denied a 40-20 kick early in the second half, and Rovers had just enough composure through their Australian half-backs Travis Burns and Michael Dobson to hang on. That eases the pressure slightly on Sandercock, an Australian who has been given until Easter to win around his doubters by the Rovers chairman Neil Hudgell, ahead of the first derby of the season against Hull FC at the KC Stadium on Good Friday. But Millward, while accepting that his team had contributed to their own downfall, was left raging by a number of decisions that had gone against them \u2013 of which Chase's denied 40-20 was merely the most obvious. \"Our kicking game in the second half was disgraceful,\" he said. \"But we're in a really bad situation in rugby league at the moment because no coaches want to speak to the referees, and we get told shut your mouths it's got nothing to do with you. I'm really struggling with some of the things we see. As a game we need to be open and transparent.\" Two of Hull KR's three first-half tries came direct from contentious penalties \u2013 Burns scoring the first from his own deflected kick, Kris Welham touching down Dobson's delicate grubber for the second, and David Hodgson making amends for an earlier howler by collecting Welham's pass for the third. Chase led Castleford's response to those setbacks, making the break that led to Kirk Dixon's opener courtesy of Hodgson's error, and then providing the key pass for the former Rovers centre Jake Webster and the left wing Richie Owen to touch down in quick succession down the left. But Dobson and Burns, both of whom had been rated extremely doubtful for the game in the week, gained control after half-time. Josh Hodgson and Craig Hall scored opportunist tries that established a 26-16 lead and although Daryl Clark pounced on one of several errors by the gifted but hesitant Rovers full-back Greg Eden to cut the deficit to four points with 23 minutes remaining, Cas failed to put him under much pressure again. \"We weren't at our best, but it was good to tough out a close game like that,\" said Sandercock, who might still need to win one of the Easter fixtures against Hull FC and Wigan to secure his position. Earlier Wakefield's home game against Leeds, which had already been postponed from Friday because of snow, was called off again because the icy conditions remained unsafe for spectators. It could surely not have been any colder than this. Hull KR: Eden; Brown, Hall, Welham, D Hodgson; Burns, Dobson (capt); Paea, J Hodgson, Tuimavave, Cox, Paterson, Griffin.
