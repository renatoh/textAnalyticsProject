The Congress represents 180 organisations and 10,000 individual members across Australia. It went into voluntary administration last week, faced with having to cease operating on 30 June, when its existing funding agreement with the federal government expires. \u201cIn the past, the congress has relied almost solely on funding from the federal government for key programs to benefit and advance issues impacting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders,\u201d Cor Cordis\u2019s Alan Walker said. \u201cWe will be working closely with the minister\u2019s office over the next few weeks to see if we can restructure Congress so that it is in a better position to apply for funding,\u201d he said. The details of those conditions have not been made public, but an initial meeting with the federal minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, was \u201creally positive\u201d, according to Walker\u2019s statement. \u201cWe are confident of meeting those conditions outlined by the minister and gave the undertaking to work closely together to secure the congress\u2019s future,\u201d he said. Walker said it was too early to say what the future level of funding may be. Congress would have to demonstrate it was operating \u201cwithin a viable structure\u201d. Labor has written to Ken Wyatt asking him to urgently restore adequate and secure funding for Congress. \u201cFor years, National Congress enjoyed bipartisan support \u2013 until Tony Abbott cut its funding,\u201d according to a joint statement by Labor\u2019s Linda Burney, Pat Dodson and Warren Snowdon, who are all members of the ALP\u2019s First Nations caucus. \u201cWe have also asked the government to guarantee that National Congress is provided with no-strings funding, so it is free to advocate on behalf of First Nations Australians.\u201d \u201cIf the government is serious about a bipartisan approach to First Nations affairs, genuine reconciliation and a co-design process for a voice to parliament, National Congress will not be allowed to go under. \u201cIt is too important to lose,\u201d the statement said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
