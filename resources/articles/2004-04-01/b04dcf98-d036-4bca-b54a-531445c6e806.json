He added: \"Phasing out will be spread over several years to ensure existing students are not disadvantaged in any way. Council's decision will enable chemistry staff to develop their well established research strengths and their links with industry. The intention is to strengthen the postgraduate area and align research with related academic areas, including the medical school and environmental science. \"We are looking to all those who lobbied the university in recent weeks to retain chemistry to now work with us to ensure that chemistry flourishes at Swansea under these new arrangements,\" he said. Three Nobel prizewinners - Sir Aaron Krug, Sir Harry Kroto and Sir John Cornforth - are among 18 Royal Society fellows, who are alarmed by the \"short-sighted\" move by the University of Wales, Swansea. Several have also written separately to the university vice-chancellor expressing their concerns. The university's council voted last month to close a series of departments, including anthropology, sociology and philosophy. Members eventually decided to phase out completely the teaching of undergraduate chemistry while retaining postgraduate research. But Sir Aaron has dismissed as \"nonsense\" the view that it is possible to continue postgraduate research without undergraduates feeding through. That view was backed today by Professor Martyn Poliakoff, of Nottingham University, another signatory of the letter. He warns that expanding so-called \"soft\" subjects like media studies at the expense of science is a threat to everybody's wellbeing. \"When you and I and others are old we will still need medicines but there will be nobody around anymore to work on them,\" he said. He added: \"I have a certain amount of sympathy for the vice-chancellor of Swansea: he is being put in an extremely difficult position because of the way funding is allocated. \"But the point that needs to be made is that although it is chemistry today it is not just confined to chemistry. Tomorrow it may well be the turn of other science subjects which remain in a similar situation in terms of funding. I am not saying that we should not teach these other subjects, such as media studies, as well. But we should not be saying it is cheaper to teach media studies so we should not be teaching chemistry.\" There has been a chorus of condemnation over Swansea's decision. Professor Colin Pillinger, the leader of Britain's ill-fated Beagle 2 mission to Mars, and a Swansea chemistry department graduate, last month also condemned the move. \"It is ironic after all the work I have done to convince people to become interested in science that my old university does not want to do it any more,\" he said. Professor Keith Smith, head of the Swansea chemistry department, also spoke out against the closure earlier this month. He chose the day his colleague, Dr Robert Ward, was awarded the Royal Society's prestigious Bader Prize for eminence in organic chemistry research. \"The decision to close the department at a time when everything is going so well is inexplicable on the basis of all the facts available,\" he said at the time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
