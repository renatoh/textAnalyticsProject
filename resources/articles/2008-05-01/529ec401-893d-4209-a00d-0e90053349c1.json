The fake crown has gone. The false chin came off for a while. By the start of next season hopes to have \"come out\" as a man with a spongy black rubber head. What he does Stops the ball going in the goal. Holds the Premier League record for match time without being beaten (1,025 minutes) and has all the attributes: height, agility, presence and an idiosyncratic range of aggrieved facial expressions that nobody pays much attention to. How fans view him God in goalie gloves: awesome keeper, lovely chap, wants to stay for life. What's not to like? How he spends his money Drives the obligatory Bentley but otherwise an unusually down-to-earth Premier League superstar. Visits museums in his spare time. And another thing Plays piano. Lists top bands as \"U2, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Madonna, Support Lesbiens\". Support Lesbiens are a popular Czech combo. Champions League 2007-08 Appearances 8 Mins played 707 Goals conceded 5 Y/R 0/0 Carlo Cudicini, goalkeeper, 34 From Castel di Sangro, \u00a3160,000 2000 He's the one who Cuts a suave, sophisticated figure, not unlike Marcello Mastroianni in La Dolce Vita, except sitting on the substitutes' bench. What he does Makes breathtaking fingertip saves with verve and agility; not so dependable challenging the big centre-forward for a high ball at Oakwell. Possibly the best reserve goalkeeper in the world but with an unlucky habit of getting injured at the same time as Petr Cech. How fans view him Popular for his Kevin Hitchcock-like loyalty/lack of ambition and for the memory of his heroics as No1 in the pre-Cech era. How he spends his money He maintains a long-distance relationship with Alessia Marcuzzi who presents Big Brother on Italian TV. She also has a son with Simone Inzaghi. And another thing The son of the legendary Milan goalkeeper Fabio Cudicini is studying for his pilot's licence, which should come in handy for keeping in touch with Ms Marcuzzi. Champions League 2007-08 Apps 5 Mins 340 Goals conceded 2 Y/R 0/0 Alex, defender, 25 From Santos, undisc. 2004 He's the one who Looks like the gargantuan opponent for Sylvester Stallone in yet-to-be-released Rocky cage-fighting schlockbuster. What he does Family-size stand-in for John Terry with a cannonball shot who's already scored from two 30-yard, net-busting free-kicks. Played with authority when he had a run in the side but spoilt things by fluffing a clearance in the dying seconds of the league season to set up Bolton's equaliser. How fans view him The rich man's Robert Huth. How he spends his money The Brazilian centre-back - full name: Alex Rodrigo Dias da Costa - has to stump up for flights back to Niter\u00f3i, across the bay from Rio de Janeiro, for himself and his family, wife Patricia and their two children. And another thing His nickname at PSV Eindhoven was \"The Tank\". His goal for PSV, having already scored at the wrong end, knocked Arsenal out of the Champions League last year. Champions League 2007-08 Apps 6 Mins 451 Assists 0 Goals 1 Fouls committed/against 9/1 Y/R 1/0 Wayne Bridge, defender, 27 From Southampton, \u00a37m 2003 He's the one who Scurries tirelessly up and down the left-hand touchline as if making a dash across the beach through a phalanx of skittish crabs. What he does Brought out like a stick of celery for cup matches or when Ashley Cole has got some explaining to do to the missus. One of the club's better crossers. How fans view him Loved for scoring the goal at Highbury that knocked Arsenal out of the 2003-04 Champions League, ending the Gunners' hoodoo over the Blues. How he spends his money Has been known to take a sporting interest in the racing prowess of horses and greyhounds. Once blew \u00a313,000 in a single four-hour session with John Terry at Coral shop near Chelsea's Cobham training ground. Has a son by his girlfriend, the French model/actress Vanessa Perroncel. And another thing He is the proud owner (and wearer) of an Imperial Stormtrooper outfit reflecting his love of the Star Wars films. Champions League 2007-08 Apps 3 Mins 270 Assists 0 Goals 0 Fouls committed/against 1/1 Y/R 0/0 Ashley Cole, defender, 27 From Arsenal, \u00a35m* 2006 He's the one who Appears in extreme close-up on your TV screen mouthing an incredibly fluent range of high-speed profanities and making the same snarly face he had on when the wind changed about three years ago. Demonstrates a myriad variety of snubs, shrugs and cold shoulders to match officials. What he does Not quite the rampaging force of his Arsenal days. Now tends to skitter about by the touchline slipping over quite a bit. Doesn't make many mistakes and doesn't score many goals (1 in nearly 150 games for Chelsea and England). But otherwise plays a low-key role in a wonderfully resilient Chelsea back line. How fans view him With a slight, albeit diminishing, sense of embarrassment. Yet to convince completely. Was he really worth all the bother? How he spends his money Purchases in the last six months said to have included: a \u00a3160,000 auxiliary wedding ring for his long-suffering wife, Cheryl, a \u00a320,000 his 'n' hers Caribbean holiday and a new duvet for the spare bedroom at the couple's Surrey mansion. Maintains an interest in media law. And another thing Warbling US soul diva Mariah Carey claims Cole is a blood relation. Carey made the discovery after tracing her family tree. She had been hoping for Nat \"King\" Cole. Never mind, eh? Champions League 2007-08 Apps 9 Mins 824 Assists 0 Goals 0 Fouls comitted/against 9/11 Y/R 1/0 *plus William Gallas Ricardo Carvalho, defender, 30 From Porto, \u00a319.85m 2004 He's the one who Looks like a reincarnation of King Charles II of Spain. Master of the sneaky, almost undetectable shirt-tugging barge, followed by puppyish, pleading appeal to referee. What he does Blocks, tackles, intercepts, sprints 30 yards to pinch the ball, leaps prodigiously. A bit like John Terry but with pace. And quieter. And without all the fist-pumping 'tis-but-a-scratch machismo. He also loves playing against United. His record reads: won four, drawn two (and two goals scored). How fans view him Stylish. Dependable. Gets the job done but still with a flourish. Like a much-loved family car - albeit one with a fancy badge. How he spends his money Hardly one for the private jet to the palm frond island in Dubai. But he has stretched to buying a replica Charlton shirt for his son, Rodrigo, who has been seen wearing it at The Valley. And another thing His favourite song is Fool's Gold by the Stone Roses: he chose it for a Chelsea players' compilation CD. Take that, Lionel Richie. Champions League 2007-08 Apps 9 Mins 840 Assists 0 Goals 0 Fouls committed/against 5/9 Y/R 1/0 Paulo Ferreira, defender, 29 From Porto, \u00a313.2m 2004 He's the one who Looks like the model for one of those yellowing portraits of a frowning man with neat dark hair that sit in Mediterranean barber shop windows for at least 30 years. What he does Hangs about in the right-back position, never playing well enough to make it his own and never quite badly enough to disappear. A good first season under Jose Mourinho but his days are surely numbered after the capture of Jose Bosingwa. How fans view him Without strong emotions either way. No sense of relief when he's not in the team. But they're not exactly doing cartwheels if he is. How he spends his money On the musical oeuvre of Leona Lewis. \"I've got Leona's song on my ring tone. I like her music. She's doing really well as an artist since winning X Factor,\" said Ferreira. And another thing In April Ferreira fainted while posing for pictures at Heathrow airport and had to be revived by a passing Rangers fan. \"He came round after a couple of minutes and said he hadn't eaten anything since the day before,\" explained the fan. Champions League 2007-08 Apps 5 Mins 432 Assists 1 Goals 0 Fouls committed/against 6/3 Y/R 1/0 John Terry, defender, 27 From Trainee He's the one who Still, even after all these years, looks eerily like Gripper Stebson from Grange Hill. What he does Hurls body in front of goal-bound piledrivers. Performs vital last-ditch tackles with partially severed foot. Overcomes recent decapitation to head balls off line. Embodiment of gung-ho backline enforcer. If only he could run a bit faster. How fans view him With unconditional love. The captain, the leader, the only player to be a regular under five successive managers. The heart of the club. How he spends his money Wears an \u00a380,000 Franck Muller watch, owns \"a portfolio of properties\" and maintains a fleet of tasty motors, including a Range Rover Sport, a Bentley Continental, a Porsche 911 Turbo and a lime green Y reg Fiat Punto (not really). And another thing Admits to having \"about 50\" pre-match superstitions. Once hung around the Chelsea car park for two hours before a game anxious to get his car into its \"lucky\" space. Champions League 2007-08 Apps 9 Mins 840 Assists 0 Goals 0 Fouls committed/against 15/9 Y/R 2/0 Michael Ballack, midfielder, 31 From Bayern Munich, free 2006 He's the one who Plays Jodie Marsh to Drogba's Jordan in 20-yard dead-ball catfight. What he does Since returning in December from eight months out with an ankle injury he has been revealed as the sort of player Chelsea thought they were getting when they signed the captain of Germany. Big player, scoring big goals in big matches. Good in the air, insightful passer, cool finisher, he has lately shown he can hack it in the rough and tumble of the Premier League. Takes penalties like a German. How fans view him Formerly arrogant carpet-bagger upsetting Our Frank; now an \"untouchable\". How he spends his money A family man. Simone Lambe, mother of Ballack's three children, was voted into the first XI of Bundesliga Wags in 2005. And another thing One of the last great footballers to hone his skills behind the iron curtain, his first club was Karl-Marx-Stadt FC. He plays golf off a handicap of 22 and is a big fan of the Godfather films. Champions League 2007-08 Apps 6 Mins 566 Assists 0 Goals 2 Shots on/off 13/2 Y/R 0/0 Joe Cole, midfielder, 26 From West Ham United, \u00a36.6m 2003 He's the one who Reacts with incredulous indignation at award of throw-in to the opposition. Beats defenders \"for fun\". Chases back 40 yards to make ill-judged lunge. What he does Extravagantly gifted playmaker. Arrived the same day as Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n for less than half the money, rightly claiming the No10 shirt. A class act but has gone off the boil in recent weeks. How fans view him Supporters' player of the year. Having watched from the West Stand as a boy, he is the fan on the pitch. How he spends his money A \u00a350,000 engagement ring for fitness instructor Carly Zucker, recently voted fourth-sexiest Wag in the world - a June wedding is planned with the reception at the Royal Chelsea Hospital featuring a possible parade of Chelsea pensioners. He also has two bulldogs and is a big Oasis fan. And another thing Like Gary Lineker, he used to help out on his father's market stall as a lad. Champions League 2007-08 Apps 12 Mins 1032 Assists 1 Goals 2 Shots on/off 16/5 Y/R 0/0 Michael Essien, midfielder, 25 From Lyon, \u00a324m 2005 He's the one who Never stops running, propelling anything he finds in his path goalwards. What he does A bit of everything: right side of midfield, the holding role, right-back, central defence. Possibly too versatile for his own good - one of the world's top midfielders will probably find himself playing full-back in a European Cup final. How fans view him An all-action midfielder who gives everything for the team? Surely the embodiment of a fans' favourite, and the 2007 supporters' player of the year. How he spends his money Telephone bills: he calls his mother in Ghana every day. A \"former girlfriend\" claimed he bought her a \u00a322,000 BMW and lavished thousands on champagne and McVitie's chocolate digestives. But Essien denied the relationship ever took place: \"I rarely go out\". And another thing Essien's hobby is sleeping: \"I like to sleep; any time I get the chance I take it.\" Contributed to an anti-racism CD with Didier Drogba. Nicknamed \"the Bison\" at Lyon. Champions League 2007-08 Apps 11 Mins 932 Assists 2 Goals 0 Shots on/off 26/13 Y/R 0/0 Claude Makelele, midfielder, 35 From Real Madrid, \u00a316.8m 2003 He's the one who Smiles angelically. Jogs about as if he's having a trot on the beach in his flip-flops. Viciously hacks down men three times his size and then politely helps them back up. What he does Seems very much at home in the Makelele role. Founding father of a style of play based around getting in the way, nipping at the heels and giving the ball to Frank Lampard. Hugely blessed with the skills you need to do this kind of thing. How fans view him With admiration, if not exactly vast amounts of affection. He intercepts, he niggles, he goes home. How he spends his money Buys a lot of fancy clobber (\"Gucci's simple evening pieces suit me well,\" he says). Hardly surprising given that he's married to a model, Naomi Lenoir - the one in the bikini in the M&amp;S ads. Also drives a Bentley Continental. And another thing Besides doing a bit of work for Unicef he acts as an official ambassador for the Catholic shrine at Lourdes. Makes regular pilgrimages \"to meet monks and discuss various aspects of my faith\". Champions League 2007-08 Apps 12 Mins 1064 Assists 0 Goals 0 Shots on/off 3/1 Y/R 1/0 Florent Malouda, midfielder, 27 From Lyon, \u00a313.5m 2007 He's the one who Frowns. Scuttles about. Frowns some more. Stands with hands on hips. Does some more frowning. What he does Left-sided scamperer. Has looked the part without quite establishing himself as an automatic pick. Quick but not that quick. Works hard. Scores the odd goal. Always nicely turned out. You don't get that much for \u00a313m these days. How fans view him With a little disappointment. Started well but has gone off the boil. Is he pining for Jose Mourinho? Nobody would be surprised if he hooked it in the summer. How he spends his money On taxis, apparently. Malouda revealed he relaxes by hiring \"a big chauffeur-driven car so I can take my kids out for a walk\". Took a four-hour taxi from Nantes to Paris in October after complaining that Chelsea hadn't laid on a private jet. And another thing When Mourinho left, Malouda said: \"His departure saddened me. A lot. For a while I was very, very upset... I felt like an orphan.\" He worked with Mourinho for two months. Champions League 2007-08 Apps 10 Mins 700 Assists 1 Goals 1 Shots on/off 13/8 Y/R 0/0 Frank Lampard, midfielder, 29 From West Ham United, \u00a311m 2001 He's the one who Has been meticulously plucked, manicured and waxed, leaving him looking a bit like Football Ken from the Ken and Barbie Soccer Set. What he does Chelsea head prefect. Trots about all over the place: takes free-kicks, corners, penalties, likes a shot or two. Player most likely to pick the ball out of the back of the net after scoring and perform knees-high trot back to the centre circle. How fans view him With adoration - and bemusement at his public vilification with England. The general view is: lay off Frank. How he spends his money Admits to owning \"about 30 or 40 pairs\" of shoes. Not to mention a \u00a320,000 platinum Vertu Signature mobile phone. And a house just down the road from Tim Henman. And another thing Is one of the Premier League's few former public schoolboys, having attended Brentwood School in Essex, alma mater of Douglas Adams, Sir Robin Day and Noel Edmonds. Champions League 2007-08 Apps 10 Mins 830 Assists 3 Goals 3 Shots on/off 17/5 Y/R 1/0 Mikel John Obi, midfielder, 21 From Lyn Oslo, \u00a316m 2006 He's the one who Has a really quite scary-looking and somewhat over-inflated head with a little baby face entirely out of keeping with his formidable physique. What he does Bought as an attacking midfielder, but seems to have settled into a more defensive role. Breaks up attacks, passes neatly and not afraid to put his enormously powerful foot in. How fans view him Very glad to have him. If only because his signing contributed to the bursting of a few additional capillaries in Sir Alex Ferguson's empurpled cheeks. How he spends his money Sends a large slice of his weekly wedge to Nigeria to support his extended family, including his brother Ebere, who plays as a goalkeeper in Lagos. And another thing During the 2003 under-17 World Championships his name was consistently spelt \"Mikel\" instead of his given name Michael. He liked the sound of it and it has stuck. Champions League 2007-08 Apps 4 Mins 149 Assists 0 Goals 0 Shots on/off 0/0 Y/R 1/0 Salomon Kalou, forward 22 From Feyenoord, \u00a38m 2006 He's the one who Resembles a sweet-tempered, baby-faced prefect who doesn't swear and stands up straight. A mother's dream. What he does Usually plays wide in a three-man attack, appearing regularly under Avram Grant (only Joe Cole has played more this season) and provides an increasingly potent threat on goal. How fans view him Slowly waking up to what a good player he is; could still be tougher and more decisive. How he spends his money Christmas must be quite pricey, considering he has two brothers, including fellow international Bonaventure, and eight sisters. And another thing When travelling with his Ivorian academy team he used to room with Arsenal's Emmanuel Ebou\u00e9. While playing for Feyenoord, he nearly became Dutch with a view to appearing at the 2006 World Cup but fell foul of a hardline immigration minister. Now a regular with Ivory Coast. Champions League 2007-08 Apps 10 Mins 534 Assists 0 Goals 1 Shots on/off 14/8 Y/R 0/0 Didier Drogba, forward, 30 From Marseille, \u00a323.8m 2004 He's the one who Looks like a tall, powerfully muscled Adonis with wet-look, ironed flat barnet. May be seen writhing on the ground having apparently been hit by a high-velocity bullet. Rediscovered his shooting boots in the semi-final win over Liverpool. What he does Everything: scores goals of all varieties - long shots, free-kicks, headers, tap-ins - defends corners, holds the ball up, bullies defenders and is more than happy to ref the game as well. Top fact: has never been booked for diving at Chelsea. How fans view him Drogba always appears to be on the point of walking out but, for fans, goals sanctify. How he spends his money Regularly buys up dozens of replica shirts from the club shop to give to friends, family (including his Malian wife, Lalla, and three children) and admirers in Ivory Coast. And another thing The focus of the cult \"Drogbacit\u00e9\" in his own country, he is comfortable with messianic status and takes his role as a UN ambassador seriously. Champions League 2007-08 Apps 10 Mins 908 Assists 1 Goals 6 Shots on/off 41/16 Y/R 0/0 Nicolas Anelka, forward 29 From Bolton Wanderers, \u00a315m 2008 He's the one who Does that flapping-bird thing with his hands after scoring a goal - not that Chelsea fans would know. What he does Older, wiser former enfant terrible who these days maintains a Zen-like calm while sent to patrol the right touchline or warm the bench. How fans view him As a European Cup-winning centre-forward - so why does Avram Grant play him out wide? How he spends his money Married to Belgian-born choreographer Barbara Tausia. A keen tennis player, his business interests include his own range of clothing, 39Pro, and his own record label. And another thing Fancies himself as something of a gourmet - citing Caribbean, African, Oriental and Turkish cuisine - but was not above trousering a few euros for endorsing an Anelka Burger for the French fast-food chain Quick. Lists his musical interests as: le rap, la soul, le funk, le RnB, le zouk, l'afrobeat. Following his conversion, Anelka's Muslim name is Abdulsalam Bilal. Champions League 2007-08 Apps 4 Mins 142 Assists 1 Goals 0 Shots on/off 0/2 Y/R 0/0 Shaun Wright-Phillips, midfielder, 26 From Manchester City, \u00a321m 2005 He's the one who Outjumped Everton's snow-capped Joleon Lescott to force a Carling Cup winner at Stamford Bridge despite being a clothes model for Action Man. What he does Usually stands on the halfway line for defensive corners. Pacy, tricky winger specialising in giving full-backs tackling practice; central midfielder of vision and authority. How fans view him Lovable, free-spirited throwback to the days of Kevin McAllister. Feel a bit sorry he doesn't get more of a fair shake. How he spends his money Invested \u00a320,000 in softcore porn channel Babe Central; likes to turn up at the studio with his champagne-quaffing mates during filming to keep an eye on his investment. Also owns a Harley Davidson trike. Separated from Naomi Brown, mother of his two children. And another thing In his spare time Bradley's big brother raises money for an education charity supporting children in Guatemala. Champions League 2007-08 Apps 5 Mins 198 Assists 0 Goals 0 Shots on/off 6/2 Y/R 0/0 Andriy Shevchenko, forward 31 From AC Milan, \u00a330m 2006 He's the one who Looks really puzzled. And lost. And a little wobbly-lipped and dewy-eyed, like a nervous five-year-old on his first day at school. What he does Non-scoring, multi-million pound substitute striker. Never adjusted to the fact nobody stops running and hoofing people up in the air in the Premier League. Andriy! They're over there. If you ask nicely, I'm sure they'll let you play. How fans view him Cheered whenever he appears on the touchline to warm up. Has a residual store of affection, partly due to the saga of his arrival. Would be an incredibly popular choice to score the winner in Moscow. How he spends his money Is currently building a \u00a31m \"batcave\" at his Surrey mansion to house his collection of cars. The six-vehicle dungeon will contain hydraulically-activated metal cages from which the Sheva fleet can be summoned at the touch of a button. And another thing His grandmother planted a lock of his infant hair under a pear tree with a twisty trunk, hoping to give the baby curls.
