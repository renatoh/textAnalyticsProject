The remarkable Ruth Negga is a potent presence as the eponymous central character, who was named after the Hebridean island where the story unfolds. Iona, we learn through flashbacks, is fleeing the aftermath of a violent relationship. Her son Billy \u2013 or Bull as he prefers to be called \u2013 is a taciturn 15-year-old who thrashes in his sleep, soaked in the sweat of the night terrors that plague him. As with his feature debut Shell, writer/director Scott Graham here captures the tensions peculiar to an isolated community. Iona \u2013 the film as well as the central character \u2013 is complicated by prickly questions of religious faith. It\u2019s a striking piece, and director of photography Yoliswa von Dallwitz evocatively captures the exposed, untamed island landscape. However, a melodramatic ending rather lets down the intelligence and restraint of what precedes it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
