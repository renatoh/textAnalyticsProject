But the day after she buried her youngest daughter she \u201cstarted to move\u201d to track down those responsible. Carolina Andrango had promised her mother she would not run away again. The 15-year-old had been through a difficult two years. She had fallen in with a bad crowd, her school grades had dropped and she had spent time in a drug rehabilitation clinic. She\u2019d gone missing from home for days at a time. But on a shopping trip in August, it felt like happier times. Her mother bought her a new backpack and Carolina fooled about with her older sister, making a video on her phone. Then Carolina got a phone call from a boy asking her to come out to eat salchipapas (hot dogs) in the Comit\u00e9 del Pueblo neighbourhood where they lived in the north of Quito, the Ecuadorean capital. Excited, Carolina pleaded with her mother to let her go. Amanda was worried, but reasoned her daughter was getting back on the right track. Reluctantly, she agreed. \u201cMake sure you\u2019re back in an hour and a half. Be careful, don\u2019t trust the people around you,\u201d she told Carolina. \u201cTrust me, Mami, I know how to defend myself,\u201d Carolina said. \u201cShe hugged me and gave me a kiss on the forehead,\u201d Amanda recalls. It was 25 August 2018. \u201cTrust me, Mami. I\u2019ll be back,\u201d Carolina had said. The following day Carolina\u2019s body was found dumped on a patch of wasteland. She had been gang-raped and strangled. On Monday in Quito, a 17-year-old boy, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, was convicted of rape resulting in death and sentenced to eight years\u2019 detention. He was also ordered to pay $4,000 (\u00a33,192) to Carolina\u2019s family. Later this year, a man is due to face trial in connection with Carolina\u2019s death and is also expected to be charged with trafficking with the purpose of sexual exploitation. Earlier this month, two teenage girls were found guilty of tampering with a crime scene and given one year probation. But the fact anyone is standing trial for Carolina\u2019s death is not down to the work of the authorities. Faced with police inaction, it was Amanda who single-handedly began the investigation into her daughter\u2019s death. Despite an autopsy indicating a violent death, Amanda was told by the police homicide squad, Dinased, that her daughter had died of \u201cacute pancreatitis brought on by alcoholic intoxication\u201d, according to documents seen by the Guardian. The police concluded there was no case to answer. Carolina\u2019s body was returned to her family, who took it home in a casket for the wake. \u201cI lifted the lid and my daughter had blows on her face, on her forehead, her lip was broken, her hands looked as if she\u2019d been trying to defend herself,\u201d Amanda sobbed. \u201cHow could she have died from natural causes?\u201d Amanda resolved to make her own inquiries. \u201cI buried my daughter on the 29th. On the 30th I started to move,\u201d she said. She began by checking Facebook videos featuring her daughter and others. She spoke to Carolina\u2019s friends; she found out where her daughter\u2019s suspected attackers went to school. Through a Facebook page she set up, Justicia por Carolina, Amanda received a tipoff about where one of the accused lived. Amanda went to the building and posed as a maid looking for work. It was a ruse persuasive enough for a porter to confirm to her where his apartment was. The same flat was raided by the police in March and the occupant was arrested. Ecuador\u2019s interior minister, Mar\u00eda Paula Romo, said it was the \u201ctenacity of the family which made this case known to us\u201d. The minister only found out about the case through Amanda\u2019s media interviews. She immediately assigned it to the judicial police, who reopened inquiries in December 2018. Carolina\u2019s body was exhumed, a new autopsy was conducted and investigations began into her murder and a possible sex trafficking network. It took the police, working with Amanda, just days to prepare the case against multiple suspects. An internal investigation into the conduct of the homicide squad has also been opened, Romo said, adding that public prosecutors and judges should also be investigated for inaction or deliberate obstruction of justice. Two police officers have been disciplined for closing the murder inquiry, and had 8% of their monthly salary docked as a punishment. \u201cThe mother and the family had advanced the case enormously on their own,\u201d said Romo. \u201cThey had identified the people, they had identified the places.\u201d The night of 25 August 2018, Amanda hardly slept. Carolina had not returned home and Amanda\u2019s 21-year-old daughter said her sister had logged off Facebook on her smartphone at about midnight. They lost trace of her. At 4am Amanda rose to prepare empanadas, traditional pastries she sells on Quito\u2019s streets. She tried to bury the sinking feeling in the pit of her stomach. Carolina had run away before, staying away for weeks at a time, and had also spent a month at a rehabilitation centre for truanting teenagers. This time, though, Amanda sensed something had happened to Carolina. Between sobs, she recalls Carolina\u2019s response when she told her daughter she was going to find out who she was spending so much time with. \u201cMami, don\u2019t investigate, you don\u2019t know what kind of people you\u2019re dealing with,\u201d Carolina had said. \u201cA mother must fight for her child, whether she\u2019s dead or alive,\u201d Amanda said. \u201cWhen she was alive I was trying to save her.\u201d * Her name has been changed to protect her privacy."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
