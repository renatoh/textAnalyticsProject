Instead they behaved as if nothing had happened. Not a single banner celebrated the manager's departure, not a solitary song told of delight. Even when images of Glenn Hoddle in his pomp flashed up on the big screen as usual before kick-off there was no surge of excitement. It might be stretching the point to suggest White Hart Lane was in mourning, but had the crowd broken into a chant of \"We want Graham in\" it would have been no surprise. If shock was behind the supporters' reaction, those feelings were shared by the players. Youngsters such as Ledley King, Luke Young and Stephen Clemence who have been helped along by Graham described themselves as \"disappointed\" or \"sad\" at the Scot's departure. \"I think he's a top-quality manager,\" King said, \"and I don't think he did anything wrong.\" Clemence's insistence that Graham had the total backing of his squad - \"I was right behind the manager and I know the other players were\" - has been contradicted by reports of a rift between the Scot and his captain Sol Campbell. But all the talk was of team spirit reaching new heights and, after that FA Cup victory at West Ham which set up a semi-final against Arsenal, the staff thought there was more chance of Graham riding into training on Shergar than there was of him being sacked. \"Everybody was in a state of shock and I don't think we've come to terms with it yet,\" said the assistant manager Stewart Houston, who also saw Graham depart in unexpected circumstances at Arsenal and added that his own future had not been discussed. \"The body takes a period of time to adapt. \"The place was as high as a kite on Monday, it really was. It was absolutely buzzing. The players were really pumped up on a high and we thought it was terrific, marvellous.\" Clearly a week is not just a long time in politics. Not surprisingly, after the remarks from Tottenham's new owners that Graham had to go because he was not a \"team player\", Houston said there was no problem: \"We're not tennis players, we're team players. George Graham is very much a team player.\" With or without Graham the team rumbled on. The good news for Spurs fans ahead of their next two games, against Arsenal in the league and Cup, is that there was no negative reaction to Graham's departure. After a hairy start in which Coventry might have scored twice, this was a comfortable, deserved victory. David Pleat said the team were so focused and well prepared that his wife could have managed them. The director of football changed little, save pushing the impressive King into more advanced positions from midfield and asking Steffen Freund to get forward more often. His decision to retain Steffen Iversen at right wing-back paid off as the Norwegian scored one goal and had a hand in another. The decision to keep Clemence in his preferred position in the centre of midfield was successful, too. It says much for the instability at Spurs that, at 22, Clemence has seen four managers come and go. But he was a lively figure with his passing, shooting and set-pieces. It was from his corner that Iversen sent a header past Chris Kirkland and from his free-kick shortly after that Les Ferdinand scored after another Iversen header had been parried. Sergei Rebrov polished things off, scoring from King's neat pass. Coventry, having wasted early chances and been let down by poor marking, never looked likely to recover. Eight points adrift of safety, their prospects look grim. \"We still feel a good run can get us out of trouble,\" Lee Carsley said. Graham believed Tottenham's good run might just have been beginning. \"We felt we were going in the right direction,\" Houston said. It will be left to someone else to carry the journey on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
