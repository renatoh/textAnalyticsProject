Now you can experience that humiliation in the comfort of your own home as you attempt the same trick with a Jedi-themed ping pong ball in Jedi Force Trainer. Get started by donning a headset with three electrodes pressed to your scalp, then follow Yoda's instructions to clear your mind and apply your emergent Force skills to get a ball to hover on a column of air in the transparent plastic tube in front of you. Surprisingly, calming your thoughts does indeed cause the ball to float upwards and losing concentration makes it flop back down again. Progressing through its difficulty levels requires significantly greater concentration and anyone living in a shared flat may find their Force skills sorely compromised.
