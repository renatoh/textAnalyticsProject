Tel: 01564 742212. Website: thebellattanworthinarden.co.uk First impressions: A suggestion of modernity overlooking a Warwickshire village green. What are the rooms like? Clean, uncluttered lines in a clean, uncluttered space. Neutral shades make for a restful Sunday lie-in, with a feature wall of olive or plum behind you. Breakfast is tea, toast and cereal in the room, but a full English can be arranged. There are only four rooms at the moment, but don't expect a view over the green. The bed test: Minimal, with a softly sprung mattress and fibre-filled pillows. White cotton sheets with Habitat blanket and throw, or optional duvet provided. The bathroom test: Ours had an ocean-going free-standing tub with separate shower and chunky chrome fittings throughout. The restaurant: Modern eclectic in both ambience and food, with a pleasant buzz. Finish a \u00a320-25 two-courser and you will struggle to fit in a dessert. Served by friendly, attentive staff, the food - from trad English dishes to Thai via Morocco and the Med -is delicious. The bar: Designed for a quick refuelling stop rather than to prop up. Well kept ales on draught and a reasonably-priced wine list. But there's more ... after turning a corner, the bartop segues into a deli counter and then into a working Post Office counter. What is there to do nearby? Visit 1970s songsmith Nick Drake and legendary motorcycle racer Mike Hailwood, who both rest in the churchyard over the road. On a livelier note, rejuvenated Birmingham is within striking distance, and both Stratford and historic Warwick a 20-minute Sunday drive away. How much a night? Singles: \u00a355 per room; doubles \u00a375, B&amp;B."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
