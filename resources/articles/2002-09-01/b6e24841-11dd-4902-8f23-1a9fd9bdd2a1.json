Crystal Palace were also interested in signing the 35-year-old but have also ended their interest for cost reasons. There remains a slim chance of him joining the First Division leaders Portsmouth, who hope to sign another former England midfielder, Tim Sherwood, but could turn to Wise if the Tottenham player fails to recover from a knee injury. The former Chelsea striker Ian Hutchinson died yesterday at the age of 54 after a long illness. He scored the equaliser in the 1970 FA Cup final against Leeds and set up the winner in the replay with a trademark long throw. \"He was a 110% player and I think that was why he went down ever so well at Chelsea,\" said his former team-mate Ron Harris. \u00b7 Franco Baresi, who spent six disastrous months as director of football at Fulham this year, has returned to Milan as chief coach of the club's most senior youth team. \"I've learned through bitter experience that it's hard to stay away from Milan for too long,\" he said. \u00b7 Tony Scholes, Preston's highly regarded chief executive, has resigned after more than three years in the role and will step down after the club's agm on October 14. \"I have spent six very interesting and enjoyable years here,\" he said. \"I am very proud of how far the club has progressed and the success that has been achieved in that time.\" \u00b7 The West Ham manager Glenn Roeder yesterday hit back at the Scotland manager Berti Vogts for his public criticism of Christian Dailly. \"You don't get credibility by publicly criticising your players,\" Roeder said. \"Berti has every right to criticise the players in private but that's the way it should stay.\" \u00b7 The Paraguayan goalkeeper Jose Luis Chilavert, who has refused to play for his French club Racing Strasbourg this season because he claims he is owed \u00a32.8m, has been sacked for allegedly faking the contract in question. \"The papers are all in the hands of my lawyers and I'm relaxed, enjoying a bit of a holiday,\" the 37-year-old said. \u00b7 The Bolton midfielder Ricardo Gardner will be out for up to six weeks after an operation on a damaged knee cartilage this week. Newcastle and Manchester United have joined the chase for a 16-year-old Icelandic striker, Donys Sigurdsson, who is to return to Middlesbrough for a second trial spell next month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
