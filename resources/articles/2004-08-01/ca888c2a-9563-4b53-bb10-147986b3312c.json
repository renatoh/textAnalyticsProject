Like-for-like sales at the chain - which exclude sales made from extra floor space - climbed by about 8% in the last three months, according to figures released by Wal-Mart, the grocer's US parent company. The growth is being driven by sales of non-food lines such as fashion, entertainment and home wares, but food sales are still robust. \"Comparable store food sales were in the mid single digits,\" said Asda, \"while general merchandise and clothing sales grew in the high single digits. Sales in the electronics category continue to run strong.\" Last month marked the fifth anniversary of Wal-Mart's entry into Britain with its acquisition of Asda. The chain's market share has increased by more than a third and it has overtaken Sainsbury's to become Britain's second largest grocer. In America, Wal-Mart announced better than expected quarterly earnings and said it remained optimistic despite the effect of higher oil prices on consumer confidence and spending. Disappointing June sales at several leading retailers, including Wal-Mart, were blamed on higher petrol prices and prompted concerns about the strength of the US economy. Wal-Mart chief executive Lee Scott said the outlook was still encouraging. \"I started this year with an optimistic view. I still feel the same way. Although I am concerned about high gasoline prices, I continue to believe that growth in employment and real income will lessen the impact.\" The Arkansas-based business announced profits of $2.7bn (\u00a31.5bn), equal to 62 cents a share, in the three months to the end of July, compared with $2.4bn, or 52 cents a share, last year. Analysts had expected earnings of around 60 cents a share. The retailer's profits are growing faster than sales because the company is buying more goods from cheaper overseas suppliers, cutting back on markdowns and selling more high-margin lines such as back-to-school clothing. \"We improved operating profits in all of our divisions,\" said Mr Scott. Wal-Mart's international division - of which Asda is a crucial part - generated sales growth of 16.3%, with operating profit up 33.3%. The British chain plans to open 10 food stores and extend 22 of its existing outlets in the coming year. It will also open three standalone George fashion stores."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
