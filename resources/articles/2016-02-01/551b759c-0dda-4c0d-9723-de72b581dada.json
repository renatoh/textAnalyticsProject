With the majority of precincts reporting, Clinton had 52.7% of the vote, to Sanders\u2019 47.2%. After a race that initially appeared to be neck-and-neck, the result was called by the Associated Press shortly after 2.20pm local time. The former secretary of state will seize on her win in the desert state as the start of her comeback in the Democratic race, in which she was first held to an effective tie by Sanders in Iowa and then was easily defeated by him in New Hampshire. Also on Saturday, the Republicans have been voting in South Carolina, where Donald Trump is expected to win, although his poll lead has narrowed in recent days. There were ecstatic scenes at the Clinton victory party. \u201cSome may have doubted us but we never doubted each other,\u201d Clinton told supporters at the Caesars Palace hotel in Las Vegas. She congratulated Sanders on a hard-fought race, but added a barely-concealed criticism of her adversary. \u201cThe truth is, we aren\u2019t a single-issue country,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need more than a plan for the big banks; the middle class needs a raise.\u201d \u201cI am on my way to Texas, Bill is on his way to Colorado,\u201d she said, in a nod to the slew of crucial primary contests due to take place on 1 March, known as Super Tuesday. \u201cThe fight is on, the future that we want is within our grasp.\u201d The reference in her speech to Bill Clinton coincided with the former president\u2019s increasing role in the family campaign to retake the White House. In a pointed campaign moment in Nevada, Bill Clinton locked horns with Sanders, implicitly comparing his populism to that of the conservative Tea Party. The Vermont senator hit back, attacking the former president\u2019s trade deals, Wall Street deregulation and \u201cso-called welfare reforms\u201d. In his concession speech on Saturday, Sanders struck an upbeat tone, claiming \u201cthe wind is at our backs\u201d despite the defeat in Nevada \u2013 pointing out how far his opponent\u2019s lead in the Nevada polls had shrunk. \u201cFive weeks ago, we were 25 points behind in the polls,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have made some real progress.\u201d He added: \u201cI believe on Super Tuesday we have got an excellent chance to win many of those states.\u201d Clinton\u2019s win comes with at least 19 of Nevada\u2019s 35 delegates, adding to her already significant lead in that count, mostly from the support of superdelegates. The Democratic race will first head to South Carolina, where Clinton has enjoyed a formidable 20-point lead in recent polls, and where her backing from African Americans, a key demographic in the state, is stronger than her support from Latinos. The Clinton camp hoped that her disappointing showing in the predominantly white early nominating states would quickly be erased once the nomination process moved to states like Nevada and South Carolina, which have a more mixed ethnic and racial makeup. That turned out to be only partly true in Nevada. Even though Clinton clinched the vote by a comfortable margin, NBC exit poll data indicated she had actually lost the vote of the state\u2019s key demographic of Latino voters. Sanders won 53% of the Latino vote, according to the sample data, compared to Clinton\u2019s 45%. That is a worrying result for Clinton, who has staked her campaign on the promise of winning minority voters. Some Latino voters, particularly younger people and low-wage workers, appeared to be opting for Sanders in the final weeks of the campaign. In the final 48 hours of the campaign, the Clinton camp ramped up a negative push against Sanders, questioning his commitment to Latinos and portraying the former secretary of state as the obvious heir to the diverse coalition that elected Barack Obama. In the end Clinton\u2019s strength among women, older voters and African Americans \u2013 as well as those who said they were looking for experience in their nominee \u2013 proved decisive. \u201cI love that she\u2019s a woman,\u201d said Darlene Gerson, an attorney caucusing for Clinton at Del Webb middle school in Henderson, in southeast Las Vegas. \u201cI agree with the vast majority of her views. She knows what she\u2019s doing. If anyone can compromise, she can. She\u2019s hugely more electable.\u201d Nevada\u2019s result lends weight to that view, and shifts momentum behind Clinton\u2019s campaign at a critical juncture. For the Sanders campaign, Saturday\u2019s result in Nevada will be considered a setback, but not one without positive signs, having significantly dented the lead of a candidate once considered the party\u2019s presumed nominee. In a repeat of Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders had his strongest showing amid young people, who have flocked to his promise of tuition-free college and a platform of radical political and economic change in America. In the northern city of Reno, where Sanders performed more strongly, there was overwhelming support for the senator at the University of Nevada caucus site. \u201cI know that the campus culture here is all about Bernie Sanders,\u201d said Olivia Komanduri, an 18-year-old student supporting Clinton, adding she was disappointed but not surprised that she lost there. \u201cThey love the idea of a political revolution, they want someone who is different like Bernie, but they don\u2019t understand that Hillary is different, too.\u201d The Democratic race still remains tight, with Clinton and Sanders each having won one state and effectively tying in the other. But after a disappointing start to her 2016 campaign, Clinton will claim momentum is now on her side. In addition to her lead in South Carolina, which holds its Democratic primary later this month, Clinton appears to be ahead in other states voting in early March. She is leading in 10 of the 12 states that will hold Democratic primaries between 1 and 8 March, benefiting from overwhelming support of black voters, according to a Public Policy Polling survey released this week. \u201cSenator Sanders has run a very good campaign,\u201d said Jennifer Palmieri, the Clinton campaign\u2019s director of communications. \u201cHe speaks very passionately to a lot of the anger - justifiably so - that people feel here. But we think that the longer the campaign goes on the more apparent it becomes as she makes her argument that she has solutions that will actually work and make a difference in people\u2019s lives for all the barriers that hold them back.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
