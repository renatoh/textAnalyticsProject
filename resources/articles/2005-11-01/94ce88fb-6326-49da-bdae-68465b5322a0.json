It comes with a double-sided A3 colour walkers' map. Jane Petzing The Road Editions map at 1:100,000 is by far the best - accurate, with footpaths clearly marked etc. Available on eBay and from good travel bookshops - the Hellenic Book Service (hellenicbookservice.com) is highly recommended. Locally published maps are useless. The best guidebook for walkers is Noel Rochford's Landscapes Of Rhodes (Sunflower), out of print but possibly obtainable second-hand or through Inter Library Loans from your local library. John Kanefsky We have just come back from Rhodes, and took with us an excellent booklet of 18 walks, including one around Rhodes city. I got it free from the Rodos Tourism Promotional Organisation (rodosisland.gr). Roger Kirk There are very few walking guides to Rhodes because the choice of walks is very limited, mainly because of over-development. Lonely Planet's Trekking In Greece devotes only four of its 355 pages to the island. Much better walking is available on Amorgos, northern Naxos, Sifnos, or Folegandros, and possibly Tinos, Samos, Nisiros and Tilos.
