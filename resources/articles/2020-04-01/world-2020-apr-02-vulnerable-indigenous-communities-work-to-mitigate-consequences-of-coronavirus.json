The service, better known as the Purple House, runs dialysis clinics in 18 remote communities across a vast area of central Australia. Purple House staff have spent the past fortnight rushing to empty its Alice Springs clinic and send its mostly elderly patients out bush where it\u2019s safer, for now. \u201cOur isolation gives us a little more time to prepare than the big cities,\u201d Brown said this week. Aboriginal community-controlled health organisations were meeting almost every day by phone to compare notes, share resources and knowledge, she said. A public health campaign in dozens of Aboriginal languages is under way, including short videos with the theme \u201cstay on country, care for family\u201d. The national taskforce of experts in Indigenous health and epidemiology who have been advising the national cabinet have released a detailed plan for when the storm arrives. It is a grim list of challenging considerations: expediting testing and reducing contagion by \u201cdriving samples to town rather than waiting for the weekly plane.\u201d using tents in overcrowded communities for quarantine and isolation deploying mobile respiratory clinics during outbreaks. discussing difficult issues, such as end of life, being unable to return to country to die, and having limited hospital visits. making a \u201cplan for the management of the deceased\u201d. Frontline doctors say they are \u201cpreparing for death and suffering\u201d in Aboriginal and Islander communities, because they don\u2019t have the resources to evacuate very ill people. The president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Tony Bartone, has called for the national cabinet to \u201curgently fund and resource Aboriginal Torres Strait Islander health services to ensure they can respond to Covid-19\u201d. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, and the health minister, Greg Hunt, have announced \u201cflexible\u201d funding to 45 organisations across 110 remote communities, to help Aboriginal medical services prepare by \u201cpromoting personal protective measures, including hand and respiratory hygiene, cough etiquette and use of respirators or face masks\u201d and even \u201cpurchasing soap for community and schools\u201d. \u201cOur number one priority is to save lives by slowing the spread of coronavirus and stop people bringing the virus into remote communities,\u201d Wyatt said. But the suspension of non-essential medical treatments will increase pressure on the everyday health burden in Aboriginal communities, according to Western Australian ophthalmologist, Dr Angus Turner. Turner treats hundreds of people in remote communities, \u201cvery stressed patients at the moment\u201d, whose vision is impaired by macular degeneration, diabetes and other comorbidities. \u201cMy concern is that over the next six months we could be allowing peoples\u2019 vision to deteriorate, while we can\u2019t do the injection treatments that keep people seeing,\u201d Turner said. \u201cWe can\u2019t get to regions or move between regions, and it might not mean blindness over the next few months, but it\u2019s the difference between driving and not driving and that is a big issue for anyone, especially if you\u2019re in an outback area. \u201cSo if someone was just on the right side of the vision line before this, they may not be afterwards,\u201d he said. The evacuation of at-risk patients to big city hospitals presents challenges too, according to the Australian Indigenous Doctors\u2019 Association. The association said in a statement it had already received reports of \u201cabhorrent and unethical behaviour\u201d in hospitals, including staff at a Perth hospital who said \u201cAboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would get [Covid-19] because they don\u2019t wash their hands.\u201d \u201cSuch blatant racism can never be tolerated \u2013 least of all at this crucial time. \u201cAIDA fully appreciates that the Australian medical workforce is facing exceptional challenges right now. \u201cHowever, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples\u2019 lives, health and wellbeing cannot be put at risk because of underlying racism and prejudice,\u201d AIDA said. An emergency specialist in Perth, Dr Nicole Liesis, said she had overhead such comments, and they were an example of her major concern. \u201cWhen I think of the impact of Covid-19 on the Aboriginal elder population, they are such a precious, fragile and irreplaceable resource, and they suffer a heavy burden of disease as well as trauma. \u201cThey\u2019ve already had so much loss and bereavement and it is inevitable there will be so much more in the week and months to come,\u201d Liesis said. \u201cIn WA the only critical care available to date is in Perth. \u201cI know current disaster planning involves setting up intensive care hubs in regional centres, which has never been done before, but there\u2019s long-standing reluctance among Aboriginal people to engage with healthcare and all the dismissiveness, judgement and stereotyping that goes with it.\u201d Liesis said Aboriginal people might prefer to stay home and \u201cdie on country\u201d than be flown to city hospitals, and health workers and families needed to prepare for that. Field hospitals should be established \u201cbefore communities are critically unwell\u201d, she said. \u201cMany that I have spoken to are deeply saddened by the plight that faces Indigenous Australia, but it is not a time for pity or sympathy. \u201cI do not want our children to hear \u2018Oh it was so sad, but there was not much we could do for those people.\u2019 Those people are our people. The holders of cultural wisdom. A national treasure that must be preserved at all cost.\u201d At the now quiet Purple House in Alice Springs, Brown urged non-Indigenous Australians to listen to the health authorities advice on Covid-19. \u201cWhat happens in the rest of the country affects us heavily,\u201d Brown said. \u201cPeople who can stay home, please stay home! Do it for yourselves, but do it for us too. \u201cThis virus knows no boundaries in terms of wealth, status, language or education. But for those less able to cope with its impact, it will be devastating.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
