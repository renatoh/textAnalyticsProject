Mr Tenet denied that his agency had tailored information to build a case for war. He told his audience at Georgetown University, in Washington DC, that his experts had never claimed that Iraq posed an imminent threat to US security. CIA analysts had varying opinions on the state of Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programmes and those differences were spelled out in the October 2002 national intelligence estimate given to the White House, he said. The report, which summarised intelligence on Iraq's weapons programs, \"painted an objective assessment for our policymakers of a brutal dictator who was continuing his efforts to deceive and build programmes that might constantly surprise us and threaten our interests, \" Mr Tenet said. But he said that his organisation \"never said there was an imminent threat\". Mr Tenet said the CIA was \"generally on target\" about Iraq's missile programmes, though he acknowledged that, on nuclear materials, the agency \"may have overestimated the progress that Saddam was making\". \"In the intelligence business, you are never completely wrong or completely right ... When the facts of Iraq are all in, we will neither be completely right nor completely wrong,\" he said. He also noted that the search for banned weapons in Iraq was continuing and that, \"despite some public statements, we are nowhere near 85% finished,\" a direct rebuttal of claims made by David Kay, formerly the CIA's top adviser on Iraqi weapons. Since Mr Kay resigned two weeks ago, his statements that Saddam Hussein's purported weapons did not exist at the time of the US-led invasion have sparked an intense debate over the pre-war intelligence the Bush administration used to justify the war. Mr Tenet agreed with Mr Kay's comments that the US did not have enough human spies in Iraq and he acknowledged that the CIA had not penetrated Saddam's inner circle. But \"a blanket indictment of our human intelligence around the world is dead wrong,\" he said. \"We have spent the past seven years rebuilding our clandestine services,\" Mr Tenet said, crediting CIA spies with the arrests of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the September 11 2001 attacks, and Asia's leading terror suspect, Hambali. The US defence secretary, Donald Rumsfeld, also defended US intelligence gathering at a Senate hearing yesterday. \"The reality is we have had some wonderful successes, and some of them not public,\" Mr Rumsfeld said. \"The failures are very visible, and that's always the case.\" President Bush and his aides have begun distancing themselves from their predictions that weapons of mass destruction would be found, but Mr Rumsfeld continued to insist that Iraq may have had them before US troops invaded, and that inspectors simply need more time to search for them."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
