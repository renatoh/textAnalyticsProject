The movie stars James Franco as a male gigolo who wants to break away from his madame mother, played by Brenda Blethyn. Variety reports that the movie cost $5m and received its premiere at the Deauville Film Festival. \"We know that we are somewhat of an underdog, but we are so proud of this film and of the work the cast and everyone involved has put into the project,\" said Cage, whose mysterious usage of the Royal \"we\" remains unresolved. Cage, who won an Oscar in 1996 for his performance in Leaving Las Vegas, will next be seen playing twin brothers in the Spike Jonze comedy, Adaptation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
