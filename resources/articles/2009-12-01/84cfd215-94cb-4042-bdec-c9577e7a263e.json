In a meeting between the Iranian ambassador and the Foreign Office's top civil servant, Britain stressed the urgent need for Iran to allow consular access to the men, who were seized after reportedly straying into Iranian waters on their way to an international yacht race. Oliver Smith, 31, the yacht's skipper from Southampton, Oliver Young, 21, from Plymouth, Sam Usher, 26, from Scarborough and Luke Porter, 21, from Weston-super-Mare, all experienced yachtsmen, were en route to join the Dubai-Muscat offshore sailing race when, it seems, they inadvertently crossed into Iran's territorial waters near the small island of Sirri. With them is David Bloomer, a Bahrain-based radio sports presenter in his 60s thought to have dual British and Irish nationality. Iran's reluctance to give a full explanation of the circumstances under which it detained the men, or to reveal where it was holding them, was raised as a matter of urgency at the meeting between the Iranian ambassador and Peter Ricketts, permanent under-secretary at the Foreign Office. An FO spokesman said the message at yesterday's meeting was: \"Since it was now almost a week since the yachtsmen were held, the delay in providing a full explanation of what had happened and clarity on Iranian intentions were a matter of increasing concern.\" As delicate diplomatic negotiations continue, the foreign secretary, David Miliband, spoke personally to the Iranian foreign affairs minister yesterday evening. Throughout the day Miliband kept his comments low-key, saying it was a \"consular matter\". The yachtsmen had \"no malicious intent\", he said. \"This is a human story. It's got nothing to do with politics. It's got nothing to do with nuclear enrichment programmes.\" It had \"no relationship to any of the other, bigger issues\". In a statement released through the semi-official Fars news agency, Esfandiar Rahim-Mashaie, President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's head of staff, said the fate of the five was now with the courts. \"The judiciary will decide about the five \u2026 naturally our measures will be hard and serious if we find out they had evil intentions\". Ahmadinejad, who made a televised address last night, failed to mention the captive sailors in the first 80 minutes of a rambling discourse in which he railed against the west and defended Iran's nuclear programme. But he gave a clear sign that relations between London and Tehran were at a new low by accusing Britain, along with Israel, of sabotaging a deal intended to resolve the dispute over Iran's nuclear programme. The deal, worked out in Geneva in October, would have seen Iran export uranium fuel to France and Russia for further enrichment. \"We are sure that the UK was against the Geneva talks. The Zionist regime and the UK were the major players \u2013 they pushed the panic button,\" he said. News of the crew's detention last Wednesday became public on Monday, one day after the announcement of Iran's plans to build 10 new uranium enrichment plants in breach of UN resolutions. The fear is the fate of the five could be jeopardised by the bigger political picture. Families, who have had brief mobile phone conversations with the men, stressed they were all highly experienced sailors. Charles Porter, father of Luke, said: \"We are extremely worried about Luke and his friends, but looking at similar incidents, we believe they will be released.\" The men were unable to tell relatives where they were being held, but the Foreign Office believes it could be on Sirri, a military installation site. Unconfirmed reports suggested their yacht Kingdom of Bahrain suffered propeller problems and could have been drifting for up to 10 hours as they waited for a tow. The UK's former ambassador to Iran, Sir Richard Dalton, warned not to expect an overnight resolution. \"There is quite a long way to go, I believe,\" he said. Iranians were extremely sensitive over their territorial waters, he added. \"Iran is very, very prickly and it regards illegal entry to its waters or lands as a crime which is prosecutable. So their comments are bound to reflect that situation,\" said Dalton, ambassador from 2002 until 2006. \"Add to that the fact that Britain's military forces \u2013 and, Iranians believe, espionage guys \u2013 are active, and that Iran thinks it has a regional terrorist problem in which Britain and the US are involved.\" The Kingdom of Bahrain yacht is owned by the Sail Bahrain project, which aims to promote the island as a yachting destination and was recently launched by Team Pindar, owned by GA Pindar &amp; Son, a family-owned publishing business based in Scarborough, North Yorkshire. Andrew Pindar, chairman of Sail Bahrain and owner of the boat, said the crew \"appeared to be in good spirits\" and he hoped they would be reunited with their families soon. In March 2007 eight Royal Navy sailors and seven Marines were held for 13 days after being detained in the mouth of the Shatt al-Arab waterway that separates Iran and Iraq. In June 2004 eight military personnel and three boats were seized, again in the Shatt al-Arab, delivering boats for the Iraqi river service. They were shown blindfold on Iranian TV before being released. But three young Americans, who allegedly strayed into Iran from Iraq after accidentally crossing the border whilst hiking, are still being detained and face spying charges."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
