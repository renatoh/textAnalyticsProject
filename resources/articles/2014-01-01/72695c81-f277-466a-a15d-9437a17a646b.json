Opener Back to the Flood spurts into life like a shaken bottle, or indeed a bursting dam \u2013 its whirling little guitar figure eddying around and around atop a glorious swell of chords and synths. This great initial deluge gushes on through the rabidly catchy, organ-led Falling Down the Stairs, then subsides a little for a run of calmer, floatier songs, every one rippling with hooks: Bulldozer Love is all big, warm waves; Even the Score a bubble-blowing lullaby with an acid twist. Siblings Daniel and Sarah Spencer's oddly sweet vocals are a treat, too \u2013 not exactly off-key, but not quite on it either. Yet another great Australian underground album, so full of colour and character."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
