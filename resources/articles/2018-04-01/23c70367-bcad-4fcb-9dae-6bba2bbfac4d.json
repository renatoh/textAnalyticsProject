It is believed that Berahino has also been fined over the incident on Easter Monday, when Stoke\u2019s under\u201123s played Aston Villa, and there are now major doubts as to whether Paul Lambert will include the forward in his match-day squad for the visit of Spurs. It is understood that the 24-year-old trained with Stoke\u2019s younger players on Thursday. Lambert, Stoke\u2019s manager, has been determined to impose a stricter regime to try to raise standards at the club. Berahino, who was signed from West Bromwich Albion for \u00a312m in January last year, is understood to have been reprimanded previously for poor time\u2011keeping, along with several other first\u2011team players, as part of the manager\u2019s crackdown. Although Lambert has talked highly of Berahino\u2019s ability and called on him five times from the bench since taking over as manager from Mark Hughes in January this year, the Scot has also given the impression that he has been left deeply frustrated with him at times. As well as questioning fitness levels, Lambert has spoken about the need for Berahino \u201cto do the right things off the pitch\u201d and said that the player needs to \u201chelp himself\u201d. With Stoke second from bottom in the Premier League table and three points from safety, they could do with Berahino rediscovering the sort of form that led to his being called into the England squad in 2014 and prompted Spurs to try to sign him at the start of the following season. Berahino, however, is yet to get off the mark at Stoke and has not scored since February 2016."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
