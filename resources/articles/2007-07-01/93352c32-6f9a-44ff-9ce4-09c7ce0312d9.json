At various times, Margaret Thatcher's and Tony Blair's cabinets had seven, including the PMs themselves. Gordon Brown's has eight. Three of the eight have Scottish qualifications - Alistair Darling, Douglas Alexander and Des Browne. The others are Jack Straw, Harriet Harman, Geoff Hoon, Hazel Blears and John Hutton. Mr Hutton is the only one apparently not to have practised; he was a senior law lecturer. The appointment of Lord Lester to advise on the possibility of creating a written British constitution is intriguing. Last time Lester was a special adviser to a minister - Roy Jenkins, 1974-76 - he became the behind-the-scenes architect of race relations and sex equality legislation. I suspect that was child's play compared with the task of sculpting an entire constitution. This is a tale of two very clever barristers, who worked in the same chambers, called Fountain Court, and earned a lot of money. But then Tony Blair became prime minister and made both of them lords and gave them very important jobs with much less money. And now they're both unemployed - but here's where their paths diverge. Because Peter Goldsmith, who was attorney general, can go back to the bar and make a lot of money again, but Charlie Falconer was lord chancellor and he's not allowed to be a barrister again, and people are asking: what will he do now? I haven't mentioned racehorses with legal names recently, mainly because there hasn't been all that much to boast about. But the drought may be over. Last week we had no fewer than two winners out of three runners. Lawyer To World won at Brighton at odds of 7-2, and at Wolverhampton, more surprisingly, Lawyers Choice, owned by divorce solicitor Raymond Tooth, was victorious for the first time, at 16-1. They were not high-class races, but who cares when counting the banknotes? I also had hopes of Legal Lover, who also ran last week and had won his previous race, but he disappointed. Legal Lover and Lawyer To World are descendants of Law Society, who, at his peak, made those of us with the foresight to bet on him very rich. In case you hadn't noticed, the recent French Derby was won by Lawman. What a sad story appeal judge Sir Nicholas Wilson told to the Association of Lawyers for Children the other day. Before he was promoted Sir Nicholas was a family court judge who conducted large numbers of adoption proceedings. \"On the way into court on the day of the hearing I would go to Queensway, buy a chocolate cake and a pink candle and get the patissier to pipe on to it, 'Melanie gets Adopted'.\" He would have a little party for the adoptee, sometimes even buying a present for the child. Eventually Sir Nicholas put down his adoption cake expenditure on his tax return, whereupon Her Majesty's Inspector - himself an adoptee - congratulated him on his initiative and then told him firmly that his outlay was not tax deductible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
