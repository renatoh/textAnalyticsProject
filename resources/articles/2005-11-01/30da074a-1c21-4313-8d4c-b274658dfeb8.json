Richard Olivier's Marvin Gaye: Transit Ostend, a documentary made of Gaye's time there shows him soberly revelling in the incongruity of his surroundings, staring out over the grey waters as if they were an aquatic mirror of his melancholy, strolling along the King Albert I promenade where he took an apartment, singing the Lord's Prayer inside a church, even visiting a fisherman's bar (long since torn down) and attempting to play darts with the locals. Gaye talked of Ostend in terms of a retreat, a penance - two years earlier, he had attempted suicide by cocaine overdose in Hawaii. In Ostend, however, he professed to be living a cleaner, even monastic life, purging his past sins with plenty of jogging, sea air and even forsaking sex. However, the documentary has the feel of an extended, real-life video with Gaye posing, to himself and to the world, as a lonely soul in exile. Truth is, he was in dispute with record label Motown, who'd released an album of his, In Our Lifetime, without his consent, and looking to regroup, detox and orchestrate a comeback. He'd been persuaded to visit Ostend by one Freddy Cousaert, who'd previously enticed Muhammad Ali on a promotional tour of Belgium. His interest in Marvin smacks of negrophiliac trophy-hunting - his goal was to promote a Gaye concert at Ostend's Casino Kursaal. But he was also concerned for the singer's welfare and genuinely hurt when, in 1982, having secured a deal with CBS for his new album (which contained Sexual Healing, written during his supposedly non-sexual healing Ostend sojourn) Gaye returned to Los Angeles. Ostend is hardly as mundane and austere as it's presented in Gaye mythology. Indeed, its history is as turbulent and varied as Gaye's own, having been besieged by the Dutch and the Spanish among others. A monument along the seafront shows an Ostender, back arched in defiance, staring out to sea at would-be foes. Shame he wasn't looking back over his shoulder towards Germany. Once, Ostend was as absurdly pretty as nearby Bruges, but as a strategic seaport, the Nazis flattened it during the second world war. A few vestiges of art deco remain dotted about the city, such as the Hotel Du Parc bar. During its \"belle \u00e9poque\", when it was frequented by Kings Leopold I and II, who went paddling there, bourgeois holidaymakers flocked to bathe in proximity to the monarch. These revellers were depicted with disgust by Ostend's greatest painter James Ensor (1860-1949) as masked, hypocritical grotesques. His house in Vlaanderenstraat is now a museum to his work. Gaye identified with Ensor, who was embittered at his lack of due recognition. But whereas Ensor's anger was all on the surface, Gaye seethed invisibly beneath his exterior panache. Gaye is filmed walking along an apparently deserted seafront. In fact, Ostend is a remarkably busy and pleasant tourist spot all the year round. The King Albert I Promenade is replete with children and adults on the city's traditional four-seater go-carts, with claques of wheat-beer-and-mussels-loving coach-party Brits on jolly boys' outings, their little colonies of beer cans along the beach evidence of their frolics. The Casino Kursaal, scene of Gaye's concert triumph was rebuilt after the war and, with its elderly epauletted doormen and imposing exterior initially, looks forbidding, like some Ministry Of Compulsory Enthusiasm. However, it's impressive inside, having been recently restored with all its early 50s features intact. A bronze statue of Gaye at the piano commemorates his performance there. While Gaye went to Ostend in search of quietude, Ostend is currently strafed by a sequence of themed, noisy Irish bars along Langestraat. Yet you still feel Ostend is, as Gaye said, \"a beat back in tempo\", and, despite its funky underbelly, a place that, like so many European cities, looks like pop music never quite happened, where even Gaye could go about unrecognised. Barely 18 months after quitting Ostend, Gaye, stricken by cocaine-induced paranoia, tormented by the push and pull between his good faith and bad habits, was shot dead by his bible-bashing father, in a probable act of subconscious suicide. Although it's assumed he always intended to return to the fatal dazzle of LA, the truth is, he was in two minds - just weeks before leaving, he bought a 21-room manor outside the city. Ostend could have been his salvation. \u00b7 The Stories Behind Every Song: Eminem - Cleaning Out My Closet and Jimi Hendrix - Voodoo Chile by David Stubbs are published by Carlton Books at \u00a314.99.
