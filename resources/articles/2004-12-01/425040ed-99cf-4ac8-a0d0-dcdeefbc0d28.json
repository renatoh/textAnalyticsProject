The possible punishment follows a warning that too many managers have crossed the line of fair comment this season. Wenger is not expected to attend the afternoon hearing at the Football Association's Soho Square headquarters, with Arsenal having prepared a detailed written defence. However, the Arsenal manager, who has denied the charge of improper conduct, could still face punishment in his absence after questioning Van Nistelrooy's honesty and conduct. This followed the controversial recent encounter at Old Trafford, with Wenger declaring afterwards that \"we all know him, he can only cheat people\" following the Dutchman's ugly foul on Ashley Cole, for which he received a three-game ban. Arsenal are not expected to use video evidence to support a claim that Van Nistelrooy cheated. But the League Managers' Association vice-chairman Frank Clark believes that Wenger may already have crossed the line of behaviour expected from a leading manager. Clark said: \"The FA has set down a code of conduct and managers are allowed to express an opinion as long as it doesn't become too personal. We all signed up to that code of conduct, with regard to not criticising our fellow members or players of other teams. Obviously somebody at the FA feels that Arsenal have gone too far.\" John Prescott's decision, meanwhile, to confirm a compulsory purchase order as part of the plan to build a new stadium for Arsenal is being challenged in the high court. The compulsory purchase is being contested by local businesses which Islington council plans to demolish to make way for housing associated with the stadium development at Ashburton Grove. The football club is not directly involved in the case. - PA"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
