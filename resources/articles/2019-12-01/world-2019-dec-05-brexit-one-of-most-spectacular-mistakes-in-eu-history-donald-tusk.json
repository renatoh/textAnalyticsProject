In his first interview since standing down as European council president last week, Tusk said Brexit was \u201cthe most painful and saddest experience\u201d of his five years in office, a tumultuous period marked by the Greek eurozone crisis, bitter rows over migration and the election of Donald Trump. He also criticised the French president, Emmanuel Macron, for branding Nato \u201cbrain-dead\u201d and refusing to open EU membership talks with North Macedonia and Albania. \u201cIf we want to treat Macron as a future leader for the whole of Europe, in a political sense, then for this we need a politician who feels more responsible for the EU as a whole and not only for France,\u201d Tusk said. The unabashed anglophile, who recently said he would \u201cin my heart always be a remainer\u201d, put himself at odds with other EU leaders by declaring it would still be better for both sides if Brexit did not happen. Many EU diplomats fear any second referendum leading to a remain result would mean festering divisions in the UK that would block the EU from making decisions \u2013 a view Tusk strongly rejected. \u201cThe only difference would be that they [the UK] will still be here. They will be divided anyway: 50/50,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s pure illusion [to think] that it is easier to build good relations with the UK when they are outside.\u201d He blamed the former prime minister David Cameron for the \u201cmistake\u201d of organising the referendum that \u201che had no chance to win\u201d. Tusk also revealed that when the two men spoke the morning after the vote, he still hoped the decision could be undone. \u201cI asked him: \u2018Is it a decision, is it an obligation to follow this result?\u2019\u201d When Cameron made plain it was, Tusk said he continued to hope. \u201cMy intention was to at least prolong the whole debate in Europe and also in the UK. With this, maybe [it was] a little bit naive [to] hope that it could be reversible.\u201d Tusk said he predicted the leave victory \u201ctwo or three months before the referendum\u201d when he visited friends in Bath, who told him they were torn over their decision. A former Solidarity activist who was briefly jailed by Poland\u2019s Soviet-controlled communist government, Tusk was the prime minister of Poland before he became European council president in 2014. In that role chairing EU summits, he found it painful to be \u201cmore a chairman than a leader\u201d and felt frustrated that he \u201crestrained\u201d himself from campaigning in the UK. He has been one of the EU\u2019s most outspoken leaders, a trait he shares with the French president. Tusk described Macron as \u201ca hope for the future of Europe\u201d and a true friend, but said he had problems with his \u201cvery new ideas and opinions\u201d. As well as Macron\u2019s comments on Nato, Tusk also objected to Macron\u2019s rapprochement towards Russia, saying he was \u201cdisoriented\u201d by this new narrative. The council president said he was really proud of having once been labelled \u201ca monomaniac\u201d about Russia by a Belgian newspaper. His term began soon after the EU agreed sanctions against Russia, following the annexation of Crimea and incursions into eastern Ukraine. \u201cIf we are not able to protect the Ukraine against Russian aggression it will not only be a problem for Ukraine but for Europe as a whole. My hope was that Emmanuel Macron would also be very consistent here.\u201d Tusk, who prides himself on his knowledge of European history, was also critical of Macron\u2019s refusal to open talks with North Macedonia and Albania. The French \u201cnon\u201d has plunged leaders in the region into despair, including North Macedonia\u2019s prime minister, Zoran Zaev, who faced down nationalists to end a long-running name dispute with Greece. \u201cI think it was just strategically and politically a huge mistake to say no \u2026 after so many efforts and sacrifices, especially in Skopje.\u201d He said Europe would be less secure as a result of the decision, echoing arguments in the region that uncertainty about a European future risked triggering instability. He compared Macron unfavourably to Angela Merkel, who has championed integration with six western Balkan nations. \u201cHer unique advantage was to be always ready to think about Europe as a whole. And [to be] ready to sacrifice some internal or national interest to protect Europe as a whole.\u201d But migration is still \u201cthe biggest problem\u201d the EU faces, as a result of historically large numbers seeking asylum or work in Europe. Tusk said it was \u201cpresently unsolvable\u201d, adding: \u201cThis new version of migration, the numbers, the determination of the people who want to come to Europe, it is something really new but also a permanent situation for the future.\u201d Tusk was speaking to the Guardian and six other European newspapers on the second day of his job as president of the European People\u2019s party (EPP), the centre-right bloc that includes the political forces of the German chancellor and Jean-Claude Juncker. One of his most urgent tasks will be to decide whether Viktor Orb\u00e1n\u2019s Fidesz party remains in the EPP. After years of foot dragging, EPP leaders set up an inquiry into the rule of law in Hungary, amid growing concern about pressure on independent media, restrictions on NGOs and Orb\u00e1n\u2019s use of the EU as \u201ca cash register\u201d to channel lucrative contracts to his friends and family. Tusk said he planned to issue a recommendation in February, after the inquiry team reported later this month. \u201cIt\u2019s for Orb\u00e1n to decide if wants to be part of this world of values or not,\u201d Tusk said. \u201cThis decision should not wait another two years.\u201d He said the biggest threat to the EU came from governments, such as Poland and Hungary, that \u201cdon\u2019t want to treat our values seriously\u201d while getting all the benefits of the EU. But he does not think Brussels should have more powers to tackle this problem: \u201cWithout goodwill we have no chance to survive,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this is also the beauty of the EU.\u201d He stressed the threat to liberal democracy was a bigger problem. Citing the 2016 US presidential race and the Brexit campaign, he said a new element in politics was \u201cthe unprecedented readiness to lie on almost everything \u2026 to treat a lie as a justifiable tool to win\u201d. He said this \u201cshameless\u201d behaviour would have disqualified politicians only 10 years ago. Asked by the Guardian to specify who he had in mind, Tusk replied: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be too spectacular in my first interview \u2026 I have enough problems in my own country with professional and pathological liars.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
