The announcement of Kylie\u2019s performance, in the \u201clegends\u201d slot at Glastonbury\u2019s biggest stage, came amid criticism of the festival for its lack of women in major headline slots. Janet Jackson played on the Pyramid stage on Saturday after the singer used photoshop to promote herself in a line-up poster. In March, Jackson tweeted the festival poster to her fans, but with the order of the acts altered to make it appear that she had top billing. The three headline acts on the festival\u2019s Pyramid stage this year are all men \u2013 Stormzy, the Killers and the Cure. Only three of the acts in the 12 headline slots on the festival\u2019s four main stages are female-led. Acts like Janet Jackson, Lauryn Hill, Miley Cyrus and Kylie are in less prominent slots. Since 2007, eight out of 10 headliners at Glastonbury (82%) have been all-male. Beyonc\u00e9 in 2011 and Adele in 2016 have been the only female soloists to headline. After the announcement of the Glastonbury lineup, singer songwriter KT Tunstall said: \u201cI have to say it\u2019s still a bit depressing looking at the lineups of festivals. Because it\u2019s been discussed \u2013 everyone knows it\u2019s an issue. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a big, bad white bloke going \u2018no women\u2019. I think it\u2019s a really deep systemic problem at all stages of music.\u201d Organiser Emily Eavis has committed to creating an equal gender balance of performers at the festival, after the Guardian revealed in 2015 that the lineup then was 86% male. \u201cWe are working towards 50/50,\u201d she said last week. \u201cSome years it\u2019s 60/40. It\u2019s a challenge we\u2019ve really taken on, and I\u2019m always totally conscious every day that the gender balance should be right.\u201d Eavis also told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Desert Island Discs that she was often the only woman in meetings with music moguls and that some male executives still insisted on speaking to her father, Michael Eavis, who co-created the festival at the family\u2019s Worthy Farm in Somerset. \u201cThe live music world has been so male-dominated,\u201d she said. \u201cI go to meetings with just tables of men. Some were great, and some just refuse to accept that they had to deal with me.\u201d As the heat raged on Saturday, a new tent at Glastonbury, the Parlay Parlour, hosted a panel of women to talk on the subject of \u201cOur Bodies, Our Rights\u201d. The space has been set up by the White Ribbon Alliance, as part of its global What Women Want Campaign, with the aim of being a space for women to discuss equality and politics. Speaking on the panel, the Labour MP Jess Phillips said that progress on gender equality was being reversed. \u201cWe are in a dangerous and critical area where the religious right in this country and the rightwing politics of this country will take us backwards,\u201d she said. \u201cOur politics are rubbish but our people are brilliant. We are some of the best, most brilliant people, and they can\u2019t take it if we don\u2019t let them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
