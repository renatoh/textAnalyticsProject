Colour: Green, blue, purple, orange and red. Cost: \u00a31,790. I think you might be missing a decimal point. Oh, not this argument again. Which argument? The old: \u201cLook, an expensive design house is selling clothes at an exclusionary price, it\u2019s an outrage!\u201d argument. Designer clothes exist to be sold at a price that only a few people can afford. That\u2019s the point of them. That wasn\u2019t going to be my point, actually. Oh really? Then go ahead. It\u2019s horrible. Pardon? It\u2019s just so ugly. Oh, right. Yes, it is a bit, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s so disgusting. It is! It looks like the sort of thing you\u2019d see a Gladiators contestant wearing in a training VT in 1993. It\u2019s what we used to call a shell suit. Is Gucci calling it a shell suit? It is! Look at what it says about it on its website: \u201cCrafted in lightweight nylon, the shell suit evolves from its late-80s and early-90s origins and is reimagined into contemporary designs.\u201d It doesn\u2019t look as though it has evolved very much to me. I know! It looks exactly like every shell suit I\u2019ve ever seen in my entire life. Gucci has gussied it up a bit on its website by styling the model with a tuxedo jacket over the top \u2013 but it is still ultimately identical to every shell suit that has ever existed. Actually, remind me again why shell suits are bad. Listen, I\u2019m old enough to have owned a shell suit when shell suits were first invented, and they were the worst. They looked like a migraine, they made you sound like a sentient crisp packet whenever you walked anywhere and their material made you sweat like a monster. Flammable, too. Yes! The original shell suits could be a genuine fire risk. They are impractical on multiple levels. Is there anything different about the 2019 shellsuit? Sort of. It seems that the key to pulling off a shell suit today is to elevate it by pairing it with some pristine shoes. Why are shoes so important? Because nice shoes are the dividing line between the shell suit\u2019s old role as a widely mocked lower-class signifier and its new role as an ironic, wildly expensive symbol of misattributed wealth. Ah, so this is about price after all. Of course it is. Do say: \u201cThe shell suit is back.\u201d Don\u2019t say: \u201cLet\u2019s all have a barbecue.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
