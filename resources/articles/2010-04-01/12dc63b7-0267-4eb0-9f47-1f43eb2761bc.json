You can mix it yourself, but so many components are involved that you'll probably be better off buying a good commercial variety. The brand I got didn't have any cinnamon in it, which I think is essential, so I just added some. This soup may sound a little challenging, but it is wonderfully comforting. You can reduce the spice by using less ras el hanout; the amount of rose water is also up to you (or, if you don't like it, just leave it out altogether). Serves four. 250g (1 large) carrot, peeled and cut into 2cm dice 3 tbsp olive oil \u00be tbsp ras el hanout \u00bd tsp ground cinnamon Salt 240g cooked chickpeas (dried or tinned) 1 medium onion, thinly sliced 15g finely chopped fresh ginger 600ml vegetable stock 200g watercress 100g spinach leaves, washed 2 tsp caster sugar 1 tsp rose water Greek yoghurt, to serve Heat the oven to 200C/390F/gas mark 6. Mix the carrot with a tablespoon of the oil, the ras el hanout, cinnamon and some salt, and spread flat in a roasting tin lined with baking parchment. Place in the oven, roast for 15 minutes, then add half the chickpeas, stir well and and cook for another 10 minutes, until the carrot is soft but still has some bite. Meanwhile, in a large saucepan over medium heat, saut\u00e9 the onion and ginger in the remaining oil for about 10 minutes, until soft and golden. Add the remaining chickpeas, stock, watercress, spinach, sugar and some salt, stir and bring to a boil. Cook for a minute or two, until the leaves wilt, then blitz in a food processor until smooth. Stir in the rose water, taste and add salt or more rose water as required. To serve, divide the soup into four bowls and top with the hot carrot and chickpea mix, and about two teaspoons of yoghurt per portion.
