Figures from Fidelity show that nearly one in three Isas bought directly from fund managers was an online purchase. Its own FundsNetwork grabbed a 5% share. Its rival supermarket Cofunds took a similar slice. Both are hoping for big business from Pep switching. FundsNetwork is available to the public; the competing Cofunds -owned by Gartmore, Jupiter, M &amp; G and Threadneedle - is limited to independent financial advisers. \"Online fund supermarkets let you mix funds managed by different companies within one easy to access account,\" says Jason Hollands of the independent financial adviser Best Invest. \"Like Tesco or Asda, you don't have to access them online, but the benefits are greater via the net - you pay using a Switch or Delta debit card.\" Internet users can get online valuations, and make fund switches as well as links to fund information. But online investing is still limited to Isas because of the money laundering rules which apply to sums greater than \u00a310,000. Each supermarket has strengths - FundsNetwork has a wider range while Cofunds is geared up to monthly savings schemes, albeit those with a higher than average \u00a3100 minimum. \"We offer both supermarkets and give 100% reinvestment of upfront commission,\" Mr Holland says. Fidelity's Ann Davis adds: \"These sales show private investors and independent financial advisers both feel more comfortable using the Internet to execute their tax free investments than in the past.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
