Kareena Arthy, the chief executive of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, informed the deputy prime minister of her decision on Thursday afternoon. It leaves the APVMA bereft of leadership in a tumultuous time for the agency, with 20 of 100 regulatory scientists having already abandoned the agency in recent months. A spokeswoman for the APVMA said she could not comment. It comes days after the Turnbull government\u2019s surprise announcement that it wants to decentralise as many government departments as possible, moving the positions of city-based public servants to Australia\u2019s regions in a dramatic reshaping of the bureaucracy. Fiona Nash, the minister for regional development, said on Wednesday government departments would soon be asked to justify why they thought they were unsuitable for decentralisation if they did not want to relocate. She called on corporate Australia to join the decentralisation drive, flagging it as a \u201clong-term project\u201d. She said rural, regional and remote Australians deserved the careers and flow-on benefits offered by departments as much as capital city Australians did. Joyce\u2019s office said it did not want to comment on Arthy\u2019s resignation. Joel Fitzgibbon, the shadow minister for agriculture, said Arthy\u2019s decision to leave the organisation was a \u201chuge blow\u201d to existing staff, Agvet companies, and farmers. \u201cMs Arthy is highly regarded and respected,\u201d he said. \u201cIndustry leaders will be fuming about this latest sad chapter in Barnaby Joyce\u2019s relocation pork barrel. \u201cMs Arthy\u2019s departure will further undermine confidence in the APVMA and will most likely see more managers, scientists and lawyers follow her lead. \u201cThe APVMA is crumbling before our eyes with financial costs of the relocation rising. It\u2019s past time the Prime Minister acted by stepping in,\u201d he said. Joyce has faced sustained criticism for forcing the APVMA to relocate to his electorate of New England in NSW, which he announced during the federal election. It provoked accusations of pork-barrelling, with the government\u2019s own cost-benefit analysis showing the move would cost taxpayers $25.6m. Joyce defended the move last month, following reports that public servants had been working out of McDonald\u2019s in Armidale because of a lack of suitable office facilities. On Thursday, Joyce said the government\u2019s broader decentralisation plan would help public servants find more affordable housing as they moved to regional areas. He dismissed the idea that the plan ought to be subject to a cost-benefit analysis, saying that shouldn\u2019t be the sole determinant of government decisions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
