When the opposing side's best batsman responds to Ryan Sidebottom's upheaval of the Kiwi middle order with 'I thought that was just great' - which was Stephen Fleming's response - we have a measure of the man who took it. Admittedly Fleming has been Sidebottom's county captain at Nottinghamshire for the past three years and unhesitatingly regards him as a 'great guy'. But no one in Hamilton would begrudge Sidebottom his moment of glory, if only because it resuscitated a moribund Test match. As Fleming kept saying after the fourth day's play - too frequently to be wholly convincing: 'It's great, that hat-trick has breathed life into a game that was meandering along. It's the best thing that could have happened and has given us our best chance of victory.' It had also given England a totally unexpected chance as well. Sidebottom himself was endearingly flabbergasted by it all. 'I suppose I'll remember that as long as I'm alive. I've never had a hat-trick before.' Of that he was certain, although he had not realised that he was, in fact, on a hat-trick when he delivered the first ball of New Zealand's second innings after dismissing Jeetan Patel and Chris Martin in consecutive deliveries on Thursday. What was going through his mind when he ran up to bowl at Jacob Oram, who was to become the third victim? 'Nothing much... though at one stage I didn't think he [umpire Daryl Harper] was going to put his finger up.' Harper had to oblige. Oram was plumb. Somewhere in the ground Arnie, Ryan's dad - proud Tyke, proud father and a one-cap wonder for England as well as a Manchester United centre-half - was celebrating. He has always kept out of the way as the best fathers tend to do. This match was the first time that Arnie had seen Ryan bowl in Test cricket. More expense for the ECB. They will have to pay for him to turn up now. Earlier in the match, Arnie had told radio listeners: 'Mr Fletcher always wanted bowlers who bowled over 85mph. He forgot to mention that they had to bowl at the stumps as well.' It now seems unfathomable that Sidebottom was ignored for so long by England. Long before the hat-trick, Sidebottom had established that he was comfortably England's best pace bowler in this match by a disturbingly large margin. His explanation of his feat - he became the third consecutive Yorkshireman to take a hat-trick for England following Matthew Hoggard in Barbados three years ago and Darren Gough in Sydney in 1994-5 - was prosaic. 'I got the ball to reverse and we caught well.' Caught well? Understatement of the day. In a match where England have often been lacklustre and purposeless with bat and ball, their catching has been stupendous. Paul Collingwood missed a half-chance on Saturday when he was bowling at Fleming, the solitary blemish. But there have been three catches that have had us gasping with astonishment, partly because of the identities of the perpetrators. Matthew Hoggard's boundary catch to dismiss Jamie How suggested that there was life in the old Hogg yet - there has been little evidence of that when he is bowling. Alastair Cook has been a revelation in the gully. Two diving efforts, to dismiss Fleming in the first innings, Matthew Sinclair in the second, were sublime. He has found a job for life. Meanwhile some difficult chances have been made to look routine by Collingwood and Andrew Strauss. Yet some astounding catches and a Sidebottom hat-trick can not mask England's shortcomings in this game. The senior bowlers are starting to look like OAPs. Both Hoggard and Steve Harmison have been off the pace and can no longer be ensured of a place in the team. Harmison, in particular, has been in the sights of the critics beyond the boundary. What they think may not be decisive. More worrying for the Durham 'paceman' is what his captain thinks and the signs are not good. On Saturday he was not invited to bowl until the 18th over of New Zealand's second innings. He delivered only 24 balls, which yielded 24 runs. When England were on the attack at the end of the day after Sidebottom's fireworks Vaughan turned to Hoggard, not Harmison. Nor does the batting inspire much confidence. It has meandered beyond tenacious towards insipid. In the 21st century it is almost unheard of for any side to bat 173 overs for 348 runs. Fleming, now regarded as a veteran guru, said he was 'incredibly surprised' at England's rate of progress. This was echoing the sentiments of Mahela Jayawardene at the end of the Sri Lanka series. The batsmen might argue that they always seem to be faced with overhauling massive totals this winter, which inevitably instils an element of caution. What is certain is that it is about time some centurians emerged. In that interminable England first innings the obvious man to escape criticism was Tim Ambrose. He also progressed sedately but this was his debut and a promising one it has been. Yet for an hour and a half in a hitherto sleepy Seddon Park all these reservations were swept away by the sudden intensity of the cricket. Monty Panesar, finally presented with some nervous, tentative batsmen, began to torment again, a fine foil for Sidebottom. As the catches stuck miraculously and the Kiwis contrived to lose six wickets for 20 runs, we suddenly had a game that was impossible to ignore."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
