I had my breakthrough fight last April [Froch's unforgettable late stoppage of Jermain Taylor] when the pound was at its weakest and ITV's share price dropped by half. ITV only showed the Taylor fight a day later. If it had been screened live the drama could've made me a household name. What can I do?\" Froch spreads his hands wide in another sign of acceptance. He now faces a far more serious and dangerous battle. On Saturday night, in Herning, a small town in the heart of Denmark, he will defend his WBC world title against Mikkel Kessler \u2013 who gave Joe Calzaghe the hardest test of his career. Froch is likely to become embroiled in an equally brutal contest. \"It's the same old story,\" he says. \"When I won the title against Jean Pascal it also won me fight of the year. I then won fight of the year in 2009, after I beat Taylor, and I was the British Board's boxer of the year. I'm doing nothing wrong.\" For the Cinderella Man, however, nothing is ever simple. He now even has to cope with the effects of volcanic ash after his weekend flight was cancelled. But a determined Froch remains \"99% certain\" the fight will proceed \u2013 after his camp spent much of yesterday arranging for a helicopter to fly him to Denmark this morning. Froch's bout against Kessler is part of the Super Six series of contests between the world's best super-middleweights, promoted by the American cable giant Showtime. Yet, in Britain, the fight will be screened on a little-known channel, Primetime. \"It's annoying that Amir Khan and David Haye are world champions and they get shown on Sky Box Office and I'm not,\" Froch murmurs. \"Sky say they don't have the budget and the schedules are full. But I still feel blessed.\" The 32-year-old smiles patiently when asked why he chooses such a quaint word to describe his enduring obscurity. \"I won my title against a top fighter, Pascal. I was then given the opportunity to go to America to fight Taylor and I snatched victory from the jaws of defeat. I'd been put down for the first time in my career, I was behind on points, away from home, and my new girlfriend [glamour model Rachael Cordingley] was at ringside. It was traumatic for her. But I stopped Taylor with just seconds left.\" Last October Froch also won a messier bout when eking out a points decision over another American, Andre Dirrell, in the first of his three group fights in the Super Six. If he beats Kessler he will almost certainly qualify for the final stages of the tournament and cement his previously low-key reputation as a deadly fighter. \"I'm not doing too bad. This multimillion-dollar deal with Showtime basically rescued my career. So that's why I'm not bitter. I'm also quite spiritual. It's questionable whether I believe in God or Jesus but I do believe in a spiritual world and some kind of afterlife. I believe my grandma is watching over me and I draw strength from that. I get that from my mum. She watches those programmes on Living TV. She thinks there're ghosts floating around. I say, 'Mum, it's not real' but she loves it. She'd do a seance tomorrow if she could.\" Froch laughs loudly, only breaking off to snub any suggestion that he might still be haunted by Calzaghe. For years he failed to persuade a mocking Calzaghe to fight him. The unbeaten Welshman eventually moved up to light-heavyweight and faced American veterans like Bernard Hopkins and Roy Jones Jr \u2013 rather than a hungry Froch. \"He took the easy option,\" Froch sneers. \"Calzaghe now says he's going to give Kessler tips on how to beat me. It's sad. He's out the circle and looking in, thinking, 'I'm not part of this any more.' It didn't work out with his girlfriend and he did that dancing show where he offered up his impression of rigor mortis. It was embarrassing. Calzaghe is desperate for good publicity and that's why he wants some new profile on the back of me. It's cringeworthy. Even if he wanted to come out of retirement he's too old and fat now.\" Yet in November 2007, on a fevered night in Cardiff, Calzaghe proved himself an imperious champion when he withstood Kessler's ferocious onslaught. He won a clear decision, and ended the Dane's long undefeated run, but Calzaghe was pushed to the limits of his considerable ability. Froch acknowledges that his own cause has been complicated by Kessler losing his first bout in the Super Six to the impressive Californian Andre Ward. \"This is his last chance so I'm getting the last burst of the very best Kessler. I'm fighting him in his backyard and most people regard me as the underdog. I relish that. He'll come hard for five or six rounds and have a real go. I'll have a go right back. The fight can't come soon enough for me.\" Froch's appetite for fighting is illuminated by his attitude towards pain. \"I broke my rib a week before Pascal and never thought of pulling out. Same against Taylor. I tore an ankle ligament three weeks before that fight. My toes went black and my foot was red and purple. But it's mind over matter. I've even fought with a broken hand, against Brian Magee.\" Leaning over to show how a bone still juts from his right hand Froch chuckles when remembering how, after the Magee fight, \"I had it pinned. Pins went through to the wrist and six weeks later they pulled them out \u2013 with no anaesthetic. They did it the old-fashioned way with pliers. I took a deep breath and thought, 'This is going to hurt, but the pain will go'.\" Why didn't he opt for any anaesthetic? \"I don't believe in drugs. When I had a knee reconstruction I woke up in horrific pain. My knee was on a machine that was meant to bend my leg straight and this nurse stood over me. She said: 'You've just had a major operation \u2013 have some morphine.' I said: 'Don't put that shit in my veins.'\" Froch's eyes are blazing. \"I eventually ripped the machine off my leg. It was just as well because the machine was broken and bending my leg past 45 degrees. If I'd been on morphine it would have kept bending my leg and ruptured the implant. I learnt a big lesson that day. \"But I probably read too much. I read a book called The Optimum Nutrition Bible by Patrick Holford. And now I don't go to the doctor \u2013 ever. Modern medicine is the biggest fucking \u2026 well, let's just say the politics of pills leads to a billion-pound industry. My girlfriend went to the doctor a few months ago with inflamed lymph nodes because she had a virus. Now your body drains the virus naturally and sometimes your glands swell. But the doctor gave her 500mg of antibiotics. I read up the side-effects of this drug. It damages your kidneys and attacks your immune system. It's like a mild form of chemotherapy. I said: 'Try this instead.'\" Dr Froch grins when asked for his miracle cure. \"Two litres of water and 100mg of vitamin C every four hours. Vitamin C is a natural virus fighter and so fresh orange juice or a peeled orange does the trick. Rachael only had the bloody flu \u2013 and they wanted to give her antibiotics.\" Froch's loathing of antibiotics was sparked by doctors consistently misdiagnosing his allergy to dog hair. They presumed he had various chest infections and kept pumping him with antibiotics. When Froch finally worked out that his wheezing was caused by his dog he swore never to take another pill. \"I sought out alternative medicine and since then, touch wood, I've never been ill. My immune system is solid.\" What happened to his dog? \"My mum took him in but he's dead now, bless him. He was 18 and a yorkshire terrier \u2013 a proper angry little dog.\" Froch laughs, as he does when asked what Rachael makes of his medical approach. \"She's only 23 and you could see her thinking \u2013 'Is he a nutter or what?' But it's not just medicine. You go to your butcher and say, 'Where's that chicken from? Has it been locked in a cage, without any sunlight, eating crap? Or has it been running around a field like a chicken should?' We're guinea pigs at the moment \u2013 eating genetically modified food. But it's organic all the way for me and Rachael.\" Froch has also instigated what the tabloids still call \"a nookie ban\", by insisting he and Rachael abstain from sex before a fight. \"I do a sex ban, yeah. Probably a month \u2013 or even more. You don't let a male horse mate before a race for a reason. Women weaken the legs. But for me it's not a sacrifice \u2013 and I say that bearing in mind Rachael was Miss Maxim a couple of years ago. She's a model and a beautiful girl. But boxing is too important. My life's on the line.\" On Saturday night, in the depths of battle against Kessler, Froch will draw on those reserves of energy. It can only be hoped that another victory will haul a singular fighter out of the shadows so that he might entertain millions more with his stories about alternative medicine and economic meltdown, about Miss Maxim and her Cinderella Man, as well as the pain and glory of the ring. \"That's the plan, mate,\" Froch grins as he rubs his battered nose. \"And it's a pretty good one.\" Froch v Kessler is on Primetime (Sky Channel 480 and Virgin On Demand) on Saturday night"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
