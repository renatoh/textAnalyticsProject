The French state weather forecaster, M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France, said the temperature in Gallargues-le-Montueux in the Gard d\u00e9partement hit 45.9C at 4.20pm on Friday. The previous 2003 record of 44.1C was beaten twice before on Friday: first when the southeastern town of Carpentras reached 44.3C, then hours later when Villevieille, in Provence, hit 45.1C. \u201cThis is historic,\u201d a M\u00e9t\u00e9o-France meteorologist, Etienne Kapikian, said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time a temperature in excess of 45C has ever been recorded in France.\u201d In Germany, the national DWD weather service said overall June temperatures were more than four degrees higher than historic averages for the month and 0.4C higher than the 2003 June average, the warmest since records began in 1881. The World Meteorological Organisation in Geneva said 2019 was now firmly on course to be among the world\u2019s hottest ever years and that 2015-2019 would then become the hottest five-year period on record. While it was too soon to definitely attribute the Europe\u2019s current blistering heatwave, which began on Monday, to climate change, it was \u201cabsolutely consistent\u201d with extremes linked to the impact of greenhouse gas emissions, the UN agency said. \u201cHeatwaves will become more intense, they will become more drawn out, they will become more extreme, they will start earlier and they will finish later,\u201d the WMO spokeswoman, Clare Nullis, told journalists. The French president, Emmanuel Macron, said extreme weather would become more frequent as a result of global warming. \u201cWe will need to change our set-up, our way of working, build differently,\u201d he said, stressing a necessary \u201cadaptation of society and its habits\u201d. Four administrative d\u00e9partements in France \u2013 Vaucluse, Gard, H\u00e9rault and Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne \u2013 were placed on red alert, signalling temperatures of \u201cdangerous intensity\u201d that are more typical of Saudi Arabia. About 4,000 schools were closed in France as head teachers warned they could not guarantee safe conditions, local authorities cancelled many end-of-school-year carnivals, and nursing homes equipped the elderly with hydration sensors. \u201cThis heat wave is exceptional by its intensity and how early it is,\u201d the prime minister, Edouard Philippe, said, defending authorities\u2019 efforts to avoid a repeat of the notorious 2003 heatwave which caused 15,000 premature deaths. \u201cI want to appeal to the sense of responsibility of citizens - there are avoidable deaths in every heatwave,\u201d Philippe said. \u201cMeasures have been taken for the most vulnerable people but given the intensity of the heat wave, it\u2019s the entire population who must be careful today ... both for oneself and for loved ones and neighbours.\u201d The French health minister, Agn\u00e8s Buzyn, warned people tempted to plunge into cold water to do so only in designated public bathing areas, adding that four people had drowned since the beginning of the week. A six-year-old child was also in life-threatening condition after being hit by water shooting from an illegally opened fire hydrant in the Paris suburb of Saint-Denis, French media reported. French families with elderly relatives who were ill or living alone were advised to call or visit them twice a day and take them to cool places, while the state-run rail operator SNCF offered free cancellations or exchanges on long-distance trips. The greater Paris region, Ile de France, had already banned more than half of cars from its roads in an effort to reduce air pollution and the cities of Lyon, Strasbourg and Marseille have also restricted traffic. With temperatures in parts of Spain expected to hit a new June record of 43C, the Spanish meteorological office issued red alerts in parts of Catalonia, Navarre and the Basque country. Hundreds of firefighters in Catalonia continued to battle to bring a large wildfire under control which has so far burned through 6,500 hectares of land and could consume as many as 20,000ha. A 17-year-old Spanish boy died from heatstroke in the early hours of Friday after having convulsions when he jumped into a swimming pool to cool down, while an 80-year-old man died on Thursday after collapsing from what is thought to have been heatstroke in the city of Valladolid. Italy put 16 cities under alerts for high temperatures, and civil security services distributed water to tourists visiting famed sites around Rome under a scorching sun and in Berlin, a police unit turned water cannon usually used against rioters on city trees to cool them down. As Germans attempted to cool off amid scorching temperatures, at least four people died in bathing accidents in different parts of the country on Wednesday. Parts of Britain were expected to experience high temperatures on Saturday, with a high of 32C forecast for London."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
