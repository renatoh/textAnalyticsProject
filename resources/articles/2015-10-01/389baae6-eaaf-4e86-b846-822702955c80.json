At a campaign stop in New Hampshire, Clinton said the federal government needs to take a \u201chard look\u201d at capital punishment, which she said has been \u201ctoo frequently applied\u201d in an \u201cindiscriminate way\u201d. \u201cI do not favor abolishing however, because I think there are certain egregious [cases] that still deserve the consideration of the death penalty,\u201d Clinton said in Manchester on Wednesday. Clinton qualified her support of the death penalty by explaining that it should be used only in \u201cvery limited and rare\u201d circumstances. \u201cWe have a lot of evidence now that the death penalty has been too frequently applied and very, unfortunately, often times in a discriminatory way,\u201d Clinton said. Her remarks on the death penalty, though cautiously phrased, amount to a rare foray by Clinton into a subject that she has generally sidestepped. In 1976, as a young lawyer in Arkansas, she was part of a team that successfully fought to keep an intellectually disabled person, Henry Giles, from the death chamber. Her passionate stance against execution in that case contrasted strongly with that of her husband Bill Clinton, who boosted his tough-on-crime credentials in the 1992 presidential election by refusing to grant clemency to a condemned man, Rickey Ray Rector. Hillary Clinton\u2019s own views have been hard to pin down in recent years given her prolonged silence on the issue. In her bid for the New York seat in the US Senate in 2000, she said that she gave her \u201cunenthusiastic support\u201d to capital punishment \u2013 a hedged position similar to the one she expressed on Wednesday that did not please the liberal wing of the Democratic party. Clinton\u2019s latest comments come against the backdrop of a nationwide shortage of lethal injection drugs, the result of a European-led boycott, that has refreshed the debate over the death penalty and raised important constitutional questions about what constitutes \u201ccruel and unusual punishment\u201d. The scarcity of lethal drugs has forced states to scramble to obtain alternatives, leading several states to resort to using untested cocktails as a means of executing condemned prisoners. She also noted that several states are \u201cbeginning to pull back from either applying the death penalty or narrowing the scope of the cases where it can be applied\u201d. \u201cI think we have to be smarter and more careful about how we do it,\u201d Clinton said. Meanwhile, Clinton\u2019s rivals for the Democratic nomination for president are both opposed to the death penalty. Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, Clinton\u2019s closest challenger in the race, has said he is strongly opposed to the death penalty. In response to Clinton\u2019s remarks on Wednesday, Martin O\u2019Malley said capital punishment is \u201cfundamentally at odds with our values\u201d. \u201cThe death penalty is racially biased, ineffective deterrent to crime, and we must abolish it,\u201d said O\u2019Malley, who as governor of Maryland abolished the death penalty in the state in 2013. \u201cOur nation should not be in the company of Iran, Iraq, China, North Korea, Saudi Arabia and Yemen in carrying out the majority of public executions.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
