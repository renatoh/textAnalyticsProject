This piece, which examines the mysterious lure of the sea, consists of little more than two blokes and a blue tarpaulin, which they whisk back and forth to create a surprisingly evocative portable ocean. The duo, Stephen Fiehn and Tyler B Myers, state that their mission is to work \"slowly, in pursuit of beautiful moments\". They are not afraid of lapsing into longueurs \u2013 the hour-long piece seems to be made up of at least 50% contemplative silence \u2013 while what action there is shows such little sign of hurry that the pair, who wear identical ties, blazers and deadpan expressions, seem to replicate Gilbert and George's experiments in animate sculpture. It doesn't sound promising, yet it is conveyed with a charmingly naive charisma that keeps you attentive as to what they're going to do next, even if it isn't much. The programme doesn't make the men's identities clear, though the larger of the two has a tie and hair that tend towards the vertical, while his partner spends a fair amount of the evening perched on his shoulders pretending to be a cloud. Despite its bizarre fascination, you can't help but feel the piece lacks a something \u2013 a concrete reason for us all to be there, perhaps. I'm not sure it left me any the wiser why people are compelled to look out to sea, but I could stare at that piece of blue tarpaulin for hours. At the Green Room, Manchester (0161-6150500), tomorrow. Then touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
