Liverpool showed little of the verve they will need to achieve that in defeating Crystal Palace 2-1 on Saturday, a performance Klopp said owed much to the staccato preparation necessitated by the international break. The Champions League quarter-final first leg promises a different level of intensity and he believes the atmosphere inside Anfield will make for a gripping affair. \u201cIf I had the choice to watch a Champions League game on Wednesday I would watch this one,\u201d Klopp said, before stopping short of suggesting strategy will go out of the window between two sides whose default setting is to attack. \u201cI think it\u2019s really not \u2026 it is about tactics but there will be fire in the game, so that\u2019s cool. And it\u2019s at Anfield anyway, so a good atmosphere to watch.\u201d It would take something to outdo the fever that enveloped Liverpool\u2019s home in January, when they beat City 4-3 in perhaps the best match of this domestic season, but Klopp instantly referred to the 5-0 defeat at the Etihad Stadium four months previously \u2013 in which Liverpool capitulated after Sadio Man\u00e9\u2019s dismissal \u2013 when asked what he learned from their previous meetings. \u201cFinish the game with 11 \u2013 that\u2019d be cool,\u201d he said. \u201cNo, we know it\u2019s difficult. Did we think before the first game we\u2019d lose 5-0? Did we think before the second we\u2019d win 4-3? No, but do we know we have a chance? Yes. Actually that was clear before, but they are the favourites. \u201cAt specific moments we are on a similar level, but they did it much more consistently and that\u2019s why they have around 20 points [18 after Saturday\u2019s games] more. So I have no problem respecting them, but we all know in this game that it doesn\u2019t mean too much so if we see our chance \u2026\u201d Rather than leaving that condition hanging in the air he quickly stressed that Liverpool\u2019s task is \u201cunbelievably difficult\u201d. He does, at least, possess a player who makes the hardest jobs seem simple. Mohamed Salah\u2019s latest showstopper came six minutes from time against Palace, converting his 41st goal of the season for club and country consummately \u2013 perhaps making the difference between a struggle for the top four and a serene domestic run-in. Klopp was reminded of the injury-time penalty Salah scored for Egypt against the Republic of the Congo in October, which secured their World Cup qualification, and asked whether a moment of such extreme pressure had prompted the forward to take greater responsibility in Liverpool\u2019s colours. He did not go that far but suggested it was a watershed moment in Salah\u2019s career. \u201cIt\u2019s responsibility, of course, but nobody told him he had to score 30 goals otherwise we can\u2019t be successful, and now we don\u2019t tell him that if he doesn\u2019t score we can\u2019t win \u2013 it\u2019s not like this,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cThe penalty he scored [for Egypt], by the way, I nearly had a heart attack. We all have these game-changing moments in our lives and maybe that was one of them. If you deliver in a situation like this, what can happen to you then?\u201d Klopp and Salah will hope any further heroics are not undone by mishaps in Liverpool\u2019s own half. They were lucky to get away with two glaring Christian Benteke misses when the score was tied at 1-1 on Saturday and also looked brittle early on, Loris Karius saving brilliantly from Wilfried Zaha before conceding the penalty from which Luka Milivojevic put the home side ahead. \u201cA lot of our opponents, people think they defend better, but there are a lot of moments when [their] goalkeepers make spectacular saves and we usually don\u2019t have that \u2013 today we had it,\u201d Klopp said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
