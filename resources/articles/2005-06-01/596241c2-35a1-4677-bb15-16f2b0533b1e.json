The three-year-old was winning his fourth race of the season and O'Neill said: \"We've always had the Britannia at Royal Ascot in mind. He'll be entered in that off 74 with a 7lb penalty and he should get in off bottom weight - I hope. \"He loves his racing and he's in again on Sunday at Doncaster so we might take him there when I've looked at the Britannia.\" O'Neill was also on the mark in the seller at Yarmouth with Goodbye Girl and the trainer added: \"That's my first double and we didn't say goodbye to her, we kept her.\" Banba, who ran with some credit here last month, confirmed that promise with a comfortable victory in Ripon's Adler &amp; Allan Median Auction Maiden Stakes. The ex-Irish filly had finished fourth behind the runaway winner Dancer's Serenade on soft going on her British debut 16 days ago. Although she ran well that day she was more at home on a faster surface yesterday. Darren Williams got a dream run up the far rail to hit the front over a furlong out and draw away to score in style by two lengths from Foursquare Flyer. The winning trainer Karl Burke said: \"She's a lovely filly, a really nice filly. I was counting my money some way out. We knew from her home work she was smart and we might be having a pop at some black type at some stage.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
