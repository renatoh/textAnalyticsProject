At 23, he formed the record company Bad Boy Entertainment, signing hip-hop artists including Notorious BIG, and producing records for the likes of Mary J Blige, Usher, Jennifer Lopez and Aretha Franklin. He is the winner of three Grammy Awards. In 2001 he made his acting debut in the comedy film Made, and more recently he starred on Broadway in A Raisin In The Sun. His business interests include TV and film production, restaurants and fashion. He has two sons, three daughters and a stepson. When were you happiest? The births of my kids - incredible moments that I will always cherish. What is your greatest fear? I don't believe in fear - I live my life without regrets. Anything else would be unforgivable. What is the trait you most deplore in others? Lack of manners. What is your most treasured possession? Easy question - my kids. Where would you like to live? I love New York, it's always been my home. It has everything - music, fashion, entertainment, impressive buildings, huge parks, street cafes. And it's very international, with people from all over the world. I love the hustle of things. What would your super power be? To fly - I could get to places a lot more quickly. What makes you depressed? Nothing. I miss my kids sometimes and that can get me down when I've been away working, but then I wake up and recognise how incredibly lucky I am. Spending time being down is less time out there achieving and enjoying. What do you most dislike about your appearance? Nothing - presentation is important, so I make sure I always look my best. Who would play you in the film of your life? I would. I enjoy acting, and after A Raisin In The Sun, it's something I am looking to do more often. What is your guiltiest pleasure? C\u00eeroc vodka - but it's not really guilty, just a pleasure. What do you owe your parents? Everything. And I also owe everything to my grandmother - she helped raise me alongside my mother after my father passed away. What or who is the greatest love of your life? My kids, my family, my mother, father, grandmother, uncles - family is unconditional love. Is it better to give or to receive? Always to give. To receive means nothing. What is your favourite smell? My two new fragrances, Unforgivable and Unforgivable Black. Smell is incredibly important and sensual; it communicates who you are. Who would you invite to your dream dinner party? Notorious BIG, Martin Luther King, Muhammad Ali, David and Victoria Beckham, Marilyn Monroe ... too many to mention. It would be a big party. If you could edit your past, what would you change? You can't start changing things in your past. Everyone has challenges and lessons to learn - we wouldn't be who we are without them. I certainly wouldn't be who I am. How do you relax? I like to hang out with my family, play some sports. Go to St Tropez, if I can get away. What do you consider your greatest achievement? I am proud of everything I have done: my music, fragrances, record label, the Sean John fashion label, my acting and, of course, my kids. But I would have to say my proudest achievement, aside from being a father, is the incredible journey my career has taken me on. What keeps you awake at night? I don't sleep much - too much to do in one day. How would you like to be remembered? As a businessman, designer, producer, musician, actor, philanthropist, father, son, friend - and gentleman. What is the most important lesson life has taught you? Follow your dreams - you can do it if you want it badly enough, get out there and make it happen. Look at me, I am living proof. Where would you most like to be right now? London, of course!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
