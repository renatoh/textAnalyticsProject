The manner in which he made his debut for Wigan, becoming the first ever player to score five tries on his senior bow, instantly saw him regarded as one of the most gifted players of his generation. His career since backs that up. From the code-hopping excursion with the Barbarians in 2011 to the numerous major trophies won with the Warriors, at 29 he remains one of the most recognisable figures in the British game as he prepares for the Grand Final on Saturday. Victory for Wigan against Warrington at Old Trafford would secure a third Super League title for Tomkins before he embarks on a new challenge with Catalans Dragons \u2013 yet there was a time when he could not have foreseen such success. Players of his kind, the ones who emerge every few decades, are tipped for the top from a very young age. His journey, however, could not have been more different \u2013 thanks largely to one of the other high\u2011profile departures from Wigan after the match on Saturday: the head coach, Shaun Wane. Wane was the academy coach before stepping up to first\u2011team level in 2011, and he oversaw the development of dozens of players, including Tomkins, although it almost worked out so differently. Asked to recount his first dealings with Wane, Tomkins says: \u201cI had to come to terms with the fact I wouldn\u2019t be play rugby for a living. Everyone got offered scholarships on three or four grand a year, but I wasn\u2019t in that group. They let me come in on a pay\u2011as-you-play basis. \u201cYou got \u00a325, which is brilliant if your car insurance is \u00a33,000 a year \u2026 But Shaun wouldn\u2019t pick me. I would ask him why I wasn\u2019t playing and he\u2019d blow my legs off with about 25 different reasons. I spat my dummy out when I got home and called him all sorts. It was difficult, but it stood me in good stead.\u201d Tomkins appeared sporadically for Wigan\u2019s academy thereafter, before a potentially career-defining moment for the full\u2011back. \u201cAt the end of the second year of academy Shaun told me I could leave if I wanted. I went on trial at Widnes and Salford and they offered me a bit of money \u2013 and there was nothing at Wigan \u2013 even the \u00a325 had gone. \u201cI went back amateur and played for Wigan St Patricks for six games. Widnes offered me \u00a33,000 and at the time I\u2019m thinking: \u2018I could get a car and insurance for that.\u2019 But my dad, Andrew, stopped me. He asked me if playing for Widnes is what I dreamed of doing, and I knew it wasn\u2019t. \u201cAt the time I was an apprentice greenkeeper at a golf course, getting up at 5am. \u201cBut an opportunity came up where I could train with the injured lads at Wigan, so I did that for a few weeks and then eventually got a few lucky breaks, stopped cutting grass and got a first\u2011team contract.\u201d More than 200 games across two spells later, Tomkins is facing up to the reality of Saturday being his final game for the club he worked so hard to join. His leaving for the National Rugby Leaguefour years ago was surprising enough but next year he will line up against Warriors for Catalans, making the Old Trafford game extra special for a self-confessed Wigan fanatic. \u201cI thought I\u2019d come back and probably finish my career at Wigan. But things change so quickly in sport. When I got that contract at 17 I thought I\u2019d never leave.\u201d It is that emotion of Wane, Tomkins and other names such as John Bateman leaving that is driving Wigan behind the scenes, as they bid for the perfect farewell with the club\u2019s 22nd league title, the fifth in the Super League era. \u201cThe bigger story is Shaun leaving,\u201d Tomkins adds. \u201cAs players we\u2019re happy he\u2019s taking that burden for us.\u201d When asked how his French is, he says \u201cshite\u201d and laughs. \u201cLeaving hasn\u2019t sunk in yet and probably won\u2019t until I\u2019m in France. Wigan is a family I\u2019ve been part of for a very long time. But I\u2019ve got four years with Catalans: what happens after that, who knows?\u201d Victory is being billed as the perfect curtain call for Tomkins\u2019s illustrious Wigan career \u2013 but they may not have seen the last of him yet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
