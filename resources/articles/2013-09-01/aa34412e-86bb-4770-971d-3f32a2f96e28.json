Alongside one of the finest martinis, made by the top bartenders in Portland, try a \"cheese plate\", a nostalgic assortment of treats. \u2022 20 Milk St, Portland, +1 207 774 4200, theregency.com. Average drink price $11 Novare Res Bier Cafe, Portland When owner Eric Michaud set out to assemble what is by far the best assortment of beer in New England, and possibly the country, he trusted his instincts, ignoring those who implored him to include generic crowd-pleasers. He found an old-school pub space with a large outdoor patio, and watched as throngs of beer geeks descended. I have been known to belly up to the bar and plunder astonishing quantities of sour beer, to the point where one of the bartenders dubbed me \"Gueuzer the Gueuzarian\". \u2022 4 Canal Plaza, Portland, +1 207 761 2437, novareresbiercafe.com. Average drink price $9 Great Lost Bear, Portland It's not often that I drink at an establishment I visited for lunch when I was 10 years old, with my grandmother, but The Bear is a Portland institution. Nobody will judge when you commandeer one of the Connect Four sets dotted around the bar and go to town on the beer list, with more than 70 brews on draught. There is also a huge food menu \u2013 try a platter of super nachos with chilli. \u2022 540 Forest Avenue, Portland, +1 207 772 0300, greatlostbear.com. Average drink price $7 The Snug, Portland You come to The Snug to do one thing only: drink. If you want food, go elsewhere. If you want to watch Red Sox game with your rowdy friends, definitely go elsewhere. If you want anything remotely \"gimmicky\", go elsewhere. This neighbourhood joint, at the base of Munjoy Hill, serves almost everything, from the prerequisites (Guinness and whisky) to pretty decent wine. And over the years, it continues to take on its character from those who frequent and from those who pour the drinks. \u2022 223 Congress St, Portland, +1 207 772 6839, thesnugpub.com. Average drink price $6 Natalie's at Camden Harbour Inn Sit at a bar crafted from the doors of an old French convent and let Seth Knowlton guide the way. Knowlton's creations, like the Elderflower Sour \u2013 made with Bulleit bourbon, St Germain elderflower, lemon and mint \u2013 go down very easily, and are ideal to sip while perusing one of the greatest wine lists in Maine. If I'm going to wear my nori-green Gucci boots in these parts, it's going to be here. \u2022 83 Bayview St, Camden, +1 207 236 7008, nataliesrestaurant.com. Average drink price $13 Newcastle Publick House After an extended visit to Oxbow Brewing in Newcastle, nothing hits the spot like a rack of oysters and a few beers across town, at the Publick House. Here you'll find traditional English pub decor and even \"English Nachos\" (starring smoky pulled pork). There's a great patio, too, and as it's not far from the Damariscotta river you could go for a cleansing swim later (just wait at least 30 minutes to digest). Note that the entrance is towards the back of the building, due to an old town ordinance prohibiting bars from being within a certain distance of churches. \u2022 52 Main St, Newcastle, +1 207 563 3434, newcastlepublickhouse.com. Average drink price $7 Easy Street Lounge, Hallowell This most remarkable basement bar, comes complete with opium-den-style lighting and a multitude of creepy paint-by-numbers portraits on the walls. The locals will tell you Hallowell is a \"drinking town with an antiques problem\", and after a long day scouting for baubles and trinkets there is nothing better than shooting pool and unwinding on a well-loved couch with a 64oz mai tai. If you decide to graze, don't miss the Smashed White Trash panini, loaded with bologna (aka baloney), cheese, pickles and lots of mayo. \u2022 7 Front St, Hallowell, +1 207 622 3360, no website. Average drink price $7 Three Tides, Belfast Home to Marshall Wharf Brewing Company, and offering all of their beers on draught, Three Tides embodies everything I love about Maine. I prefer to go in the colder months, when they light the chiminea outside and hammer down countless Pemaquid oysters on the deck overlooking the water (these are perfect with an Umlaut K\u00f6lsch beer). After happily chucking the \"dead soldiers\" on to a massive heap of oyster shells, you can play bocce (boules) overlooking the ocean, before capping off the evening with a glass of absinthe. Growlers (glass jugs of beer) are available to go in the adjoining tasting room. \u2022 40 Marshall Wharf, Belfast, +1 207 338 1707, 3tides.com. Average drink price $8 Old Vines wine bar and tapas, Kennebunk I avoid Kennebunkport at all costs in the summer, but as the leaves begin to turn I will see if the coast is clear for a visit to Old Vines, in neighbouring Kennebunk. Though there's a very strong cocktail menu, it's the wine list that draws me, and dishes such as broiled shrimp and spicy chorizo with garlic. The walls of this renovated barn are lined with old wine casks, and illuminated mostly by candlelight, making this a desirable location to hide away. \u2022 173 Port Road, Kennebunk, +1 207 967 2310, oldvineswinebar.com. Average drink price $10 Billy's Tavern, Thomaston They pour a great pint in this no-frills Irish bar with live music. There's also a nearly endless selection of superlative whiskies, and a reasonable selection of comfort foods. Worth a trip slightly off the beaten path when you're on the mid-coast; just be sure to make arrangements for transport home. \u2022 1 Starr St, Thomaston, +1 207 354 1177, billystavern.com. Average drink price $8 Joe Ricchio is a freelance writer and host of the web series Off The Wagon. He documents his nights out regularly on foodcoma.me, and has contributed to Bon App\u00e9tit and Maine Magazine. \u2022 For more information on holidays in the USA go to DiscoverAmerica.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
