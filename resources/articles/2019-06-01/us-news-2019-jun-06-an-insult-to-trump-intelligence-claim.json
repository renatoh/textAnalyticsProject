What a rare treat to read an alternative account that more closely reflects a world recognisable to many of us (Ageing and raging, G2, 4 June). Les Bright Exeter, Devon \u2022 So Matt Hancock thinks a one-nation Tory trying to appeal to the centre ground does that by making appalling and clearly defamatory remarks about the leader of the opposition (Hancock tells Tories only he can halt \u2018antisemitic\u2019 Corbyn\u2019s march to No 10, 6 June).

Alan Knight St Antony\u2019s College, Oxford \u2022 There is certainly some truth in the notion that people often have similar careers to others born on the same day (Letters, 5 June). Both Brian Ferneyhough and I are quite well-known composers of contemporary music and we were born on 16 January 1943. Gavin Bryars Billesdon, Leicestershire \u2022 Is there a support group for those of us, born 14 June, who share a birthday with Donald Trump (Letters, 6 June)?
