The news will come as a massive blow to Mark Hughes and Sir Bobby Robson. The Newcastle manager and his board must now consider spending on a replacement forward in January's transfer window. Barcelona confirmed yesterday that Newcastle had spoken to them over the weekend about Patrick Kluivert's possible availability at the Nou Camp. \"Newcastle came here to invite us to play in a pre-season tournament and, while they were here, they asked us about Kluivert's situation,\" said the Barca president Joan Laporta. \"We didn't give them permission to speak to him. Kluivert is a top-class striker and right now we're short of goals. I want to speak with Patrick to see how he feels and what it is he wants. Depending on what he tells me, we'll see whether it's better for him to go or stay.\" It is thought Kluivert would prefer Arsenal as a destination. Newcastle's quick action - the chairman Freddy Shepherd flew to Barcelona rather than watch Newcastle's 1-0 win at Middlesbrough - may have been prompted by the realisation that surgery was again needed by Bellamy. The operation, required on persistent patella tendinitis, would, according to Bellamy, who turned 24 in July, be the sixth of his career. The operation will be performed by Richard Steadman, who also operated on Bellamy's right knee last year. Steadman's initial diagnosis was optimistic. Bellamy has suffered various knee complaints since his emergence as a teenager at Norwich City. Two seasons ago Bellamy was injured at a key time in Newcastle's challenge for the Premiership, Sir Alex Ferguson saying that he thought Newcastle would have won had Bellamy stayed fit. Newcastle's hope is that Bellamy will be able to participate in the run-in to the Tyneside club's season. But it will be too late for Wales. \"I'm 24 years of age and it can't keep going with these operations because I've had five already,\" said Bellamy three weeks ago. \"The way I see it is, I am due a break.\" Bellamy was not the only player Newcastle arrived in London without last night as they prepared to meet Fulham at Craven Cottage tonight. Kieron Dyer is missing after collecting a hamstring injury at Middlesbrough and Nolberto Solano's future at St James' Park is in doubt after he stormed off before Saturday's game after being told that he was not in the team. \"We'll have further talks when I return from London,\" said Robson of Solano. \"That's all I want to say.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
