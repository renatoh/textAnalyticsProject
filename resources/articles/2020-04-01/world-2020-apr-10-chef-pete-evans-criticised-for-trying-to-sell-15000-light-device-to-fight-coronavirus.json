Evans, a television host and paleo diet enthusiast who has previously promoted anti-vaccination ideas, was selling the BioCharger NG Subtle Energy Platform \u2013 dismissed by the Australian Medical Association as a \u201cfancy light machine\u201d \u2013 for $14,990 on his website. Evans\u2019 ad said the machine was a \u201csubtle energy revitalisation platform\u201d. \u201cFour transmitted energies stimulate and invigorate the entire body to optimise and improve potential health, wellness, and athletic performance,\u201d the ad says. In a livestream video, Evans, judge on Channel Seven\u2019s My Kitchen Rules, said the BioCharger \u201cis a pretty amazing tool that will take you down some a rabbit holes and it will take me an hour or two to explain it\u201d. He said the machine had \u201ca thousand different recipes and a couple on there for Wuhan coronavirus\u201d. Covid-19 has so far infected more than 1.6 million people globally and killed 95,000. It has ground economies to a halt all over the world and has the potential to force hundreds of millions into poverty. There is no evidence that it can be treated or cured by coloured lights. Evans has since pulled the advertisement down. The president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Dr Harry Nespolo told Guardian Australia that several months ago he had said Evans should \u201cleave vaccinations alone\u201d. \u201cWell, he should also steer well clear of peddling devices which he claims use \u2018subtle energy\u2019 to counter COVID-19. He just needs to stop it right now. \u201cIt is a reality that many people look up to Mr Evans in his roles as a popular chef and television host. I once again urge him to book an appointment with his local GP to learn about the damage he is doing on social media.\u201d The Australian Medical Association said of Evans: \u201cThis guy just doesn\u2019t get it. Pete Evans is trying to sell a $15,000 fancy light machine to vulnerable and frightened people to protect them against Covid-19. He is not a doctor. He is not a scientist. He is a chef.\u201d At the peak of last year\u2019s measles epidemic in Samoa, Evans posted a picture of himself with the anti-vaccine campaigner Robert F Kennedy Jr, citing the \u201cthe important work he is doing\u201d. Kennedy, son of Senator Robert Kennedy and nephew of the former US president John F Kennedy, is the founder of Children\u2019s Health Defence, which bankrolls anti-vaccination advertisements and misinformation on Facebook. In 2017 doctors felt compelled to condemn Evans\u2019s documentary The Magic Pill, which claimed that following his paleo diet guidelines for five weeks could drastically reduce symptoms of diabetes, cancer and autism. The AMA said Evans\u2019s claims were \u201csilly\u201d and \u201charmful\u201d. Guardian Australia has approached Evans for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
