He was particularly light on his feet when asked on Thursday if Vladimir Putin \u2013 the global villain du jour \u2013 had sent him supportive sentiments before challenging Britain\u2019s unbeaten four-belt world heavyweight champion. All in all, Povetkin was having no Russian away-day in Salisbury. \u201cOur president loves sport,\u201d he said. \u201cHe pays a lot of attention to sport. He pays a lot of attention to youth sport and he is an athlete himself [a karate black belt]. He\u2019s always training. I\u2019m sure he is going to watch the fight. The Russian Olympic team were invited over to the Kremlin [after the 2004 Games in Athens, where Povetkin won super-heavyweight gold] and he congratulated all of us.\u201d An accomplished kick-boxer before taking up boxing, Povetkin might also have added he once used to train alongside his president. With quiet dignity and good humour, Povetkin \u2013 who has beaten two doping bans \u2013 said of the international row building over Wada\u2019s decision on Thursday to lift the three-year sanction on Rusada: \u201cEven before the reinstatement announcement came into place I saw a lot of changes because the Russian anti-doping management system \u2026 At which point, the boxer\u2019s interpreter and his minder chipped in with a combined interpretation of an untangling distraction to the business at hand. \u201cThey request every day to know where the athletes are. And they test all the athletes over and over again. Alexander has been submitted to this testing on numerous occasions. \u201cTheir main purpose is to see that all the athletes in Russia, no matter what sport it is, are clean.\u201d So, as Winston Churchill might have observed, the situation was \u201ca riddle, wrapped in a mystery, inside an enigma\u201d. To many in boxing, Povetkin is just that. Inoffensive, polite and softly spoken, he has stopped and badly beaten up 24 of his 35 opponents after reluctantly turning professional in 2005, and has lost only to Wladimir Klitschko, on points in Moscow five years ago. The last time a British audience got to see him up close he knocked Liverpool\u2019s David Price unconscious on the undercard of Joshua\u2019s defence of his titles against Joseph Parker in Cardiff in March. He is 39, and it is reasonable to assume his career will not linger much longer, but he is eminently capable of derailing the Joshua journey towards showdowns with Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury. \u201cPerhaps there is more responsibility put on his shoulders,\u201d he said of Joshua, whom he admires. \u201cThere\u2019s a saying in Russia, you feel like the walls are crushing you in. Psychologically, I\u2019m very stable. I don\u2019t feel under any pressure. I\u2019m very calm and I think Anthony is the same. \u201cThere was a lot more pressure on me for the Klitschko fight because, when you\u2019re at home, the walls are even more closing in on you. So you do feel a lot of pressure \u2013 more then than I am feeling now.\u201d Povetkin jumps out of planes and helicopters in a parachute for relaxation \u2013 although he has given away his motorbike because he considers it too dangerous \u2013 and spends much of his time back in Chekhov \u2013 named after the Russian writer \u2013 \u201chelping the young people of Russia. We get them away from drugs, from alcohol, from tobacco. We get them into sports. Most important, we try to make gentle and intelligent people out of them.\u201d Povetkin has endured. He never wanted to be a professional fighter but here he is: an enigma of sorts, a puzzle for Joshua to solve on Saturday night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
