The England forward limped out of Sunday's damaging defeat at Fulham and into a casualty room that houses James Vaughan, Victor Anichebe and Tim Cahill, During the game, the manager, David Moyes, had to play the midfielder Leon Osman, and then the defender Joleon Lescott, alongside Yakubu Ayegbeni in attack as Everton chased the game. Johnson's injury was confirmed following scans on Monday afternoon and although the \u00a38.6m forward has not been ruled out of Saturday's league game with West Ham United - \"we'll do everything we can to get him fit before the weekend,\" said the head physio Mick Rathbone - the 27-year-old remains doubtful for the following weekend's Merseyside derby at Anfield. Johnson's absence could not have come at a worse time for Moyes who, having been knocked out of the Uefa Cup by Fiorentina three days before the defeat at Fulham, has been without the influential Cahill with hip and foot injuries for the past two games, lost Anichebe to a hip problem last Friday and is expected to be without the highly promising but injury-plagued Vaughan for the rest of the season following knee surgery. Anichebe, however, does have an outside chance of facing West Ham on Saturday evening. Everton's versatile defender Jack Rodwell, meanwhile, who made his league debut at Sunderland this month, has signed his first professional contract with the club. The 17-year-old has agreed a two-year deal with Everton, the maximum permitted for a player of his age."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
