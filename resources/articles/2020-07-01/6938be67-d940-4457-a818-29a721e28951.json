After the BBC picked up #HoodDocumentary in 2016, Enterprice followed in 2018, then a small role last year in Jamie Demetriou\u2019s consistently bonkers Stath Lets Flats on Channel 4, as an estate agent whose property boasted \u201cno doors, just ropes\u201d. Ewumi spoke rapturously this month about growing up on the likes of Hollyoaks and Doctors, as well as his love of Donald Glover\u2019s Atlanta, with its occasional \u201cwait, what?\u201d moments in which disbelief is not so much suspended as discarded. It is heartening, then, to see him continue to marry the kind of storylines that would not be out of place in soapland (kidnappings, burglaries, medical crises) with a dash of Glover-style surreality \u2013 as well as his own playful, heart-filled writing \u2013 in this second series of Enterprice. Now re-airing in the Fleabag slot after premiering on iPlayer earlier in the year, the series sees him reprise his role as Kazim, one half of the fledgling south London delivery service Speedi-Kazz. While Kazim is all about the hustle, his business partner, the former medical student Jeremiah (Trieve Blackwood-Cambridge), is more cautious, his mum remaining constantly and loudly disappointed by his decision to drop out of university. Think of it as akin to a young, black Only Fools and Horses \u2013 but weirder. In the first series, the pair were almost divided by their different backgrounds and varying approaches to business, but now they are back \u2013 and stronger than ever. Kazim suggests hiring an underling for their business (\u201cWe\u2019ll just pay them six wings and chips\u201d). After all, he is, as he tells two thoroughly uninterested girls on a double date with Jeremiah, merely \u201ctrying to get Mummy out the ends and put her in a Benz\u201d. When a waiter suggests he reconsider his choice of expensive wine, Kazim loudly accuses him of discrimination (\u201cUs black people, we like to bring each other down\u201d), before clocking the price and frantically searching for the cork. Jeremiah, meanwhile, is still pining for his ex, Layla (Thea Gajic), and, being a sentimental guy, paints her a portrait that looks like something a year 3 pupil might have created. It sets the tone for a series in which business and personal quandaries are constants. As in Atlanta, where invisible cars exist and Justin Bieber is black, there are many moments intended to make you go \u201cHuh?\u201d \u2013 not least an incident involving a fake doctor wandering into a hospital, which makes the NHS seem even more beleaguered than it already is. The addition of the brilliant Fatou Sohna as Simi, a schoolgirl who tricks the friends into abetting a burglary, leads to an intriguing plotline revolving around Hackney kingpin Mustafa (Dwane Walcott). Rather than painting the goings-on in the Fagin-esque gangster\u2019s world as cartoonishly sinister, Ewumi adds a touch of social commentary; the reason for Mustafa\u2019s control over his estate is shown to be the help he offers to local people, who give him money in the hope that he will gee up the Home Office to look into their immigration issues. In return, he orders his gang to look after them. With a light touch, Ewumi also considers the plight of office cleaning staff and their awful bosses. Social struggles aside, Enterprice is the kind of series you can\u2019t help but smile at; in a later episode, the pair make a song to promote their business, to the tune of Biggie Smalls\u2019s Juicy: \u201cIt was all a dream, Jeremiah and Kazim, we\u2019re the Speedi-Kazz team, we deliver the goods you need to your front door \u2026 but we don\u2019t deliver crack cocaine, no heroin, no crystal meth, no horse tranquillisers.\u201d The later addition of a Nigerian love interest for Kazim, Ire, also allows Ewumi to incorporate his own background further, in joyous fashion. And then, of course, there is that endearing strain of soapiness. Although the boys\u2019 business, love lives, stability, families and safety are all on the line at some point or another, with a string of highs and lows through these five episodes, one constant is their unbreakable bond. The final episode is titled The Mitchell Brothers, but this pair are far more lovely."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
