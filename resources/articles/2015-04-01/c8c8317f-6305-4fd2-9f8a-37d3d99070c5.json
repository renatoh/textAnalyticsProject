The pain of failing to qualify for the Masters a year ago is still raw enough for the Irishman to appreciate this return. \u201cIt\u2019s like going there for the first time,\u201d Harrington says. \u201cIt was a big miss last year. It\u2019s funny; all my family are going, while in other years it was: \u2018Ah, we\u2019ll wait and we\u2019ll go another year.\u2019 But obviously now that I\u2019ve missed one they\u2019re fearing this will be the last time they are going. It\u2019s good, though. It feels like I\u2019m a rookie.\u201d Harrington\u2019s Masters place was sealed by what was a widely welcomed \u2013 if perhaps surprise \u2013 victory at the Honda Classic in early March. He will compete in the Shell Houston Open from Thursday, the same venue at which he failed in a last-ditch bid to play in the 2014 Masters. Harrington has won three majors and recalls of last year: \u201cIt was tough. I watched it all at home and it wasn\u2019t nice. Because, you know, even when I was out of form I always thought I had a chance at any major so I was gutted to miss out on not so much the experience \u2013 amazing as it is at Augusta \u2013 but on the chance to win a Green Jacket. \u201cEvery player thinks that when they\u2019re in form it\u2019s going to keep going that way and they\u2019re never going to get older or anything like that. Hopefully I\u2019ll play well for a while now; that\u2019s always been my modus operandi over the years. I\u2019ve had peaks and troughs and you always try to keep the peak as long as you can. My wins tend to come together so hopefully I\u2019ll win a few more.\u201d During his quest to return from the golfing doldrums Harrington turned to the psychologist Steve Peters \u2013 an expert, that is, who is perhaps most famous for his unusual mind model book, The Chimp Paradox. \u201cI hadn\u2019t hit a golf shot in four or five years that I hadn\u2019t found something wrong with,\u201d Harrington says. \u201cEvery single shot, even if I\u2019d hit it stone dead. The trick is not to think anything about it. I turned myself into someone who analysed everything to the nth degree. I could write the book on the mental game. I\u2019ve spent 25 years of my life working hard on that side. \u201cI started working with Steve last summer and he really helped me out. I don\u2019t generally tell people about The Chimp Paradox. It\u2019s a hard one to explain, that one. I rather tell people about the subconscious and the conscious. My big mistake was that I read the book \u2013 as I read all the sports psychology books out there \u2013 and didn\u2019t think it applied to me. \u201cI assumed the chimp was very aggressive, loud, always jumping out there, the type of guy who throws clubs and loses his temper. Which isn\u2019t me. My chimp is a lot quieter, a lot more behind-the-scenes sort of guy but he needs serious quietening down and a lot of reassuring like everyone else. My chimp was definitely doing a lot of damage and still does. \u201cBut you accept it and get on with it and think that\u2019s just the way it is. I don\u2019t lose my temper. I don\u2019t show it. It\u2019s more deep-rooted. It never was a swing thing. It was a mental thing. I won my three majors because my focus was so good.\u201d Harrington, who won his first major at the 2007 Open, was the last player seeking to win a third major in succession when teeing up at the Masters in 2009, having won the Open and US PGA the previous year. Rory McIlroy is looking to achieve that very feat and complete a career grand slam this time around. \u201cI\u2019d have to say of the expectations they get more and more the more you win,\u201d says Harrington of McIlroy\u2019s biggest hurdle. \u201cAnd it\u2019s difficult. But Rory is in a good position where he likes that feeling of expectation on him. He\u2019s had it on him, to varying degrees, since he was a kid. \u201cAugusta\u2019s a tough course, though, and you don\u2019t want to have any fear or inhibitions on that course. You have got to play golf. you can\u2019t protect anything. \u201cIn many ways that is Rory\u2019s career, isn\u2019t it \u2013 what is he going to do in the majors? So it is a long wait between them, seven months. When I went for it I remember starting well but that\u2019s about it. I would have been realistic and told myself, \u2018Look, I want to win one of those but it doesn\u2019t have to be this week.\u2019 That\u2019d have been my attitude, trying to play it down a bit. It\u2019ll be the same this time as well.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
