Responses to Freedom of Information requests submitted to trusts by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) show that one in nine posts are now unfilled \u2013 double the level in 2013. The data obtained by the RCN also suggests that fewer care providers are now employing registered nurses, raising new fears over patient safety. Today the RCN\u2019s chief executive and general secretary, Janet Davies, will tell the college\u2019s annual conference that ministers are leaving themselves open to accusations that they are trying to deliver \u201cnursing on the cheap\u201d instead of funding a proper policy for recruiting and retaining registered and experienced staff. Research in all four countries of the United Kingdom, carried out by ComRes for the RCN, shows that four out of five NHS nursing directors are worried that their hospitals rely on the goodwill of staff to keep services running, while two out of three say the financial pressures of maintaining an adequate service are worsening. The RCN report also shows that nursing vacancies are increasing in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 health spokesman, Norman Lamb, who was a health minister in the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government after 2010, said the Tory policy of capping pay increases at 1% a year was \u201cdriving nurses out of the profession\u201d and putting patient safety at risk. The government\u2019s approach to Brexit was also adding to the recruitment difficulties, Lamb added. \u201cSome 7% of nurses and health visitors \u2013 22,000 \u2013 are other-EU nationals, many of whom are also leaving due to the government\u2019s failure to guarantee the right to remain of NHS nurses.\u201d The RCN will use its conference to demand the early introduction of legislation to guarantee safe staffing levels in hospitals. Davies will tell the conference on Sunday: \u201cA lethal cocktail of factors in the NHS has resulted in too few registered nurses and patient care is suffering. \u201cPressure and demand have spiralled upwards at the very moment nurses\u2019 pay [is] headed the other way. They stay behind after 12-hour shifts to give patients extra care and go home exhausted and sometimes in tears. Too many now feel no alternative but to leave nursing. \u201cThere is no certainty about the next generation of UK nurses joining either: they\u2019re deterred by low pay, pressure and new training costs, so the government desperately needs to keep the experienced ones we have. \u201cWhen finances are tight, nursing budgets are slashed and patients can pay the highest price. Hospitals are hiring unregistered staff and delegating jobs that should be done by trained nurses. The government cannot allow \u2018nursing on the cheap\u2019.\u201d The conference will also announce the results of a consultation among members about whether to move towards a ballot on strike action. NHS England declined to comment on the figures."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
