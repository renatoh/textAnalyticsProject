The 24-year-old was not in England\u2019s thinking earlier in the season and was some way from Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s first-team plans at Spurs, playing with the club\u2019s under-21s and resigning himself to a summer watching Euro 2016 rather than playing in it. A move to Newcastle United gave him a late opportunity to impress Roy Hodgson and, under Rafael Ben\u00edtez, Townsend flourished towards the end of the season. Of his difficulties at Spurs, he said: \u201cWhen you\u2019re going to Chester on a Monday night to play against Liverpool under-21s you don\u2019t see yourself making the England squad for the Euros six months later. I didn\u2019t foresee it but had enough faith in my ability to know that if I got the chance to play regularly I\u2019d get my form back. \u201cIt was no secret that I wasn\u2019t playing enough football and my confidence was low. I needed to get back playing week-in week-out. I knew if I got back to my best I could get in the England squad. On a personal level it\u2019s worked out but it\u2019s a shame I couldn\u2019t help Newcastle stay in the Premier League. \u201cThe lowest point was probably when I was playing for the under-21s and the boys were doing so well, winning games at the top of the Premier League. I wondered what would happen with my career so I was grateful that Newcastle paid a lot of money for me and helped me get things back on track. \u201cEven when I wasn\u2019t playing much at Spurs Roy Hodgson always had faith in me and put me in the squad, and nine times out of 10 I\u2019ve done well for him. Hopefully I can repay that faith in the friendlies and make sure I get in the [final, 23-man] squad.\u201d England begin their preparations for the Euros with a friendly against Turkey at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday, although the squad who have trained at St George\u2019s Park this week has been without players from Manchester United and Liverpool because of their FA Cup and Europa League commitments. Ben\u00edtez\u2019s future at Newcastle has yet to be resolved and Townsend, who hopes the Spaniard stays at St James\u2019 Park beyond the summer, said: \u201cHe\u2019s been great with me. When he walked through the door I was struggling with an injury but he said: \u2018I know you\u2019ve got an injury, I\u2019m not going to rush you, I\u2019m going to help you get back to your best.\u2019 In the last few weeks I\u2019ve been close to my best.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
