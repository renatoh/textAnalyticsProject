The culture secretary, Jeremy Wright, said he was minded to order regulators to look into the sale of 30% holdings in the two news outlets by their Russian owner, Evgeny Lebedev, on public interest grounds. A final decision will be made by the end of the month. The announcement, made in the final weeks of Theresa May\u2019s government, is potentially embarrassing for the Evening Standard\u2019s editor, George Osborne. Any block on the investment could be financially damaging to the London newspaper, which is struggling due to a collapse in the value of print advertising. The company has already announced a round of job cuts. The British government stated that it appears a bank controlled by the Saudi Arabian government now owns an indirect stake in both the Evening Standard and the Independent. The UK also raised concerns over a \u201csignificant level of material influence\u201d enjoyed by the new shareholders and that the ownership \u201cmay have an effect on the Evening Standard and the Independent\u2019s news agendas\u201d. The Evening Standard declined to comment, but told the UK government that the new shareholders and their appointed directors \u201cwill have no control over the appointment of the editor or editorial matters at the Evening Standard\u201d. Wright cited the national security section of the Enterprise Act 2002, which stipulates \u201cthe need for (a) accurate presentation of news; and (b) free expression of opinion\u201d in newspapers. \u201cIf I decide to issue an intervention notice, the next stage would be for Ofcom to assess and report to me on the public interest concerns and for the Competition and Markets Authority to assess and report to me on whether a relevant merger situation has been created and any impact this may have on competition,\u201d Wright said. Sultan Muhammad Abuljadayel, a Saudi banker, made an investment in the Independent in July 2017, although little is known of his personal involvement in the deal. At the end of last year, the Evening Standard\u2019s parent company, Lebedev Holdings, sold a stake to an offshore company registered in the Cayman Islands, which was later revealed to be controlled by Abuljadayel, who has ties to Saudi Arabia\u2019s state-owned Al Ahli bank. The Independent has launched a range of foreign-language websites run by a Saudi publisher that uses its name, raising concerns about editorial oversight given the Middle Eastern kingdom\u2019s poor record on press freedom."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
