The 19-year-old half-back crossed for five tries as Brian Noble's side brushed their National League opponents aside 106-8, a club-record defeat for the Cumbrians. For Tomkins and his family his stunning debut was the latest vindication of their decision to move to the town to aid the blossoming rugby careers of him and his two brothers. The eldest, Joel, has already made his own mark on the first team from the back row and the 15-year-old Logan, a hooker, is just beginning his professional career in the Warriors' academy. All three are now earmarked for big futures in the game, easing any unease that a Warrington-mad family may have had in making the short trip to Wigan. \"We moved to Wigan for rugby when I was about nine,\" Sam explained. \"Because me and Joel had got on the Wigan town teams we were coming to Wigan most nights from Chorley, so we decided to move here. It's starting to pay off now.\" Tomkins had grown up watching Warrington, with Jonathan Davis among his idols, but in moving close to the old Central Park he soon found new heroes in Andy Farrell and Kris Radlinski. It wasn't long before the two eldest boys were signed by Wigan and, with Joel having made his first-team debut as a teenager in 2005, Sam followed suit on Monday after a Test match on the other side of the world presented an opportunity. Wigan's first-choice scrum-half, Thomas Leuluai, was chosen to play in the Centenary Test for New Zealand against Australia and, though the Warriors initially tried to block it because of concerns over the travelling involved, the international federation intervened and ruled that Leuluai should be allowed to play. Noble then informed Tomkins last Wednesday that he would make his debut. \"I was thinking about it all week and struggling to sleep a bit,\" Tomkins said. \"But all the other players were a real help, talking to me about the game. \"I was worrying from about Wednesday but the closer it got the more confident I was. On the day of the game I thought I was ready for it. When I went over for the first try I was ecstatic; I'd have been happy with just that on my debut. But the forwards did really well in getting us down to the right end of the park and I was just trying to get on the outside of people like Gaz Hock and Sean O'Loughlin. With guys like that, eventually you'll get over the line. I got the hat-trick before I could think about it really, and luckily got on the end of a few passes.\" Debutants' delight Billy Boston Such was the interest in the capture of the Welshman from rugby union in 1953 that 8,500 saw him score twice on his debut in a reserve match for Wigan against Barrow Sonny Bill Williams The New Zealander made a stunning impact at 18 for Canterbury Bulldogs against Parramatta, scoring a try Alan Smith The winger, who went on to become Leeds' all-time third-top try scorer, crossed four times on his debut against Dewsbury in 1962"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
