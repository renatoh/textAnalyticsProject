I changed it from a team which was bottom of the league into a team that works harder. I got people in who are going to do that. Players like Wilson Palacios, they give everything and that's why we're doing a lot better.\" Redknapp introduced Pavlyuchenko as a 71st-minute substitute in the FA Cup fourth-round tie against Leeds United at White Hart Lane on Saturday, with the score at 1-1. He was immediately rewarded as Pavlyuchenko scored a fine goal, his second of a difficult season, in which he has featured only sporadically. The home crowd had welcomed Pavyluchenko warmly and they chorused his name, and, after his goal, they chanted it more loudly still. His popularity does not appear in doubt with them yet Redknapp was less enamoured and, after the tie had finished 2-2, he spelled out a few home truths. \"He [Pavlyuchenko] can start games, there's nothing to stop him from starting,\" Redknapp said. \"If he comes in every day to work, shows a good attitude and if he plays on Tuesday [against Fulham], then I expect him to run around, work hard for the team. If he does that, he's got terrific ability, then there's no reason why he can't be in the team. \"It's finding the ball. When you haven't got the ball, you have to work. You can't have a couple not working for you. It's finding that blend for you. There are exceptions to the work ethic but you have to put a shift in, and I'm not talking just about Pavlyuchenko. You can't have two strikers who won't work for you, who won't run the channels and track back when they lose the ball. \"That's what you need if you're going to be a successful team. Wayne Rooney does that, look at the shift he puts in every time he plays football. That's why Rooney is a great footballer. When he plays, he's special. He got four goals for Manchester United against Hull on Saturday and he probably covered more ground than anyone else on the pitch. He tackled everybody, worked hard, headed the ball and that's why he's so good.\" Pavlyuchenko has attracted interest from England and Russia, with Redknapp confirming last week that Zenit St Petersburg had \"been in\" for the 28-year-old. Spartak Moscow have also indicated that they would like to take him but Redknapp is beginning to think that no deal will be struck. \"I'd be surprised if Pavlyuchenko wasn't here at the end of January,\" he said. \"I think he's sure to be here. There's nothing happening, no one's spending any money. It's pretty quiet.\" Redknapp said that he would consider relieving Jermain Defoe of penalty-taking duties. Defoe missed against Leeds, having also missed an injury-time kick at Everton last month, which would have given Tottenham victory. \"I don't know if he's a great penalty taker, to be honest,\" said Redknapp. \"It's finding someone else who takes them. Pav takes good penalties. He's got to get in the team...\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
