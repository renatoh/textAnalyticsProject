In August the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age reported allegations of branch stacking and smear campaigns involving taxpayer-funded electorate staff in the offices of the Liberal MPs Sukkar and Kevin Andrews. That prompted Sukkar and Andrews, who denied the allegations, to refer themselves to the finance department to investigate whether there had been any misuse of their taxpayer-funded budget, a potential breach of parliamentary rules. The investigation found there was an insufficient basis to reach a finding of serious misuse of money or resources. It was outsourced to the major law firm Ashurst, where Sukkar worked for seven years. Sukkar\u2019s parliamentary biography says: \u201cPrior to entering the Parliament, Michael Sukkar spent seven years working as a lawyer with the firm, Ashurst Australia (then known as Blake Dawson Waldron) where he was a Senior Associate,\u201d the biography reads. \u201cIn this role, he advised many of Australia\u2019s most successful individuals and largest corporate groups. Before this role, he worked as a Senior Consultant with accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers where he specialised in taxation.\u201d The department and Ashurst both said steps had been taken to avoid any conflict of interest. The finance department said the reviewer was completely independent, had no link to Sukkar or his time in the then-Blake Dawson Waldron, and had acted \u201cin accordance with their ethical and professional duties as a legal practitioner\u201d. \u201cThe reviewer joined Ashurst in 2018 and has not had any prior contact or dealings on a professional or personal basis with Mr Sukkar outside the context of this review,\u201d a spokesman told Guardian Australia on Friday. \u201cMr Sukkar ceased working for Ashurst (then known as Blake Dawson Waldron) in 2013.\u201d Ashurst told the Guardian it took its responsibilities seriously and acted in accordance with the \u201chighest standards of ethics and conduct at all times\u201d. \u201cOur usual processes were followed in relation to identification of conflicts in advance of accepting instructions, and we are confident that there is no bias or conflict of any kind, personal or professional, on the part of the firm or any of the individuals who worked on this matter,\u201d the firm said in a statement, provided via the finance department. The contract to conduct the work was awarded via a panel arrangement, a form of government procurement that allows departments to handpick a contractor from an existing panel of suppliers. Firms must compete through open tender to get on procurement panels but can then be quickly picked for work relevant to the panel without further tender processes. The finance department said the terms and conditions of the panel \u2013 known as the legal services panel \u2013 and the commonwealth procurement rules both require firms to identify conflicts of interest and disclose them. \u201cThis was undertaken by Ashurst before they were engaged as an independent reviewer for each Review,\u201d the spokesman said. Guardian Australia approached Sukkar\u2019s office for comment but did not receive a response. A spokesman for Sukkar told the Sydney Morning Herald and the Age that the minister\u2019s employment was disclosed publicly on his personal website and on parliament\u2019s website. \u201cThe minister\u2019s employment with Ashurst prior to entering parliament has been publicly listed on the official Parliament House website and his personal website since his election,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
