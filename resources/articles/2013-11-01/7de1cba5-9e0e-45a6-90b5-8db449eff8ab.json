The treasure trove of art looted by the Nazis and found in a nondescript flat in Munich is now world news. Ever since the existence of the haul was revealed by Focus magazine on Sunday, the authorities in Augsburg have been playing catch up. They said yesterday that the accidental discovery of some 1,400 major works of art \u2013 including priceless works by Matisse, Picasso, Chagall and Renoir \u2013 occurred last year, not, as first reported, two years ago. Neverthless, there has been something ponderous and old-fashioned about the secrecy surrounding this discovery, considering how important it is. Some of these works are previously unknown. The works by Chagall and Otto Dix are major discoveries in their own right. And yet for a year the German authorities have kept quiet about them. It is hard to avoid the impression that Augsburg has been overwhelmed by the scale of what was found. Would it not have been better for customs officials who raided the flat to have made the announcement themselves, or were they embarrassed because it took them 17 months from the initial spot check at the border before they acted? And what of the whereabouts of the slippery, reclusive 80-year-old owner of the flat, Cornelius Gurlitt, who continues to be under investigation by the tax men? Secrecy may have allowed art historians to establish the provenance of some of these works. Some would have formed part of the art world's most notorious show, the Exhibition of Degenerate Art, which was put on in Munich in 1937. The permutations of the original appropriation of these works of art are endless \u2013 from straight theft, to blackmail, to forcing Jews looking to flee the Third Reich to sell their pictures at rock-bottom prices. Some came from state museums as well as private collectors. But given the complexity of the operation facing the Munich Customs Office, which now has custody of the art treasures, might not transparency and crowdsourcing have been more modern and effective tools? It could well be years before these art works are released from their new prison. Unravelling the intrigue of that Munich flat is only really starting, and basic questions remain. Was Gurlitt's father Hildebrand \u2013 a director of the prestigious Kunstverein Hamburg \u2013 a hero who saved \"degenerate\" works from the hands of the Nazis? Or did he collaborate with them and dabble in the trade they conducted? The art seized by the Nazis to \"cleanse\" Germany of impure art, and indeed the trophies seized by the advancing Red Army, are unfinished business. The latter are still capable of rocking relations between Russia and Germany, as Angela Merkel's last visit to St Peterburg showed. As far as is possible, the story of each work of art now has to be told."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
