In an interview in today's Times, the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, identified Iran as a \"centre of world terror\". Mr Sharon advocated a military strike against the country as soon as the US and Britain had completed their proposed attack on Iraq. \"Iran makes every effort to possess weapons of mass destruction, on the one hand, and ballistic missiles,\" he told the paper. \"That is a danger to the Middle East, to Israel, and a danger to Europe.\" But on hearing Mr Sharon's comments, Mr Straw told BBC radio: \"I profoundly disagree with him. I think the way to ensure proper progress with Iran is not by that kind of hostile threat, but by the process of constructive and critical engagement that we are involved in.\" Mr Straw has made three trips to Iran in the last 14 months to maintain diplomatic relations with elected leaders in Tehran. The British position contrasts with the stance of the US president, George Bush, who branded Iran part of an \"axis of evil\" alongside Iraq and North Korea. Mr Sharon's comments come as the US and Britain try to push a tough new resolution, allowing for military action against Iraq if weapons inspections fail, through the UN security council. He also suggested a possible escalation of an attack on Iraq. Unlike the 1991 Gulf War, when the US persuaded Israel not to launch a counter-attack as Iraqi Scud missiles hit Israeli cities, Mr Sharon hinted he would retaliate if Iraq fired chemical or biological weapons against Israel. Mr Straw was also forced to respond to criticism by the archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, of the government's support for a strike on Iraq. Mr Williams warned in an article in today's Telegraph that military action to force out the Iraqi president, Saddam Hussein, could \"rapidly and uncontrollably spiral down into chaos\". He said the conflict could lead to a nuclear war, and would turn Arab opinion against the British. Mr Straw told BBC radio that diplomatic efforts to have President Saddam allow weapons inspectors back into the country had to be backed up by a military threat. The US and Britain have refused to rule out acting without the backing of the UN. \"We have to maintain our options in the event, which I do not believe will happen, that the United Nations fails to meet its responsibilities to deal effectively with the defiance by Saddam Hussein of international law,\" Mr Straw said today. \"Our overwhelming preference, as is that of the United States, I am certain, is for there to be a new, tough resolution, or resolutions, before the United Nations so that this can be resolved within the immediate framework of the United Nations.\" Security council members China, France and Russia have all opposed a resolution that would give the US a military mandate before waiting to see whether weapons inspections work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
