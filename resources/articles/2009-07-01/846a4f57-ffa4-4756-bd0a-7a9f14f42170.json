Where they differ is how they deal with the practical problem of sometimes having, as one of Margaret Thatcher's cabinet secretaries memorably put it, to be \"economical with the truth\" in a crisis. Thatcher's admirers claim she only lied twice \u2013 large lies, since they involved the Westland scandal and the sinking of the Argentinian cruiser Belgrano \u2013 which is generous. But, unlike Harold Wilson, she had a reputation for plain speaking so got away with things. Early in his career, Wilson had been dogged by a mistake he owned up to, and resorted to verbal trickery to avoid repeating the experience. He remained terrified of being caught in a lie, old hands still recall. Less deft than Wilson, Gordon Brown retreats into statistical juggling and double-counting, even as he protests his Presbyterian integrity. \"I have always told the truth, I have always told people as it is,\" he told the BBC as he struggled to defuse Tory accusations that he has systematically misled voters about his public spending plans. There is nothing new in charge and counter-charge. As Disraeli once observed there are \"lies, damned lies and statistics\". As shadow chancellor in the mid-90s, Brown was brilliant at wrapping selective stats around John Major's neck, a habit he carried into the Treasury, initially with some success. Scarred by the tabloid destruction of Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair, buttressed by Alastair Campbell and Peter Mandelson, was equally ruthless, feeding a hostile media with slick stories to keep it on side after 1997, much to Major's indignance. Eventually the pack turned against them, something Labour's last prime minister but one, Jim Callaghan, could have told them. \"Don't lie, it always catches up with you,\" he told aides. \"Don't brief against cabinet colleagues either; if you're loyal they will be loyal back,\" Sunny Jim also told No 10 staff. Wise advice then and now. Blair's personal style was different. He rarely disparaged colleagues, though others did it for him. More than most prime ministers he first deceived himself, then deceived the voters, as Douglas Hurd once put it, over the Iraq intelligence debacle of 2002-03. Which is why most \"Liar Blair\" charges bounced off him. Blair believed Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction hidden in Iraq (he probably believes it still), so he was not saying something untrue, knowing it to be untrue. That kind of reasoning is why most liar controversies, including the one on spending, are futile. Politicians leave themselves wriggle room \u2013 like Bill Clinton's claim that he \"didn't inhale\" \u2013 and when that fails they can insist what they said was true at the time. Few come smoother than Lord Mandelson. Yesterday he spotted a weakness in George Osborne's latest complaint about Treasury bad faith and turned the tables, deflecting attention from his own retreat on Royal Mail privatisation as Brown fluffed his lines again over spending plans. In the age of 24/7 news channels, internet search engines and Twitter-based citizen journalism, some claim political lies can be instantly exposed. It happens, but voters seem to accept the distinction between a direct lie and being economical with the truth: that it is sometimes justified, in war or economic crisis, to withhold the full facts. The stakes are high. Politicians resent being held to higher standards than newspapers. But the expenses scandal has just taught them \u2013 again \u2013 that trust is a commodity which, once lost, cannot be regained."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
