Rodgers is one of the candidates being considered by Arsenal as they hunt for a replacement for Unai Emery but asked on Monday whether that meant he would not be interested in an offer from Arsenal, he replied: \u201cYeah, the message is clear and it has been and probably I\u2019ll get asked again until they appoint someone, but it\u2019s very simple. I\u2019m very happy here. \u201cI made a choice nine months ago to come here for a purpose. The purpose was very clear in that I wanted to help this club move forward and looking to lead it forward with a group I feel has huge potential. Why would I want to move from that? OK, I moved after nearly three years at Celtic and people may look at me thinking: \u2018Right, because a club like Arsenal, with the great institution and size, and all of that \u2026\u2019 But it\u2019s all about happiness and I couldn\u2019t be happier here. My contract is until 2022 and the club haven\u2019t said they want to release me from that.\u201d Rodgers has taken Leicester to second in the Premier League \u2013 a climb that has included six consecutive wins \u2013 and they are eight points behind the leaders, Liverpool. Sunday\u2019s late 2-1 victory against Everton at the King Power Stadium means that they are three points ahead of Manchester City in third and that they have a 12-point gap down to fifth-placed Tottenham in the hunt for a Champions League place. \u201cI have a contract until 2022 and thus far, and I know managers are losing their jobs, the club haven\u2019t indicated to me that they are going to sack me. I think they\u2019re pretty happy with how we\u2019re working,\u201d said Rodgers, whose side are at home to the bottom-club, Watford, on Wednesday. \u201cI\u2019m very happy, so I\u2019ve no need to look elsewhere. And I think logic would tell you \u2013 and I know that sometimes in your world it\u2019s not always logical, this gossip and speculation \u2013 but why would I want to leave Leicester City at this moment in time? I\u2019m working with a young group of players with so much potential, they want to improve and want to develop.\u201d Rodgers appeared to scoff at claims he had practically invited Arsenal to inquire about him when he confirmed in a television interview he has a clause in his contract allowing him to talk to any club willing to pay a potential release fee. \u201cI was asked a question on my contract, talking about clauses and stuff like that there,\u201d he said. \u201cI gave an honest answer, which was based around probably most managers have something in their contracts, and by all accounts that \u2018opened the door\u2019 for something. \u201cLogic looks at it and I repeat: I\u2019m very happy here. There\u2019s a lot for us to grow and develop over these next few seasons. \u201cWe\u2019re moving to a new training facility. I respect there will always be this speculation around jobs, and there\u2019s probably a number of other managers but for me, I repeat, I\u2019m happy here, very happy, and have great relations with all the people, and I feel I want to continue with that. Take from that what you want.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
