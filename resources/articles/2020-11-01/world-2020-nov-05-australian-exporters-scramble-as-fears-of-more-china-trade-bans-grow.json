Guardian Australia understands some Australian wine exporters have suspended shipments to China, based on requests from their Chinese import partners, amid fears officials in Beijing are about to press ahead with bans on a raft of goods. Lobster exporters have also been trying to clarify the hold-ups they have experienced since late last week. While the trade minister, Simon Birmingham, hit out at Beijing for sending \u201ccontinued uncertain and inconsistent messages\u201d, some Australian-based analysts argued the Chinese government was engaging in \u201cpsychological warfare\u201d by flagging vaguely defined potential sanctions that may or may not eventuate. The state-run Global Times published an article late on Wednesday saying Australia was nervous about losing access to the Chinese market after China \u201chalted seven categories of Australian goods from the market\u201d. The article did not provide new details but treated the development as fact, even though China\u2019s commerce ministry had earlier in the week dismissed \u201crumours\u201d of potential disruptions to Australian wine, lobster, sugar, coal, timber, barley and copper from Friday onwards. The apparent confirmation of looming trade actions coincides with the third China International Import Expo, which is being held in Shanghai this week. Xi, the Chinese president, reportedly told the opening ceremony he aimed \u201cto turn the China market into a market for the world, a market shared by all, and a market accessible to all\u201d in order to \u201cbring more positive energy to the global community\u201d. But Birmingham said the inconsistent messages from China about what was happening with Australian exports were \u201cheightening risks\u201d and also undermined \u201cthe statements made by President Xi\u201d at the import expo. \u201cIf China is to be true to the statements of its government then it should provide confidence that normal customs and related processes will apply to imports of goods such as seafood and wine,\u201d Birmingham said in a statement. Hours before Birmingham issued the strongly worded statement, Scott Morrison, the prime minister, told reporters: \u201cChina has denied that is what they are doing and I can only take that at face value out of respect for the comprehensive strategic partnership we have with China.\u201d Dr Jeffrey Wilson, a trade expert who is the research director of the Perth USAsia Centre at the University of Western Australia, said he believed China\u2019s tactics were a case of \u201cgrey-zone\u201d diplomacy. \u201cThe ambiguity is by design,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not a trade war, it\u2019s psychological war.\u201d Wilson said the uncertainty was \u201cprincipally designed to strike fear into a large number of Australian companies \u2026 that their shipments to China might not get cleared\u201d. China is Australia\u2019s number one trading partner, making up 33% of Australia\u2019s total exports. Sowing that fear, he said, would \u201cprovide additional ballast\u201d to those commentators who were pressing the Australian government to soften its stance towards China in an effort to \u201cfix\u201d the relationship. Wilson said the moves also sent a message to import partners who may be thinking of doing business with Australian exporters at the trade fair this week. Richard McGregor, a senior fellow at the Lowy Institute, said China wanted Australia to pay a price for their political disagreements, especially the call for the international inquiry into Covid-19. \u201cWhether or not the hard ban goes into place on Friday, Chinese importers of all sorts of goods have been sent an unmistakeable signal by the [Chinese] government, that it is pointless building business ties with Australia, because they can be interrupted overnight because of politics,\u201d McGregor said. \u201cSo even if business doesn\u2019t stop this week, it is going to come to a stop at some point, so why bother investing in the relationship.\u201d Guardian Australia understands wine exporters have still not had anything officially confirmed, but several have suspended shipments to China to avoid any risk at the border. This step was taken at the request of importers. However, one of Australia\u2019s biggest operators, Treasury Wine Estates, which makes Penfolds, is believed to have continued business as normal with China this week. Shares in Treasury Wines Estates fell by 8% on Thursday, after it informed the stock market it had become aware China\u2019s domestic drinks industry was lobbying Beijing to impose retrospective tariffs on Australian wine. That domestic request was associated with an ongoing anti-dumping investigation into Australian wine that was launched by China\u2019s commerce ministry in August and is scheduled to take up to 12 months to complete. Wilson questioned how it would even be possible for authorities to implement back-dated tariffs on products that had cleared customs, been sold and consumed. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest with you: I have a PhD in trade policy from the Australian National University and I\u2019ve never heard of retrospective tariffs in my life,\u201d he said. While Australian and Chinese officials continue to talk through diplomatic channels, Australian ministers have reported being unable to reach their Chinese counterparts for several months. Birmingham said earlier this week that this situation had not changed but the Australian government remained keen for dialogue. China\u2019s embassy in Australia has not commented directly on the potential new trade actions but has referred Guardian Australia to comments from the foreign ministry spokesperson on Tuesday \u201cthat the Chinese authorities take inspection and quarantine measures on imported products in accordance with laws and regulations\u201d. China\u2019s foreign ministry urged Australia to \u201cbring the bilateral relations back to the right track\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
