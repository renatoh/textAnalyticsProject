Chris Stokes, 30, from Littleborough, near Rochdale, Greater Manchester, was killed and five others injured when a gunman opened fired on their tour group in the capital, Amman, on Monday. A witness said the man pulled out a pistol and shouted: \"Allahu Akbar [God is great]\", before raking the group with gunfire. Two British women were wounded as well as three other tourists - from Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands. Mr Stokes, an accountant, had been four weeks into his trip to the Middle East and was due to travel on to Egypt. His brother Philip, 31, is a sergeant with the Territorial Army, serving in Iraq. The family has told Philip about his brother's death. Norma Stokes, 60, a retired primary schoolteacher, spoke of the moment when she was told of her son's death, saying she knew immediately there was something wrong when she returned to find police at her home.\"I didn't really know which one [of my boys] to think it was. In some ways we were more prepared for the fact it might have been Philip rather than Chris, although equally devastated whichever one,\" she said. Mr Stokes' father, Rod, 59, a computer programmer, said: \"He knew he was going to dangerous places. He knew the chance was there. He told us he was out of Turkey and Syria and that he was probably OK now. He was now in Jordan which he thought was the safest of the four places he was going to. He knew the dangers, he wasn't crazy, if you know what I mean. Just adventurous.\" He added: \"Ironically, we thought Jordan was the safest of the places that he was going to go to.\" Mr Stokes had not travelled abroad much until his mid-20s. His parents said he had worked long hours and he saved up his annual holiday entitlement for trips during the summer, when his services were not in such demand. They described their son as \"very down to earth, loyal and considerate\". He was a law graduate from Sheffield University who latterly had worked as an accountant in Dublin. Both his parents had attended Smithy Bridge Methodist church, near their home, where Mrs Stokes is a lay preacher. Mr Stokes said it was \"not an issue for me\" what the gunman had said before opening fire. \"I am certainly not angry about the nutcase who shot him,\" he added. \"It's just one of life's variables. We have got enough things to deal with without bothering with the person who shot him. That's totally destructive, negative and pointless.\" He said he had cried his heart out because he would not see his son again. Mrs Stokes added: \"He was a very loving and caring son. What this has done is made me more determined to make as much out of life as I have got, as I don't know what is around the corner.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
