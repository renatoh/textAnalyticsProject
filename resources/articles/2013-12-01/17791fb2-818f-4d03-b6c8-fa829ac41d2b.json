The main overnight problems are: Several thousand homes will be without electricity in the south east of England on Christmas Day. Hundreds of travellers face spending Christmas Day at Gatwick Airport after 36 flights were cancelled and power cuts and railway engineering works prevented them leaving. Towns and villages in the Mole Valley in Surrey face flooding overnight as the River Mole is expected to rise to record levels. Winds of up to 80 mph left 800 homes without electricity in the north of Scotland. Debbie Davies voices the frustration of many travellers stuck at Gatwick. According to the Environment Agency the River Mole has been at its highest ever recorded level. River level at Downside Bridge was 3.45 metres at 7.45pm. The typical river level range for this location is between 1.01 metres and 2.40 metres. The highest river level recorded at this location is 3.29 metres and the river level reached 3.14 metres on 14/12/2008. A spokesman for Gatwick Airport has contacted us to tell us that easyJet has recently cancelled some more flights which means there is a danger of some travellers being stuck at Gatwick. Train services are due to stop for planned engineering works and many of the local hotels are fully booked. There are 20 flights due in and 20 expected to leave, mostly from the south terminal. All flights except British Airway flights have been switched to the south terminal. We are doing everything we can to find a solution for those whose flights have been cancelled. We are ringing around to find any available beds in hotels and bed and breakfasts. Our priority is those who have greater needs but we do have camp beds if that is necessary. Here's an image of the problems people are facing at Gatwick's north terminal. I am seeing many tweets about chaos at Gatwick Airport's north terminal where there appears to have been a power cut and police are calming angry travellers. Amazing image from Worcester. Firefighters in Kent and Surrey have called off a five hour strike which was scheduled to begin at 7pm because of the danger of flooding in their counties. Firefighters elsewhere in Britain are now on strike in protest at changes to their pension schemes. According to PA, Network Rail said this evening that most passengers completed their journeys although the disruption to the network was worse than during last month's St Jude's storm. Robin Gisby, managing director of network operations, said: Our stations are quieter now with most passengers safely on their way home. We thank people for their patience as our engineers have battled extreme conditions over the past 24 hours clearing scores of line blockages and over 200 trees to restore services and get people on the move again and home for Christmas. We will continue to repair the damage caused by the storm, damage that has been even more extensive than that suffered during the St Jude's storm. After the storm, the calm. Jacquie Dunn greets the open road to Scotland. The waters of the River Mole are lapping at the car park walls of The Running Horse public house in Leatherhead but landlord Colin Turner is undeterred. We're wet but we are defying the odds with true British valour. We have been serving the emergency services with tea and mince pies all day and there is an ambulance in the car park, flashing its blue light which is adding to the Christmas ambience. We hope the waters will recede now but we will stay open all the same. The latest from PA is that the A303 in Somerset is closed in both directions near Yeovil between the A37/A372 at Podimore and the A3088 at Tintinhull due to flooding. The Highways Agency, Avon and Somerset Police and Somerset County Council are working to re-open the route as soon as it is safe to do so. Traffic travelling from Devon and Cornwall towards London is advised to use the M5 northbound and M4 eastbound,\" a Highways Agency spokesman said. Road users travelling from London and the South East are advised to use the M4 westbound and M5 southbound. I have just been speaking to Emma at the Met Office who tells me that the extreme conditions are easing all over the country. There are still showers which could fall as snow in Northern Ireland and Scotland in areas over 200m. There may also be some whiteness on Christmas Day in Wales and south west England. Emma also warned of isolated spots of ice in northern England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Leatherhead and the Mole Valley appear to be the worst affected area in the south east of England. Tim Hall, a Mole Valley district councillor told the Dorking and Leatherhead Advertiser: This the worst we\u2019ve had for at least a decade. It\u2019s just the sheer volume of water and it\u2019s going at some speed. The bridges are just about above the water level and you can see the logs and debris going past and the current is really fast. The whole area with the leisure centre and the football ground is all under water.A couple of flats in Minchin Close have been flooded. People had to be evacuated from there. The water level still seems to be rising.Everybody is working very hard. Everyone\u2019s neighbours have been very good, people have moved cars for each other. It was unexpected. We are just hoping for dry weather now. The motorist who died in a multiple-collision crash on the A30 near Bodmin in Cornwall on Sunday afternoon during a hailstorm has been named as Michael Gregson. PA reports. Gregson, 63, from the Truro area, died at the scene of the crash involving three vehicles on the eastbound carriageway. A further accident happened nearby when another three vehicles collided on the westbound carriageway but no one was injured. Sgt Olly Tayler, from Devon and Cornwall police, said: \"Both carriageways were closed due to the serious nature of the collision and the horrendous weather conditions. \"The investigation into what caused the collision continues but one line of inquiry is that there was an unexpected exceptional weather event that happened at the time of the collisions in the form of a hailstorm.\" The storms have so far claimed five lives, including three people who got into difficulty in fast-flowing rivers. \u2022 A man died on Tuesday after attempting to rescue his dog from the River Lemon in Devon. The 46-year-old man, whose family were shopping nearby, went into the water to try save his dog shortly after 11am. He was flown to hospital but later pronounced dead. \u2022 A woman died in a car crash in Shrewsbury in Shropshire at about 9.30pm on Monday night. \u2022 A man's body was pulled from the River Rothesay in Ambleside in Cumbria. The body of Simon Martindale, 48, from Lancaster, was recovered on Monday. He too had been attempting to rescue his dog. \u2022 A woman died in a river in Gwynedd, North Wales, after she was thought to have left her house to check on her water supply. Rescue teams were called to Nant Ffrancon near Bethesda at around 3.30pm on Monday following heavy rain. \u2022 A man died in a multiple-collision crash near Bodmin in Cornwall on Sunday night in a hail storm. Police have named the man who died on Monday in a fast-moving river in Cumbria as Simon Martindale. Martindale, 48, from Hest Bank in Lancaster, was swept away by the River Rothay, in Ambleside, after attempting to rescue his dog. His body was pulled from the water at 3.30pm yesterday following a huge search operation involving the RAF and mountain rescue. His dog managed to get out of the water. Cumbria police said this afternoon: \"Police are urging people to stay away from the water\u2019s edge and not to enter the local rivers or lakes as the water is fast moving and can be very dangerous.\" Desperately sad news from Newton Abbot, in Devon, where a man who jumped into the River Lemon to save his dog has died. Police said the 46-year-old man was swept away by the rain-swollen river after attemping to rescue his dog, which later escaped from the water. A spokesman for Devon &amp; Cornwall police said: The man is thought to have been trying to rescue his dog which had gone in to the fast-flowing water. The man was then swept away by the water and later spotted some distance downstream by police officers near to the Tucker Maltings site, near Brunel Industrial Estate. Two police officers managed to retrieve the man from the river and other officers arrived and CPR procedures were carried out until the air ambulance took him to the Royal Devon and Exeter Hospital, where he was pronnounced dead. The man\u2019s family, who were at the Asda store, are aware. The dog escaped from the water unharmed. Police are reminding members of the public not to enter fast-flowing water for any reason. The Environment Agency has just issued a severe flood warning \u2013 meaning there is a danger to life \u2013 in Leatherhead and Fetcham, in Surrey. The agency says: Severe flooding is expected in the area around Leatherhead. River levels are extremely high and are forecast to continue to rise through this afternoon and evening. Flood levels are likely to peak at around midnight tonight but flooding to properties and other infrastructure is likely to continue into Christmas Day morning. Our teams are on the ground clearing watercourses and we will continue to closely monitor situation. We are working closely with the emergency services and local authorities to assist anyone affected by the floods. Showers are likely to continue through Christmas Eve into Christmas Day but are unlikely to cause any additional impacts to current forecast levels. The river level situation should improve through tomorrow morning. Light aircraft and cars have fallen victim to severe flooding in Surrey, according to this video footage filmed from a helicopter. UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage is preparing to decamp to a local pub for Christmas lunch \u2013 a prospect he is perhaps not altogether unhappy about \u2013 after electricity supplies failed in his home village. Farage took to Twitter to complain about the blackout in the village of Downe, in Kent, writing: Farage later told BBC Radio 4's World At One: \"I know it's Christmas Eve and I hope that the lads that are out mending this all get paid a bit of overtime, but we would very much like to have our electricity back by Christmas Day. \"I know the Prime Minister talks about the voluntary side at Christmas and how it important it is in what he sees as the 'big society'. I'm asking for the professional society - the electricity companies to whom we pay an awful lot of money - to please get on with the job. \"I do understand that in the next village there is still power and there is a pub there, so it could well be that Christmas lunch plans change.\" Yet more despair at Gatwick airport. We've been sent this photograph that appears to show a man stood on a check-in desk remonstrating with airline staff. Another stranded traveller, Rhiannon Jones, has been in touch from Gatwick airport. Jones was supposed to fly to Belfast at 8.30am to spend Christmas with her partner Tom's parents \u2013 but the pair were still at the west Sussex airport at 1pm. She told us: There hasn't been any update in the last 3 hours from staff other than calling the flights required. Which is frustrating but there isn't much else we can do about it. They brought some bottled water out about 40 minutes ago. One family near us had their flight cancelled to Glasgow and we saw one lady collapse but everyone else just seems to be sitting it out. When we arrived I read on the easyjet app the was a power cut and there would be queues and delays. We were directed to a lettered area which was already packed out with around 3,000 people. There were no announcements for around 30 minutes then staff came out and had to shout what was going on. As a lot of people couldn't hear some moved closer then relayed the information. Initially they explained two of the sub rooms had been flooded and that had had cut power so no computers, baggage conveyors or screens were working and no one would be able to be checked in. Also to add they said there were 20 or so planes short that we're in other airports so they had to wait for these to return. They gave us no time frame on how long it would be. We then waited a further half an hour till 7:30 and there was another announcement saying they were sorry for delays and they were trying to come up with a plan and would update us after 8. So we're told the plan is for members of staff to shout for each individual flight and shuttle those passengers to the south terminal - check them in - then bus them back to north to get on their plane. Everyone has been in good spirits that I've seen, everyone feeling hopeful they'll get to their destination for Christmas. A stranded passenger at Gatwick, Deborah Oliver, 57, has been in touch with my colleague Carmen Fishwick. Deborah was meant to fly to Edinburgh this morning to see her 81-year-old parents in Kirkcaldy, but has just been told that her British Airways flight is cancelled. \"I've been here since 6.30am and you just want to get home for Christmas,\" she said. \"My flight was at 8.25am and we've just had so little information. We've not even been offered a cup of tea. It's just such a shame. You just think what the heck can I do. It's seeing my parents and it means a lot to see them at Christmas.\" Deborah described Gatwick's departure lounge as a scene of frustration and chaos as passengers wait around to see whether they will get home for Christmas Day. She added: \"It's absolutely packed in the departure lounge. It is really heaving. People sitting on the floor and standing around the notice board because they're not telling us very much. They're just saying wait in the lounge and you keep hoping for the best.\" Gatwick announced that from 1pm today all its departing flights would be leaving from its South Terminal. Paramedics are treating a man who was pulled from the swollen River Lemon in Newton Abbot, Devon. Devon and Cornwall police said it had received a number of 999 calls at around 11.15am from people who saw the man in difficulty in the fast-flowing water near to the Asda store. \"Emergency services managed to locate the man and he is currently being treated at the scene by paramedics,\" a spokeswoman for the force said. Network Rail has said that most of the network is running again but some lines are still affected by flooding, debris and power supply problems, particularly in the West Country, Press Association reports. NR added that more than 200 trees had come down on lines during the last 24 hours and there had been \"a further 100 major incidents discovered on top of that\". The company's network operations manager, Robin Gisby, said: \"Our attention will now turn to our extensive programme of engineering work over the holiday period. \"We will be assessing the extent to which this latest storm has put any of our deadlines at risk and together with the train operators we will be advising passengers accordingly.\" Despite the weather, the planned Christmas Day swim from Weymouth harbour is still going ahead. We just spoke to Mark Lockie, the organiser, who said he was expecting between 230 and 250 hardy souls to turn up for the annual dip, which last year raised \u00a38,000 for charity. Lockie told us: The sea will be 8 degrees, so chilly but not as bad as a couple of years ago when it was 5 degrees. It's in very protected waters, in the harbour, it's very rare it gets choppy. It looks like it will be fine for tomorrow and we talked it over with the harbour master last night and decided to go ahead. We did try one year to stop it because we had problems with sewage in the water and people still swam. The swimmers don't seem to mind, whatever the weather. A body has been found in a stream, police in Shropshire have said, taking the number of confirmed fatalities in the last 24 hours to four. The body was discovered by a dog walker in Horton, Telford, Shropshire, just before 9am this morning. West Mercia Police said the area in Horton Lane has been cordoned off and they are currently treating the death as unexplained. A force spokesman said: \"Police are investigating an unexplained death after a body was found in Telford by a member of the public this morning. \"The body was discovered in a stream in the Horton Lane area at around 9am today. There are police cordons in place in the area, which is popular with dog walkers. The inquiry is in its very early stages. \"It is not clear if the body is male or female.\" By late morning, 15 flights had been cancelled at Gatwick and some others were delayed. A Gatwick spokeswoman said: All North Terminal arriving flights are operating normally and all flights to and from South Terminal are unaffected. We are looking into the cause of the power outage. It's definitely weather-related. We are doing everything we can to get people away for Christmas and we understand passengers' frustrations. We have extra staff helping out in the terminals. Here's a flavour of the scene at Gatwick now : \u2022 A woman who died in a car crash in Shrewsbury in Shropshire at about 9.30pm last night \u2022 A man's body was pulled from the River Rothesay in Ambleside in Cumbria. The body of the 48-year-old, who is reported to be from Lancaster, was recovered on Monday. \u2022 A woman died in a river in Gwynedd, North Wales, after she was thought to have left her house to check on her water supply. Rescue teams were called to Nant Ffrancon near Bethesda at around 3.30pm on Monday following heavy rain. \u2022 Also, a man died in a multiple-collision crash near Bodmin in Cornwall on Sunday night before the storm began, amid a hail shower. \u2022 Five teenagers were injured after their car rolled over in Wolverhampton. Back to Gatwick Airport again, which is in the eye of the storm in terms of the sheer number of people affected by the travel chaos. Engineers are still on site attempting to tackle power outages in parts of the North Terminal has continued to cause check in delays. The South Terminal continues to operate as normal Getting there major problem. Southern Trains are currently operating a Gatwick to Victoria limited service while National Express has added extra coaches from London. On the continent, Brittany and Normandy were among the regions worst hit in France, while a teenager was killed and another seriously injured today when a wall in a building site collapsed in Normandy. Naval authorities said a Russian sailor was reported missing after being blown overboard a cargo ship off the coast of Brest. A spokesman for France's SNCF national rail service said there were numerous delays but that no rail lines had been put out of service by the storms so far. Henry McDonald reports that Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) has warned of possible power cuts on Christmas Eve as the storms may bring down power lines: NIE has said northern and eastern coastal areas and exposed high ground are likely to be particularly affected. The utility company opened all of its incident centres across Northern Ireland from early on Christmas Eve. On storms battering the province, the Met Office said: \"A spell of very strong winds will affect Northern Ireland through Tuesday morning. \"Gusts of 60-70mph are expected inland with 80mph gusts possible along the north coast and over high ground. \"Along with the winds there will be sleet and snow showers these mainly affecting County Londonderry and County Antrim.\" Stena and P&amp;O ferry services between Larne and Cairnryan in Scotland have also been suspended. Driving conditions are also atrocious with the Foyle Bridge in Derry closed to high vehicles and a 30mph restriction imposed on the bridge. In the Republic, the Met Eireann service has warned that winds will be even stronger than in the north with gusts of up to 100mph. Bad news now for those trying to get to Gatwick Airport from London. The Gatwick Express Twitter account tweets: It's a soggy Christmas Eve in many places after a night of heavy rain, while concern about rising river levels remains today. In Dorset, fire crews had to rescue 25 people trapped in their cars by flood water, while as many as 150,000 homes across the country were left without power. The Environment Agency currently has 157 flood warnings in place in England and Wales, along with 276 flood alerts. After severe disruption last night, ferry crossings are returning to normal, albeit with delays. The port of Dover had to close overnight due to the strong winds but reopened again at 7.30am, while ferry services between Scotland and Northern Ireland were seriously disrupted. It's not just at airports and on the rail network where movement has been grinding to a halt. Many major road routes were flooded overnight or blocked by fallen trees, with Kent, Hampshire, Surrey, Sussex and Cornwall among the affected counties. In London, the Metropolitan Police said this morning that they closed the A20 due to severe flooding. Police were called at 04.17 by motorists stuck on the A20 due to high water levels. The A20 is closed both directions between Green Lane and Frognal Corner. Motorists are advised to take alternative routes as the road will be closed for sometime. Here's a link to the latest information from the Traffic Agency. For all the problems on the ground in many places, the situation looks rather beautiful from above. Check out this image from European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), via Channel 4 Weather Presenter Liam Dutton: While the worst of the weather has passed, for now, in England and Wales, the Met Office has upgraded warnings of high winds in Scotland. Areas including the the north west Highlands, Argyll and Bute, Orkney and Shetland, as well as the Inner and Outer Hebides are now subject to Amber 'be prepared' weather warnings The Scottish Environment Protection Agency also has flood alerts and warnings in place in a number of areas. And below the line, here's a comment from Holland: Currently waiting at 'London Schipol' airport flowing diversion from Gatwick shortly after 1am for my easyjet flight from Milan. Christmas cheer in very short supply, missed approach was an utterly terrifying experience, followed by an hour of circling and then the decision to blast back across the channel as 'all other available diversion points are full'. To use the popular youthful parlance, fml. Spare a thought for those who've thought that they were off and running, but then ended up being stuck. Here's a person who was stuck on train at Taunton train overnight: If you're wondering about trains, here's a National Rail web page giving a breakdown (is that the right word?) of the situation on many lines. Its Twitter account is going to be picking up a few extra followers today also, I suspect, along with: \u2022 South West Trains \u2022 East Coast Trains \u2022 Virgin Trains \u2022 Southern Rail \u2022 First Great Western Here's the Gatwick Express: Tensions are running high at Gatwick airport after that power outage added to the travel misery of many - a situation not helped by the lack of a good cuppa, it seems. There's still no sign of the Gatwick Express train service (full disclosure: I'm hoping to get it later on myself) and many of those who arrived at the North Terminal for early morning flights found that they were going nowhere fast. The Press Association reports that the chaos was compounded by a lack of information and the closure of toilets, coffee shops, restaurants and other facilities due to the power cut, passengers complained. Graziella Vella, a six-months-pregnant make-up artist from Kilburn in north west London, was due to fly to Malta to spend Christmas with her family. The 37-year-old said: I am fuming and absolutely desperate - there has been no information at all and we can't make alternative plans. We're just hanging in limbo... at least if they said 'Nothing is going to happen, come back tomorrow', but there is no information of any kind. It is absolutely choc-a-bloc and in the check-in room upstairs there are 50 people queuing for the one toilet that is working. Ms Vella said that staff initially offered to take passengers to the South Terminal, which Gatwick said was operating normally. A Gatwick spokesman said: Due to the adverse weather overnight, Gatwick's North Terminal is currently experiencing significant power outages across some areas including check-in. This is causing delays to some departing flights. South Terminal is operating as normal. We are investigating the cause of this issue to ensure it is resolved as soon as possible and extra staff are on hand to assist passengers. We are also advising passengers to leave extra time for their travel today due to weather-related road and rail disruption. Here's the scene earlier, courtesy of one of those souls at the airport: The Energy Networks Association, which represents power companies across the UK, said 100,000 homes are without power, mainly in the south of England. Kent, Surrey and Sussex are the worst-affected areas. UK Power Networks, which delivers power to eight million customers across the south-east, east of England and London, said nearly 70,000 homes it supplies are without power: 28,530 in Kent; 17,230 in Surrey; 11,975 in Sussex; 350 in Bedfordshire; 700 in Buckinghamshire; 1,590 in Cambridgeshire; 1,800 in Essex; 400 in Hertfordshire; 3,160 in Norfolk and 3,380 in Suffolk. Key events on Monday night and Tuesday morning Strong winds, floods and fallen trees are causing chaos to travellers trying to get away for Christmas. Many rail services are disrupted, with some companies unable to run any trains at all, while a power outage at Gatwick airport's north terminal added to flight problems. Casualties A man's body was pulled from the River Rothesay in Ambleside in Cumbria, while a woman died in a river in Gwynedd, North Wales. A woman was killed in a car accident in Shrewsbury, Shropshire, last night and a man died in a multiple-collision crash near Bodmin in Cornwall on Sunday night. Weather and flood warnings \u2022 Amber level weather alerts and more than 400 flood warnings and alerts have been issued across the UK. Forecasters have warned of blizzards and winds gusting up to 90mph in some places \u2022 The Environment Agency says there is only one warning in place categorised as severe (for the area around the Sea Life Centre in Weymouth). Here's the full breakdown. \u2022 The Met Office says the public should prepare for \"significant disruption due to the combined hazards of heavy rainfall and high winds\". The main areas of concern on Tuesday are Scotland and Northern Ireland. Transport disruption \u2022 Train operators have delayed or cancelled services across England, Wales and Scotland. \u2022 South West: no trains until 10am to allow for safety checks. \u2022 Southern: all services suspended until further notice while obstructions and routes are cleared, which it expects to have completed later this morning. \u2022 Thameslink: replacement buses until at least 8am. \u2022 25 people rescued from cars in floodwaters in Dorset. \u2022 Unverified reports that 100 people have been trapped on a train near Taunton since 1am. The London fire brigade says it took five times more calls than usual last night. Firefighters will be on strike again in some areas on Tuesday night. Unverified reports that 100 people have been trapped on a train near Taunton since 1am. And here's what it looks like from above, in an image posted by Channel 4 weather presenter Liam Dutton last night: The Dorset Fire and Rescue Service reported early this morning that it had rescued 25 people from cars in floodwaters around Sturminster Newton, Blandford, Shaftesbury, Sherborne and Wimborne. Gatwick confirms its power failure, as passengers have been saying for a while. Can't say yet how this sentence will end. Most of the worst conditions so far have been in the south, but it's now expected to ease there, while strong winds and blizzards are forecast for Scotland and Northern Ireland. Up to 70mph says the BBC weather centre, with snow on the hills. In much happier news, the RNLI has posted a video of a frightened labrador rescued by the Happisburgh lifeboat after it was swept out to sea off Norfolk on Sunday. Strictly speaking not related to today's storms, but who can resist a labrador good-news story at Christmas? Frustrated passengers at Gatwick have been telling the BBC of huge queues as they are manually checked in due to a power cut in terminal north. One would-be passenger says: \"All systems are down due to weather condition!! I should be boarding right now! All flights have been suspended. It's Christmas eve!! I want to go home!!\" Some more details on train delays and cancellations from the Press Association: \u2022 South West: no trains until 10am to allow for safety checks. Some 35 trees came down across its network yesterday and there was flooding at several sites. Power supplies have also affected signalling, with the West of England and Portsmouth lines the worst affected. \u2022 Southern: all services suspended until further notice while obstructions and routes are cleared, which it expects to have completed later this morning. \u2022 Airports: currently no rail services in and out of Gatwick. The Stansted Express is suspended. \u2022 Thameslink: replacement buses until at least 8am. Some companies are allowing train tickets valid for travel on Monday to be used today, and lifting normal ticket restrictions. ScillyToday is reporting a harrowing rescue mission for two French sailors whose yacht has broken in two, 170 miles south-west of Scilly. Attempts to rescue the sailors last night failed. It says a French aircraft has dropped a life raft but the sailors have been unable to get into it. Falmouth Coastguard says the weather and sea conditions are \"horrendous\" with \" humungous\" seas and waves reaching nine metres. The Environment Agency says there is only one warning in place categorised as severe (for the area around the Sea Life Centre in Weymouth), but another 152 regular warnings and many more alerts, mostly in the south-east and south-west. Here's the full breakdown. Even celebrities have no power over the elements. Niall Horan of One Direction tweeted his anger at the delay in getting home to Ireland for Christmas in terms that parents of his younger fans might not enjoy. A passenger on a ferry from Portsmouth to Bilbao has told BBC radio news it was forced to take shelter off the French coast overnight. She said they had been told they would know by 7am whether it would divert to Brest, but the ship was pitching and rolling so much that \"80% of us just want to get off it now\". And National Rail says there are no Southern services until further notice. Gatwick airport says there are no train services operating to and from the airport this morning. Passengers trying to reach the airport are reporting trains have been halted due to a landslide. Passengers have been posting hair-raising accounts of flights that tried to land late last night or in the early hours, mostly in London and the south. Planes trying to land at London's Gatwick were diverted to airports as far away as Dublin, Cork, Amsterdam, Manchester and Liverpool. One passenger on a flight from Stockholm to Heathrow told the BBC he thought \"everyone thought they were going to die. Plane being thrown about like a toy. Absolutely horrible flight but glad to be alive.\" Also on the BBC, a passenger on a flight from Paris to Bristol spoke of \"the most terrifying\" experience of his life\" after the plane circled Bristol for 30 minutes before being diverted to Birmingham and landing in high winds. He said eight other flights had been sent to the same airport and hundreds of passengers were being put up in hotels. Both praised the skill and courage of the pilots in bringing them in safely. \u2022 Amber level weather alerts and more than 400 flood warnings and alerts have been issued across the UK. Forecasters have warned of blizzards and winds gusting up to 90mph in some places \u2022 The Met Office says the public should prepare for \"significant disruption due to the combined hazards of heavy rainfall and high winds\". The main areas of concern on Tuesday are Scotland and Northern Ireland. \u2022 Train operators have delayed or cancelled services across England, Wales and Scotland. \u2022 There are severe delays across UK roads and highways \u2022 Two deaths were confirmed on Monday.
