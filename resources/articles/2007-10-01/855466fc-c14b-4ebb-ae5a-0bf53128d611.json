In Gordon Brown's last Budget earlier this year, he announced that drivers of the most polluting vehicles would have to pay \u00a3400 a year to tax them, while vehicle excise duty on low carbon-emitting cars would be reduced by 30 per cent. Some cars, such as electric ones, which emit less than 100g of carbon dioxide per kilometre, would be tax-exempt. When they appeared about seven years ago, hybrid cars cost almost \u00a34,000 more than petrol models. But, says Honda, they are now cheaper to buy and run. 'Hybrids are becoming more mainstream,' says John Kingston, Honda environment manager. The latest Honda Civic Hybrid (which costs about \u00a316,600) is just over \u00a3200 cheaper than its 1.8-litre petrol-only counterpart (at \u00a316,840) - and when the lower running costs of a hybrid are taken into account, the savings are considerable. Road tax on the Honda hybrid will be just \u00a315 a year, compared with \u00a3140 on the petrol version; hybrid drivers are exempt from the \u00a38 a day central London congestion charge; and some boroughs, such as Westminster, charge hybrid drivers less for parking permits. Kingston says few people understand how a [Honda] hybrid works - and often think they are less powerful. 'The engine is smaller in a hybrid car - a 1.1 litre - but it's supported with a motor which helps the petrol last longer and gives it extra strength, making it exactly the same powerwise as a 1.8-litre petrol engine. It drives like any normal vehicle, with the added benefit that the engine turns itself off when you stop at traffic lights - and while you're braking, energy is being channelled to recharge the motor battery.' He adds that servicing costs for a petrol Civic and hybrid Civic are identical. ' Other main hybrid vehicles are the Toyota Prius (from \u00a317,777 to \u00a320,677) and the Lexus hybrid (from \u00a330,000). But there are cheaper alternatives. According to Which? Car magazine, new diesel-powered 'superminis' might not be totally carbon neutral, but they can be a greener choice than petrol-engined cars. However, they are about \u00a31,500 more expensive. 'Diesel is still a conventional fuel, but diesel cars have lower CO2 emissions because they don't use so much of it,' says Richard Headland, motoring editor at Which? Car. Toyota's diesel-engined Yaris, which costs about \u00a38,800, emits 2.49 tonnes of CO2 annually, compared with 2.84 tonnes from a Fiat Punto. The road tax on the diesel Yaris is \u00a335 a year. Meanwhile, the new Bluemotion diesel version of the Volkswagen Polo (from \u00a311,995) is exempt from road tax because it emits less than 100g of CO2 per kilometre (less than the Prius, which emits 104g/km)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
