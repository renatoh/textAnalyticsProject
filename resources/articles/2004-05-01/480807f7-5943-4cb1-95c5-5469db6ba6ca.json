In a corner of the Great Court a set of fantastically detailed costumes from the film look perfectly at home amidst the antiquities (even if Brad Pitt's is really short). Alongside are artworks taking Troy as their theme, from Mycenaean pottery to modern interpretations by Wedgewood and Paolozzi. More dramatic events include re-enactments of Homer's tales in the first week of June. www.thebritishmuseum.ac.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
