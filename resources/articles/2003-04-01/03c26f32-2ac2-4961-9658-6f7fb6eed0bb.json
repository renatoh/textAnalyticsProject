Can you recommend the 'must see' places? We'd fly into Rio and aim to see some of the 'main' attractions, such as Igua\u00e7u Falls, Ouro Pr\u00eato, Pantanal, and Salvador. But we'd also like a couple of days chilling out on a beach. Which are the best and most accessible? Pete Blackman, by email In two weeks you might only have time for the country's south-east. So, from Rio head inland to Ouro Pr\u00eato. This stunning colonial town has no twentieth-century buildings and the Parque Itacolomy makes a pleasant excursion with good walking trails, waterfalls and orchids. Be aware that almost all the museums and churches close on Mondays. From here head east to the Pantanal. This is a fantastic place to see wildlife, with 650 bird species, from hawks to hummingbirds, and other creatures galore, including anacondas, anteaters and up to 35 million alligators. After the Pantanal sample more natural wonders at Igua\u00e7u Falls - which are higher than Niagara and more beautiful. For your chill-out time the coastline around Rio de Janerio has dozens of secluded beaches within a couple of hours of Parati by boat or bus. Or, try B\u00fazios, a resort on a peninsula scalloped by 17 dazzling beaches. Then you could go north from Rio to Salvador da Bahia, a city with an African soul and vibrant culture. Try Placaford or Itapu\u00e3. Finally, there's Jericoacoara, a remote, hip beach village, a long way north but worth reaching by air. If you're feeling crazy, as the sun sets, surf the dunes. Europe in a month After my A-levels, I plan to go with friends Inter-Railing in Europe for up to a month. We aim to cover two or three of these zones: France, Belgium, Holland and Luxembourg; Italy, Greece, Turkey and Slovenia; and Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, and Croatia. We haven't got much money. Any ideas on where to stay and what to see? Should we rent a Greek villa for a week? We'll miss the peak holiday time, but would this still be ridiculously expensive? What kind of amount of How much money do you think we'll need overall? Anna, London Inter-Rail is still one of the best summer adventures for young travellers - and it should be fairly easy to convince parents of the merits of a cultural month in Europe. A three-zone Inter-Rail pass covering all your destinations is \u00a3225 for a month, but for an extra \u00a340 you get all zones from the tip of Norway to Morocco - which allows you to alter plans, if you decide to check out the midnight sun in Scandinavia or go to Spain for a real sizzle. You'll never have problems finding a hostel or campsite, though you may want to book some popular sites. But, for sun and sand on a budget, forget the villa. You'll waste all that time on your travel pass. Instead think about Croatia and island hopping in Greece, where you'll get your tan yet also see memorable parts of the continent. Turkey also offers some excellent deals. A fair budget for the trip is \u00a330-40 a day, excluding the rail pass. Rail Europe (08705 848 848) has got details about passes and Eurostar deals. The highlights of an inter rail trip are the highlights of Europe - too many to list here, but Lonely Planet's Europe on a Shoestring guide includes detailed route plans. And don't go without Thomas Cook's European Railway Timetable (Thomas Cook, \u00a310.50) - it lists every train you'll take to allow for last minute planning. By sea to Sweden In September I will visit friends in Stockholm. A friend going with me cannot fly due to illness and would also have difficulty with a long coach journey. What possibilities are there for travelling by boat and train? David Esteber, London This is a straightforward trip, in three parts, each of which is operated by firms used to handling disabilities. First go London to Newcastle by GNER (08457 225 225), to catch the DFDS Seaways ferry (08705 333 000) for Gothenburg via Kristiansand in Norway. Voyages take 27 hours. Expect to pay between \u00a3140-210 return depending on the cabin class. From there, the X2000 fast train takes five hours between Gothenburg and Stockholm and costs about \u00a340 return. Book the train in the UK through Deutsche Bahn (0870 243 53 63). Malaysian stopover I'm travelling with my family to New Zealand at Christmas and stopping off at the Malaysian island of Langkawi for five days on the way back. Is there an alternative to the five-star resorts that seem to dominate the island? We'd like somewhere with a family room (and a pool would be nice) but without the opulence. Any ideas? Zosia Kmietowicz, by email Over the past 10 years or so Langkawi has been targeted by the Malaysian government for development as the country's premier tourist resort. Much of the island's budget accommodation, therefore, has been demolished to make way for luxury resorts. Reasonably priced accommodation is now only available in Kuah and on the southwest coast at Pantai Cenang and Pantai Tengah. Pantai Cenang is a 2km long strip of good beach where almost all of Langkawi's beach chalets are concentrated. Near the northern end of the built-up strip is the very pleasant Beach Garden Resort (00 60 4 955 1363). It has a small swimming pool and family rooms are available for about \u00a340 with breakfast, air-conditioning and private bathroom. The restaurant here is excellent; www.asia-hotels.com also has a good selection on Langkawi. At Pantai Cenang, between November and January, you can walk across the sandbar, which appears at low tide, to the nearby island of Pulau Rebak Kecil, inspecting the local sea life on the way. It is also worth venturing away from the built-up areas as Langkawi is still really a rural Malay island of small villages, rice paddies, water buffalo and natural beauty. \u00b7 We welcome letters.
