Jo Moore was reprimanded by Mr Byers and Sir Richard Mottram, her permanent secretary. Despite receiving the backing of Downing Street, Ms Moore, 38, was still facing calls for her resignation from Tony Wright, the Labour chairman of the public administration committee, as well as from the shadow foreign secretary, Michael Ancram. Mr Ancram also called for an inquiry into how the government had \"manipulated\" announcements since the crisis broke. The government responded by saying no news had been postponed or advanced since the attacks. Ms Moore sent her memo to Mr Byers, the director of communications, Alun Evans, and her fellow special adviser, Dan Corry, an hour after the two attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York, but before they had collapsed. In the memo, timed at 2.55pm and sent from home, she said: \"It is now a very good day to get out anything we want to bury. Councillors' expenses?\" An announcement on councillors' expenses - controversial within local government - was made the following day. Ms Moore issued a statement yesterday saying: \"I would like to sincerely apologise for the offence I have caused. \"It was wrong to send the email and I accept responsibility for doing so. It was clearly a mistake I regret.\" A Downing Street spokesman, under severe pressure at the morning briefing with journalists, said Ms Moore had committed an \"error of judgment\" but that it should be kept in perspective. He said the prime minister accepted Mr Byers' assessment of Ms Moore's worth. He added that Mr Byers had accepted her public apology and her admission that she had got it wrong. Mr Byers was made aware of the email on Monday when journalists from the Guardian and Independent confronted the department. He said that he had not read it. The Rev David Smith, whose cousin Richard Cudina died in the attack in New York City, said the email could only have come from the most hard-hearted of people. \"If the idea is that bad news should be buried, this is basically burying bad news of a fairly insignificant kind under the bodies of 6,500 people. That is very, very bad for our nation and the worst form of modern politics.\" Mr Wright said the email showed something worse than an error of judgment. \"I do not believe the kind of attitude displayed in this is compatible with working in public service.\" Peter Kilfoyle, a former defence minister, said the leak was \"very embarrassing for Mr Blair, Mr Byers and Jo Moore herself\", adding: \"In contemporary politics image and spin are mightily important.\" Charlie Whelan, the former press secretary to Gordon Brown, said: \"We all get carried away with our work\", but added: \"I will be very surprised if she is still in her job at the end of the week. You just cannot say this a good day for anything.\" The Liberal Democrat transport spokesman, Don Foster, described Ms Moore's attitude as \"unbelievable\". He said: \"The rest of us were absolutely transfixed and horrified as we watched our television screens, and that there was somebody in government working in public services thinking only about how to bury news is horrific.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
