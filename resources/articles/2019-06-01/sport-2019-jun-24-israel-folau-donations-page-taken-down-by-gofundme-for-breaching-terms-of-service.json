The rugby star had collected more than $750,000 as of Sunday night as he sought donations from the public for his legal fight, with a $3m target. But on Monday GoFundMe Australia removed the crowdfunding page. \u201cAs a company, we are absolutely committed to the fight for equality for LGBTIQ+ people and fostering an environment of inclusivity,\u201d said its manager, Nicola Britton. \u201cWhile we welcome GoFundMes engaging in diverse civil debate, we do not tolerate the promotion of discrimination or exclusion \u2026 Our platform exists to help people help others.\u201d Folau had his $4m employment contract terminated in May, after he made social media posts saying \u201chell awaits\u201d homosexuals, which were deemed in breach of its code of conduct, and after previous warnings from Rugby Australia not to denigrate people on the basis of their sexuality. The player announced he would challenge the decision in court and set up a GoFundMe account asking for donations to \u201cstand up for the word of God\u201d. But on Monday morning the page was removed. \u201cAfter a routine period of evaluation, we have concluded that this campaign violates our terms of service,\u201d Britton said. GoFundMe\u2019s terms of service say it can take down funds that are \u201cfor the legal defence of alleged crimes associated with hate, violence, harassment, bullying, discrimination, terrorism or intolerance of any kind relating to race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender or gender identity or serious disabilities or diseases\u201d. Folau\u2019s GoFundMe had also been heavily criticised over the past week for asking for public money. His former Wallabies teammate Drew Mitchell accused Folau of \u201cgreed\u201d after his fund received more donations than accounts for disadvantaged and sick children. \u201cYOU are in a fight that YOU chose to be in after YOU broke the terms of YOUR contract,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe kids below are in a fight they NEVER wanted to be in &amp; yet YOU think YOU deserve donations more than they do?\u201d Rugby Australia\u2019s chief executive, Raelene Castle, said: \u201cFrom our perspective [GoFundMe] is a place where sick children get support, so it\u2019s certainly not a strategy we think is appropriate.\u201d On Monday Britton said GoFundMe was a platform for \u201cacts of kindness\u201d. Prime minister Scott Morrison declined to weigh in on the issue on Monday. \u201cI think that the issue has had enough oxygen,\u201d he said. Some donors said on Twitter that they were looking for other avenues to donate to Folau\u2019s legal costs. The controversy has also extended to Folau\u2019s wife Maria, who plays netball for the Adelaide Thunderbirds. Maria Folau reposted her husband\u2019s GoFundMeCampaign on social media. \u201cWhile Netball SA in no way endorses the reposting, we do not believe Maria has contravened our social media policy,\u201d Netball South Australia chief executive Bronwyn Klei said in a statement. \u201cMaria is a key member of the Thunderbirds. Not only has she provided great strength and leadership on court, she attends and works with netballing clinics, spends a lot of time with fans, engages with local communities and passionately encourages young kids with their netball dreams. We continue to support her as we support all our players.\u201d Klei clarified her organisation does not endorse the repost and is committed to diversity and inclusion. Netball great Liz Ellis was furious with the code\u2019s response. \u201cAs much as I love watching \u2066Maria Folau play netball I do not want my sport endorsing the views of her husband,\u201d Ellis tweeted. In his initial plea, Israel Folau said the account was \u201csolely to fund the rest of my action in court\u201d. \u201cMy faith is the most important thing in my life. I try to live my life according to the Bible and I believe it is my duty to share the word of the Bible,\u201d he said. \u201cMy wife Maria and I have already spent over $100,000 of our own money, and that was just to try and deal with Rugby Australia\u2019s internal tribunal processes. The money I am asking for is solely to fund the rest of my action in court.\u201d In April Folau posted an image on Instagram that read: \u201cWarning drunks, homosexuals, adulterers, liars, fornicators, thieves, atheists, idolaters, Hell awaits you. Repent! Only Jesus saves.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
