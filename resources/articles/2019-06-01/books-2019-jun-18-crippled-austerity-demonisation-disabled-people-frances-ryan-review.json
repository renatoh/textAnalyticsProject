Its conclusion was that a \u201chuman catastrophe\u201d was under way. In every sphere, including employment, housing, education and social security, disabled people are hugely disadvantaged. Shamefully, that country is Britain. In Crippled: Austerity and the Demonisation of Disabled People, Frances Ryan, a fine journalist, broadcaster and campaigner for disability rights, robustly stacks up the evidence that ought to put politicians \u2013 especially chancellors \u2013 in the dock. There, they could be tried and found guilty of the destruction of the rights, dignity, independence and mental health of too many of Britain\u2019s 14 million disabled citizens. Ryan argues cogently that in order to distract from the extent of the impact of these inhuman measures, to reduce the allegedly \u201cbloated welfare bill\u201d, disabled people have been demonised as \u201cnot really disabled\u201d. Meanwhile, the welfare state has become an instrument of punishment. The Centre for Welfare Reform calculated in 2013 that disabled people have endured nine times the average burden of austerity cuts. The figure rises to 19 times for the most severely disabled. Last year, 4 million disabled people were living below the breadline. The gains in the 1990s, such as the Disability Living Allowance, which covered the extra cost of care and mobility needs, have been replaced by brutal changes to benefits, including the bedroom tax, universal credit and the notorious \u201cfit for work\u201d tests. In 2013-14, Ryan reports, sanctions against disabled people and the chronically ill rose 580%. Last year, 70% of disabled people judged \u201cfit for work\u201d successfully overturned that decision on appeal. Something is wrong. In example after example, Ryan illustrates how wrong. Rachel, 44, in a wheelchair, suffers from fibromyalgia, Crohn\u2019s disease and lupus. All her social care has been axed (between 2010-17, \u00a36bn was cut from adult social care). For five days a week she can\u2019t shower, get dressed or cook. She has malnutrition. Peter, 31, has cerebral palsy and scoliosis. For eight years he lived in his own flat and had carers 12 hours a day. That support has gone. Now, he lives in an older persons\u2019 care home. Robert, 34, has been trapped in an attic flat with no lift for six years. He is paralysed and has severe vitamin D deficiency from the lack of sunlight. Vindictive? Carla, 27, has autism and multiple mental health problems, as well as scoliosis. Her daughter Harmony, 6, has ADHD, epilepsy and a learning disorder. Carla has repeatedly asked for support. But as Ryan writes, \u201cdisabled women are not supported with their needs and then blamed for not parenting properly\u201d. The fear is that children will be taken into care. By 2021, people like Carla will have lost a third of their already meagre income because of a decade of cuts. Crippled is an admirably comprehensive charge sheet of the scale of state abuse. \u201cI\u2019m treading water \u2013 or at least delaying my drowning,\u201d one woman says. Austerity has been a political choice, Ryan says. Since 2010, social security benefits will have been cut by \u00a335bn a year by the early 2020s. Tax cuts will cost the Treasury \u00a347bn per year by 2021-2; lucky rich. She calls for a new kind of \u201csolidarity politics\u201d. Disabled people are entitled to better lives in a more humane, compassionate society than that which we currently have. As Ryan says: \u201cHow things are \u2013 is not how they need to be.\u201d \u2022 Crippled: Austerity and the Demonisation of Disabled People by Frances Ryan is published by Verso (\u00a312.99).
