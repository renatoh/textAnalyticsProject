When we put the call out for readers to send in stories about the parks they loved, we received lots of submissions. There were clear favourites \u2013 there were a number of stories about Wilsons Promontory as well as the Blue Mountains, Girraween, Kosciuszko, Lamington, the Alpine and the Royal national parks. And there were common themes in your responses: many readers said how glorious it was being out in nature, imagining life before colonisation, when Indigenous Australians looked after the land. But some voiced their concerns about the cuts to national parks funding, and many were worried about whether these treasured areas would be protected for future generations. But mostly there was love: love for all the animals, birds and plants living in these areas; gratitude for the big, wide spaces; and appreciation of just how fortunate we are to have these parks. Here are some of our favourite stories and pictures: Lake Mungo, New South Wales Leaving the curling line of river gums along the Darling River, driving across the apparently empty flat plains, with only the occasional emu watching you pass by. Somehow out of the flat featureless horizon, a natural bowl appears, a lake that has been empty for hundreds of years. This place has been at the epicentre of the local culture since well before the Roman empire, and you can feel it in the place. The soil itself reveals the layers of history, evident to even the casual observer. As the kids run around across the lunar-like landscape, they climb a ridge to reveal a huge sand dune. They slide down it for hours on end until the surprising morning chill gives way to a fiercely dry midday heat causing us to beat a retreat to find a picnic spot amid the trees a few kilometres further on. Never seen any place like it before or since. Brendan Girraween national park, Queensland We camp here every year. Our children have, over time, managed all the walks on offer, climbing up spectacular granite boulders. We climb the Pyramid to see the dawn, and the pink hues turn to yellow as the sun comes up. The rangers tell us about the abundance of wildlife and flora, and we can watch grey kangaroos from our campsite. Other campers and day visitors smile as everyone seems to enjoy the park. It is relaxing, it is a privilege to be surrounded by such natural beauty. Helen McDonald We go camping every year at Easter to Bald Rock Creek camping spot. We\u2019ve been doing this for five years now since our son was two and our daughter six. Every year they experience the beauty of lying out on granite slabs in the middle of the night looking up at the great smeary swoosh of the Milky Way, the sense of accomplishment from climbing the pointy peak of the Pyramid and the excitement of scrambling to get there along with the simple joys of sizzling sausages on an open fire. Time as family. Time in nature. Priceless. Brian McIntosh Alpine &amp; Mount Buffalo national park, Victoria From a very young age, my family has loved the mountains. When we were growing up in Gippsland, they were always on the horizon. We have walked to all the peaks, rode horses on the edges in the state forest, skied, camped, swum and rafted in the rivers. When I was 14, I rode my horse from Braigalong to Wonnangatta Station, and one night he escaped the camp and joined the brumbies. For two days we tracked him. After a long and beautiful ride over snowplains, sphagnum moss creeks and up mountain gullies, we trapped him in a fallen tree yard. It was hot and sticky so when we secured him, relieved to have him back, we swam in the Wonnangatta creek. At that moment, a whole bus of Japanese tourists suddenly appeared at the creek taking photos of us swimming. Miles from anywhere, tourists had come to see this gorgeous national park. Diversity of ecosystem and our protection of these spaces is the glue that holds the wildernesses together and we need to protect them. So much more could be done to protect our national parks, underfunding, not listening to the science and logging to produce wood chips? The perceived value of these areas is changing \u2013 let\u2019s move on from cattle, logging, brumbies, four-wheel driving. These are the lungs of our planet. We have to work on alternative ways of getting people in it or appreciating it, so they too could not imagine life without it. Nikki Atherstone The Victorian Alpine national park keeps me sane. [It\u2019s] the greatest anti-depressant on earth. The park is huge and best accessed on foot. It covers Victoria\u2019s highest alpine areas and surrounds some of our best ski fields, like Mount Hotham or Falls Creek. It incorporates an array of ecologies from wet forest and rainforest to sweeping alpine planes of dwarfed shrubs and mosses and tiny crystal clear streams that freeze over in the winter. There are multiple threatened species that are protected by the park, like the spotted tree frog or the pygmy possum, but I like the birds. From gang gang cockatoos to nervous pink robins and a dozen different birds of prey that glide on the freezing alpine slip streams. It feels like home, the ecology and topography is familiar and beautiful but it\u2019s also dangerous. There are snakes and potential bushfires, slippery ledges, sudden changes in temperature and the ever-present threat of severe cold. I think it\u2019s the combination that works for me. It\u2019s the beauty and the threat, the privilege of being somewhere so wild and untouched and the humility of being in an environment indifferent to me. You have to be there, you can\u2019t sink into your own thoughts and memories. It demands a type of mindfulness that undermines the apparent significance of quotidian worries \u2013 a mindfulness easy to hold, calming and wondrous and all while breathing in cold clean air of such purity it\u2019s almost intoxicating. Pip Barber Blue Mountains national park, NSW My dad taught me and my sister to love and appreciate nature from a very young age. In our childhood, he would take us on outdoor adventures in nearby national parks. We mostly visited the Blue Mountains, where we retraced the hikes, canyons and campsites that dad first experienced when grandad took him there in the 60s. There\u2019s one campsite that\u2019s particularly special to us, Acacia Flats, near Blue Gum Forest, a valley that we\u2019d walk down to from Govetts Leap lookout. It was like a rite of passage, taking that hike, in my family. My sister was the one who went first, right after her sixth birthday. I was jealous. But when I turned six, I got to go there too, just with dad. And it felt truly special, it felt important. Being outdoors makes me feel alive and happy, then and now. There\u2019s a thrill in knowing that you have everything you need to survive for a few days in a pack on your back. Some primitive euphoria that you experience simply by walking in a natural wilderness means my thoughts calm down, I become grounded, it\u2019s really easy to be relaxed and simply enjoy myself, my company and the nature that\u2019s all around. And Dad taught me how to experience it. So now that I\u2019m a young adult, I enjoy going on hiking adventures into the wilderness with my mates. And when I feel that primitive bliss, I\u2019m always thinking of my father, who lives an ocean away now but only a few eucalyptus deep into my heart. So, thank you Dad, Grandad and the national parks. I hope that they still exist for my children, and my children\u2019s children, to enjoy. Ella Seabrook Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair national park, Tasmania I remember my earliest trips to Cradle Mountain, when me and my family would stay in the wooden huts in the rainforest where curious currawongs and quolls would come to suss us out. I\u2019ve been visiting regularly ever since: having wild adventures on untracked peaks, wandering hidden trails, showing it off to friends, staying in the park\u2019s cosy lodges with my partner. The diversity of habitats is astounding, from dark green rainforest to golden buttongrass plains. There are ancient pines, beds of cushion plants, spiky pandani, and Australia\u2019s only winter deciduous tree, turning the slopes orange in autumn. I fear for it as the climate warms, and bushfires encroach on the alpine environment. What I love most about the park is its accessibility; there really is something for everyone. It\u2019s Tasmania\u2019s most visited park, and while managing the numbers in such a sensitive environment must get harder for the park\u2019s staff every year, it has so far been done with sensitivity. I\u2019m glad so many people can visit such an incredible place, and maybe leave with a greater sense of what makes this planet wonderful. While I believe there must be places in the world that are left largely to plants, animals and all the processes that sustain ecosystems, the wonderful thing about national parks is the window they can give us into the natural world. James Walls of Jerusalem national park, Tasmania Much of Tasmania is wilderness, but the Walls of Jerusalem, for me, epitomise this beautiful, wild and rugged state. To even get to the limit of the park is a five-hour drive from Hobart followed by a three-hour uphill walk to the high plateau. The park is dotted with hundreds of lakes and tarns \u2013 some home to platypuses \u2013 and ancient stands of pencil pines. The biblical place names \u2013 Solomon\u2019s Throne, King David\u2019s Peak \u2013 only add to the mystique. This year I was lucky enough to see the park blanketed with snow. In three days I saw not another soul: the feeling of utter solitude in this crowded, noisy and busy world was glorious. There is nowhere else remotely like it. William Seager Murramarang national park, NSW As a kid, my parents took us on modest trips in the school holidays. Almost every year we inhabited a small cabin at Depot beach in Murramarang national park, surrounded by kangaroos and colourful lorikeets. We\u2019d get lost among the giant trees behind the beach and spend hours spotting critters in the rock pools. I\u2019d say that these moments are a big part of why I became an environmental scientist as an adult. This park and every other should be protected to continue to inspire kids across the country. Bridget Corcoran Croajingolong national park, Victoria There\u2019s a certain aura you can feel when you get to \u201cCroa\u201d. There is so much life there, relatively untouched. You really get a sense of what the whole Australian east coast would have been like pre-colonisation. You can camp on the beach and be woken by the sound of fish jumping next to you. There is dense bush all around with untold mysteries within it. Perhaps most spectacular are the dunes. You walk out of tea tree scrub and onto vast plains of sand, which seem to stretch upwards and out endlessly. It is worth marching along them towards the horizon as the views from the top are more than rewarding. It is a spiritual experience spending a while in Croajingolong, one can only hope it remains that way. Jacob Mildren Hattah-Kulkyne national nark, Victoria Hattah-Kulkyne national park is in the hottest, driest corner of Victoria. In summer, the sun is a weapon and the sand between the old growth mallee trees is covered in the very spiky and unforgiving spinifex grass. This land seems inhospitable, yet it is teeming with wildlife. Somehow, many species thrive here, from the very smallest forms of termites, ants, bush-roaches and wolf-spiders foraging among the leaf litter, to the colourful array of birds, reptiles and mammals that can be found nowhere else in the world. You cannot have a boring walk here. Instead you find natural wonders accosting you at every turn. Just last week I tripped on an ant nest that released a powerful odour of coconuts in response. The same day I saw one of Australia\u2019s smallest birds, the mallee emu-wren, foraging inside hummocks of spinifex-grass that we cannot even touch without injuring ourselves. When the sun becomes overwhelming, you can leave the spiky spinifex-grass and swim in the Hattah Lakes. It\u2019s a thrill to swim among red gums that were growing before the First Fleet hit Australian shores. Simon Verdon Karijini national park, Western Australia The deep gorges, freezing pools, beautiful streams and tall rock cliffs make an amazing contrast with the arid red plains and hills of the surrounding Pilbara district. I first visited these with my parents back when I was a 12-year-old, and even then I could see the beauty of the gorges in the then-Hamersley Range national park. Back in the 80s, almost no one outside of WA had heard of it. Even today, when it\u2019s much better known, Karijini\u2019s isolation \u2013 in the middle of WA\u2019s Pilbara district \u2013 makes it a challenging place to visit. The most common things nearby are giant iron ore mines and their occasional service towns. But the natural grandeur is still there and you still feel like you\u2019re part of a special group of people who\u2019ve had the privilege of visiting. Matt Quinn Kosciuszko national park, NSW I\u2019ve bushwalked in Kosciuszko national park for more than 30 years, and love its dramatic landscapes, cool streams and picturesque mountain huts. In January this year, I took my two teenage sons and one of their friends on a seven-night walk from Kiandra to Mount Kosciuszko. It was great introducing them to some new places, and talking with them about the many layers of human history in the park \u2013 first Australians, miners and pastoralists. Our small party of four walkers made an Acknowledgement of Country at the beginning of our walk and then again in the alpine region, as we walked through the territory of two tribes of traditional owners. In Kosciuszko, it\u2019s not too hard to imagine the great annual gatherings that occurred for generations, of tribes from far and wide feasting on Bogong moths. It is a precious place. While its heritage is important to remember, we must protect the park\u2019s natural assets. Who knows? Maybe my sons will take their kids someday. Jonathan Wills Mount Field, Tasmania Tasmania\u2019s fourth-largest national park is Mount Field, just a short drive up the Derwent Valley from Hobart. Covering 16,000 hectares this small gem of a park contains a breathtaking range of landscapes. We were visiting for a short break and I wanted to show my girlfriend from the UK why I\u2019d been drawn back to Tasmania many times since visiting in the late 60s on a school excursion. We were not disappointed. Soon after arriving and setting out on the short walk to Russell Falls (above), I was thrilled to point to a dark darting object in the crystal clear stream below the falls. After many years bushwalking, this was my first platypus sighting. We watched amazed as it swam seemingly oblivious to us a few feet above it. After spending what seemed hours gazing at the towering falls we pressed on a short distance up the valley to one of the stands of tallest trees in a national park in Australia. A short track takes you through a stand of mountain ash (Eucalyptus regnans) soaring up to 85 metres, the largest of which is estimated to be older than 385 years. With daylight fading, we decided to drive up to the alpine plateau which contains a beautiful series of tarns \u2013 Dobson, Fenton and the smaller lakes Belton and Webster. The snow-capped Mount Field towers above the plateau. In a short trip we were delighted by one of the gems of Australian national parks. Malcolm McLennan Great Otway national park, Victoria I remember a time when myself and a friend went to a billabong in the heart of the forest. There we spent three hours floating in a canoe, waiting for the two platypus who have found a home there to pop up and show their faces every time they needed a breather. On our walk out of the forest as the sun began to set, we were led by the lights of glow worms back to our car before we headed home. A simple day that was peaceful and magical. Benjamin Royal national park, NSW From the first time I visited the Royal national park as a child, I felt I had stepped into a world apart, one of grounded calm and a vast fierce beauty particular to the Australian landscape. As an adult, launching a kayak and finding a place upstream to float gently on clear water, surrounded by the buzzing rhythm of cicadas and the smell of the bush, is the best antidote for a troubled mind. It is a powerful and ancient place. I spoke with an Aboriginal ranger at the park who said: \u201cYou should talk to the old ones.\u201d Thinking he meant the elders, I asked where I could find them. He laughed and said: \u201cJust sit under a tree.\u201d I now know what he meant. The Royal is the world\u2019s second oldest national park. What astounding foresight back in 1879 to have established and protected this place. Here we are, in the 21st century, with our vastly extended knowledge and technology \u2013 why are our politicians seemingly oblivious to the inestimable value of our national parks? Annabel O\u2019Flynn Wilsons Promontory, Victoria We have been coming here for more than 20 years, bringing tiny children to camp, then bigger children to walk, and then teenagers to be challenged; by distance, the track, the weather, their pack; and then be dwarfed by the surrounds. I am proud to say all our children love this place and every year we celebrate a family \u201cretreat\u201d in early December. It is always breathtakingly beautiful. We now celebrate grandchildren admiring wallabies and wombats. Every year, as I get older, it becomes more precious. I notice how fragile it is. How many tourists are around us, how the park rangers who used to patrol Sealers or Refuge coves are no longer seen. It\u2019s such a rare chance for all to experience what our country might be like without \u201ccivilising\u201d forces. I simply adore this pause at the end of our year. And honour the nature that so generously provides it: like the pause before a sunset, or the breath before the kookaburras chuckle the day away.
