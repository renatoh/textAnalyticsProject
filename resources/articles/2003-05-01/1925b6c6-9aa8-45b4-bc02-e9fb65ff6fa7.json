Ministers and officials might toast one another with department sherry for our deliverance from \"low skills equilibrium\", economists' posh euphemism for going to the dogs. Will mutual congratulations be justified, though? Will a transformed adult workforce bristling with level 3 qualifications be entirely or even mainly to the government's credit? Or will the critical factor that impels the nation's employers to train their staff turn out to have been beyond government control? In short, will it be down to the soaring cost of insurance? Rising premiums and the increasing difficulty of getting comprehensive cover are the staple moans of boardroom bores nationwide. What is seeping slowly into the consciousness of businesses reeling painfully from the exponentially increasing cost of cover is that training employees may prove one of the few reliable ways of taking the edge off the pain. \"Insurance is now a boardroom topic much more than it was in the past,\" says Andrew Hicks, managing director of Willis Risk Solutions, part of the Willis Group, a leading global firm of insurance brokers. \"Both the increase in premiums and, in some cases, the inability to get insurance cover are major concerns.\" A demonstrably good level of skills and training in a business's workforce is one of the more persuasive arguments in negotiations with insurers for any premium reduction, he says. \"If there's a strong commitment from the client to training, they will be more favourably treated in terms of premium and the coverage they get.\" But insurers will want evidence that a company's vaunted levels of training do indeed lead over time to fewer claims, and they will regularly review the situation. \"Training is a good argument to have but it will be even better in three years' time if things have gone well.\" Good, thorough training is an obvious method of limiting a contributing factor shared by most major accidents, from train crashes to oil refinery fires. Subsequent inquiries usually show that at some stage someone took a decision that contravened safety or good practice. There was human error. The headline-grabbing disasters are at one end of a spectrum that is rapidly broadening as the public's appetite for litigation grows and we become more demanding as consumers. Broadly, employers have to insure against injury to their own staff and to the public. And there is a growing demand for professional indemnity that has spread far beyond the obvious occupations such as medicine and dentistry, where incompetence has severe consequences. It is now needed by anyone giving advice that others act on. \"It's down to the qualifications and training of the people giving that advice.\" So it is not just the staple health and safety courses, which already account for the bulk of training in the workplace, but the skills required for doing a good job that are becoming more important in risk assessment. The extraordinary advances in global communications, coupled with the increase in litigation, have left multinational companies more vulnerable than they have ever been, says Michael Stark, head of skills and workforce development at the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). A successful lawsuit in one country can now wreak much more damage on a carefully nurtured brand across the world, he says. \"The days when it was assumed that a chemical plant disaster in one part of the world would not affect that company's operations elsewhere are long gone.\" By and large, the biggest companies are more fastidious about training and don't need persuasion. The government and its LSC agent face their big task with the small and medium enterprises. It has to take a sectoral approach, and in the DfES at least the favoured solution is still the more voluntary, less regulated one. Although the official line in, for instance, the LSC's reports on adult skills, has been to sing up the positive returns from training rather than the penalties of inaction, the potency of the insurance effect is recognised. \"In the LSC's view, the strongest real driver in skills that's sustainable and isn't just a bribe or a moral suasion or bludgeon is licence to practise,\" says Stark. And one of the strong drivers pushing employers in a particular sector to agree that no one should operate without the mutually agreed minimum qualification and level of com petence is the prospect of reducing the cost of insurance, he says. Some sectors are already there, or getting there, such as gas engineering and construction. He cites Transco, which has the massive \u00a350bn contract to renew and extend Britain's gas pipline network. It has to be insured, and for this \"it has to ensure that anybody who touches any part of this network has got to be competent\". For companies of this size, the sums insured are vast. \"Minimising your human factor risks is what drives people towards the national qualifications framework.\" Cheaper insurance was not the reason that the biggest contractors in the construction sector drew up a licence to practise according to Tony Merricks, chairman of the Construction Skills Certificate Scheme. But the industry will now collectively approach the Association of British Insurers to open negotiations for discounts. If they haven't said so in public, ministers are privately happy to acknowledge that the insurance effect is an ally, particularly when it has most definitely been an enemy in driving up council tax bills. As one said, with a smile: \"We've never said there is only one approach.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
