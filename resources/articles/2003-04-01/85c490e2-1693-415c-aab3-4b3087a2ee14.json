The economic reforms in the late 1970s and the early 1990s created a press system in which newspapers operate as business operations. To earn money by using the media, the party wants both its own newspapers and the non-party papers to be financially independent. This has not made expression in China any more free. The party controls the press by elaborate staff arrangements, censorship and strict policies which demand that newspapers support and promote the party ideology. It has been difficult for the party to control the internet. But in trying, it keeps introducing new regulations. It has shifted some of the responsibility from its own Ministry of Public Security to the internet service providers. At first, the party only allowed domestic use of the internet and banned or blocked most international access. But since it started allowing international use, the \"PRC Regulations for the Safety Protection of Public Information Systems\" from 1994 have been expanded. Now, internet service providers are responsible for their subscribers. One article states: \"Units providing international [internet access] shall establish a network management centre in order to strengthen management of their own units and their consumers according to the relevant law.\" And in 1997 the Ministry of Public Security introduced the \"Computer Information Network and Internet Security, Protection and management Regulations\". It says that it is prohibited to use the internet to create, replicate, retrieve or transmit anything inciting to resist or violate the constitution, laws or regulations. Anything concerning overthrowing the government or the socialist system is forbidden. Material that incites \"division of the country, harming national unification, making falsehoods or distorting the truth, spreading rumours or destroying the order of society and injuring reputations of state organs\" is also outlawed. As China claims it is loosening up its public relations, international sites such as Yahoo, Google and America Online, some of which have recently been blocked, will have to adhere to the \"Telecommunications Regulations of the PRC.\" Effective from September 2000, they state that the following is outlawed: \"Material that opposes the constitution, jeopardises national security, reveals state secrets, subverts state power, undermines national unity, harms the prosperity and interests of the state, spreads rumours, disturbs social order or undermines social stability.\" The \"Measures for Managing the Internet Information Services\" make internet service providers responsible for recording subscribers' access to internet, their account numbers and the web addresses they visit. They must store this information for 60 days. If any of the material listed as prohibited is accessed the provider must \"immediately stop transmission, keep the relevant records and report the situation to the relevant state authorities\". For the party, this is still not enough. The Ministry of Public Security introduced a law in 1997 that states that all internet users must register with their local police station within 30 days of signing up with an internet service provider. \"The Chinese government is struggling to maintain control, but it will not work,\" says Linhai, an internet engineer and journalist who spent 18 months in a Chinese jail because of his involvement in an opposition website. \"What China needs is an independent media. That is what the people expect. We do not need a media that serves as the government's copy machine.\" \"When I was in prison, everyday before we had dinner we had to line up and sing communist songs. The administration thinks it can turn people into 'good' people by using these funny rules. \"The whole reason why all this has happened to me is simply because I prefer to be myself. The communist government is trying to make everyone the same, into something programmed.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
