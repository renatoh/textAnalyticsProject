Ben\u00edtez risks another golf trip before Athens", "bodyText": "The previous \"bonding session\" abroad undertaken by Rafael Ben\u00edtez and his squad may have degenerated into drunken chaos in a Portuguese karaoke bar and Craig Bellamy subsequently threatening John Arne Riise with a golf club. But the Liverpool manager intends to repeat the exercise before the Champions League final on May 23 in an attempt to inspire a performance on the pitch similar to what followed on that occasion. The controversy that surrounded February's trip to the Algarve detracted from the Merseysiders' win in their knockout-phase tie in Barcelona, for which they had been preparing in Portugal, but Bellamy and Riise, whose dispute had begun when the Norwegian refused to sing on stage in the karaoke bar and culminated in the Welshman threatening his team-mate with a nine-iron back at the team hotel, both scored at Camp Nou and players and management alike suggested that the training camp had in fact been beneficial. With that in mind Ben\u00edtez hopes to reinvigorate his squad on a five-day break in Spain after Sunday's final Premiership fixture against Charlton at Anfield. \"I know people will mention that again but it's not an issue,\" said the Spaniard. \"We are thinking only about doing the right things to prepare the players for the final. When we did this before the Barcelona game it had a positive impact, although I know people talked about other things in the end. The most positive thing is we can work together in a climate and in conditions which will be more like those we'll play in at the final.\" The desire to acclimatise to playing in stifling heat is paramount in Ben\u00edtez's thinking because the final against Milan at the Olympic stadium in Athens is expected to be played in muggy and oppressive conditions, as was the final between the two teams in Istanbul in 2005. Liverpool may yet travel to Greece boosted by the knowledge that Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher, both key players in Ben\u00edtez's set-up, have signed new long-term contracts. The manager hopes deals will be finalised this week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
