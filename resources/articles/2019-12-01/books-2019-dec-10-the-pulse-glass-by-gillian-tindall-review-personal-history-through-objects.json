And yet not everything crumbles to dust; some bits and pieces defy the odds by surviving, and it is Tindall\u2019s delight \u2013 albeit of a measured and low-key sort \u2013 to describe their escape from \u201cthe quiet darkness of forgetting\u201d. Take, for instance, the scrap of tightly folded paper recently discovered in the crack of a wall at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, possibly to stop up a draught; when examined, it turned out to be a fragment of a musical score by Thomas Tallis, from a service held in St Paul\u2019s in 1544. Or the case of an attic clearance in Westminster Abbey where debris was found strewn across the floor. It was about to be tipped away when an archaeologist happened to notice many tiny shards of coloured glass mixed in there: closer study uncovered 30,000 fragments, which when put together revealed details of \u201cexquisite workmanship\u201d dating back to the 13th century \u2013 literally a window on a lost world. Tindall herself is involved in some of the accidental recoveries. Offered the chance of a souvenir by a couple clearing out a French farmhouse near her own, the author found a small cardcase that held a cache of letters written to C\u00e9lestine, an innkeeper\u2019s daughter, in 1863-64. It inspired an earlier book of hers, Voices from a French Village, and made C\u00e9lestine a posthumous local celebrity. The bequest of a tiny pulse glass \u2013 used by doctors prior to reliable watches \u2013 which once belonged to her great-great-grandfather Arthur Jacob (born 1795), unveils a portrait of her forebears that takes on darker hues as the book proceeds. The history of her house in north London, which she and her husband bought in 1963, is also reconsidered in the light of certain rackety Victorian occupiers and the building\u2019s own semi-miraculous survival against developers and German bombs. It was much luckier than those East Enders whose displacement after the war Tindall saw at first hand while working for the Welfare Association in Stepney; the ageing tenants about to lose their homes \u201cfelt hurt in a profound, inarticulate way at what was being done, at the zero-value accorded to the very fabric of their lives\u201d. Some losses really are irrecoverable. Tindall has written, inter alia, a very good book about Kentish Town in north London (The Fields Beneath) and a brilliant one about George Gissing (The Born Exile), but I don\u2019t think she has ever written as personally as she does here. \u201cPersonally\u201d is a relative term, though, because one hears an austerity in her voice that repels any inclination to make friends with it. Beneath her historian\u2019s fierce curiosity lies an obsessive, near-devotional spirit that puts the reader on guard \u2013 in another life she might have been an antiques dealer, or possibly a nun. The little elegy she writes to her lately deceased younger brother, an intensely private man, taps into a whole culture of mid-century English emotional reticence. Despite her quiet affection, Tindall calls him only \u201cN\u201d. Why not the honour of a name? Loss was the terrible lifelong bond between them. When he was a schoolboy and she a teenager, their mother, Ursula, killed herself with an overdose in a stranger\u2019s garage. A bright young thing at Oxford in the 1930s, later a promising novelist, Ursula seemed unable to cope with the legacy of a privileged upbringing and the five-year absence of her husband during the war. The horror of her suicide \u2013 a \u201cbetrayal of love and trust\u201d \u2013 haunts the daughter still. For a time, she \u201cavoided ever thinking about her\u201d. Amid the many objects the author celebrates here \u2013 including keepsakes from her aunt and grandmother \u2013 there is nothing of her mother\u2019s she has kept. No jewellery, no letters. \u201cWhat will survive of us is love,\u201d wrote Philip Larkin. It would take someone of severe integrity to deny that in the face of a parent\u2019s ghost. Tindall, honest to a fault, is that person. \u2022 The Pulse Glass by Gillian Tindall is published by Chatto &amp; Windus (\u00a316.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.
