Come December, World of Ceramics was driven to announce Tranny Frock Shock Rocks Turner, as Grayson Perry won the Turner prize, not for his pots, nor for his frocks, but for his bleak and troubling ideas. I have bleak and troubling ideas too, but they never seem to win any prizes. The bleakest artwork to hit London this year was Titian's The Flaying of Marsyas, in the National Gallery show devoted to the artist. The problem was not so much that a mythological being was hanging upside-down and being skinned alive, but that the whole show was overhung. The subterranean Sainsbury Wing galleries are too small for blockbuster exhibitions, especially for the godfather of Venetian painting. The show later travelled to the Prado in Madrid, as did a hugely memorable Manet exhibition, which for me was the exhibition of the year, despite Titian's undoubted supremacy as a painter. Sometimes you have to trust what moves you most. Titian always said he painted with his fingers and with rags so as not to look like Raphael, whose Madonna of the Pinks the National Gallery is desperate to save for the nation. Fewer visitors seem as interested in this little painting as in Ron Mueck's sculptures, which were displayed at the National this summer in one of the gallery's more embarrassing attempts to look with it and modern. Mueck's pensive little angel looked down from a cornice on Damien Hirst's exhibition at the new Saatchi Gallery at County Hall, which opened in April, but could do nothing to save either Hirst or Saatchi's misconceived and ill-presented takeover of the venue. No wonder Hirst turned to God, and to Christian imagery, in his White Cube show this autumn. The artist the Saatchi Gallery ludicrously calls the \"alpha male\" of Britart might be turning into the art world's Cliff Richard, except he is too much in love with blood, pain and martyrdom. But not so in love with suffering that he is prepared to let Saatchi continue buying his work, which he has been negotiating to buy back from the collector. Nothing in Hirst's show was as good as the huge display of pills and capsules in a work he showed at the 50th Venice Biennale. But even here tempers frayed, mostly on account of Biennale director Francesco Bonami's hideous catch-all painting survey show in the Museu Correr, and the awfulness of most of the curated survey shows surrounding the national pavilions. On a eulogistic note, British artist Tacita Dean showed a beautiful little film of arte povera artist Mario Merz sitting under a tree, a pine cone nestled on his lap, in the Biennale. Merz died, aged 78, in November. Chris Ofili's British Pavilion installation at Venice, with its complex glass canopy and thick carpets, sweltered - as did his paintings, with their own inner heat - while the Jury prize for best pavilion went to Luxembourg, possibly because its show was called Air-Conditioned. Things were cooler at the Frieze Art Fair in October, the first decent international commercial fair London has ever seen, held in a big tent in Regent's Park. Not only did the galleries come, so did the public, and, most important of all, the travelling circus of international collectors. The most memorable work at the fair was provided by several pairs of children, who acted out being artworks and gallerists, in a work by Tino Sehgal at the Wrong Gallery stand. The success of the art fair doesn't mean that the British art market is flourishing on account of home-grown collectors, more that international collectors are so loaded that punitive exchange rates don't bother them. The opening of several new and prestigious galleries in London also signals the buoyancy of the international art market. Whether the money sloshing about will trickle down to the younger, post-YBA generation of artists in Britain, many of whom have moved here from abroad, is questionable, but this is a great place to see art, if not to make it. I have never known a livelier time. Another great discovery, in a year dominated by impressive photography shows, was self-taught newspaper photographer Enrique Metinides, who showed at The Photographers' Gallery last summer. From 1948 to 1997, Metinides followed a trail of blood and carnage through Mexico, documenting train wrecks, suicides, accidents and murders for a Mexican tabloid. Of the thousands of images one sees in a year, his remain among the most haunting. For all their violence, they maintained a humanity many other photographs lack. Tate Modern mounted the enormous photography exhibition Cruel and Tender over the summer, but little could be more cruel, or as tender, as Metinides's work. Tate Britain's pair of shows, by Bridget Riley and 2000 Turner prize-winning photographer Wolfgang Tillmans, were both tremendous, but the Millbank gallery is still having problems attracting big audiences. Riley's new work proves that innovation doesn't slow down as an artist gets older, and I'd vote hers the show of the year. Olafur Eliasson's current Leverhulme commission in Tate Modern's Turbine hall has captured the public's imagination more than almost any other work this year. But it has also led to problems. The Tate's curator of misinterpretation announced last month that a crack squad of snipers had been positioned on balconies overlooking the Turbine Hall, with orders to pick off acolytes of a New Age cult who have taken to holding weird ceremonies and behaving oddly amid the smoke and mirrors of Eliasson's installation. Tate Modern's extreme action has led to consultations with the National Gallery, in order to deal with the mass outbreaks of religious hysteria that have also broken out in their current exhibition of Bill Viola's quasi-religious video installations. Other disappointed National Gallery visitors are also besieging gallery staff with complaints, because the paintings in the permanent collection fail to exhibit any signs of movement whatsoever, while Viola's videos are full of life: they wail, they cry, they move me to tears. In a joint statement, Tate and National Gallery supremos announced last week that \"Although art can evoke many different sensations and feelings, including those of a spiritual nature, inappropriate responses to it really are terribly annoying to other customers at the point of delivery of our products and services. We had no choice but to act swiftly, and with extreme prejudice.\" It must be those bleak and troubling ideas again. Highs and lows Best British exhibition Bridget Riley, scrawling on the walls at Tate Britain, London. Best international exhibitions Titian, National Gallery, London and Prado, Madrid; and Edouard Manet at the Prado. Worst exhibitions The painting exhibition From Rauschenberg to Murakami, 1964-2003, at the Venice Biennale, curated by Francesco Bonami; and anything at all at the Saatchi Gallery, London. Artist of the year Jane &amp; Louise Wilson, for their colourful and compelling Baltic, Gateshead, multi-screen video installation A Free and Anonymous Monument.
