Recent exit polls have confounded campaign polling and pundit expectations. Projections of possible Tory advance in 2015 and retreat in 2017 came as massive surprises. Predictable or not, the exit polls\u2019 results will be the main talking point for at least an hour, as the first declarations are awaited. Expect much praise from parties the new figures project will do well and, from those given poor marks, plenty of scepticism \u2013 which can boil over into rash pledges later regretted. Maybe put the kettle on. There\u2019s a long night to come. 11.30pm-1am: early results arrive The first results will arrive just before midnight, with seats in Sunderland and Newcastle racing to declare. The very early results are skewed towards safe Labour seats in the north-east. These are unlikely to change hands, but keep an eye on the swings in heavily Leave voting seats such as Newcastle North or Houghton and Sunderland West, where a strong Tory showing may be a harbinger of blue gains later on. 1am-2.30am: will the \u2018red wall\u2019 hold? We should start to get reports from the \u201cred wall\u201d of traditionally Labour but heavily Leave-voting seats in the Midlands and north, which could determine if the Tories\u2019 push for a majority will succeed. Workington (Labour since 1918 barring one by-election blip) and Darlington (Labour in all but one election since 1964) are expected to be the first such seats to declare \u2013 gains here will suggest the Tory strategy is on track. A bit later we\u2019ll hear from Sedgefield (Labour since 1935 and Tony Blair\u2019s old seat), Leigh (Labour since 1922, Andy Burnham\u2019s old seat) and West Bromwich East (Labour since its creation in 1974, Tom Watson retiring). Any gains will suggest the red wall is breached, shortening the odds on a comfortable Conservative majority for the first time since 1987. 2.30am-4am: look north and west Results will come thick and fast, and the picture in the main English battlegrounds will become clearer. But keep an eye on events outside England. Scotland is crucial to Tory hopes: they have 13 seats to defend after surging here in 2017, and every successful Scottish defence is one less gain needed elsewhere. Tory strategists will breathe more easily if the party can keep seats such as Angus, Moray, and Aberdeen South. There are other Scottish subplots. Scottish Labour is fighting for survival, and defeats in ultra-marginal seats such as Midlothian and Glasgow North East may presage a total wipeout. The Liberal Democrats also have gains to defend against a resurgent SNP, including the East Dunbartonshire seat of party leader Jo Swinson. Watch out also for Wales, where marginals are thick on the ground. Seats such as Wrexham, Gower and Vale of Clwyd are key Tory targets. The Liberal Democrats will hope to hold their byelection gain from the Tories in Brecon and Radnorshire. 4am-5.30am: revolt in London and Remainia? The flow of results becomes a torrent, and we should get an idea of whether the result is a clear victory or another closely divided Commons. One crucial piece of the puzzle will fall into place relatively late, as many of the strong Remain seats in central London and the south-east commuter belt are expected to take a while declaring. Lib Dem prospects hinge on such seats, and they may play a large role in determining the Conservatives\u2019 fate if results elsewhere have disappointed. Lib Dem hopes hinge on consolidating the Remain vote to gain southern marginals such as Cheltenham and Winchester, where they came second in 2017. Meanwhile Labour will be hoping a tactical squeeze of the Lib Dem vote can help them hold on to 2017 gains such as Canterbury, Reading East, and Warwick and Leamington. Polling in the London battlefield suggests big increases in Lib Dem support. High-profile defectors may reinforce this trend in heavily Remain-voting seats such as Finchley and Golders Green, Kensington and the Cities of London and Westminster, all of which are unpredictable three-cornered fights. 5.30am-noon: a late plot twist? Most results will be in by now, but late-declaring seats and recounts could provide material for a final plot twist. Key Lib Dem targets including Wells and St Ives and Richmond Park, are expected late, as are Hendon and Truro and Falmouth. The Tories could also lose late-declaring Devon East to a popular local independent candidate who ran them close last time. A narrow Tory majority could still evaporate as dawn breaks. All night long: Portillo moments Some declarations help tell the broader story; others become stories in their own right. These have been known as Portillo moments since 1997, when the shock defeat of cabinet minister Michael Portillo by Stephen Twigg was the defining image of the New Labour landslide. There will be moments of triumph or disaster for MPs who have broken with their parties since 2017 and are standing as independents or under new party colours. Former Tory cabinet ministers Dominic Grieve and David Gauke will hope that Remain partisanship trumps Tory loyalties as they seek election as independents in Tory heartlands, while Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger are the most prominent Labour defectors seeking re-election as Lib Dems or independents. The election will be a day of reckoning for some high-profile loyalists too. Polling suggests foreign secretary Dominic Raab is struggling in his heavily Remain seat of Esher and Walton. Veteran Eurosceptic John Redwood is also out of step with opinion in Remain-leaning Wokingham, and faces a strong challenge from Tory-to-Lib Dem defector Philip Lee. Demographic trends are running against the Tories in Chingford and Woodford Green, seat of former party leader Iain Duncan Smith, and against Labour in Bolsover, which Dennis Skinner has held since 1970. There is also some chance we will see the biggest Portillo moment of all \u2013 the defeat of a sitting prime minister. Boris Johnson\u2019s Uxbridge and South Ruislip seat is rapidly shifting in a Labour-friendly direction. The past few turbulent years have provided many vivid images, but surely few would rival a prime minister facing up to personal defeat, flanked by satirical candidates Lord Buckethead and Count Binface, even as his party triumphs nationwide.
