Between the party, the cards from suppliers offering their \"best wishes for repeat business in 2007\" and the office lunch lottery of blandness, Christmas in the office can sometimes be a bit of an ordeal. It's not that we don't want to celebrate the festive season but that we'd rather it wasn't all done in such a formulaic manner. So, for the final Canteen Culture of the year, we suggest you celebrate Christmas with the wonder that is cake. Rather than using your lunch hour to nip to the pub and grab a sandwich on the way back, why not get a group of colleagues to take an extended break at 11 o'clock (for \"elevenses\") and then another in the afternoon (for afternoon tea) and rather than sandwiches you can serve cake, including this classic creamy lemon pie from specialists Chesters Cafe By The River. Cakes at the ready, all you have to do is distract the health and safety officer with a rumour of an unsecured cable so that you can brew up a good pot of tea. Try a generous slice of cake and wish each other a cake-filled Christmas and very biscuity New Year. Ingredients for the base 400g digestive biscuits 200g melted butter Ingredients for the topping 800g of condensed milk 286ml whipping cream The juice and zest of 3 unwaxed lemons Method Heat the butter in a pan until melted and pour into a bowl. Crush the biscuits and add to the melted butter and mix. Pack the butter and biscuit base into the bottom of a 10in sandwich tin with a loose base (the loose base makes life a lot easier when you're serving the pie). While you're making the topping put the tin in the fridge to harden slightly. Combine the condensed milk and the whipping cream in a bowl using a food mixer if you have one; if you haven't you can survive with a whisk and some elbow grease. The aim isn't to whip the cream or make the mixture stiff, simply to combine the ingredients, so it shouldn't take too long at all. Then add the juice and the zest from the lemons. Again you won't need to mix it for long (about five seconds) before it should thicken naturally. Spoon this mixture on top of the biscuit base and return to the fridge overnight. Transport to work in a cake tin and then keep it in the office fridge until elevenses time rolls around.
