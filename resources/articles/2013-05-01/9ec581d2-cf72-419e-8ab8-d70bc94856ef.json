The occasionally out-of-sorts Rocket shot four centuries and leads Barry Hawkins 10-7 after an enthralling opening day of this Crucible denouement. The final frame was a belter and could prove crucial, with Hawkins throwing away the chance to go to bed only a frame down with a dreadful safety shot on the final black. It was a shame, as moments previously he had exhibited Houdini-esque levels of escapology to extricate himself from a ridiculous snooker behind pink and black to not just hit but fluke a long green on the double. Lesser men would have claimed they had meant to do it. After a year in self-imposed exile, it has been an eventful fortnight in the life of O'Sullivan. The defending champion has been tut-tutted for making a lewd gesture with his cue and has waxed lyrical about legal costs, school fees, a former girlfriend and the parlous state of his finances. He has also threatened \u2013 one hopes idly \u2013 to pack in snooker altogether for a more idyllic life on a barge. For two weeks the Rocket has been box office, centre stage and hogging a spotlight he claims to abhor. But for all his grumbling, he has been the stand-out player at this tournament in a state of affairs that ought to prompt feelings of envy and no little embarrassment among peers who have failed to test a player unbeaten in four previous finals, but who has barely swung his cueing arm in the past 11 months. For his unheralded opponent, this was virgin territory. Ranked 14 in the world, Hawkins took a couple of notable scalps en route to this showdown, but reserved his steeliest snooker until now for a remarkable semi-final comeback that did for Ricky Walden in an often scrappy war of attrition. Rather mean-spiritedly, the presence of such an apparent no-hoper in the final had pundits thumbing the record books in search of heavy defeats. John Parrott's 18-3 humbling at the hands of Steve Davis in 1989 is the nadir and will remain so. The 34-year-old from Kent equalled the Liverpudlian's derisory haul in a blistering afternoon session that lasted less than two hours. Featuring seven breaks over 70 and rounded off by two centuries, it ended with O'Sullivan 5-3 up and voicing concerns about the speed of the baize. A fabled frontrunner, O'Sullivan took first blood with a break of 74, following up with a brisk 92 to double his lead. For the underdog, the early signs were ominous, but nerve-steadying breaks of 88 and 81 in the third and fourth frames restored parity and after winning the fifth, Hawkins became the first player to lead the reigning champion at any point during this championship. Game on or a huge mistake? O'Sullivan responded to his opponent's impertinence with a three-frame slap-down, including back-to-back centuries \u2013 the first and second of this final \u2013 putting him level with Stephen Hendry's Crucible record of 127 tons. O'Sullivan repeated the feat in the evening session, snapping back to make the record his own with consecutive hauls of 103 and 106 after Hawkins had posted a mighty 133 to level the score at 7-7. These thrilling efforts came in the wake of five comparatively dreary frames in which both players traded consecutive blows. Blowing the final frame will gnaw away at Hawkins but he has all but made fools of those predicting an O'Sullivan victory with a session to spare. Barring an unlikely afternoon whitewash it will not happen but the prospect of a massive upset remains very real."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
