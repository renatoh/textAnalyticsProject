Chelsea find themselves 11 points behind City going into their home game against Swansea City on Wednesday evening and, having suggested after Saturday\u2019s 1-1 draw at Liverpool that the club needed to enter January\u2019s transfer market in order to get anywhere near Pep Guardiola\u2019s side, the Italian has now called on those above him to seek out his advice in regards to exactly which players need to come in at the turn of the year. \u201cI think about this topic but it is better if my club ask me what I need to catch them up and then I will answer, but in a private way,\u201d said Conte, who has already voiced his frustrations with Chelsea\u2019s dealings in the transfer market in the close season. Explaining in more detail, the Italian said: \u201cWe are in November and now we have to fight with this squad and I want to repeat that I am very happy to work with these players and try to do our best [this season]. If one day the club try to ask me something about this topic, I can give my opinion but at the same time I am very happy to work for this club with these players. The club knows very well we are trying to build something important for the present and for the future.\u201d For now Conte said Chelsea\u2019s first target is to overtake Manchester United, who are second. \u201c[Considering] the problems we had at the start of the season we are doing our best,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you leave Manchester City out of the table there is [United] and we are three points behind. City are doing something incredible but we have to continue to improve our work with our team and try to do our best. \u201cWe have to look at ourselves and not the others. Now our target must be to see the team that is before us. Our first target is to try and catch [Manchester United] up and, if we are able to do this, then we can see the team who is staying before us.\u201d Conte would not be drawn on any plans to strengthen the squad in the January transfer window. \u201cNow is not the right moment to talk about this topic,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must be focused to go game by game and go with my players to take as many points as possible. To try to reduce this gap to Manchester United and then we have to try to do this with Manchester City.\u201d Chelsea will be without the services of David Luiz, who had only just returned to the Stamford Bridge squad after being dropped by Conte. The central defender played in the 3-0 Champions League away win at Qarabag and was on the bench at Anfield but the manager revealed on Tuesday that the Brazilian had since suffered a knee injury that will keep him out of action for an indefinite period. Conte was unable to confirm if the current niggle was a new issue or a recurrence of the knee problems David Luiz battled with last season. \u201cI must be honest at the moment it is difficult for me to answer. It will be up to the doctor to assess it and take the best decision. I don\u2019t know how long he will be out,\u201d admitted the manager. A club spokesman later said there may be a further update before the Swansea game."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
