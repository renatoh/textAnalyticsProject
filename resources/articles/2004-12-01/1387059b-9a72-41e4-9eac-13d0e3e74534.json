But no! It's because there isn't a pretty bunch of begonias brightening up your desktop, you poor petal. Luckily, revolutionary new website Power Pots (www.powerpots.co.uk) will soon see to that. Designed by professional nest featherer Rita Konig in conjunction with - act impressed, now - a \"top behavioural psychologist\", the site matches flower types to desired office moods. Apparently \"putting a jaunty Narcissus 't\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate' in reception will cheer up visiting clients,\" while \"a beautiful Muscari in a beautiful pot will calm fraying tempers and soothe stress heads!\" As anyone who recalls the day Kim and Aggie came to the Guardian's offices can tell you, even the hardiest of perennials would have a job flourishing in this pit, but it's a fragrant idea all the same. Don't get too excited, now: the site doesn't launch until for real until January 3 2005. \u00b7 Despite the health hazards that go along with life surrounded by mucky pups who don't know how to clean up after themselves, at least no one here is in danger of going deaf. Unlike the UK's 568,000 bar, pub and club workers, of course. As reported last week, these nocturnal troopers are being subjected to music so earsplitting that they could lose or permanently damage their hearing. If campaigners get their way, discos in the future may only be allowed to play tunes at volumes only fairies can hear. But we desk-bound dullards mustn't get all complacent just because we're not subjected to the Weather Girls as part of our daily grind. A hippopotamic hazard is just around the corner for most of us, wrapped in the deceptively harmless guise of the office party. So you think the biggest danger posed at your bash is the prospect of acting like a bit of a tool after too much mulled wine? Think again. According to the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and the ever-cautious TUC, all too many office parties result in injuries, breakages, fires, food poisoning and - gulp - \"worse\". Cripes. Advice from their handy checklist on how to avoid a festive disaster includes: 1 Make sure you and other party organisers know what the late-night security arrangements for your office are. Some offices may lock doors and stairwells at night, which could cut off an emergency escape. (NB. This could work to your advantage if you're planning an amorous assault on one of your co-workers. Get locked in the stairwell after hours and they will, quite literally, have no escape. Huzzah!) 2 Office furniture isn't designed to be as sturdy as the furniture in your local pub, so dancing on desks could do them and you a lot of damage. Likewise, the boardroom table is meant for weighty documents, not overweight executives. (Note to the naughties: this goes for horizontal tangoing too). 3 Keep fresh party food in a fridge, and don't leave it out in a hot office all day. Remember to keep fresh and cooked meats separate. Prawn vol-au-vent poisoning could see half your colleagues off sick until the new year. 4 It might be best to leave out the mistletoe (and not just because the berries are poisonous). Cases of sexual harassment at parties are often attempted to be excused as \"a bit of fun\" rather than a serious workplace issue. If a party is clearly a works party though, it's likely that any harassment would be covered by sexual harassment at work rules. In any case, behaviour of this sort is unacceptable. The excuse that \"everyone else was doing it\" is no defence either. Party planners can download the full checklist at www.worksmart.org.uk/officeparty. \u00b7 Now, we wouldn't usually believe this nonsense, but somehow all this Christmas chat has gone to our head like a pint of double-strength turbo shandy and consequently we're taking more heed of ridiculous research than we might normally. Could your choice of sandwich really reveal the \"inner you\", as research by Avery Dennison suggests? Does picking an old-fashioned BLT really indicated a \"hard-working, self-motivated individual who holds traditional family values\"? Can a penchant for tuna and cucumber point to a \"caring and giving individual\"? I'm a chorizo and gherkin girl myself, which no doubt reveals me to be a caustic witch with a bitter take on life, love and everything, but the press release didn't get that far, so we'll never know. \u00b7 And on that bombshell, the last Office Hours of 2004 is upon us. You will have to wait until January 10 for your next fix of workplace-flavoured frivolities. Don't go cold turkey on us.
