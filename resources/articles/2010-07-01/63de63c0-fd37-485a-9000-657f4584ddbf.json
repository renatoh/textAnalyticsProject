It says nothing of the sort. What it concludes is that, for all its inadequacies, care often makes things better for neglected children, and it exposes the serious flaws in comparing outcomes for looked-after children \u2013 damaged by neglect, abuse or both \u2013 with children from stable family homes. Dr Ritchie may be correct that about a third of those in prison are care leavers. But she confuses correlation with causation. Many of the care leavers in prison were in care for relatively short periods after years of neglect in the family home. I do not celebrate the fact that we might need to have more children in care. And our first priority should be to try to support families and make them successful. But we cannot continue to try when the consequences might be irreparable damage to neglected children.
