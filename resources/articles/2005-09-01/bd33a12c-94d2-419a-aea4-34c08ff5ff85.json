Amid fears that the deadlock would lead to a prolonged policy paralysis, the knee-jerk response of dealers was to push the euro down by 1% against the dollar to its lowest in seven weeks, while the stock market tumbled 100 points on opening. It recovered around half this in later trading. Economists warned that whatever coalition was eventually pieced together, it would be much harder to implement the reforms seen by most commentators as necessary to breathe life into the German economy, which has suffered from more than a decade of slow growth and mass unemployment. Although economists thought the most likely coalition would be between the SDP, the CDU and the Greens, they warned that this coalition would struggle to find common ground. Stephen Lewis of Monument Securities said: \"While the markets are assuming that German politicians will find a way out of the current impasse through forming a government on the basis of a wide coalition of parties, none of the potential combinations look easy to achieve.\" Robert Prior, a European economist at HSBC, agreed: \"We have different degrees of pessimism about the possible outcomes.\" Gerhard Schr\u00f6der launched a package of pension, health and labour reforms last year to try to drag Europe's largest economy out of years of stagnation. But the unpopular measures have so far failed to do more than put a dent in the jobless total and cost his party a string of regional elections, triggering an election a year ahead of schedule. Angela Merkel's CDU has a more aggressive agenda but voters seem to have shied away from this. Its manifesto includes tougher proposals for labour market reform than those of the SDP. \"Mrs Merkel is now in such a weak position that it is unlikely she will be able to see through any radical reforms,\" Mr Prior said. The performance of the German economy since the early 90s has been disappointing, with economic growth around a third of that in Britain. Unemployment has ballooned to almost 5 million - the highest level since the second world war. The only bright spot has been the manufacturing sector, which has performed strongly in recent years. But consumer spending has been weak as uncertainty about the economic outlook has made people save rather than spend. German retailers have suffered as a result of the depressed consumer sentiment and are keen for further economic reforms. Hans-Joachim K\u00f6rber, the chief executive of the German retailer Metro, said: \"In view of the great challenges which we are facing, Germany needs a clear, untrammelled majority in the Bundestag.\" He added: \"The deregulation of the labour markets and the fundamental reform of the social insurance systems, too, must be tackled seriously and without delay\". But some market commentators were more optimistic, thinking that the Germans do want reforms but not at the pace that was being offered by the CDU. Nick Parsons, the head of research at Commerzbank, said: \"Germans want things carefully mapped out with a sense of purpose and leadership.\" The proposal by the CDU to raise VAT by two percentage points and to introduce flat tax was just too radical for the electorate, he added. \"This election reflects that there is an appetite for change.\" Those feeling the most frustrated by the election result were likely to be in the US and Britain, Mr Lewis said. \"They hoped it would usher in a German government that would lead the rest of Europe in free-market, pro-US directions. A prolonged period of relative German political weakness probably lies ahead.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
