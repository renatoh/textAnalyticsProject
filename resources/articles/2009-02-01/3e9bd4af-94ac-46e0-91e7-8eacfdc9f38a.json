Their record-breaking unbeaten run rumbles on but the 21st game without defeat was the most controversial, the substitute Max-Alain Gradel curling home a free-kick in the 97th minute, two minutes after injury time was supposed to have ended. An enraged MK Dons bench protested in vain as Gradel's late goal, coupled with Matty Fryatt's early strike, cancelled out two goals either side of half-time from the midfielder Peter Leven. Leicester remain 12 points clear of the Dons at the top of League One, though Roberto Di Matteo's side have two games in hand. This stadium is a work in progress, the upper tier to be completed when a promotion \u2013 or maybe two \u2013 attracts even greater crowds to see Pete Winkelman's \"new\" club in England's most iconic new town. Back-to-back promotions and a first appearance in the Championship for the Dons of Milton Keynes is attainable after a superb first season for Di Matteo, picking up where Paul Ince left off before his League Two-winning performance earned him his ill-fated Blackburn adventure. Leicester City's move from the historic Filbert Street to the ultra-modern Walkers Stadium was predicated on the club's Premier League adventure continuing; instead they find themselves in the third tier of English football for the first time in their 124-year history. Fears of languishing like Leeds were mingled at the start of the season with a cockiness that led many fans, and even the club shop, to treat the coming 46 games as a unique tour of a world they had never known and would not be visiting again. Those \"Leicester City on tour\" T-shirts may have irked other fans, tempting fate they may have been, but Nigel Pearson's side came intothe game having broken the club's previous record for unbeaten league games \u2013 a 1-0 win away to Bristol Rovers last Saturday was their 20th league game without defeat \u2013 and everyone at MK Dons, from the chairman, to the manager and the captain, Dean Lewington, maintained beforethe top-of-the-table clash, that the Foxes are champions in waiting. Fryatt , arguably the champions elect's chief catalyst this season, scored his 27th goal of the season after a mere four minutes. Spinning like a top in the area, wrong-footing Miguel Llera and Sean O'Hanlon, before shooting under Willy Gu\u00e9ret from six yards. The home side responded well and Luke Chadwick could have scored on eight minutes and should have scored a minute later. The first shot from distance was of his own making, coming at the end of a slaloming, incisive run. The second was a glaring miss after a clever pass from Aaron Wilbraham afforded the midfielder time and space in the box. MK Dons had another glorious chance on 20 minutes. This time Chadwick was the provider, breaking at pace before finding Wilbraham wide on the right. The striker's centre menacingly crossed the six-yard area but his partner Jason Puncheon, on loan from Plymouth Argyle, failed to make contact. In the 14 games he had played for the Dons before yesterday Puncheon had yet to taste defeat and as the first half progressed, thanks in no small part to the striker's work rate, the prospect of an equaliser seemed more viable. Parity was achieved on 36 minutes when Leven scored from 25 yards. His left-foot shot was struck low and hard, but Mark Bunn, on loan from Blackburn was slow in diving to his left and could have got a stronger hand to the ball. Bunn was fallible again just before half-time, his feeble palming of the ball allowed Puncheon a shot from the edge of the area, Matthew Oakley clearing the ball off the line to save Bunn's blushes. What began like a coronation ceremony ended in the 52nd minute when Leven scored his second, comically bundling Wilbraham's square ball over the line. The home side looked sure to take all three points and a massive step towards automatic promotion until Gradel's late equaliser."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
