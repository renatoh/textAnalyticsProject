On a day when Jones repeatedly insisted he was revelling in the pressure and heat of an up-and-down Six Nations campaign, England\u2019s coach stumbled a little too close to the fire during a fractious press conference when asked whether he still meditated. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever spoken about meditation,\u201d said Jones, who has a Japanese-American mother. \u201cYou must be thinking about someone else \u2013 maybe another half-Asian person.\u201d Then, smiling, he added: \u201cMaybe we all look the same.\u201d Perhaps it was an attempt at a joke that backfired. Or maybe Jones was suggesting he felt he was the victim of racist attitudes but what made the exchange so unexpected was that moments earlier the same journalist had asked Jones, in the wake of Caroline Flack\u2019s death, how he looked after his players\u2019 mental health. \u201cThat\u2019s a very interesting question,\u201d he replied, before paying his respects to Flack\u2019s family and explaining England had an \u201cindividual way of looking after each player as well as we can\u201d. It was not as if meditation was a taboo subject for Jones, either. Last summer he spoke wisely on a podcast about the benefits of mindfulness and doing 5am breathing exercises. Jones later apologised to the reporter in private and an RFU spokesman quickly clarified no malice was intended by his remarks. \u201cEddie made an off-the-cuff comment during the press conference, which was not intended to cause any offence. He has subsequently spoken to the journalist privately explaining this and apologised, which was accepted.\u201d This is far from the first time that Jones has caused controversy. Two years ago he also apologised after a video emerged in which he referred to \u201cthe scummy Irish\u201d and Wales as a \u201clittle shit place\u201d during a speech. But relations between Jones and some sections of the media are now more strained, although the genesis of the tension is disputed. Some suggest that some reporters\u2019 noses have been put out of joint by comments in Jones\u2019s recent autobiography, or with his unwillingness to put up more Saracens players for interview. Others, though, believe that Jones is less inclined to cooperate after reading reports he gave France ammunition with some of his comments before the Six Nations began. Either way, the tension and tetchiness sometimes was noticeable on Thursday, although Jones brushed off suggestions he was not enjoying this Six Nations. \u201cI like all this heat around,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are at our best when we are under pressure. I\u2019m always under pressure, which is a great thing. That\u2019s when you come to the fore.\u201d But when it was put to him that the scrutiny had eased after the victory over Scotland at Murrayfield, he replied: \u201cIf you read the papers and what you are writing then there is a possibility that we could be under pressure.\u201d Jones was almost as forthright when asked about the strength of Ireland\u2019s aerial game. \u201cThere\u2019s a perception they\u2019re strong,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s been cultivated through the years of players that have come through with a Gaelic football background. \u201cBut we believe we\u2019ve got some pretty good armoury in that area. And we are happy to take them on in the air, if the conditions dictate it\u2019s an aerial contest.\u201d When pressed further he said: \u201cI think we\u2019ve got an advantage in that area.\u201d Jones was blunt when asked what he made of the U2 singer Bono giving a pep talk to Ireland\u2019s squad earlier in the week. \u201cI\u2019m not interested in talking about Bono,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not into celebrities, mate.\u201d There is more sparring with the press again to come. Unusually Jones has put himself up for every media opportunity in the last week \u2013 four in all \u2013 and is scheduled to appear on Friday and Saturday, too. The Bath prop Beno Obano could well be in line for his first cap after being recalled to the squad because of injury doubts over Joe Marler and Ellis Genge and the return of the loosehead prop Mako Vunipola to Tonga for family reasons. \u201cBeno\u2019s on the freight train, just in as a bit of cover,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a few niggles, so we just needed an extra prop in there.\u201d Jones had already announced an enlarged 27-man squad \u2013 two more than usual at this stage of the week \u2013 for a match England need to win to keep their Six Nations hopes alive."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
