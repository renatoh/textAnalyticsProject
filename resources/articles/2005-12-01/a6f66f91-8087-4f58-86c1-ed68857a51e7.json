The protesters called for a clear timetable for the introduction of universal suffrage, something promised - without a deadline - under the mini-constitution that came into effect when the former British colony reverted to Chinese rule in 1997. The demonstration signalled the end of a honeymoon period for Mr Tsang, whose popularity has ebbed since he came to power in June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
