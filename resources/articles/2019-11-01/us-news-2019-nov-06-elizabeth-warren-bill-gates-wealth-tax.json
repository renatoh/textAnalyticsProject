Speaking at the New York Times DealBook conference on Wednesday, Bill Gates balked at Warren\u2019s tax policies. \u201cI\u2019ve paid over $10bn in taxes. I\u2019ve paid more than anyone in taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cIf I had to pay $20bn, it\u2019s fine.\u201d \u201cBut when you say I should pay $100bn, then I\u2019m starting to do a little math over what I have left over.\u201d Warren, who has proposed a 6% tax on wealth over 10 figures, reassured Gates that he wouldn\u2019t have to pay $100bn, and offered to meet with him to explain. At the conference, Gates had said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure how open-minded she is \u2013 or that she\u2019d even be willing to sit down with somebody who has large amounts of money.\u201d Warren responded: \u201cI\u2019m always happy to meet with people, even if we have different views.\u201d Despite being a vocal critic of Donald Trump, Gates also wouldn\u2019t commit to supporting Warren in a hypothetical race between her and Trump: \u201cI\u2019m not going to make political declarations. But I do think no matter what policy somebody has in mind \u2026 whoever I decide will have the more professional approach in the current situation, probably is the thing I will weigh the most. And I hope that the more professional candidate is an electable candidate.\u201d Critics pointed out that the Microsoft founder and philanthropist would still remain extremely wealthy under Warren\u2019s plan. And even if he were to pay that much, he\u2019d still have some money left over. On Thursday, Gates replied to Warren on Twitter, saying: \u201cI greatly respect your commitment to finding ways to address wealth inequality and poverty at home. While we may disagree about some of the ways to get there, we certainly agree we need a lot of smart people committed to finding the path forward.\u201d This isn\u2019t the first time Warren has contended with disgruntled billionaires. Last week, the billionaire money manager Leon Cooperman exchanged tense words with Warren on Twitter and sent her a letter criticizing her \u201cvilification of the rich\u201d. \u201cLeon can and should pitch in more,\u201d she responded, \u201cso that every kid has the same opportunities he did to succeed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
