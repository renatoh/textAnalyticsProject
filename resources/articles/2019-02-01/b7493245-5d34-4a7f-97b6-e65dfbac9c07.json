Luke Shaw was outstanding in the club\u2019s 3-1 win at Crystal Palace on Wednesday, having also starred in the 0-0 home draw with Liverpool on Sunday. According to Romelu Lukaku, the 23-year-old left-back has been United\u2019s player of the season so far. And it has been difficult to ignore the evidence that his performances have gone up a level since Solskj\u00e6r took over from Jos\u00e9 Mourinho in December. The Norwegian has brought liberation to virtually every pore of the club and it has been clear to see how players such as Paul Pogba and Marcus Rashford have thrived under his charge. But Shaw, too, has grown, having been encouraged by Solskj\u00e6r to play higher up the pitch and express himself more freely. Moreover, and this might be key, he has been able to do so without the fear of reprisals if he makes mistakes. Shaw had always felt like one of Mourinho\u2019s whipping boys. In March last year, the then manager humiliated him by substituting him at half-time against Brighton in the FA Cup. There were other examples of Mourinho publicly taking him to task: one of the most infamous came in April 2017 when he urged Shaw to change his football brain. It should be noted that Mourinho\u2019s predecessor, Louis Van Gaal, also preferred the stick to the carrot when it came to dealing with Shaw. Mourinho would argue that the tough love worked. Last October, Shaw was rewarded for his positive start to the season with a new five-year contract; a development that had previously been hard to foresee. Yet what has shone through behind the scenes during Shaw\u2019s trials and tribulations has been his mental toughness. Mourinho would criticise him over his mentality but it takes a hard edge to withstand the knocks that Shaw has taken, which include the horrific leg break that he suffered in September 2015. Before the start of pre-season, Shaw took himself to Dubai for a personal training camp with United\u2019s head of strength and conditioning, Gary Walker, and he always believed that this would be the season when United saw the best of him, having taken him from Southampton for \u00a327m in 2014. Lukaku, who scored twice in the victory at Palace, had no doubts either. \u201cLuke\u2019s our player of the season \u2013 from the start until now, he\u2019s been the most consistent,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy? His preparation. The whole summer, we were in touch, when I was in Russia [with Belgium for the World Cup], I used to get videos of him working out and stuff. \u201cI knew that this year would be his year. That\u2019s what I told him, as well, at the end of last season \u2013 that he has the potential to be the England left\u2011back for many, many years and for Manchester United, the same. It\u2019s about being that guy. \u201cThe previous criticism did not hurt him. People that don\u2019t know Luke don\u2019t know that he\u2019s mentally really tough. It\u2019s a side that not a lot of people talk about but it has to be known that, mentally, he\u2019s a really strong guy.\u201d Shaw takes all of the credit for his upsurge but it feels as though he has responded to the tactical and man\u2011management approach of Solskj\u00e6r who, at present, can do little wrong. Even Lukaku, who has been on the bench more times than he has started under Solskj\u00e6r in the Premier League, speaks warmly of him. \u201cI like him,\u201d Lukaku said. \u201cHe\u2019s really open, really honest in his communication. He keeps me hungry so whenever I get a chance to play, I just want what\u2019s best for the team and to help the team win.\u201d The Palace success meant that Solskj\u00e6r maintained his perfect away record as the United manager \u2013 it is now eight wins out of eight in all competitions \u2013 while his complete league record reads P11 W9 D2. He could not have done any more to press his candidacy for the post beyond the end of the season because the results have been accompanied by fast and exciting football. At the heart of everything has been the change in atmosphere that Solskj\u00e6r has overseen. United have made no secret of how this had to happen after Mourinho. Shaw has enjoyed the benefits."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
