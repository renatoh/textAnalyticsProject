Six years later its successor, UK Athletics, is also on the verge of being declared broke - not financially, but morally. There was much wrong with the BAF but at least its integrity remained intact and it had principles, something UK Athletics is sadly lacking if its stance over drugs is any guide. Peter Radford, the former chief executive of the BAF, once gave a speech about drugs that was described as \"Churchillian\". When it comes to doping, the policies of his successor at UK Athletics, David Moorcroft, appear, sadly, to owe more to Neville Chamberlain and appeasement. That is the only conclusion that can be drawn from UK Athletics' official endorsement of East Germany's former drugs guru Dr Ekkart Arbeit as coach to the Olympic heptathlon champion Denise Lewis. This is a man who in the 70s and 80s was the architect of what has been described as the \"largest pharmacological programme in history\". He is a man who Stasi documents reveal once reported two coaches under his supervision for refusing to administer drugs to athletes. His fingerprints are all over the most shameful period in sport's history. But it's OK because, according to Lewis and her chief coach Frank Dick, it all happened a long time ago, so it does not matter any more. Well, trying tell that to the former discus thrower Brigitte Michel. She is one of 142 female athletes who will suffer from menstrual and gynaecological problems for the rest of her life as a result of being part of Arbeit's drugs programme. \"There is not a single day without pain,\" she says. The most severe case involves Heidi Kreiger, the 1986 European shot put champion, who was given so many steroids she developed male characteristics and had to have a sex change. She had been given five steroid tablets daily from the age of 16 under a drugs schedule drawn up by Arbeit. Some were as young as 14 when they were given drugs without their knowledge by coaches who were operating under Arbeit's orders. This has led to many giving birth to children suffering from blindness, heart conditions, deformed limbs - all as a by-product of their mothers' heavy ingestion of the steroid Oral-Turinabol. There would be an outcry if a British coach had been involved in such systematic abuse of teenagers and was still allowed to be involved in the sport. Yet in Arbeit's case it seems it is acceptable because it happened in another country in another era. Everyone realises that there is little UK Athletics can do about Lewis working in an individual capacity with Arbeit, who was never convicted because of a loophole in German law. She is an athlete and top athletes are inherently selfish - that is why they are so successful. But by supporting Arbeit's request for accreditation at the European Combined Cups in Tallinn next month, however, UK Athletics confirmed what the rest of the world has increasingly grown to suspect since Moorcroft took over. That when it comes to the fight against drugs, Britain has run the white flag up the pole. In the space of less than eight years Britain has gone from being at the front of the vanguard - when Radford urged the International Association of Athletics Federations to introduce life bans for all drug offenders - to a splinter faction that is actually part of the problem. A few years ago the policy of clearing every athlete who tested positive for the anabolic steroid nandrolone, even though it flew in the face of international sports rules, earned UK Athletics worldwide condemnation. Then, earlier this year, it appointed Linford Christie as coach for an official British international, again despite his record of being a convicted drug cheat. Now it is supporting the appeal for reinstatement of Carl Myerscough, the shot putter who in 1999 tested positive for a cocktail of steroids but has now returned as a genuine contender for a gold medal in the Athens Olympics next year. As a result of that suspension he is barred from the games by the British Olympic Association. That will not be a problem judging by how compliantly quiet the BOA has been over the Arbeit issue, despite the fact it was among the organisations that shouted loudest for justice when the scale of the systematic doping inside East Germany became clear. It would be nice to know what Moorcroft thinks about Lewis's association with Arbeit. But telephone calls to him at UK Athletics last week were returned instead by the performance director Max Jones. Perhaps even Moorcroft realises you cannot defend the indefensible."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
