Brilliant as the joke was the first time around, in the long decades since, the standing of contemporary art has suffered from the \"I could do that\" reaction. The great thing about the transvestite potter Grayson Perry is that, for all his weird playfulness, he churns out a flood of original ideas \u2013 and executes them exquisitely. Few of us could fashion a Ming-style vase, and still fewer would ever think to emblazon it with a pleasing mix of medieval icons and photographs cut out of back copies of Smash Hits. Perry's Walthamstow Tapestry stole the show at last weekend's Frieze art fair, and the full-size version is showing at Islington's Victoria Miro Gallery for another two weeks.

Sometimes there is a satirical logic (the RBS astrologer on the BAE warship), although why the blacksmith-cum-policeman labours alongside \"Marmite\" is anyone's guess. Understand it or not, though, the truth is you would never have dreamed it up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
