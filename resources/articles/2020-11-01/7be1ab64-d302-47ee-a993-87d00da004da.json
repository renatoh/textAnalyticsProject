As the Australian government seeks to navigate its own rocky ties with China, the prospect of constructive talks with the US is likely to be welcomed in Canberra. Meet some of the key people Joe Biden has named in senior roles this week and what they will mean for relations with China, tackling climate change and more. Antony Blinken Australia\u2019s foreign affairs minister, Marise Payne, will be dealing with Antony Blinken, who has been nominated to the senior cabinet position of US secretary of state. Blinken, who was a senior foreign policy adviser for the Biden campaign and previously served as a deputy US secretary of state in the Obama administration, is experienced in diplomacy. Blinken believes Donald Trump made strategic errors by failing to properly coordinate with allies and by withdrawing from international institutions \u2013 giving China an opening to fill. \u201cWe need to rally our allies and partners instead of alienating them to deal with some of the challenges that China poses,\u201d Blinken told a Hudson Institute event in early July. That signals Blinken will listen to feedback from allies such as Australia in framing policies towards China, and that the US will again become active in multilateral bodies, something that will please officials in Canberra. The outgoing US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has previously worried some countries in the region by making broad statements like \u201cthe freedom-loving nations of the world must induce China to change\u201d and by shunning UN bodies. Pompeo\u2019s past comments sound very much like a kind of binary choice that Morrison warned against in a speech this week, in which the prime minister also called on the major powers to give Australia room to move. Blinken has foreshadowed trying to work with China on issues such as climate change, dealing with health emergencies and preventing the spread of dangerous weapons. But one thing that is unlikely to change is America\u2019s overall posture towards a rising China. Blinken has said the US needs to take steps to \u201cdeter aggression if China pursues it\u201d and that \u201cwe are in a competition with China and there\u2019s nothing wrong with competition if it\u2019s fair\u201d. Blinken has also said the US needs to speak up for its values \u2013 similar to the Morrison government\u2019s insistence that Australia is right to speak up about China\u2019s human rights record and other actions. Jake Sullivan Biden will also be relying on advice from Jake Sullivan when it comes to framing America\u2019s approach to security challenges including strategic issues with China. Sullivan, named as Biden\u2019s new national security adviser, was the national security adviser to Biden when he was vice-president in the Obama administration. Sullivan has made positive noises about working with Australia. He said earlier this year that Biden would be \u201ceager to develop a really strong relationship\u201d with Morrison. They were likely to \u201cget off to a strong start\u201d because the former vice-president saw Australia as the kind of partner that was central to a finding successful strategies when faced with a range of issues in a fast-changing world. In a wide-ranging podcast interview with the Lowy Institute in September, Sullivan said like-minded democratic allies would be at the heart of a Biden administration foreign policy, because that was the platform upon which the US could most effectively deal with great power competition and transnational challenges. \u201cAllies are going to have pride of place in the hierarchy of priorities in a Biden administration foreign policy,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cAnd yes, the rise of China is at or near the top of the list of big global challenges that we all have to be working effectively together on.\u201d However, Sullivan has also foreshadowed some difficult conversations with allies regarding climate action \u2013 reflecting the importance Biden has placed on helping to spur more ambitious global action and returning the US to the Paris agreement. In the same podcast interview, Sullivan said while Biden would hold heavy emitters such as China accountable for doing more \u201che\u2019s also going to push our friends to do more as well\u201d because everyone needs to \u201cup their game\u201d. Biden would be respectful with allies, Sullivan said, \u201cbut he\u2019s not going to pull any punches on it\u201d. John Kerry Former US secretary of state John Kerry will be at the centre of those efforts to push countries to lift their level of ambition, having been named as Biden\u2019s special presidential envoy for climate. Kerry has a longstanding interest in the issue, having signed the 2015 Paris agreement on behalf of the US \u2013 a deal from which Trump withdrew his country. Biden has vowed to re-enter the Paris accord from his first day in office in late January 2021. A column in the Australian newspaper this week was highly critical of Kerry and reported that the former Australian prime minister Tony Abbott found the then secretary of state \u201crelentlessly focused on climate change as a security issue\u201d. However, that is by no means a fringe view. In 2015, a report on community consultations for the Australian government\u2019s defence white paper flagged the consequences of climate change, extreme weather events and environmental pressures as a significant security risk for Australia \u2013 second only to the risks posed by terrorism. This was because of the increased need for humanitarian and disaster relief activities, along with climate change driving future unregulated cross-border movements of people. Kerry will sit on the national security council, reflecting the importance Biden places on climate in security deliberations. Janet Yellen The Morrison government and the Biden administration place a high priority on the economic recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic, although the US starts from a position of severe crisis as the virus still runs rampant across that country. Janet Yellen, the former US Federal Reserve chair and former economics professor, will be charged with charting a course to economic recovery as Biden\u2019s nominee for Treasury secretary. Yellen is a well known figure on the world stage, given her past experience, and she travelled to Australia in 2014 for G20 meetings. If confirmed to head Treasury, Yellen will be dealing with the Australian treasurer, Josh Frydenbeg, who has recently championed economic talks among the finance ministers from the Five Eyes countries, which also includes the UK, Canada and New Zealand. Frydenberg has argued the once-in-a-century pandemic only increases the importance of regular talks to share notes on economic recovery strategies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
