This was the match-up everyone wanted to see and 2,403 turned up to Wembley Conference Centre, including a clutch of marquee celebrities. These included Sam Torrance, the most able cueist on the golf circuit, and Terence Stamp, the actor, who played the game in his east-end youth and who paid his first visit to Wembley since the 1966 World Cup with his Australian girlfriend, an O'Sullivan fan. Stamp, whose 40-year film career runs from Billy Budd and Far From The Madding Crowd to The Hit and The Limey, mused that the snooker player and the actor share \"a commitment to the moment\" in which their normal selves are subsumed. Stamp is in London for a marathon voiceover for Pearson TV's 13-part history of football. A few weeks ago, he chanced upon O'Sullivan's uncle Mickey, one of the fighting O'Sullivans who are all boxers whom he knew in his youth. In the White corner, as ever, was Ronnie Wood, a neighbour and mate who has a snooker table in both his homes. When he tours with the Rolling Stones, one member of the entourage is charged solely with erecting his table at each stop. O'Sullivan felt the pressures more keenly even though he led 3-1 and 5-2: \"I'll let other people decide how I played. I was just trying really hard.\" White did nothing special to close to 4-5 but his growing self-belief was evident as, from 34 behind, he made a cool 72 to level at 5-5. O'Sullivan, in play with 42 and 30 in front in the decider, was unlucky not to leave a pot when he opened the bunch of reds but added mistake to misfortune by bungling his safety. White made 35 from it and from O'Sullivan's over-hit safety on the last red, dispatched the remaining balls he needed for a place in tonight's semi-final against either Stephen Hendry or Mark Williams. \"Ronnie usually destroys you when you give him a chance but it didn't happen for him,\" said White. \"I'll have to play more solid against Stephen or Mark.\" \"I love the venue but I don't really like playing in London because there is so much emphasis on me to do well,\" said the world champion O'Sullivan, who made a top break of only 51. It at least keeps alive White's hopes of a second Masters title 18 years after his first. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
