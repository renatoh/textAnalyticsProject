(She once told a taxi driver in Atlanta, Georgia, what she did for a living. \u201cThat sounds relaxin\u2019,\u201d came the reply.) But even Hewitt\u2019s daunting concert series is eclipsed by her 25-year association with Hyperion, recording all those works, and sometimes revisiting them. So it is that The Six Partitas (Hyperion, 2 CDs) are getting a second look, more than 20 years after Hewitt first recorded them to great acclaim in 1997. Don\u2019t expect any major departures. As she says in the liner notes, an allemande is still an allemande; a French courante should still not be rushed; a gigue must remain danceable. The warm praise that greeted that first release could equally attach to this exquisite new set. Hewitt\u2019s playing is characteristically limpid, technically faultless, deeply intelligent and infectiously joyous. Her decades of experience playing this repertoire gives it a special patina; it glows like old gold. Give yourself an early Christmas present; you\u2019ll want to play this again and again. \u2022 Next year marks the 250th anniversary of Beethoven\u2019s birth, so stand by for lorryloads of Ludwig. Getting in early are the period wind instrument ensemble Boxwood &amp; Brass, with volume one in their Beethoven Transformed series (Resonus). They pair his Op 71 Sextet in E flat major with the Op 20 Septet in the same key, arranged for \u201charmoniemusik\u201d forces by his pupil Carl Czerny. Creamy clarinets combine attractively with punchy horns and burbling bassoons to give this music a special Viennese verve. \u2022 Today is Advent Sunday, the start of the liturgical year and preparations for Christmas. The Advent Carol Service sung by the Choir of St John\u2019s College, Cambridge, will be broadcast live on Radio 3 at 3pm, an event in the choral calendar every bit as significant as King\u2019s College\u2019s carols on Christmas Eve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
