I look back and I think, I wish I hadn\u2019t done that\u2019 Michael Gove on his cocaine admission Tweet of the week Any leadership campaign which interrupts me during #LoveIsland will be subjected to a vicious and just the right side of plausible smear campaign. You have been warned #leavemealone Tory MP Paul Masterton gets his priorities straight Endorsement of the week Chris Grayling, the cabinet minister whose rap sheet of cock-ups is second only to the man likely to become the next prime minister, initially held back from supporting any of the contenders. The race was on to avoid the support of the man whose probation reforms were so cack-handed that they forced a Tory government to embrace renationalisation. The candidates must have been mulling over what they could offer Grayling to dodge his backing. Defence? Chancellor? A timeshare in Buckingham Palace and naming rights for the Scilly Isles? But late on Saturday, it emerged that Boris Johnson had drawn the short straw and won the transport secretary\u2019s backing. How this will affect Johnson\u2019s chances is yet to be seen. There was also the rare sight of a Fox (Liam) backing a Hunt (Jeremy) \u2013 but then masochism has been an early feature of this painful campaign. Claim of the week The contest\u2019s self-proclaimed Brexiter-in-chief, Dominic Raab, identified the next phase of Brexit meltdown by refusing to rule out suspending parliament in order to secure a no-deal Brexit. It is part of a wider effort by Brexiters to find the most absurd irony possible in their quest to set British democracy free from the shackles of European servitude. It is not yet clear how temporarily parking parliament, having become prime minister after a vote among 120,000-odd Tory members, hands power back to British democracy. I\u2019m sure all will become clear. Gaffe of the week After his shock announcement that he was \u201cprobably not\u201d a feminist, Raab further endeared himself to female colleagues by insisting he helps \u201cpick up the slack at home\u201d. He was pipped to the post though, by Michael Gove\u2019s admission that he had taken cocaine \u201con several occasions at social events more than 20 years ago\u201d, while a young journalist. It confirms this contest\u2019s status as the most drug-fuelled leadership race in history, though Gove\u2019s effort was both less imaginative than Rory Stewart\u2019s Iranian opium pipe and less on-brand than Jeremy Hunt\u2019s Conservative-friendly cannabis lassi. With increasing talk of a consensus around loosening drug laws, Gove\u2019s admission may not be the devastating slip that it might once have been. Yet in a race decided by Tory members, he may have contrived to disgust the few people left in the country who may actually still care. Good week Self-awareness. It is a quality that hasn\u2019t had so much as a look-in so far during this fight, but it made an appearance when Kit Malthouse revealed not only that he was a Tory MP, but that he was pulling out of the race to be the next prime minister. In a triumph for nominative determinism, James Cleverly also pulled out of the race, narrowing the number of candidates from a stampede to a mere glut. Bad Week Gove\u2019s drugs admission was his second setback of the week. He was also hit with the backing of Tory grandee Oliver Letwin, famed for coming up with brilliant policy ideas and leaving them in bins in public parks. An endorsement from Letwin, a man who once let a burglar into his own home, does not necessarily inspire confidence. It\u2019s also been a bad week for anyone who likes outdated institutions like schools, hospitals, or anything that requires actual money. Various candidates have been pledging Tory-friendly tax cuts that won\u2019t be great for fans of public services. The candidate markets UP: Jeremy Hunt MPs suggested he performed best in hustings, while he secured the surprise support of pro-Brexit cabinet minister Liam Fox. UP: Boris Johnson The frontrunner hasn\u2019t imploded. Yet. DOWN: Andrea Leadsom Her campaign has never really got going. DOWN: Michael Gove Having experienced life\u2019s highs, Gove ends the week on a low."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
