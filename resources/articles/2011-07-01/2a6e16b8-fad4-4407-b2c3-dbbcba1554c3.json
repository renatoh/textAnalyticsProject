Greening played under Steve McClaren, the Nottingham Forest manager, at Middlesbrough and will provide much-needed experience. The former Manchester United trainee moved to Fulham from West Bromwich last July after a successful season-long loan at Craven Cottage. However, his first-team appearances were restricted under former Fulham manager Mark Hughes. He started only six Premier League games last season. Even so, Hughes turned down an approach from Forest to take Greening on loan in February. Routledge, who is also a target for Forest's Championship rivals Leicester City, is available for \u00a31.4m after being deemed surplus to requirements at Newcastle United. Routledge has had success in the Championship with former clubs Crystal Palace, who were promoted via the play-offs in 2004 and was in the Newcastle sidewho went up as champions in 2009-10."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
