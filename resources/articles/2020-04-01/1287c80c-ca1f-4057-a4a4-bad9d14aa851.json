In revealing more detail of a previously announced plan to have students return from week three of term two, the premier said: \u201cDefinitely from May 11 \u2026 students will start going back to school.\u201d Schools will have additional cleaning protocols and may even have temperature checks for children. \u201cInitially, it will just be a day a week,\u201d Berejiklian said. \u201cAnd then progressively two days, and then we hope by the end of term two we\u2019ll be in a position to have students going back to school in a full-time capacity by term three.\u201d NSW is in the final week of Easter holidays. The first week of term two was to be next Monday, 27 April. Berejiklian stressed it would be months before schools returned to normal operation. \u201cWe\u2019ve made sure we\u2019ve used this time not just to build up our online capacity, in case children, or a proportion of them do need to continue learning from home, but we\u2019ve also made sure we have enough hand sanitisers, soap and all those things which make a school community feel safe, not just be safe. \u201cSchools will also have capacity for temperature checks where they think it\u2019s appropriate.\u201d The state\u2019s education minister, Sarah Mitchell, paid tribute to schoolteachers and principals for managing the transition to remote learning during the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic: \u201cTheir innovation and the work that they have done to move learning to at home and online has been phenomenal.\u201d The minister said while the government had outlined a broad plan to return schools to full capacity by term three, individual schools would be given \u201cflexibility and discretion\u201d as to how to implement their returns. \u201cWe want them to make sure they are having about a quarter of students on campus each day, but how they break that group up will be a matter for them. \u201cBut we are asking them to certainly consider family groupings, keeping siblings together, so that that will make it a lot easier for parents as we transition back to normal schooling.\u201d Mitchell said extra measures would be taken to protect students and staff. \u201cWe will have extra cleaning, extra sanitiser, extra health provisions, including forehead thermometers, and also extra health equipment in our sick bays. And we\u2019ll also be asking parents to stagger drop-off and pick-up times, and recess and lunch breaks within our schools.\u201d Queensland began term two on Monday, with the state government\u2019s new online learning portal overwhelmed by 1.8 million students trying to access it. The system crashed after just 30 minutes and remained down on Tuesday morning. Only 12% of students in the state physically attended school on Monday, with the rest trying to learn from home. Victorian schools are set to remain closed until the end of term two, but the premier, Daniel Andrews, said those restrictions might be eased if Covid-19 cases remained stable and new infections low. \u201cIf we were continuing to see very stable numbers \u2026 then of course we would always reserve the right to look at those restrictions.\u201d In Western Australia, the government has said schools will be open for all children from the start of term two on 29 April but attendance will be voluntary. \u201cAll parents and carers can choose to send their children,\u201d said the premier, Mark McGowan. \u201cIf parents don\u2019t feel comfortable sending their kids to school, for whatever reason, they will not be obligated to do so. \u201cHowever, year 11 and 12 students are very strongly encouraged to attend.\u201d McGowan said the plan for term two would be reviewed at the end of week three."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
