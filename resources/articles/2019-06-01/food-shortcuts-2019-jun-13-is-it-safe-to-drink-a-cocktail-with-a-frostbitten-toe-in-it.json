If you are at the Artesian in London, the four-time world\u2019s best bar, your glass is also likely to come adorned with a floating pillow filled with aromatic smoke, to be pierced as you take your first sip. What you probably shouldn\u2019t expect is a human toe in your drink. The news on Thursday that British endurance athlete Nick Griffiths was sending his frostbitten and amputated toes to the Yukon in Canada to be sipped in a cocktail, the Sourtoe, will turn the stomachs of most. Yet it is a long-known and notorious tipple, reportedly founded during prohibition when a pair of rum-running brothers were caught in a blizzard and kept a frostbitten toe in whiskey for preservation. The jar \u2013 complete with toe intact \u2013 was then found in 1973 and, for reasons only known to Captain Dick Stevenson, he had a taste. Stevenson then decided to form a Sourtoe Club, where members are initiated once they have drunk a shot of the whiskey and the dead toe has touched their lips. The whiskey has since changed, as have the toes, owing to thefts; in 2013, one man even swallowed the digit on purpose. Griffiths\u2019s toes will reportedly be kept in salt for six weeks before they are served, but British GP Ben Tschobotko cautions against the Sourtoe\u2019s safety. \u201cI certainly wouldn\u2019t do it myself,\u201d he says. \u201cI would worry about drinking it because I don\u2019t know what pathogens might come from a severed toe. While it might be basking in alcohol, it is reused by multiple drinkers so sanitary problems could also arise from there.\u201d Tschobotko says you can only be sure of its safety if each toe is tested in a laboratory. What about the taste, though? \u201cI couldn\u2019t imagine anything worse; it seems almost cannibalistic, touching a dead toe to your lips,\u201d says Michael Boyle, the director of cocktail-makers the Mixology Brothers. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously some kind of challenge \u2013 the drink isn\u2019t important, it\u2019s just about finishing it. We\u2019re trying to move away from waste in cocktails, such as unnecessary garnishes, so as much as the toe is reused, I\u2019d still put it in the category of a useless garnish. It\u2019s just a tourist trap.\u201d Apparently, 100,000 people have tried the drink at the Downtown Hotel in Dawson City \u2013 including early revellers who not only had to touch the toe to their lips but put the whole appendage in their mouth and then spit it out. For Boyle, it is enough to make him teetotal: \u201cThis is the kind of drink that makes people not want to drink again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
