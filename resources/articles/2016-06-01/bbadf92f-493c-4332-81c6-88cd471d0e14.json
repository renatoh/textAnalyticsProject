The bank is offering customers the chance to lock in for two years at an interest rate of 0.99%, but they need a deposit of at least 35% and will pay a product fee of \u00a31,499. David Hollingworth, of mortgage brokers London and Country, described the rate as \u201cabsolutely ridiculously low \u2026 It sets a new benchmark for two-year fixed rates.\u201d He said the fee was \u201cbig, but not the biggest\u201d and that repayments on a \u00a3150,000 mortgage would be \u00a3565 a month. The deal is the cheapest fixed rate on the market, and the lowest ever recorded by the financial information firm Moneyfacts. It matches HSBC\u2019s previous lowest rate, a 0.99% discount deal it offered in 2014, but undercuts Yorkshire Building Society\u2019s current market-leading fixed rate of 1.14%. That loan has a slightly lower fee of \u00a31,345. Rachel Springall, finance expert at Moneyfacts, said: \u201cAs with any deal, applicants should always work out the true cost of the mortgage to decide whether it\u2019s right for them.\u201d Hollingworth said the rate on the deal was one percentage point below the cheapest five-year fixed-rate, a 1.99% mortgage also offered by HSBC. \u201cYou have to weigh that up against the longer-term security of the five-year deal. Two years comes around pretty quickly, but for some people that suits them just fine,\u201d he said. Funds for the loan would be limited, so it was unlikely to be around for a long time, he added. The launch comes as Moneyfacts data shows that rates on two-year fixed-rate mortgages have risen since May, from an average of 2.56% to 2.58%. However, five- and 10-year deals have fallen to all-time lows of 3.16% and 3.46% respectively. Although the Bank of England base rate has remained unchanged since March 2009, mortgage rates have fallen in recent years as the cost of funding the loans has dropped. The recent dip in long-term fixed-rate deals has been driven by investors seeking a haven for their cash in the run-up to the EU referendum on Thursday. Concerns about a Brexit vote have driven money into government bonds, driving yields on them down to record lows. The maximum available to borrowers who take out HSBC\u2019s new mortgage is \u00a3500,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
