Mills escaped punishment for the tackle that ended the Blackburn full-back Vratislav Gresko's season, breaking three bones in the Slovakian's foot, with the referee Paul Durkin oblivious to the incident at the time. Though the Dorset official will not include Mills's challenge in his match report, it is believed he has since conceded after seeing television replays that the tackle should have incured at least a yellow card. \"The tackle that injured Gresko is something we are not very happy with and I'm obviously disappointed we have been left with a badly injured player,\" said the Rovers manager Graeme Souness. He spoke with Durkin after the match and the referee acknowledged that he had missed Mills's lunge. Gresko, on loan from Parma, will be out for at least a month and Blackburn's problems are compounded by the similarly untimely absence of their centre-half Craig Short, who pulled a hamstring during the 3-2 victory at Elland Road. The FA is empowered to activate its video advisory panel when apparent offences have been overlooked and, to that end, will do so over Ferguson's alleged elbowing of Aston Villa's Joey Gudjonsson during Everton's 2-1 win on Saturday if, as expected, the incident is not included in Graham Poll's match report. Bolton's manager Sam Allardyce is hoping Andy D'Urso reconsiders the two yellow cards he issued to Florent Laville during Saturday's 2-2 draw with Arsenal so that the French defender, on loan from Lyon, can feature against Middlesbrough on the final day of the season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
