His career is over due to injury, and his lucrative media deals and appearances on the after-dinner circuit dried up when he developed a stammer. This isn't subtle, quirky comedy. It's bold, very funny, a bit edgy here and there, and acutely observed on the celebrity theme that it has so much mischievous fun with. Podmore's rejected by even the most humiliating reality formats, and here there are real echoes of Reardon, who would at least disdain them. A woman called from Burned Out Celebrity Come Dine With Me. \"We've decided to go down the Cheggers route,\" she explained. Even callers to his show on Don't Get Me Wrong FM gave up on him. \"I'm calling Talksport,\" one snapped. \"David Starkey's on midnight til 6.\" The journey back from this nadir was excruciatingly well drawn, with Podmore using superinjunction legislation in an attempt to stir media interest. He changed his name to The Sportsman Who Cannot Be Named for Legal Reasons. It backfired: he painted his new name on his Mondeo and still nobody mentioned him. That existential void led him on to Newsnight, with his dog who's got a gastric-band. It and Paxman didn't exactly hit it off.
