Inquiry staff said today that the hearings will resume on July 9 for two days to discuss the document that casts doubt on a glowing inspection of Haringey social services, which has faced heavy censure for its handling of Victoria's case. The move will delay publication of the inquiry chairman Lord Laming's report until the end of this year and possibly early 2003. The document was handed over by the social services inspectorate (SSI) in late February, three weeks after the close of the first phase of the inquiry which examined the role of staff and agencies involved in the eight-year-old's care. Denise Platt, the chief inspector of the SSI, has been invited to explain why the report was not presented earlier, as it was produced in April 2001. The report for the SSI and spending watchdog the audit commission criticises their earlier joint review of Haringey council, which declared in November 1999 that service users in the north London borough were \"generally well served\". Several of the council's witnesses at the inquiry referred to the inspection to contradict claims that the department had handled the case poorly. But the internal review of the inspection concluded that it presented \"an overly positive picture of Haringey's social services, particularly children's services\". The council received a zero rating in the new league table of social services performance last month. An inquiry spokesman said: \"Lord Laming has decided that this new document is potentially important and believes its significance can only properly be considered by calling for evidence from the witnesses concerned. Reconvening public hearings is the most fair, just and transparent way of dealing with this matter.\" The public hearings closed last month, having heard evidence from police, social workers and medical staff involved in the case. The inquiry also hosted a series of seminars on how to strengthen child protection."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
