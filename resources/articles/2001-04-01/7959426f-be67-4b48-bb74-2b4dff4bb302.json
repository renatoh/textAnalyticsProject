Both Microsoft and Sun Microsystems announced quarterly profits that surpassed - if only just - Wall Street expectations, while Canada's Nortel reported a hefty loss. The figures, coming just a day after the Fed stunned markets with a half-point cut in borrowing rates, added to the confusing picture of US corporate health confronting policy-makers, with some of the bigger corporations performing well and others showing evidence of sagging profits and sales. Microsoft said earnings had been boosted by stronger sales of its Windows 2000 software. It said that for its third fiscal quarter, ended March 31, it made net profits of $2.45bn (\u00a31.7bn), or 44 cents a share, compared with $2.39bn, 43 cents a share, a year earlier. It posted revenues of $6.46bn, against $5.66bn a year earlier. Sun Microsystems, the network computer maker, beat lowered profit targets in its third quarter but sales missed analysts' target. Sales at the firm, which scaled back its targets in February, rose 2% to $4.1bn from $4bn last year, while operating earnings were $263m, or eight cents per share, against $464m, or 14 cents, a year ago. Nortel Networks, the world's biggest telecoms equipment supplier, reported a first-quarter loss in line with expectations. It said it lost $385m, or 12 cents per share excluding one-time costs, compared with year-earlier net earnings of $347m, or 12 cents per share. PC maker Gateway posted a $503m loss, including $533m of restructuring charges, and said it expected to return to profitability in the second half."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
