Not so for 18-year-old Bo Burnham, possibly the youngest comic to head the bill at a West End theatre. Next month the teenager from Massachusetts will perform on the same stage as comic veterans Roseanne Barr and Joan Rivers in his British debut. Yet until recently he faced not much more than his maths homework in the evenings. The songwriter and comic is being hailed in the United States as the most talented musical satirist since Tom Lehrer. His subversive lyrics and shocking subject matter became hits last year, when he recorded a couple of songs on a synthesiser in his bedroom and posted them on the web for his elder brother, Pete, to watch at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. The songs were passed on around student and academic circles and quickly gained several million internet page hits each. This summer, as he leaves St John's Prep, a Catholic boys' high school, Burnham finds himself represented by one of the country's leading comic talent agencies. He has also found fans for a regular live act in a Boston nightclub. 'I write about what I know: teenage dating, overly charged sexuality, all the things that make you uncomfortable,' said Burnham this weekend from his home in Hamilton, Massachusetts. 'I grew up listening to Steve Martin and Robin Williams, so I didn't ever intend to be a musical comedian. I sort of stumbled into it.' Burnham's lyrics, frequently too explicit to reproduce here, are full of clever puns and dark humour. It is the kind of mordant sophistication that has led to comparisons with Lehrer, the retired Harvard-trained maths professor who became a star in the Sixties. Lehrer's most enduring hits, including 'Poisoning Pigeons in the Park' and a version of the periodic table of chemical elements set to the music of Gilbert and Sullivan, all rely on deadpan delivery and breathtaking breaches of taste. Burnham's songs push the genre still further. This summer he wrote 'New Math', a tribute to the Lehrer song of the same name. 'I really like maths. Music is really, really mathematical,' he explains. A typical lyric in this latest Burnham song makes an esoteric joke about the XXY chromosome description of Klinefelter's Syndrome, an inherited condition that endows a person with both sexual organs. As befits his age, Burnham's customary territory is adolescent angst, with a tendency towards outrageous punchlines. His most controversial songs play with the expectations of the listener. One ballad, called 'Perfect Woman', turns out to be about Helen Keller, the pioneering deaf and blind activist. 'I am going to hell,' Burnham quips. One of his earliest songs, 'My Whole Family (Thinks I'm Gay)', is more mainstream, but it still upset his mother. 'At first I jumped up and down like any parent would and told him to get the songs off the internet,' said Patricia Burnham, a staff nurse at his old school. 'They're not exactly mother-friendly.' Burnham's father, Scott, who runs a construction company, has admitted the videos were 'a little shocking'. 'The key for us is, this hasn't taken over his life. Bo's a smart, serious, hardworking kid.' The teenager has deferred his place at New York University as he takes a year off to perform. He's at the Leicester Square Theatre from 10 to 12 October. \u00b7 This article was amended on September 28 2008. The article above mentioned a song lyric about 'Klinefelter's syndrome, an inherited condition that endows a person with both sexual organs'. This is incorrect. It is a chromosonal abnormality that is not inherited; those with the condition are genetically male with fully functioning male sex organs and symptoms can be improved with medication."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
