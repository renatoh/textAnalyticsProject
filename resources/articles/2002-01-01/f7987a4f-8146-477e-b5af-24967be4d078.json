Solicitors for the Australian, whose job as director of rugby has disappeared in a reduction of staffing levels, were yesterday still in talks with the Rugby Football League to finalise a financial package. A Sydney newspaper claimed yesterday that McCallum had already resigned and would be heading home on February 15. But he said the report was \"erratic\" and his legal team were still in discussions. \"I can't comment other than I expect a resolution in the next 24 to 36 hours,\" he said. McCallum, who has done marvellous work in raising refereeing standards, was due to return to work last Wednesday after a family holiday in Australia but apparently learned that his office had already been cleared, and he was advised by his solicitors not to report for duty. Super League coaches were reluctant to talk about McCallum's situation at such a sensitive time but one leading referee, who did not want to be named, said this week: \"We believe that Greg has played a tremendous part in improving refereeing and other standards in rugby league and we feel it will be a tragedy to lose him. \"The top referees have great respect for him and he has developed a lot of people. His job has changed to a degree during the time he has been here but we have the greatest respect for the work he has done in this country. To get another candidate with a knowledge of the game that Greg has will be very difficult.\" An RFL spokesman said yesterday: \"We have no comment to make and there will be a joint statement released in due course.\" League's Warrington Wolves and union's Sale Sharks may be the next cross-code marriage after Sale's revival of interest in ground-sharing with the Super League club. The Sharks are keen to leave their cramped Heywood Road base - capacity 4,500 - and, with construction of the Wolves' 12,500-seat stadium due to start this summer, relocating there is a strong option. The Sharks' chief executive Peter Deakin dismissed reports that the owner, Brian Kennedy, would take a financial stake in the Wolves if the two clubs shared the \u00a38m stadium. But he added: \"You can never say never.\" Hull have confirmed the signing of the veteran Australian three-quarter Graham Mackay, who will complete their overseas quota. He will leave the Leeds Tykes immediately and join the Humberside players when they return from a training camp in Lanzarote at the end of the week."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
