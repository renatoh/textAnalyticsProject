Maybe so, now that the Conservative thinktank Onward has identified so-called Workington Man and his \u201cstrong rugby league traditions\u201d as a key target for Boris Johnson\u2019s election campaign. The idea that \u201crugby league traditions\u201d have anything in common with the Old Etonians in charge of Britain is laughable. Rugby league was actually born out of a radical revolt against the stranglehold of the privately educated over rugby. When huge numbers of industrial workers in the north of England took up rugby in the 1880s, the privately educated leaders of the Rugby Football Union tried to restrict access to the game by making it an amateur sport. \u201cWhy should we hand it over without a struggle to the hordes of working men players who would quickly engulf all others?\u201d asked rugby and cricket international Frank Mitchell in 1897. But men working in mines, docks and factories had to take unpaid leave from work to play rugby. Amateurism meant they could not be compensated for the wages lost playing the game, so the northern rugby clubs proposed that players be given \u201cbroken time\u201d payments. Rugby\u2019s leaders refused. Threatened with expulsion, the top northern clubs broke away in 1895 to form the Northern Union, which would become known as rugby league. In response, RFU banned for life anyone connected with rugby league. Players were ostracised for even talking to rugby league officials. In no other sport was Britain\u2019s class divide so starkly illustrated. Rugby league became a sport outside the establishment, with its own traditions of equality and democracy. Eddie Waring, the legendary commentator, hailed the sport as \u201cthe most democratic in the world\u201d. Trade union leaders such as the miners\u2019 Joe Gormley and TUC general secretary John Monks were regulars on the terraces of Wigan and Swinton. Rugby league also has a history of racial integration unique in British sport. In 1935 George Bennett became the first black international rugby league player, over 40 years before the first black English football international. In 1972 Clive Sullivan became the first black Briton to captain a national side, and led Great Britain to a world cup triumph. The sense that the game reflected wider social divisions was highlighted during the 1984-85 miners\u2019 strike, which was fought out in many towns and villages in the north where rugby league was the dominant sport. Rugby league clubs became organising centres for feeding and supporting striking miners and their families. When Rupert Murdoch\u2019s BSkyB tried to force clubs to merge after it bought the game\u2019s TV rights in 1995, many of those who had been on the picket lines in 1984 once again turned out to protest. \u201cThey\u2019ve taken our jobs, now they want to take away our leisure,\u201d was how one demonstrator expressed their anger. Rugby league communities have been devastated by deindustrialisation, austerity and government policies over the past 30 years. Half of the English teams in the Super League come from areas that are in the most deprived 10% in Britain. Workington itself has lost its coal and steel industries, and is a long way from the prosperous town that launched its professional rugby league club in 1945. The attitudes that gave birth to rugby league remain strong. Hostility to the establishment and suspicion of the ruling elite, whether in Westminster or in business, has not diminished. Indeed, the strong Brexit vote in rugby league-playing regions can be seen as a protest vote against a two-party parliamentary system that has continually let down the \u201cpost-industrial\u201d north. Unlike Essex Man or Worcester Woman, Workington Man (Johnson\u2019s consultants appear to be ignorant of the fact that women are also rugby league fans and players) has none of the advantages of living in the economic bubble of the south of England. While dissatisfaction with Labour also runs deep, it is unlikely that traditional rugby league areas in the north of England will fall to the Tories. Although the Brexit party has picked up votes in these areas, Nigel Farage\u2019s Dulwich College accent and golf club-bore demeanour is too great a barrier for him to make any significant breakthrough in areas where stubborn resistance to self-appointed authority is deeply ingrained. As one contemporary writer remarked about the 1895 split, northern rugby and its communities had rejected the \u201cthraldom of the southern gentry\u201d. There\u2019s no reason to suspect that things will change in 2019. As Onward\u2019s misunderstanding of rugby league traditions demonstrates, Britain remains two nations separated by huge class and cultural divisions. And few things illustrate that chasm better than rugby. \u2022 Tony Collins is emeritus professor of history at De Montfort University."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
