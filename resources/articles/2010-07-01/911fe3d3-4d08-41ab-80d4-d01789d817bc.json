In truth, there can be few racing followers who don't think of Channel 4 that way, since the BBC decided last year to hack their output back to the bone. For 46 weeks of the year, Thompson has no competition. He is determined, however, that this should not lead to complacency and stagnation, a threat made greater by the fact that he has used the same production company, Highflyer, for the past 15 years. Highflyer recently had their contract extended to the end of 2012 after what Thompson describes as \"a long, rigorous and very, very useful tender process\" which, he says, identified a number of ways in which the station's racing coverage can be improved. He promises \"continuing changes, which we'll be rolling out over the months in the run-up to the [Cheltenham] Festival next year,\" aimed at \"trying to grab new audiences, building the appeal of the sport\". Few specifics are available but Thompson reveals that The Morning Line, Channel 4's Saturday morning preview show, will be revamped and relaunched later this year. \"Racing is the only sport that has a terrestrial, weekly magazine programme every single week,\" he says. \"We want to put a few more resources into the show and try and change the feel in a number of ways. It'll still be the show where you go for, I hope, the definitive preview of that afternoon's racing. But I think there are other areas we can look at in terms of its wider news coverage, how it is presented, the style and so on.\" More immediately, the former England rugby international Matt Dawson will be added to the Channel 4 team during coverage of Glorious Goodwood, which starts a week on Tuesday. Dawson, who has built up a body of television work including A Question of Sport and Strictly Come Dancing, will be used to make racing more accessible for viewers unfamiliar with its odd customs and recondite jargon. Thompson says he will \"have a look behind the scenes of the sport and, in those areas that are complicated, bring them to life, make them more understandable\". \"He'll ask questions from an informed point of view, from another sport, the questions that wouldn't have been asked in the past,\" adds Andrew Franklin, executive producer at Highflyer. A more familiar figure during Goodwood week will be John McCririck, below, making a rare appearance on screen during the afternoon. Thompson defends his decision to reduce the number of days worked by one of the sport's most recognisable figures, adding that he foresees a \"central\" role for him in the relaunched Morning Line, \"where he has the time to be discursive, to offer his uniquely entertaining take on the sport in a way that he can't in the afternoon programme\". Both men are pleased with the start made by their two new teams of presenters, Emma Spencer and Mike Cattermole for Flat racing, Alastair Down and Alice Plunkett for jumps. Spencer attracted criticism elsewhere for failing to mention the assault by an owner on Kieren Fallon at Lingfield this season, but Franklin insists that the decision was his alone, taken because of a lack of available evidence. Franklin feels the charisma of his presenters can only count for so much. Fundamentally, he says, the sport must make a major effort to broaden its appeal. His wish-list includes decimalised odds, a more theatrical delivery of photo-finish results and greater willingness from racing professionals to make themselves available for interview. \"The nettles that have got to be grasped get bigger by the day, particularly for Flat racing,\" Franklin says. \"As we all know, this season hasn't quite caught the imagination. It could be argued whether Sea The Stars really reached out to the wider public, even at the end of last year. \"If you are serious about not just checking its declining fortunes but reversing them, you would have to do something as dramatic as making it a condition of entry to Group One three-year-old races that the first, second and third all stay in training, not just as four-year-olds but as five-year-olds as well. \"This season would be transformed if Sea The Stars were running. Of course, there would be a mass outbreak of swooning and fainting amongst the traditionalists but it's something as profound as that that is required, I believe. Can you imagine Wimbledon having the same popularity if every year there was a different cast of characters playing? That's what Flat racing is trying to do.\" One race that Channel 4 will not be able to show this year is the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe. The BBC confirmed last night that it would screen the October race, despite a clash with the Ryder Cup."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
