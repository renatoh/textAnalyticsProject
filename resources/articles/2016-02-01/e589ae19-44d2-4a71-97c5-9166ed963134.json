Ahead of the summit, David Cameron made a crucial concession that the changes would not apply to EU workers already in Britain, only to new arrivals. This left one problem to solve at the summit: how long Britain could keep special rules in place. The British government wanted to keep the emergency brake in place for 13 years, but the Visegr\u00e1d group of four central European countries (Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech Republic) arrived at the summit with a starting bid of five years. What he\u2019s got: The consensus settled on seven years, which matches the time period other western countries had to keep eastern Europeans out of their labour markets. Britain was one of a handful of countries that allowed eastern European workers into its labour market, after the EU enlargement of 2004. The seven-year emergency brake cannot be extended. Child benefits What Cameron wanted: Before the negotiations got serious, Cameron wanted to stop all payments of child benefit going to children living outside the UK, whose parents are working in the UK. Ahead of the summit, the UK relaxed this demand, so child benefit would merely be indexed to the standard of living in the country where the offspring are based. Despite this concession \u2013 and the relatively small sums at stake \u2013 child benefits caused one of the biggest rows at the summit, as the Visegr\u00e1d countries opposed other countries taking advantage. What he\u2019s got: Child benefit payments will be indexed to the cost of living for children living outside the UK, under new EU legislation. This will apply to new arrivals to the UK, once legislation has been passed, and to all workers from 1 January 2020. Stronger protection for non-euro v eurozone What Cameron wanted: Safeguards to protect countries outside the eurozone against regulation made by those inside was at the top of prime minister\u2019s wishlist in the Bloomberg speech. Specifically, he wanted any non-eurozone country to be able to stall new regulations for the currency union, by triggering further discussions among EU leaders of the proposals. What he\u2019s got: In a surprising win for Cameron, only one euro \u2018out\u2019 will be able to force a debate among EU leaders about \u2018problem\u2019 eurozone laws. Other EU leaders agreed to this because neither the UK, nor any other country, would have a veto. The tactic can be used to delay, but not to stop eurozone laws. Ever-closer union What Cameron wanted: a declaration that the treaty motto of \u201cever closer union among the peoples of Europe\u201d did not apply to the UK. EU leaders had already agreed a special formula of wording in June 2014 that not all member states were on the road to integration, but Cameron wanted something stronger. What he\u2019s got: Much more emphatic language, stressing that the UK is not on the road to deeper integration. \u201cIt is recognised that the United Kingdom ... is not committed to further political integration in the European Union ... References to ever-closer union do not apply to the United Kingdom.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
