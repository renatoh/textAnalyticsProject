However the upper and lower classes didn't like the idea one little bit so they joined up, too. Soon hardly anyone gave a hoot about snobbery. They simply divided themselves into neat pairings of small landlords and tenants. Today there are more than 200,000 of the former and considerably more of the latter. And, unlike the Middle Ages when tenants paid their feudal masters in tithes or crops until a flurry of Peasants' Revolts, today's partnerships are usually amicable. A recent Government survey shows that almost 80 per cent of tenants are 'highly satisfied' with their private landlords and agencies, which is 10 per cent more than tenants of council homes. I would endorse this after a relatively trouble-free 12 years. Although, of course, there have been exceptions. I once let to an estate agent and his friend. A month after they signed a six-month agreement, the friend vanished to Greece, while the agent, who failed to pay any rent, emigrated to Malta. A plausible-sounding divorcee who moved in with her eight-year-old son decided to introduce a pair of kittens without telling me, completing her extended family with a live-in lover a few weeks later. After a brief chat about 'the terms and conditions of the lease', I shrugged off both incidents. Until the woman's son started doing Just William impressions. One evening he was caught throwing raw eggs at the windows of several nearby flats. Thankfully, the divorcee and her 'family' left after six months, complaining the area was too quiet. 'For them, but not for us,' chorused the neighbours. But I'm glad to say several tenants have become close friends. Two magazine journalists who moved into a two-bedroom flat a year ago recently redecorated it in an eclectic blend of blues and yellows and refused to take any money for paint or materials. Peasants' Revolt? You must be joking."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
