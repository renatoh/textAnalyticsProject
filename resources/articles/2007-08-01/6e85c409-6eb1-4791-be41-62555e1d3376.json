High in the hills of Zubieta, the new manager of Real Sociedad is going about his business when one of the players asks for a private word. \"It turns out I've been calling him by the wrong name,\" Chris Coleman later explains. \"I thought he was called Alexandro and he's actually Alvaro. The poor bugger didn't want to tell me but he finally plucked up the courage.\" Such is life for a Welshman in the Basque country. Coleman is adapting well to life in northern Spain but language presents a formidable barrier and it is probably only to be expected that there have been a few teething problems. \"I dread to think how many times I've got players' names wrong,\" he says. \"I was always rubbish at languages at school. I wasn't interested in Spanish or French or German and I'm regretting it now. I've been getting things wrong all the time, saying stuff that's completely back to front.\" The trick, he says, is seeing it out, even in those moments when he knows he is not making sense. \"The important thing is that the players can see, hey, this guy's making an effort here. They might have a little snigger behind my back. But if I make a mess of it, if I pronounce something wrong, or if I call someone Alexandro and embarrass myself, that's something I have to go through. \"A few of the players speak English but I said to them on my first day, 'I don't want you to talk my language because otherwise I'll be here in six months and no further forward.' My Spanish is very little and it is the most frustrating part of the job. But the way I see it, I'm in their country and I can't expect them to change for me. I've got to learn and, hopefully, that will get their respect. \"I've got an interpreter and there's an English fella who lives in San Sebasti\u00e1n and gives me lessons. So I am getting there slowly. I don't suppose I'll ever be fluent, but as long as I can understand everyone and say what I mean to say. I've got all the football terminology, simple stuff like move left, move right, long pass, short pass. I know how to order a nice bottle of wine. And I've mastered a few swear words.\" After 10 years at Fulham as player and manager, Coleman was sacked in April without so much as a thank you from the chairman, Mohamed Al Fayed. It was a brutal way to go, but Coleman is a popular member of the management set and Sociedad got in touch in May on the recommendation of John Toshack, one of the few Brits to manage in Spain and not make a pig's ear of it. Coleman has just moved into a new house, with a swimming pool in the garden and a Michelin-starred restaurant across the road. But this is no holiday. First, there is the pressure that comes with managing a club that has dropped into the Segunda Divisi\u00f3n for the first time in four decades. Sociedad were relegated last season with only eight wins and having scored the fewest goals in the league. They are skint, too. Yet that will not stop the Basque supporters expecting a promotion season, beginning tomorrow at home to Castell\u00f3n in the Estadio Anoeta. Then there is the obvious language problem. And last, but not least, Coleman is here alone, with his wife, Belinda, and four children staying in London. \"It is a step into the unknown and, I'll be honest with you, when I sit down and think about it properly, it is quite daunting. I've always wanted to work abroad and this is something I just had to do. But we've just been relegated, we've lost 12 players, it's a brand new team with young players, mostly under 23, and it's going to be really difficult. This club was winning leagues not that long ago and there are journalists at the training ground every day. One paper prints seven pages of Real Sociedad every day. The level of expectation is huge.\" San Sebasti\u00e1n is a beautiful place but it is hard being apart from his family. \"Being a manager can be a lonely job and I'm sure there will be times when I will feel alone and isolated. But my daughter has just got into a top dance school in London, so I said to Belinda, 'I don't want to bring you all over here, take the kids out of good schools and in 12 months we have to come back.' \"I don't want to sound pessimistic, but we know what football's like. I can go back to London once a fortnight, or once a month. They can come over here for holidays. So we'll do it that way and see how it goes.\" He is entitled to be cautious given the way it ended at Fulham. \"Looking back,\" he says, \"I should have jumped rather than waiting to be pushed. I'd told Belinda at Christmas it would be my last season. We beat Newcastle with 10 games to go, we had 32 points and I remember thinking, 'This is the time, go now.' I'd been there 10 years, we weren't getting money in the transfer window and there was always the feeling from certain people inside the club that we should be doing better, that we should be in the top 10. \"I was gone five games later and I'm sad about the way it was done. It was over the phone, which was disrespectful, and it never came from the chairman (Al Fayed). It was the chief executive and that was wrong. The right way to have done it, whether I'd been there one month, five years or 10 years was eye to eye in the same room. I deserved that respect.\" Al Fayed, incidentally, is still to get in touch and Coleman's firm suspicion is that his replacement, Lawrie Sanchez, had been lined up in advance. \"Of course he was. You don't appoint a manager overnight unless it's all been sorted out beforehand. I may be naive, but I'm not that naive. \"People say to me now, 'Bloody hell, you didn't spend \u00a325m in four years and he [Sanchez] is close to spending that in one transfer window.' But it's a new start for Fulham and I wish them well. There are a lot of people at the club I will always be fond of. I've moved on, they've moved on and there's no malice. I will always look back on my time there with fondness.\" And pride. \"I know the job I did and, if it wasn't good enough for certain people, I would ask, 'Why?' When I joined Fulham, in 1997, we didn't even have enough bloody kit! I couldn't get my shorts on for my first game. They were all too small, so we had to snip the sides with a pair of scissors. That's how far away we were from being a proper Premier League club.\" Sociedad have their own financial problems, but the Erreala have the kind of facilities that are the envy of many Primera Division sides and, at the club's training ground, Coleman is an enthusiastic tour guide, excited about the challenges that lie ahead, eager to get the season underway. \"It might have surprised a few people, but I'm not afraid of stepping into the unknown. As soon as I got the call, I thought, 'I've got to do this.' Even if it doesn't work out and I'm home by Christmas or the end of the season I can still say, 'I tried it, I went there and I had the experience of managing abroad.' And he will never call Alvaro Novo by the wrong name again.
