Anything less and Eoin Morgan\u2019s team will need other results to go their way. Pietersen had taken to Twitter to accuse Morgan of looking \u201cscared\u201d when facing Australia\u2019s quick bowler Mitchell Starc while Vaughan told BBC radio on Wednesday: \u201cThis is looking like turmoil for England. I\u2019ve been involved in a couple of atrocious World Cups. If they\u2019re not careful, this could turn out to be top of the tree.\u201d Asked whether Pietersen\u2019s tweet had annoyed him, Bairstow responded: \u201cI\u2019ve not even seen it, to be quite honest. I was on the radio this morning; I was surprised with a clip of Vaughan\u2019s comments at 8.30am. Bloody hell. That\u2019s pretty rich. \u201cPeople now are paid to have an opinion, so they\u2019ve got to have an opinion. Because we\u2019ve done so well, any opportunity for someone to see we\u2019ve lost two games, they were always going to jump on it. People were waiting for us to fail. They are not willing us on to win, in many ways they are waiting for you to get that loss, so they can jump on your throat. It\u2019s a typical English thing to do, in every sport.\u201d Bairstow revealed he had been sledged by a London taxi driver after the defeat by Australia. \u201cI chuckled,\u201d he admitted. \u201cOf course people are going to say things. Of course they are. Everyone\u2019s saying like [it\u2019s] as if we\u2019re eighth or ninth in the table. Bloody Nora: chill out guys. You\u2019re panicking.\u201d Speaking after a visit to a Chance to Shine school as part of Yorkshire Tea National Cricket Week, Bairstow also took aim at the pitches which some groundsmen have produced at this World Cup. There have been few of the flat, high-scoring, bat-friendly tracks England have enjoyed at home in recent years, with the home side failing to chase down modest targets on challenging surfaces against Sri Lanka and Australia. \u201cThe pitches that we\u2019ve been playing on the last two years are surely the pitches we [should] be playing on in a World Cup,\u201d he said, \u201cso I don\u2019t know why they\u2019ve changed. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t a typical Oval wicket we played South Africa on in the opening game. It wasn\u2019t a typical Trent Bridge wicket we played Pakistan on. It wasn\u2019t a typical Lord\u2019s wicket that we played the other day. They\u2019re not the typical wickets we\u2019ve been playing on over two and a bit years. That\u2019s just factual. But I\u2019m not making excuses, we\u2019ve not played well enough to beat sides when we should have done. We know that.\u201d Whatever conditions England face at Edgbaston on Sunday, they will not change the aggressive approach that took them to No 1 in the world \u2013 even though it has offered critics more ammunition in the past week. \u201cOur method doesn\u2019t change,\u201d said Bairstow. \u201cBecause of the way we go about it and the way we play, it doesn\u2019t make a difference what\u2019s been said here, what\u2019s been said there. This group has been together for near-on three years now, if not longer. So just because we\u2019ve lost two games in a crunch tournament and people start talking, it\u2019s not going to change the way we go about it.\u201d Bairstow\u2019s opening partner is one thing that could change on Sunday, however, should Jason Roy recover from a hamstring tear to take over from James Vince. The Yorkshireman said he and Roy have learned how their strengths complement each other\u2019s. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve done it for a little while now there\u2019s a relaxed confidence, if that makes sense,\u201d Bairstow said. \u201cI\u2019ve batted with him and known him for quite a while so if he\u2019s up or too much [up] then you can say: \u2018Oi, come on\u2019 or vice versa. \u201cIt\u2019s just having that understanding and you can only get that by spending time in the middle, so if he\u2019s not fit then Vincey and I go out again and try to put on as many as we can.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
