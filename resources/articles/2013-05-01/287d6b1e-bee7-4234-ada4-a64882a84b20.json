It centres on his strikers, or rather striker as, with Steven Fletcher and Connor Wickham injured and St\u00e9phane Sess\u00e8gnon suspended, Danny Graham is the club's sole fit senior forward. And Graham has still to score his first goal for Sunderland following a \u00a35m January move from Swansea City. Not that Di Canio, whose former club, Swindon Town, won at Stoke in a League Cup tie in August, is daunted. \"I am sure the time will come when Danny will score and I'm sure it will be in the next two games,\" said Sunderland's manager. \"I am sure Danny is going to be crucial in our final three games \u2013 and not only because he is the only striker we have got.\" While there are hopes that Wickham may return in the final two fixtures, at home to Southampton and away at Tottenham Hotspur, all eyes will be on Graham on Monday. \"When I arrived, in my opinion, Danny wasn't really fit enough in terms of playing in the Premier League,\" said Di Canio, a former striker himself. \"He had a long face during my first two or three training sessions and I thought 'can he play football?' I wondered what was going on so I spoke to him. Now he is confident. He is not down. He feels part of the cause and is always active, encouraging the other players in the training drills. He is intelligent and now he is ready, which is why I feel confident that he can score.\" After two fine wins at Newcastle and at home to Everton, Sunderland were brought back down to earth with a 6-1 defeat at Aston Villa last Monday but their Italian manager is confident that the \"poison of complacency and over-confidence\" has now been purged from their systems and promises he can \"guarantee\" a much improved performance against Tony Pulis's side. During a post mortem into the Villa reverse held at 4pm on a cancelled day off last Tuesday, Di Canio threw the floor open to his players before questioning individuals on what, precisely, had gone wrong. He liked what he heard. \"This is a very genuine group, very honest, one of the best groups I've seen in a football dressing room,\" he said. \"They are also very shy and they maybe lack a bit of devil, a bit of edge \u2013 they are very clean \u2013 but I trust them. We fell into a trap at Villa but I have no worries that they will not perform well against Stoke.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
