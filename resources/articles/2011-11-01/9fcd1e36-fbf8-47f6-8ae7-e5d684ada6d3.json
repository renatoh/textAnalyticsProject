Four months after he previously gave evidence to them, the MPs want to know if Rupert Murdoch's heir apparent has misled parliament. So serious is the test before the Commons culture, media and sport select committee that friends and critics alike believe that his credibility and chances of taking over at News Corporation are on the line. James Murdoch's team is refusing to give guidance as to what he might say, although earlier this week it was hoped he would try to regain the initiative by indicating that he is apologetic about News Corp's failure to get to the bottom of the hacking allegations until the very end of 2010. However, reflecting tensions within the News Corp camp, company lawyers led by acting group counsel Janet Nova, are cautious about him blaming others and making too deep an apology. Meanwhile, the News of the World's former chief reporter, Neville Thurlbeck, has been asked by Scotland Yard officers investigating the phone-hacking scandal to provide what they believe could be vital evidence. They have asked if he would be prepared to give evidence against News International, though he has rejected the request. It is known that police took key documents from Thurlbeck's home when he was in custody on 5 April this year. Among those documents is said to be a copy of a 2009 memo allegedly sent by Thurlbeck to the paper's former editor, Colin Myler, and its legal manager, Tom Crone, in which he made serious allegations about a News of the World executive's involvement in hacking. The dossier is also said to contain a tape-recorded phone call made by Thurlbeck to Ross Hindley, the junior reporter who transcribed the \"For Neville\" email that has been the focus of the hacking investigation. Thurlbeck had tracked Hindley down to Peru and during the call, which he says he taped, he is believed to have made allegations against the same executive. The police now have a transcript of the call. James Murdoch was asked by his father to move from his job as chief executive of BSkyB at the end of 2007 to become chief executive of News Corp in Europe and Asia and \u2013 fatefully \u2013 executive chairman of News International, the subsidiary responsible for the News of the World, where he chaired regular meetings between the editor and company executives. But since James Murdoch appeared in July, the select committee has published a previously confidential legal opinion prepared for News of the World's chief lawyer in 2008 that there was \"a culture of illegal information access\" at the newspaper and a 2007 unfair dismissal complaint from Goodman sent to Murdoch's predecessor Les Hinton that the practice of hacking was \"widely discussed in the daily editorial conference, until explicit reference to it was banned by the editor\". Murdoch said he saw neither document until relatively recently."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
