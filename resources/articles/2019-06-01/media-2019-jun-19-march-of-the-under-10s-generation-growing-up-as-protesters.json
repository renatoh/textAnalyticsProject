One in five children aged between five and nine have already attended their first march or protest about something they care about, and half of their parents are encouraging them to speak out as activists, according to a survey carried out for Beano Studios, which owns the comic brand. As children prepare for a fresh school climate strike on Friday, the study of 2,000 parents and 1,500 children also found that the generation born since 2010 are less likely to get sucked into spending time on their devices than their older siblings and take a proactive attitude towards tech, with half making videos and a third enjoying computer coding. And for parents concerned about children experiencing too much screen time, three quarters of under-10s say they still climb trees. The Alpha generation \u2013 people born after 2010 \u2013 has played a high-profile role in recent climate change protests, including action by Extinction Rebellion. Sophie Davies, 10, helped set up the first schools climate strike in Redditch in Worcestershire and will be out campaigning this Friday. \u201cIt is quite scary that we only have 12 years to sort [the climate] and if we don\u2019t, we don\u2019t know what will happen,\u201d she said. \u201cBut I do quite like getting out and making a difference. Because children my age can\u2019t vote, it\u2019s the least you can do.\u201d Arthur Castel-O\u2019Leary, a five-year-old from Romford in Essex, has been to climate protests, including on Waterloo Bridge and at Oxford Circus, said his mother, Noleen O\u2019Leary. \u201cHe gets so involved, it is incredible,\u201d she said. \u201cHe joins in fully with the chants of \u2018What do we want? When do we want it?\u2019 But the thing is, he can\u2019t say \u2018now!\u2019, he says \u2018now, please.\u2019\u201d Arthur has also declared himself a vegan and picks up rubbish he sees in the street and comments: \u201cThat\u2019s not good for the planet.\u201d Greta Thunberg, the 16-year-old Swedish climate change activist, has proved to be a role model for some, but others such as Ruby, a Scottish nine-year-old who took on a catalogue company over gendered clothing, have adopted different causes. She challenged the company because \u201cgirls need clothes for adventures too\u201d with practical shoes and more pockets. Bruce Adamson, the children and young people\u2019s commissioner in Scotland, said he had worked with primary school-aged activists on local issues including litter in coastal towns and on poverty in deprived parts of Glasgow. \u201cOne of the positive things about social media is it does allow for information [to be shared] and for organisation among young human rights defenders,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is worrying they have to engage on some of these issues, but it is a positive evolution of the way we exercise power.\u201d But ensuring young activists are educated, supported and protected from reprisals was essential, he added. The survey also found 57% of under-10s do not feel that gender matters, compared with 32% of their parents. Two thirds of girls felt it was not important, a larger proportion than boys. While there are signs that creative play is often being channelled through technology, with 86% using technology to design, build and make things, the alpha generation displays a measure of scepticism about the internet. Almost three quarters (73%) say they are confident online and the same proportion feel it is important to question what they see, while almost a third believe they can spot fake news. \u201cGen Alpha is the generation that will seek to bend the digital world to their needs and ambitions and not be defined or consumed by it,\u201d said Emma Scott, chief executive at Beano Studios. \u201cThey will set aside our current worldview stereotypes of identity and difference and their love for cherishing and saving the physical world around them will literally change the face of our planet.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
