Ministers have promised \u00a3600m to fund the removal of the type of combustible cladding that spread the fire at Grenfell, but checks since the tragedy have identified many high-rise blocks with other faults including wooden cladding and missing fire breaks, for which no public funding is yet being offered. Leaseholders in 14 blocks in Manchester are facing bills of up to \u00a380,000 each and are now working with lawyers to bring legal action against the government, arguing that it is unjust for only some residents to be bailed out when the problems appear to be systemic. James Oates, 31, a leaseholder at the Skyline building, which has wooden cladding on lower storeys, said: \u201cIf building control signed off a building like this, it is not doing its job properly. It all stems back to the government. It seems strange they can announce a fund for ACM [cladding] but not other [problems]. It feels unjust. We are being told by Greater Manchester fire and rescue that if we don\u2019t have a waking watch in place they would have to evacuate the building.\u201d Other affected blocks in Manchester include Burton Place and City Gate. Lawyers are understood to be exploring different avenues for the action, including whether residents\u2019 right to \u201cadequate housing\u201d under a legally binding international treaty is being violated and whether the building regulations were fit for purpose. \u201cWe feel cast aside in terms of the cladding lottery they have created,\u201d said Fran Reddington, a leaseholder who is helping to lead the campaign. \u201cGovernment isn\u2019t stepping up to help. Some residents are facing \u00a380,000 bills and we don\u2019t have any other choice. Fire doesn\u2019t distinguish between the different types of dangerous material but the government is doing just that.\u201d Families of those who died at Grenfell have also turned to the courts for justice. This month they announced they would sue the cladding and insulation manufacturers in the US courts for punitive and compensatory damages for alleged wrongful death. The UK government has announced funds to replace aluminium composite material used as cladding, which has been found on 393 social, private and student residential blocks above 18 metres in height in England. It earmarked \u00a3400m for social housing and \u00a3200m for private blocks. Leaseholders have been left in limbo by wrangling between the government, freeholders and housebuilders over who should pay to fix their homes. As of last month, none of the owners or developers of almost 100 of the privately owned towers with ACM had agreed to pay for safety works. Scores more buildings, including low-rise wooden-clad flats in Barking that caught fire this month, have other fire safety faults. Many are wrapped in panels made of high-pressure laminate materials that can be combustible. Their flammability is currently being tested by the government. A spokesperson for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the funding for ACM was exceptional because of the unparalleled fire risk it posed. \u201cWe have repeatedly and consistently made clear building owners are responsible for the safety of their buildings,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cWe issued unambiguous advice to building owners 18 months ago to reinforce existing building safety requirements and tell building owners what to do to make sure their cladding system is safe. This advice was updated in December 2018.\u201d Suzanne Richards, Manchester city council\u2019s executive member for housing and regeneration, said it was \u201cdisheartening\u201d to hear that leaseholders in her city felt they had no other option than legal action. \u201cWe have consistently said that all residents facing fire issues should be treated equally and not bear the burden of costs,\u201d she said. \u201cResidents should not be exposed to a cladding lottery and be forced to bear life-changing bills.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
