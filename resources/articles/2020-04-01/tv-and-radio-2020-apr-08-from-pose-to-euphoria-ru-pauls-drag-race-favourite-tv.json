The writing is so good and very queer in its punch lines and delivery, but it\u2019s worth watching just for the clothes. The fashion design on Fran Drescher is so ridiculous, and so drag. I would wear any of these outfits! Then there\u2019s the butler. They write him straight, but honey, come on\u2026 Pose (FX/BBC iPlayer) is exquisite. It takes the stories of queer people of colour from New York in the 80s and puts them front and centre, which is something that hasn\u2019t really been done before. Looking at Ru Paul\u2019s Drag Race, the jokes and references are rooted in Paris Is Burning and the ball culture that Pose showcases. It\u2019s a historic timepiece, but fun and beautiful to watch. Many of the actors and writers are also from the queer and trans communities. The show that has been getting me through the lockdown is The Simpsons (Disney+/All4). It might not be queer or gay, really, but it is a little bit, right? It discusses serious issues, but in an irreverent way, which makes it very comforting, because we\u2019re dealing with a lot of serious, scary stuff, so ending the day with some levity and nonsense is a nice tonic. The Vivienne, RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race UK season one The first show you have to watch is The Vivienne Takes on Hollywood, which premieres on BBC Three on 9 April. It\u2019s a tongue-in-cheek mockumentary about me going over to Los Angeles to make my music video, rubbing shoulders with all these Hollywood types. It\u2019s everything you\u2019d expect to see and more from The Vivienne, this little drag queen from Liverpool, trying to find her feet on Hollywood Boulevard. Lately, I\u2019ve been watching the true-crime documentary Tiger King (Netflix). Joe Exotic [the protagonist] is in a lifelong feud with a conservationist, Carole Baskin, and eventually gets locked up for plotting to kill her. Oh, and he\u2019s also a massive homosexual; his blue eyeliner is the best thing ever. And he\u2019s polyamorous (he has two husbands). And this is real life! It\u2019s 100% factual and it makes me think: \u201cOnly in America.\u201d For a series that\u2019s camp, fun and easy to binge-watch, Next in Fashion (Netflix) is like Ru Paul\u2019s Drag Race meets Project Runway. It showcases these amazing designers, who are really established and good at their craft, but have always worked in the shadow of celebrities and big labels, giving them the opportunity to make their names. Detox, RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race season five/All Stars season two Euphoria (HBO/Sky Atlantic) is my favourite show right now. It\u2019s important because it describes so much of what happens with teenagers when it comes to addiction and partying, and also abuse. As someone who grew up very quickly, it really resonated with me. I think parents ought to watch it to be aware of what they should be looking out for if their children have problems. I enjoyed the way they handled the trans character [played by Hunter Schafer], because they didn\u2019t do this whole coming out situation. She\u2019s just there, in a very normal and natural way. I liked Sex Education (Netflix) for similar reasons \u2013 because of the way queerness is portrayed as something normal and acceptable. The non-discussion of people\u2019s gender expression, or what they align to, is a great direction for things to go. It\u2019s styled in a way that\u2019s so 80s, but with modern issues, giving it a timeless quality. Oh, and how brilliant is \u201cshag specialist\u201d Gillian Anderson? Sex and the City (HBO/Now TV) is quite adult, but in the camp sense. There\u2019s a queer sensibility throughout: quick tongues, quicker flings and the best early 00s fashion put together by quintessential NYC style maven Patricia Fields. What more could you want? Latrice Royale, RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race season four/All Stars season one and four Sadly, Ru Paul\u2019s AJ and the Queen (Netflix) hasn\u2019t been renewed for a second season, but it\u2019s a heartfelt show with some great drag cameos. The story is all about heart and forgiveness and proving you\u2019re never too old to learn, even from a 10-year-old. The best episode? Obviously episode seven, starring yours truly and Monique Heart. I play the \u201centrepreneur\u201d Faberg\u00e9 Legs \u2013 drag queen, club owner and manufacturer of counterfeit goods. I love cartoons and Family Guy (Hulu/Now TV) touches on every issue imaginable. I mean, Quagmire\u2019s dad is an army veteran who\u2019s also a transsexual woman! Back in 2009, the show even predicted Caitlyn Jenner\u2019s transition. Check out the episode We Love You, Conrad, from the seventh season. Nina West, RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race season 11 The show I\u2019ve been watching non-stop is The Golden Girls (Hulu/Amazon Prime). Just hearing Rose say something stupid and Dorothy snapping back at her gives me this feeling of comfort \u2013 probably because I\u2019ve watched it so many times. Why do gay men love this show? Well, it\u2019s about four very different, sassy, funny, independent women. And there\u2019s nothing gay men love more than strong women. If you haven\u2019t seen Fortune Feimster: Sweet and Salty (Netflix), check it out. Feimster is a lesbian comedian with a terrific brand of comedy and storytelling. She\u2019s joy-filled and joyous to watch, with this charming southern drawl, and she represents part of the queer community that doesn\u2019t get enough visibility. Women in showbusiness already have a major uphill battle \u2013 and then add her sexuality to that. This woman has been working her entire life and is just starting to become known. Also, Glee (Netflix) is one to rewatch. It has great storylines \u2013 like Kurt coming out \u2013 and a fantastic cast of colour and ability. It\u2019s diversity in your face! Remember, Glee made Ryan Murphy mainstream, and that led to American Horror Story, which led to Pose. So without Glee, we wouldn\u2019t have Pose. RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race is on VH1 in the US and Netflix in the UK"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
