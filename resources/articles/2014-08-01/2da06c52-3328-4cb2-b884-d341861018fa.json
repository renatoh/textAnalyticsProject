Terrorism Tony Abbott yesterday announced a huge expansion of anti-terrorism laws, including requiring Australians returning from designated terrorism hotspots to prove they went there for a legitimate purpose, lowering the threshold for arrest without warrant, and making it easier for the government to suspend passports. At the same time, he said the government was dropping proposed changes to section 18C of the racial discrimination act, which would have removed prohibitions on offending, humiliating and insulting people, in order to \u201cpreserve unity\u201d. The race discrimination commissioner has backed Abbott\u2019s decision on 18C, which has been greeted with a furious response from Andrew Bolt and other backers including human rights commissioner Tim Wilson. Abbott announced that Australia\u2019s spy agencies would get $630m more funding over the next four years, and said it was crucial that the country was together on this issue: \u201cEveryone needs to be part of Team Australia.\u201d If we are Team Australia, we need to be told more about these policies, Lenore Taylor writes. The Daily Telegraph reports that under new terrorism threat assessments Australians will undergo facial and fingerprint scanning before leaving the country as well as on arrival, despite Abbott saying in his announcement yesterday that the threat level had not changed. Gaza Israel and Hamas began a 72-hour ceasefire yesterday, which so far has held fast, with Israel saying it has finished destroying tunnels and withdrawn its ground forces. There is relief among Israelis as the tanks pull out, but no sense of victory, with those on the border uncertain whether the conflict will bring any security or stability. The ceasefire has given residents in Rafah the chance to return to their ruined homes; no one has yet assessed the physical damage from the conflict. The international criminal court has been urged to investigate \u201ccrimes\u201d committed in Gaza, including the destruction of homes, hospitals and schools, and Palestinian leaders are poised to join the ICC to call for an investigation.
