The Bairns are now four points adrift of Hamilton at the bottom of the SPL. Home defender Dawid Kucharski scored an injury-time own goal to cancel out an unusual opener from team-mate Lee Wallace in the first half. Wallace netted in the fifth minute when his diagonal cross into the area caught goalkeeper Robert Olejnik by surprise as it sailed into the net. However, Kucharski put the ball in his own net seconds before the break as a Marc Twaddle cross cannoned off him and edged past keeper Marian Kello. Pressley made his intentions clear at half-time by going with two in attack. Striker Enoch Showunmi came on for winger Jack Compton. Despite Falkirk's pressure, the home side added a second goal a minute later through Suso Santana. A deep cross from Arvydas Novikovas from the left was not dealt with by Olejnik and the Spaniard cracked a shot into the net from six yards. Ian Black gave Hearts a two-goal cushion with a 25-yard strike that flew past Olejnik in the 67th minute. The midfielder edged past Brian McLean and unleashed an unstoppable left-foot drive past the Falkirk goalkeeper for his first goal for the Jam Tarts. Substitute Pedro Moutinho set up a tense finish by finding the net seven minutes from time. Wriggling free in a congested penalty area, the substitute struck a shot high into the net from close range for the visitors' consolation. Kilmarnock striker Kevin Kyle was St Johnstone's nemesis once again as resurgent Killie twice came from being a goal behind to snatch a fourth straight win in another Rugby Park thriller. The home team's strong recent run under new manager Jimmy Calderwood looked like coming to an end when goals from Peter MacDonald and Graham Gartland put Saints 1-0 and 2-1 ahead in the clash. But equalisers from Chris Maguire and Garry Hay \u2013 the latter's first goal since December 2008 \u2013 set the stage for Kyle to score his fourth against Derek McInnes's side this season. A 93rd-minute winner from substitute David Goodwillie earned Dundee United a last-gasp 2-1 win at St Mirren as United kept the pressure on Hibernian for third place in the SPL.Saints must have thought they had the game won when Michael Higdon grabbed the opener on a day when both sides passed up decent chances. However, United did manage to haul themselves back into the game with 83 minutes on the clock when Goodwillie's lay-off was collected by Danny Swanson and he drove a low shot into the back of the net. But there was further drama to come when Goodwillie snatched the winner deep into injury time. A Prince Buaben free-kick was not properly cleared by the Saints defence and John Daly was able to chip the ball back into the area for the substitute to force home. Hamilton Academicals and Motherwell cancelled each other out in their clash at New Douglas Park. Goalkeeper John Ruddy made a succession of second-half saves to maintain Well's unbeaten league record under former Scotland manager Craig Brown. The Motherwell goalkeeper denied Simon Mensing three times in around five minutes as Hamilton pushed forward after an even first half. But the home side could not maintain their pressure and John Sutton missed a good chance to take the points across the M74. A scrappy goal from Lukas Jutkiewicz had been all that separated the Lanarkshire rivals the previous weekend in a tight rearranged match at Fir Park, and the latest derby was even closer. The Steelmen have now lost only one goal in seven SPL games under Brown and they maintain fifth place in the SPL table."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
