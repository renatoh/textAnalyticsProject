Charged by the Sun with slipping out this week's revision to the drugs laws under the cover of the IRA's decision to disarm, David Blunkett spent most of yesterday protesting that the opposite was the case. \"I deliberately didn't spin this. I didn't put it out at the weekend. I didn't put a line on it,\" he told his interviewer. \"I didn't announce it in advance, it wasn't leaked.\" Rarely can so senior a minister have spoken this openly about the black art of media persuasion. Mr Blunkett can only have done so this time because he is genuinely in the clear. His meeting with the home affairs select committee, where the relaxation of the law was announced on Tuesday afternoon, was long arranged. And it is hard to believe that the IRA had been recruited by Downing Street to time its statement on the same day just to cover it up. The home secretary has a point, too, when he says that the reclassification of cannabis possession as a non-arrestable offence is good news that the government did not want to hide. But Mr Blunkett's denial yesterday also served to confirm his guilt on earlier occasions. He was rather like a suspect blurting out details of a crime that only the guilty could know. Indeed he asked for a string of previous offences to be taken into consideration, joking that \"for the first time I have been in the Home Office something hasn't been leaked on my behalf and then I get criticised for the timing of putting it out\". The problem is that the political world is now so accustomed to news management that even its absence is seen as a sophisticated tactic. Can a government that now claims to be without spin get away with spinning only some of the time? The answer is obviously not. Ministers are always being told by MPs that they should make statements first in the House of Commons. But when, for once, Mr Blunkett did just as they ask, he struggled to persuade the world that his intentions were pure. This doubt is perfectly right. As with any repentant sinner, Mr Blunkett's confession ought to be welcomed. But over cannabis it suited the home secretary to play things straight. The true test will be to stay without spin when things get difficult. If the home secretary achieves that, then he really does deserve praise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
