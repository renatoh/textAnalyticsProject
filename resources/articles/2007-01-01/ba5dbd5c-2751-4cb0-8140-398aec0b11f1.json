Pity the Frames then, the Dublin band whose last album entered the Irish charts at No 1, but who remain also-rans over here. Fronted by former Commitments star Glen Hansard since 1991, the Frames' accomplished, accessible rock is full of bland, building crescendos and lovelorn trajectories. Fire flickers here, though. \"Love has been the cause of all this suffering,\" gripes the title track like a twisted greetings card; while the conclusion of The Side You Never Get to See (\"The side you never get to see/ Is alive\") suggests a stream of real rage. Hints of Elton John, Coldplay and even Smog haunt this album, and although it often turns lacklustre, its aftertaste lingers. There's grit and gleam in Hansard's vocals, and enough muscle within the melancholy to turn the head and catch the ear."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
