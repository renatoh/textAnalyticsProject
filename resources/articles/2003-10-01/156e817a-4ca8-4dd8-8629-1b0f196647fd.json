The company has contacted investment giant Fidelity, the ringleader of the plot to oust Mr Green, in a bid to keep him as executive chairman of a merged ITV. It promises Mr Green will agree to stand down, but only after 18 months when the two companies are fully integrated. It has also proposed appointing an independent non-executive deputy chairman at Carlton, who would go on to be the senior independent director at ITV following completion of the \u00a34.5bn merger. But the proposals were almost immediately dismissed as unworkable and too little, too late. Earlier today Standard Life said Mr Green's attempts to cling on to his job were a lost cause because the shareholders who want to oust him had the support of 50% of the company. Another shareholder this afternoon told MediaGuardian.co.uk that nothing in the new proposals would undermine their resolve to see Mr Green removed. \"It's been a difficult process and this wasn't an opinion that has been reached recently. We are all standing by what was said in the original letter,\" said a source at the institutional investment company. Fidelity today stepped up its media war with Carlton, which this weekend hired PR firefighter Alan Parker to help Mr Green secure a future within ITV. The investment fund has in turn hired Tim Bell's Bell Pottinger to handle the fall-out and controversy that erupted after Fidelity's plans were leaked to the press over the weekend. The move comes hours after Carlton's board insisted it was \"unable to comply\" with demands from Fidelity and seven other institutional investors to remove Mr Green. The Carlton chairman feels particularly wounded by suggestions that Charles Allen could stay on as chief executive when the initial objections by Fidelity involved both of them. At the end of last week Fidelity changed its tactics and decide to focus on Mr Green's future, issuing an ultimatum that he should stand down by noon on Tuesday. Sources say Mr Green is perplexed by the humiliating demands made by Fidelty's boss Anthony Bolton, who is known in the City as the \"quiet assassin\". \"Six weeks to two months ago, Michael asked Fidelity did they have a problem with the proposed management structure post merger and they said 'no',\" the source said. Fidelity today said it would not discuss the issue with Carlton until after Granada's crunch board meeting which starts at 6pm tonight. Granada will put a statement out at 7am tomorrow morning to respond to calls for Mr Green's resignation and Fidelity have promised a statement after its noon deadline. The pressure on Mr Green continued to intensify today after more shareholders emerged to give Fidelity their support. David Cumming, head of UK equities at Standard Life - one of the eight shareholders involved in the move to oust Mr Green - said they had the support of at least 50% of the company's stock owners. But earlier today shareholders made it clear they were \"resolute in their requests\" and would not soften their stance. Granada said today it would be considering the demands for Mr Green to go, but it will have to tread carefully. If Granada were to back the shareholders even in part, it would ratchet up the pressure on Mr Green to quit, probably to unbearable levels. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
