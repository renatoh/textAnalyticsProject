By late yesterday afternoon, this sleepy hamlet had become infamous after police said it appeared to have played host to the worst infanticide in French history. Two people \u2013 a married couple both in their mid-40s, he a roofer and she a nursing auxiliary \u2013 have been detained by local police since Tuesday, when they were arrested in connection with the discovery. A neighbour, who had recently moved into a house formerly owned by the woman's parents, and in which the couple used to live, stumbled upon the remains of two of the children when he was digging a duck pond for his garden on Saturday, sources said. Police from the nearby city of Douai called in forensic experts to determine if they were human remains. The answer, which came swiftly, prompted them to further their search. At the house where the pair live, the police discovered six more corpses wrapped in plastic bags. The couple, who have two daughters in their 20s, were placed in custody. They are likely to appear before a court today and could face charges, police said. An initial report by French radio that the mother had admitted to \"systematically\" killing her babies without telling her husband was later rejected by a police source. For the 700-odd inhabitants of Villers-au-Tertre, the news, followed by a media invasion, was bewildering. Many locals described the couple, whose names had not been released by police last night, as completely ordinary. And many refused to entertain the idea that they could have been responsible for such acts. \"We knew them quite well. They were very pleasant people. I have nothing bad to say about them. We're having trouble believing it,\" said one woman, who asked not to be named. \"They were normal people. How such a thing is possible is unimaginable,\" said another. Daniel Collignon, a former mayor of the village, told AFP he was struggling to comprehend the magnitude of the investigation. \"I am still in shock,\" he said. Teams of forensic experts, policemen and sniffer dogs arrived last night, combing the two sites until midway through the evening. Police indicated they believed they might find more bodies. The couple's current house, at which the six bodies were discovered, was under surveillance from the media. Pots of geraniums on the drive bore testament to more normal times; a letter box sealed up and blankets draped over the gates reflected the sudden change. Although on a scale not yet seen in France, the discovery of the bodies has a familiar ring in a country which in the past two years has seen two women confess to killing their babies straight after giving birth. V\u00e9ronique Courjault was convicted in June last year of murdering three of her newborns and hiding two of them in a freezer, while C\u00e9line Lesage was found guilty in March of killing six of her babies. Courjault's husband discovered two of the corpses in a freezer while the two were living in South Korea. During the trial, psychiatrists testified that she suffered from a psychological condition known as \"pregnancy denial\". Germany also has seen a string of similar cases. In one, a woman was convicted of manslaughter in 2006 and sentenced to the maximum 15 years in prison for killing eight of her newborn babies and burying them in flower pots and a fish tank in the garden of her parents' home near the German-Polish border."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
