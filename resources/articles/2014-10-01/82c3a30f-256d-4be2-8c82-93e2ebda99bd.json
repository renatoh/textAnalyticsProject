As You + Me, the pair explore pastoral byways, and it\u2019s a partnership of equals \u2013 while Pink often dominates their harmonies due to the featheriness of Green\u2019s voice, she gives him plenty of space. The album was recorded in eight days, and sounds it: tracks such as Second Guess, which brings to mind Robert Plant and Alison Krauss\u2019s warm alliance, feel like demos, but that\u2019s fine. The sketchier and more organic a track \u2013 such as Unbeliever, with its drowsy acoustic guitar and vague musings about being \u201ca thousand miles from nowhere\u201d \u2013 the more charming. Their cover of No Ordinary Love, stripped of any adornment but piano, makes Sade\u2019s original sound like Metallica. Pink, credited here under her real name, Alecia Moore, slips in a few scaled-down power ballads, but these are also utterly lovely."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
