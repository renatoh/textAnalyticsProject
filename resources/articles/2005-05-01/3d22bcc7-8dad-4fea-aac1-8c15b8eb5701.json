At any rate the literary world is agog at the revelation that George Galloway MP, fresh from last week's triumph over Oona King at Bethnal Green and Bow, is about to launch his own imprint. Friction, as the fruit of Galloway's partnership with the journalist Ron McKay intends to style itself, will be debuting later this month, with a reception at the House of Commons, about which nothing is known save the imposed absence of Jeremy Paxman from its guest list. There is, of course, a fine old tradition of leftwing publishing houses in this country. Victor Gollancz, pipe-smoking doyen of the 30s literary scene, leaned so far towards Moscow that his conscience forbade him to publish Orwell's Spanish civil war memoir Homage to Catalonia, while insiders alleged the presence of a \"hotline to King Street\" (the head-quarters of the British Communist party) in the Gollancz boardroom. Then, and subsequently, messrs Lawrence &amp; Wishart made a decent living out of publishing such varied works as Negro, Nancy Cunard's radical race anthology, the Communist Manifesto and The Ragged Trousered Philanthropists, Robert Tressell's epic novel about a gang of downtrodden Edwardian house-painters. There have been others. No - ah - disrespect to any of the publishers involved, but much of this substantial output has erred on the side of worthiness (Marx, Marcuse, An Eternal Golden Braid, etc). Galloway, on the other hand, is clearly bent on setting off handfuls of metaphorical fireworks amid the anodyne display cases of the average Waterstone's. Highlights of a list guaranteed to \"cause controversy\" include Paco Taibo II's An Easy Thing, billed as the adventures of a South American gumshoe, and an expos\u00e9, co-written by the publishers, of last month's campaigning in the East End. Plainly the bran-tub of authors' submissions to which messrs Galloway and McKay are now devoting their business hours will yield up anything but bran. I look forward keenly to Bolsover Nights: The Backbench Diaries of Dennis Skinner; Scargill: The Man Who Saved the Mining Industry; and Jeremy Corbyn's Vintage Red: Wine-buying for the Conscience-Stricken. DJ Taylor Innovations Accessories with added angst Do you feel your lighter doesn't understand you? That your T-shirt doesn't care? If so, then two German existentialists have created a brand just for you. Aylin Langreuter and Lea Schmidbauer have created a clothing and accessory company that they call Confession of a Depression. CoD is Habitat in a darkened room, refusing even a little chicken broth; the Conran Shop in a straitjacket. Night has now fallen in the lifestyle market. A wander round the CoD catalogue (yup - it's black) is a voyage to the Priory, pausing on fashionable self-indulgence and passing Go at adolescent angst. An ashtray is printed with the words, \"I'm not strong enough to fight my addictions.\" A pen whines, \"I have learnt nothing of relevance - I can neither heal nor teach.\" What can one say to a depressed Biro? This too shall pass? Have a biscuit? Clothing, meanwhile, is desperate. A pair of T-shirts is rambling, \"I am turning into my mother but I am too tired to care\" and \"I disappoint my father but I am too weak to fight.\" Leather goods are overcome. The shopping bag says, \"The world does not care about me and I am completely on my own.\" The handbag believes, \"I will die alone and before my time.\" Why have Langreuter &amp; Schmidbauer done this to their products? They email me from a \"retreat\". \"Our inspiration was our own and our friends' state of mind,\" they say. \"It seems that there is an omnipresent, yet underrepresented collective depression going on. There are feelings of dissatisfaction, aloneness, fear, weakness and defeat. CoD reflects on our darkest feelings. We wanted to wear these feelings on our sleeves.\" So is CoD the first clothing range aimed at the clinically depressed? CoD say no. \"People who have been diagnosed with clinical depression at least have a diagnosis. CoD is aimed at the undiagnosed: the sad, weak and defeated.\" If you believe a T-shirt can rip you out of denial, if you are mad to trivialise mental illness, if you are wretched but need to shop, or if you just covet household goods that behave like Judy Garland, order from www.confession-of-depression.com. \"This is my confession of depression,\" the order form whinges. \"Be gentle with it.\" And, if you make a mistake with your shopping, click the \"I'm afraid\" button. Your ashtray, at least, will empathise. It may even hug you. And die. Tanya Gold A la carte Hello, I'd like to buy the Ivy Getting a table at the Ivy is a legendary exercise in frustration. But the tables might just be turning; help for the frustrated non-celeb is at hand. The Ivy, along with five sister restaurants in London, is up for sale. Just as Victor Kiam liked the company so much he bought it, maybe I can circumvent the waiting list by buying the restaurant. It will be expensive, but at least I won't have to leave a tip. I can't make my offer to Signature Restaurants, which owns the Ivy, as the chief exec is away until Friday. So I phone the manager's office at the restaurant directly. \"I hear you're up for sale, I'd like to make an offer.\" I'm bluffing slightly here: I haven't yet decided whether to buy just the Ivy or the other five (Le Caprice, J Sheekey, Daphne's, Bam-Bou and Pasha) as well. Nor have I settled on what to offer. Signature paid \u00a313.1m for the Ivy, Le Caprice and J Sheekey in 1998, so I suppose to buy all six you wouldn't get much change out of \u00a325m. Since the man in the accounts department at the Guardian queried the \u00a340 I spent on booze in Liverpool last week (and knocked a tenner off!), this could prove to be an expenses minefield. In any case, we don't yet get down to the nitty-gritty of price. When I say I want to make an offer, the man in the manager's office is non-committal. \"I've only read in the papers that we're up for sale. I'll have to put you through to someone else.\" That someone else is Mitchell Everard, a director of Signature, but he isn't available either, so I still can't make my offer. The \u00a325m is burning a hole in my pocket. There's only one thing for it. I'll have to phone Luke Johnson, chairman of Signature (as well as of Channel 4) and a majority shareholder in the company. His initial response when I get him on his mobile is a long burst of laughter. \"I'm glad to hear that the Guardian has a sense of humour,\" he says. The mockery is clearly an opening gambit, a feeble negotiating ploy. Look, ours is a serious offer aimed at democratising the Ivy and making Belgian endive salad available to all. \"OK, what's your number? I'll call you back.\" I still await the callback, but remain con vinced: a new era at the Ivy is dawning. See you there. Stephen Moss Foreign affairs Is the Pope a Cat-olic? Many are the mysteries surrounding the high walls of the Vatican. Now there is a new one: does the Pope have a cat in there with him? Benedict XVI is a proven cat-lover. Indeed, according to some Vatican officials, the pontiff is nothing short of a \"cat-whisperer\". \"When he worked at the former Holy Office he spoke to the cats,\" confesses one. \"He would stop and say something in German, probably in Bavarian dialect.\" Few things could do more to reconcile the Romans to a Pope who came to office with a reputation for severity and aloofness. As Monica Cirinna, the council official responsible for animal rights, says, Rome is \"a city where cats are considered as part of the bio-cultural heritage\". Its ruins teem with stray mogs, fed by an entire class of mainly female volunteers, known as gattare. But photocalls with Benedict and his feline friends have not been forthcoming. Vatican protocol dictates that comment is never made on the private affairs of the Pope (it was never actually confirmed, for example, that Pope John Paul II suffered from Parkinson's disease), and so, instead, rumours about his possible pets have proliferated. Last week when it was noticed Benedict was making an unusual number of visits to his old flat, it was assumed that the trips were to feed two cats. A denial from the papal housekeeper, Ingrid Stampa - \"The only cats he owns are made of porcelain\" - did nothing to curb belief in the story. The newspaper Libero made a brave attempt to satisfy the public's appetite by plastering its front page with a photo of a sturdy-looking ginger tom under the headline, Here he is! The Pope's cat! Close textual analysis revealed, however, this was merely \"the cat the pope stroked on his return visits to Bavaria\" and belonged to his brother, Georg. Ms Cirinna, meanwhile, has made a passionate appeal to the Vatican authorities not to bar entry to the Pope's supposed pets, saying it would be \"a mistake to sacrifice such a sweet, delicate and natural relationship\". It is now being reported the two purported felines have, in fact, been quietly moved to the papal apartments. But as soon as one mystery is solved, another appears. A newspaper claimed this week that the Pope gave away at least one cat before his election to an unnamed cardinal who, it said, was feeling depressed. John Hooper"}, "isHosted": false}}}
