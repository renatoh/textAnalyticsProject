Earlier, in the offices of the New Zealand Cricket Board, there had likewise been talk of change. International one-day cricket, itself revolutionary on that January day in Melbourne 31 years ago, has evolved gradually until those who played the game then would scarcely recognise it now. Floodlights, coloured clothing and white balls have come and stayed. So, too, fielding restrictions. Captains and coaches have racked their brains to try to beat the system. We have had specialist batters and bowlers and the mongrel cricketer, good enough at neither but \"doing a job\". Ten years ago in the World Cup the Kiwis had an off-spinner, Dipak Patel, taking the new ball, and a human helicopter, Mark Greatbatch, opening the batting, and they nearly got to the final. The Sri Lankans redefined the use of the first 15 overs when the field was in, and won the trophy in 1995. Later South Africa and Australia pushed back the frontiers of what is possible. Totals achieved routinely now would have been considered astronomical even a decade ago. Now the game is changing once more, and unquestionably for the better, with one bouncer above shoulder height allowed each over. No longer can batsmen push forward secure in the knowledge that even the fastest of bowlers have been emasculated. The game has taken on a new and spectacular dimension, adding an edge that has been missing perhaps since the no-holds-barred stuff of Kerry Packer's World Series in the 70s. So at the weekend, when the New Zealand selectors learned that their fast-bowling sensation Shane Bond had a stress fracture of an ankle, the reaction was not to call up a familiar face but to turn to Ian Butler, a lad of minimal experience but who had been seen by Ross Dykes, a former chairman of selectors, giving England the hurry-up at Hamilton last week. \"It is a gamble,\" conceded Stephen Fleming, New Zealand's captain, \"but it is a calculated one in that we think genuine pace is essential to one-day cricket in the way it is being played. \"The recent tri-series in Australia has given an indication as to how the game might be played in [the World Cup in] South Africa in 12 months. It is the South Africans who are leading the way and their attack is based on pace. With the new bouncer rule, the game has changed.\" It has certainly altered the way opening batsmen will be allowed to play. Fleming and England's Nasser Hussain have pointed out that openers will no longer be allowed to \"swing from the hip\", as the captains like to call it, without risking a strong retort. Nor is the bouncer the defensive weapon it was before it was banned in one-day cricket. Instead, as Sir Richard Hadlee said on Mon day, the cross-bat shots, a lost art against pacemen in the short form of the game, must come back into vogue. The bouncer is an attacking ball to be taken on, and fields are being set accordingly. So pinch-hitters, for example, are not necessarily the answer now. England appear to have settled on Marcus Trescothick and Nick Knight at the top of their order, but New Zealand have yet to find a combination with which they are comfortable. They have tried 11 in the past year, four in the tri-series alone. For the first of these five one-day games with England another will be tried. All the countries are feeling their way but in terms of World Cup preparation they have been given sufficient notice to get it right. England are on the way although they have a way to go, but it would be in total keeping with the resourcefulness of the Kiwis for them to come up with something exceptional. Anyone who can produce the All Blacks, Kiri Te Kanawa and Cloudy Bay sauvignon blanc can never be discounted. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
