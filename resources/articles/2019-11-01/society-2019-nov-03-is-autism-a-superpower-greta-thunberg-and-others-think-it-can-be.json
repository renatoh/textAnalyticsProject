Several times. I was diagnosed with Asperger\u2019s syndrome at 42 and, seven years on, I\u2019m still far from sure what that means. Are those of us with autistic spectrum conditions disabled or different? Are we, by definition, deficient human beings, or are there compensations that come with our condition? Are there any circumstances in which autism could be considered, not merely an acceptable difference, but a superpower? Thunberg\u2019s comment some two months ago was her robust response to commentators who had sought to use her Asperger\u2019s to discredit her, claiming she must be a nave puppet and calling her a \u201cweirdo\u201d with a \u201cmonotone voice\u201d. She wrote: \u201cI have Asperger\u2019s and that means I\u2019m sometimes a bit different from the norm. And \u2013 given the right circumstances \u2013 being different is a superpower. #aspiepower.\u201d As a fellow autist, I find myself stuck in the middle of these two incompatible views: on the one hand, autistic people are disturbed, na\u00efve individuals who are incapable of knowing their own minds or speaking credibly; on the other, autistic people are superhumans with a preternatural ability to see the truth of things and to articulate it without equivocation. The world would be better without us; the world would be lost without us. Food writer and campaigner Jack Monroe, too, has written that learning to harness her own autistic traits has enabled her to see them \u201cas a kind of superpower\u201d. Novelist Katherine May is more ambiguous: \u201cMy autism brings some things I really value \u2013 the flood of words I experience, the ability to fixate on a subject and burrow deep into it, and an intense relationship with the natural world. But there are other bits I\u2019d get rid of. I break things and hurt myself all the time; and I hate the way that I don\u2019t remember faces and so come across as rude.\u201d Charlotte Moore, who has written about bringing up two autistic sons with high support needs, told me: \u201cI don\u2019t see my sons\u2019 autism as a disability, exactly. In the right environment, they can (and mainly do) lead happy, healthy lives. So I prefer the word \u2018difference\u2019 to \u2018disability\u2019.\u201d She continued: \u201cCan autism be a superpower? Probably, yes, in a few cases \u2013 some autistic people do have extreme abilities \u2013 but the popular belief that all autistic people are really geniuses isn\u2019t helpful to parents or carers struggling with autistic people with no speech and self-harming behaviours, meltdowns or sensory overload.\u201d When I received my own diagnosis, I wanted to find out what it meant. I learned that Asperger\u2019s syndrome is a controversial condition, sometimes set apart from other forms of autism. Since 2013 it has no longer been recognised as a stand-alone diagnosis in the United States, now falling under the umbrella term autism spectrum disorder (ASD), but it still is in the UK. The opposing views of autism \u2013 disability or difference \u2013 may owe their origins to two different models of autism outlined by two different psychiatrists. On the one hand, there is Leo Kanner\u2019s autism, first described in the US in the late 1940s. It is characterised by repetitive movement, little or no speech and high support needs. On the other hand, there is Asperger\u2019s syndrome, named after Hans Asperger, the child psychologist and eugenicist who published the first definition of the condition in 1944, describing the children he encountered in his clinic in wartime Vienna as \u201clittle professors\u201d. He famously said: \u201cIt seems that for success in science and art, a dash of autism is essential.\u201d For a long time, it was the Kanner view that prevailed. Autism was considered a severe disability \u2013 and a rare one. Then, in 1976, the British psychiatrist Lorna Wing coined the term Asperger\u2019s syndrome and a new group of patients \u2013 mostly children, overwhelmingly male \u2013 began to receive this diagnosis. Autism is no longer considered rare. According to the National Autistic Society, just over 1% of the population is autistic. Other estimates are higher. Although Asperger\u2019s syndrome is no longer recognised in the United States, there are people who have grown up with it as their identity and they are sticking with it. Others have abandoned it in favour of the broader ASD. Controversy over Hans Asperger\u2019s possible involvement in the Nazis\u2019 eugenics programme led some to drop the term. Many, like me, use autism and Asperger\u2019s interchangeably. I usually define myself as \u201cautistic\u201d, because I don\u2019t recognise any essential difference between myself and non-speaking autistic people. I tried to figure out what autism might explain in my own life, including some of its negative aspects. I\u2019d had long experience of depression, anxiety and OCD. Had they arisen directly from a glitchy abnormal brain? Had they come about as a response to the adverse life experiences that accompany any difference, or might hypothetical non-autistic me have had them, too? And what about the more positive aspects? Would non-autistic me ever have had the focus or determination to persevere in the financially insecure, isolating, all-consuming business of writing? I have always loved words and books. At the age of three, I would take my whole library to bed with me. My mother described me as a \u201cnot very childish\u201d child, who preferred to talk to adults rather than other children. When I was nine, a teacher read a poem I\u2019d written to the class, and I decided then and there to be a writer. That was a rare happy moment at primary school. Like many parents of autistic children, my parents found themselves with a child that mainstream education refused to accommodate. Their solution (not one open to everybody) was to re-mortgage the house and send me to private school. For my parents, my autism, literally, came at a great cost. If I picture myself at Thunberg\u2019s age, I see certain similarities. I was idealistic, passionate about what I believed, blunt in the expression of my ideas. I was uninterested in makeup or any other aspect of what my mother called \u201cmaking the best of myself\u201d. I was a vegetarian, because two years earlier Morrissey had said that meat was murder. I didn\u2019t go in much for what people think of as normal teenage socialising. Instead, I pursued my own interests \u2013 and I pursued them single-mindedly. My passions were writing, the Beatles and feminism. I read my way through the Women\u2019s Studies section of Edgware Library, and passed The Female Eunuch round the sixth form at my all-girls\u2019 school, to raise the consciousness of the sisterhood. I announced to my mother that I was not going to go to university, because to do so would only mean following a patriarchal curriculum. Mum told me to stop being so silly. I went to university, but I took Greer and De Beauvoir with me. So that was how I was 33 years ago: intellectually curious, idealistic and articulate. I could even be funny sometimes, but I was also intense and sullen, with few social graces. Asperger\u2019s wasn\u2019t available to me as a diagnosis in the 1980s, but people found other words for me. They said \u201cmoody\u201d and \u201cdifficult\u2019 or \u201cthinks too much\u201d. I still find it painfully difficult to maintain a conversation with more than one or two people at once. I have to overcome a wagon-load of inertia in order to clean my teeth, wash and dress. On a bad day, it seems to me that everything I have managed to do as an adult \u2013 earn money, find a partner, raise a child \u2013 has only been possible because I have learned to suppress my autism. But that\u2019s not to say I see no advantages. Like Greta Thunberg and the comedian Hannah Gadsby, I find public speaking easier than casual conversation. In her brilliant Ted talk, Gadsby asks how she can be so good at something \u2013 talking \u2013 she knows she is so bad at. The answer is that standup has none of the pitfalls conversation brings for autistic people. When she is on stage, Gadsby does not have to listen as well as speak, she does not have to figure out how to respond to what she hears, she does not have to do all the exhausting parallel processing that an autistic person has to consciously engage in during everyday conversation. She has figured out what she wants to say and she can just say it, without distraction or interruption. Perfect. And I can add from personal experience, that when you have to perform almost every time you interact, performing in front of 1,000 people isn\u2019t very different to performing in front of three. To a non-autistic person, who finds conversation easy but public speaking unnerving, this may well look like a superpower. Another trait that we have on our side is the intensity of focus with which we pursue our passions. Chris Packham, naturalist and environmentalist and ambassador for the National Autistic Society, explained how the strength of his sensory response to the world around him enables him to \u201cengage with the natural world with greater clarity and ease\u201d. Packham said that from an early age, he could \u201csee things which others couldn\u2019t in nature\u201d. There is a third trait associated with Asperger\u2019s syndrome that Packham shares with Thunberg and which makes them both such effective activists. It is a certain moral single-mindedness, sometimes pathologised as \u201crigidity of thought\u201d, but at other times framed more positively as \u201ca strong sense of justice\u201d. Thunberg has spoken of her ability to see things \u201cin black and white\u201d \u2013 for her, this is not rigidity, but clarity. Autistic people, in general, feel the pull of the truth more powerfully than we do the pull of fitting in. We are not inclined to accept reassurance that has no facts behind it. Sometimes I do pretend to accept it. I\u2019ve changed since I was a teenager: softened, become more pragmatic. It makes me easier to get on with, but when I watch Thunberg, I wonder what I might have done if I hadn\u2019t spent so much energy learning how to smile when I talked. I asked Steve Silberman, author of NeuroTribes: the Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neurodiversity, whether he agreed with Thunberg. \u201cAutism,\u201d he said, \u201cis a disability that can have advantages in the right situation, and with the right support. Greta\u2019s intense focus and disregard for others\u2019 opinions of her are \u2018superpowers\u2019 in that they help her ignore the fossil-fuel industry\u2019s lies, take on the facts of climate change, and organise her peers to change the world.\u201d Perhaps we can change the world, if we don\u2019t let it change us too much. Packham has suggested that: \u201cHumanity has prospered because of people with autistic traits. Without them, we wouldn\u2019t have put a man on the Moon or be running software programmes. If we wiped out all the autistic people on the planet, I don\u2019t know how much longer the human race would last.\u201d At the same time, there are some autistic people who see no advantage in it, and would gladly take a cure. There are some parents so desperate to believe in a cure that they put their faith in bogus treatments, sometimes with terrible consequences. So, what do I have \u2013 a disability or a difference? I asked developmental psychologist Professor Uta Frith the question: \u201cBoth points of view are valid and should be respected,\u201d she told me. \u201cWe might avoid confusion by dividing the spectrum into subgroups, but where the boundaries would be is far from clear. We need more research to tell us what autism really is.\u201d There\u2019s no telling where the boundaries are between a person\u2019s autism and the autistic person. As far as I can tell, everything I am, I am autistically. If you took the autism away you would take me with it. And, regardless of whether autistic people have superpowers or not, when the world gives us the support we need, we thrive, and give the best of ourselves in return. You\u2019ve not seen the best of us yet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
