Now Boro have to manoeuvre him into the job without the necessary qualifications, as Newcastle United did a few weeks ago with Glenn Roeder. A large part of Boro's argument will rest on them having had to provide Steve McClaren as England's manager at a month's notice. As Newcastle's chairman Freddy Shepherd did, Boro's Steve Gibson and chief executive Keith Lamb will have to lobby other Premier League clubs for their support. But John Barnwell of the League Managers Association heavily criticised the plan. \"They can't do it [appoint Southgate] - it's as simple as that,\" he said. \"My understanding is that Middlesbrough have had lengthy discussions with the Premier League over the weekend and they have been flatly refused. Gareth Southgate may be working towards becoming a coach but at this stage he hasn't got the necessary qualifications to do the job.\" Gibson reacted by saying: \"What does John Barnwell know about taking a club from liquidation to the Uefa Cup final? I have to do what's in the best interests of Middlesbrough. Why should I be stopped from doing that because of beaurocracy?\" Like Roeder, Southgate does not have the Pro Licence deemed mandatory for managing in the top division in England and on the continent; in fact he has yet to complete his Uefa A coaching badge. The 35-year-old has completed his Uefa B badge and was due to begin his A badge the week of the Uefa Cup final. That course was being rescheduled but Middlesbrough, should they choose to do so, could instal Steve Round, who does have the Pro Licence, as nominal manager. Round was Steve McClaren's assistant and is valued by Gibson. A similar arrangement saw Chris Coleman appointed at Fulham with Steve Kean the possessor of the Pro Licence. It would mean an end to the Boro captain's playing career, which began in 1988 at Crystal Palace and brought him 57 England caps. \"I know the chairman will get it right and I am sure every Middlesbrough fan knows,\" Southgate said of the Boro managerial succession recently. \"As it stands I am here to play for another season and I am more than happy to do that. That was the intention all along - until someone tells me otherwise.\" Everton's attempt to complete the signing of Joleon Lescott from Wolverhampton Wanderers for an initial \u00a34.5m will have to wait until the centre-half returns from holiday next week after the Merseysiders' medical assessment of the 23-year-old revealed areas of concern. Lescott missed Wolves' entire season in the Premiership in 2003-4 after an injury required the reconstruction of his right knee. Everton will examine that joint again having grown frustrated at the Wolves chief executive Jez Moxey's suggestion over the weekend that the player had passed a medical. That comment was made hours after Everton had requested a second set of x-rays of the knee. Lescott has agreed personal terms but has since gone on holiday and will not be able to return for further tests until the end of the week. Jim Magilton has been confirmed as the manager of Ipswich. The 37-year-old former Northern Ireland international succeeds Joe Royle and becomes the youngest manager in the Championship."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
