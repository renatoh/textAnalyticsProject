The Dutch side took the lead in Amsterdam after 11 minutes through Zlatan Ibrahimovic who capitalised on an error by the goal-keeper Francesco Antonioli. The substitute Jari Litmanen made it 2-0 midway through the second half, curling a shot in from the edge of the box, before Gabriel Batistuta pulled a goal back with a header in the 89th minute. It was small consolation. Roma are pointless after two games. Meanwhile Internazionale defeated Bayer Leverkusen 3-2 to take a three-point lead in Group A over Barcelona, who try again tonight to play their game against Newcastle. Internazionale established a two-goal cushion by half-time thanks to goals from Luigi Di Biagio in Milan's Giuseppe Meazza Stadium in the 15th and 27th minutes. Boris Zivkovic pulled a goal back for Bayer Leverkusen in the 62nd minute. Then Milan's third goal came courtesy of Leverkusen's Jorg Butt in the 80th minute when he fumbled a low cross and the ball rolled over the line. In injury-time Francoaldo Franca headed into the far corner for Leverkusen's second."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
