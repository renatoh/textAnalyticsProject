The UK\u2019s largest retailer, Tesco, said earlier this week that it would allow its shoppers to pay with the round pound coins at tills and self-service machines for an extra week in apparent defiance of the 15 October deadline the Royal Mint has imposed. It follows a similar announcement by the discount retailer Poundland, which will accept round pounds until 31 October. About 500m are believed to remain in circulation. Aldi said: \u201cWe\u2019ve been ready to accept the new \u00a31 coins since they first came into circulation in March. To make the transition as easy as possible for our customers, we will continue to accept the old \u00a31 coins as payment across our stores until 31 October.\u201d The old coin remains legal tender until midnight on Sunday. After that time, businesses can stop accepting it and will not automatically be giving it as change for notes. The Royal Mint and the Treasury were keen for retailers to stick to the deadline for a clean break from the round pound to avoid potential chaos being created by some shops continuing to accept them. The new 12-sided \u00a31 coin, which resembles the old threepenny bit, entered circulation in March and has new high-tech security features to thwart counterfeiters. The production of the new coins followed concerns about round pounds being vulnerable to sophisticated counterfeiters. About one in 30 old-style pound coins in people\u2019s change has been fake in recent years."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
