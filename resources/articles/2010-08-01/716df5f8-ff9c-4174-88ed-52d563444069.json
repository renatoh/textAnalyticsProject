The team only began to compete in around 1970 but within 30 years was a serious contender at men's level and No1 in women's chess. Yet the national game remains Chinese chess and the global version has little public support. The secret has been well-directed government backing to identify young talent and provide intensive coaching. China will be going for medals again at next month's world team Olympiad in Russia, although the home squad will be heavy favourites. China has also created its own elite tournament at Nanjing, where the top two finishers qualify for a Grand Slam final against world champion Vishy Anand and world No1 Magnus Carlsen. However, Chinese progress has stalled in the past couple of years. Beijing's best grandmasters reached the top 20-30 in world rankings, but could not break convincingly into the top 10. Meanwhile the gifted girl prodigy Hou Yifan, who was expected to challenge Hungary's Judit Polgar as the best female player of all time, also made slower progress and remained behind India's Humpy Koneru, the world No2. Such a pattern can be a danger to funding in any country where top chess is backed by the government. Chinese setbacks contrasted with the brilliant form of the small Caucasian republics of Armenia, gold medallists at the 2006 and 2008 Olympiads, and Azerbaijan, 2009 European team champions with three grandmasters in the top 20. Very recently, however, China has made a fresh effort to renew its advance with high profile successes. In this month's match against Russia, which fielded a second string but still highly ranked squad, China won impressively 15\u00bd\u20139\u00bd. Moreover Hou Yifan, now 16, has just scored her best result yet, winning the female grand prix unbeaten ahead of Koneru. And at next month's World Universities Championship in Zurich China's entry world No18 Wang Yue should outclass the field. This game from the China v Russia women's match shows a much debated opening line from the Pirc 1 e4 d6. Black's early choice is between 5...0-0 and the sharper 5...c5 which followed previous play until Black faltered with 15...Qa4? Instead Nxa2+ 16 Ka1 Qb5! is fine. White then cashed in her attack with the incisive 19 d6! and 25 Nd8 leading to mate.
