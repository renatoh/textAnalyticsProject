Golf is a man's game, and this is not necessarily a compliment, for the side of the male psyche it appeals to is the literal, anal, completist, constrained and emotionally constipated one. It's a game defined by rules, of play and etiquette, that can give the impression that it is less 21st-century sport and more encrusted gentleman's club. And never is this more evident than when the BBC does the Masters and Gary Lineker morphs from one of the lads into a fawning butler. The jokes are replaced by hushed tones. We, the unworthy, are privileged to be allowed entrance. To be able to watch Tiger Woods play Amen Corner is akin to being given a spoonful of the best sponge pudding in clubland, with treacle. It doesn't necessarily follow from Cryer's statement that people who play golf don't like women, although there is evidence in support of this proposition. For instance, neither the Royal and Ancient nor Augusta accept women as members. Worse, those clubs which allow women in but subject them to no-go areas, no-play times, and draw lines in the bar they must never cross. All of this is repugnant and should be knocked on the head yet golf, literal and legalistic and hidebound, remains resistant to change. In part, and on some deep level, this may be a territorial thing. The golf course is where men go to get away from it all, the all usually being their family. Like fishing and trainspotting, golf is an activity in which the actor spends an inordinate amount of time attempting to do one simple thing \u2013 put a ball in a hole, catch a fish, spot a train. There's no need for multi-tasking. The simplicity of the task, however, does not prevent it being extremely expensive, with fortunes capable of being spent on equipment and green fees. Golf, fishing and trainspotting are perfect hobbies in that they require one to spend large sums of money and thereby leave one with neither inclination nor funds to do anything else. Furthermore, and crucially, they can never be finished. There will always be another hole, another fish, another train. Once one sees golf as trainspotting \u2013 a somewhat odd activity practised predominantly, but not entirely, by men \u2013 then it makes a lot more sense. If you consider \u2013 to choose at random from day one's top 10 in Augusta \u2013 Chad Campbell, Larry Mize, Hunter Mahon. Mike Weir and Todd Hamilton to be trainspotters, then, at a stroke, their purpose and motivation becomes apparent. They are quiet and God\u2011fearing men going about their lonely work, with patience and dignity. That they may appear a little dull, a little hemmed in, is the fault of their work. There is as little room for histrionics in golf as in trainspotting. Which is why I enjoy golf most when it is played by those least suited to it. When unbuttoned and flamboyant men such as Big John Daly, Monty and Seve pick up a club and set off on a rollercoaster ride of our, and their, emotions. This is when the game becomes magnetic, when the lateral take on the literal, the careering take on the careerists. And there was never one more swashbuckling than Seve, whose contempt for the rules and the rule-bound was magnificent to behold, and who played the \"man's game\" with the grace and passion of a diva."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
