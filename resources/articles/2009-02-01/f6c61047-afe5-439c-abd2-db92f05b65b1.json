That was the stark warning from the Japanese car manufacturer yesterday as speculation continued over whether Richard Branson's Virgin group might make a bid for the Brackley-based team, thus saving 700 jobs there and guaranteeing the formula one futures of Jenson Button and Bruno Senna. \"It's true that we are pursuing several potential buyers,\" the Honda spokesman, Hiroyuki Murase, said in Tokyo, although he declined to name interested parties. \"But the team may still have to be disbanded if the negotiations fail.\" Bernie Ecclestone, the formula one commercial right holder, said that he is keen for Branson to make a bid. \"I've spoken to Richard's people about it. He would love to do it,\" he said. \"I'd like it very much. It would be super. We're working to try to make it happen.\" However, Ecclestone added that the team's future is on a knife edge. \"I have no idea which way it will go. I wouldn't bet on it either way,\" he said. Honda decided to put its underperforming team up for sale at the start of December as a result of the global economic recession. The company, which has a major UK manufacturing plant in Swindon, felt it could no longer justify the expense at a time it was putting a large proportion of its global labour force on short-time working. It has long been understood that Honda would be prepared to make a significant contribution to the team's running costs in 2009 should any buyer be prepared to take it off their hands, reasoning that this would be a cheaper means of winding it down than funding the redundancy bill for the workforce. Honda withdrew its own V8 formula one engines from the Brackley premises in Northamptonshire within days of announcing it would be withdrawing from formula one. There was never any prospect of the company permitting any buyer to use them, but Mercedes-Benz has stepped forward and said it will lease engines on a commercial basis to any new owner who saves the team. The final deadline falls early next week. There might be a couple of days' grace if developments are moving in a positive direction, but any further delays would make it almost impossible for the team to make the first grand prix of the season, in Australia on 29 March."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
