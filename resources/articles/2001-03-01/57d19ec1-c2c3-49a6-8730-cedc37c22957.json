In a hard hitting report into the role of ministerial special advisers, the cross-party public administration committee will say that handing over such powers to Mr Campbell has upset relations within government. The report will be published after the former premier, John Major, who is standing down at the next election, launched a stinging attack on the government for fostering a \"miserable political climate of spin\". In his farewell speech to MPs last night, he said: \"I hope we will be able to end the miserable political climate of spin and counter-spin that has grown up here in recent years.\" His remarks showed what a highly controversial figure Mr Campbell has become since Tony Blair passed a special order after the last election which allowed his press secretary to issue orders to civil servants. Similar powers were handed to Jonathan Powell, the prime minister's chief of staff. Special advisers, who technically become civil servants, are subject to strict rules, and until the prime minister's special order in 1997, were never allowed to issue orders to career civil servants. The public administration committee today says that Mr Campbell and Mr Powell should no longer exercise their powers after the election. Tony Wright, Labour chairman of the Commons committee, raised fears that Mr Campbell and Mr Powell were influencing the promotion of civil servants. Downing Street will dismiss the committee's findings because the prime minister is determined to use Mr Campbell and Mr Powell to tighten his grip across the whole of Whitehall. However, the report will provide powerful ammunition for the Tories who complain that Labour has vastly in creased the number of special advisers as it attempts to politicise the civil service. The report points out that Mr Blair has appointed 27 special advisers to work in Downing Street out of a total staff of 149, a massive increase on the six who served Mr Major. The MPs conclude that seven special advisers, who work in Downing Street's press office and its strategic communications department, should be appointed through open competition. Mr Major demonstrated the unease felt among MPs across the House at the role played by Labour's special advisers when he lambasted the behaviour of spinners. \"We need to separate fact from fiction, substance from soundbite, information from innuendo; the public, the electorate, the people who sent us here deserve more than to be spoon fed a cocktail of headline grabbing feelgood stories,\" he said. \"They deserve the truth; every member of this House, whether backbencher or minister, has the obligation, the duty, to provide it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
