The action cannot of course be compared to the frenzied scenes of looting in Iraq or to the chilling pictures of masked Hong Kong residents but in Brussels terms it is big news. Hacked off that a group of eight countries including Britain have suggested that Eurocrats' generous pensions are perhaps a tad too generous, the trade unions that represent them called a general strike today. Many but not all of EU offialdom's workers stayed away from the office as a warning to the cheeky eight to leave their pensions alone. The result was startling - in Brussels terms. The city's ugly EU quarter was eerily quiet, office blocks looked even more deserted than usual and business was badly down for the scores of Italian, Spanish and Greek restaurants in the area. When Eurocrats go on strike it is clear who really feels the pain - the eateries and watering holes that have come to rely on the largesse of EU officials. Considering there are some 34,000 Eurocrats the picket lines were a little underwhelming. Officials reported that there were four people waving banners outside the European commission's headquarters at 9.30 this morning, a number that swelled to 40-50 before lunchtime when everyone knocked off. Most people, it seemed, had opted simply to stay away. The idea of Eurocrats going on strike might seem laughable if not deeply offensive to many, but Union Syndicale, the largest trade union for EU officials, insists that the situation is deadly serious. It put out a strongly worded statement describing the proposed pension reform as \"conflict-driven, provocative and unacceptable\". Countries such as Britain are adamant that reform is unavoidable. Last month they concluded that the current pension system is \"excessively generous\" and warned that the annual cost of EU officials' pensions could rise to almost \u00a31bn by 2020. This year the cost is expected to hit \u00a3500m. Under the current system officials can receive a maximum pension of 70% of their final salary and do so by accruing two percentage point for every year of service. The offending proposal would change that to 1.75% for every year of service and alter the official retirement age from 60 to 63. The scheme has not yet been agreed but Eurocrats are keen to lay down a marker at an early stage. Eurocrats are also having their working practices overhauled by Neil Kinnock, the European commission's vice-president, and believe that the ideas on pension reform are the last straw. They are painfully aware of their stereotypical media image as feather-bedded free-loading fat cats but that does not mean, they say, that they should stand by and see their benefits downgraded. \"People are well paid,\" concedes one official. \"But we could be paid far more in the private sector. Whether you're paid peanuts or in gold it's natural to try and defend what you have.\" Others are more sceptical. \"It looks very bad when Eurocrats go on strike,\" says an official who prefers not to be named. \"Especially when they decide to go on strike on Friday. People are going to say they just want a long weekend.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
