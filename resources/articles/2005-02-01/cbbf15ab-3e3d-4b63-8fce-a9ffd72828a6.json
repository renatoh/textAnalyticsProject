Cardiff's Millennium Stadium is on the horizon for the the second successive season for a club now unbeaten in 10 games since the turn of the year. Last February it was heartache at the hands of Middlesbrough in the Carling Cup final. This time around Bolton are much better equipped and not many teams will fancy their chances of derailing them in this run of form. Manager Sam Allardyce made five changes to the side that drew with Middlesbrough yet they were still too strong for Fulham. Former France and Roma defender Vincent Candela made his debut while Nicky Hunt, Henrik Pedersen, Fernando Hierro and Khalilou Fadiga were also recalled. Candela showed good awareness in the fifth minute to get across the area and head away an inswinging cross from Luis Boa Morte. Fadiga then peeled away from his marker in the 10th minute to hook a shot over the bar following a long throw from Jay-Jay Okocha. Bolton took the lead a minute later through Davies after good work from Pedersen. The Danish striker spotted Davies unmarked in the area and he steered a shot inside goalkeeper Edwin Van der Sar's near post. Fulham responded and Andy Cole got away from Hierro in the 17th minute only to clip his effort over the top. Cole then tried to set up Boa Morte in a sweeping move but Tal Ben Haim was alert to the danger and threaded the ball back to goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen. Fulham were coming more into the game and winning a lot of possession with Tomasz Radzinski particularly industrious. They stepped up the pressure and Papa Bouba Diop strode forward in the 26th minute but his effort cleared the bar. A minute later Cole latched on to a good ball from captain Lee Clark and cut inside, only to drag his shot wide. It was an open game and Bolton were not having it their own way despite Davies's early goal. The home side were again forced on the back foot after 36 minutes when Sylvain Legwinski released Radzinski. The Canadian striker failed to test Jaaskelainen, however, with his shot finishing off-target. This was a worrying spell for Bolton as they were finding it difficult to get out of their own half. However they almost added a second in the 40th minute from a set piece. Hierro got enough power on his effort 25 yards out but it drifted wide of Van der Sar's post at the last minute. Fulham continued to threaten but their finishing was wasteful with Boa Morte striking a shot wide in first half stoppage time. Van der Sar had to be alert in the 48th minute to punch away an inswinging free kick from former Real Madrid ace Hierro. Davies was putting in a solid shift for Bolton and latched on to a long clearance from Jaaskelainen four minutes later. He tried to pick out Pedersen but Fulham managed to scramble the ball clear. Bolton had started the second half at a higher tempo than they had finished the first period and the home fans were beginning to find their voice. Fulham hit back and Radzinski scampered away down the right and released Cole but Jaaskelainen managed to smother his effort. Then Radzinski cut inside after 58 minutes only for Jaaskelainen to react superbly and parry the ball around the post. Allardyce made his first change in the 61st minute with Ricardo Gardner coming on for the ineffective Fadiga. Diop showed some good skill three minutes later before rattling a 25-yard shot narrowly over the bar. Bolton picked up the pace again and Hierro showed his ability from dead ball situations by picking out Okocha. However the Nigerian playmaker could only get the slightest touch on his header and Van der Sar was able to breath a sigh of relief. Pedersen should have added a second in the 70th minute but Goma cleared his close range effort off the line after Okocha had set up the opening. Pedersen paid the price for missing that clear chance by being replaced immediately by Kevin Nolan. Van der Sar then did well to block a thumping 25-yard free kick from Okocha in the 84th minute. But Diop almost pulled Fulham level with two minutes to go only for Gardner to scramble his effort off the line."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
