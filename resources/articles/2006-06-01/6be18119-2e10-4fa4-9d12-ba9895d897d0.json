That homogeneity, more of which later, is part of the problem. But the music on offer could not be more at odds with the mood among some radio executives. For them, Status Quo's Deeper and Down might better reflect the fact that with each new set of listening figures the BBC continues to extend its lead over the commercial sector. The BBC has taken its highest ever share of the radio market - 55.4% - opening up its biggest lead yet over its commercial rivals, whose share of the total radio market sank to 42.6%, the lowest since new ratings methodology was introduced a decade ago. And while it is hard to imagine GCap chief Ralph Bernard, head of the biggest commercial radio group, cavorting with a bunch of daffodils, Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now might be apt for a man who recently placed Capital FM in \"intensive care\" and announced record \u00a347.9m losses. Where once they had an effective local monopoly, with only the BBC as competition in any given region, commercial radio stations now have to deal with headspinningly rapid change. The proliferation of the iPod gives people a virtual radio station in their pocket: on-demand listening and podcasting are changing the way people engage with radio and allowing them to tune in to stations from around the world. The way we listen is changing too, with 11.4% of listening now via a digital platform. Listeners are tuning in via their TVs and a TV broadcaster, Channel 4, last week unveiled plans to move into radio in a big way. Meanwhile, the internet is eating into radio's ad revenues with overall income down by 5% in 2005 and recent industry forecasts putting the rate of growth at barely above inflation over the next few years. A sector in decline Channel 4's announcement was the first step towards its ultimate goal of winning the new national digital radio licence that Ofcom plans to put up for grabs in the autumn. The broadcaster, which is in talks with various partners and sees radio as another means of diversifying its income streams ahead of an inevitable erosion in ad revenue from its main channel, is already hot favourite to secure the spectrum. It will launch around four stations, leaving room for others but also - crucially - for its own interactive and mobile TV services. Although careful not to say so directly, chief executive Andy Duncan painted a portrait of a sector in decline. \"Commercial radio has probably seen better times and we think Channel 4 can provide a shot in the arm,\" he said, listing a string of new shows that will be made available on the internet and through digital radio station OneWord, in which it holds a 51% stake, ahead of a bid for the digital multiplex. He also revealed that Jim Moir, the man who revolutionised Radio 2, had been hired as a consultant. The ultimate aim, according to Duncan, is to offer a mix of high-quality output that, like the TV channel, will offer a balance of the credibly commercial (music, entertainment and TV spin-offs) and a genuine public service alternative to the BBC (speech radio aimed at a younger, less fusty audience than Radio 4). The broadcaster's announcement was broadly welcomed by the radio industry, although Phil Riley, chief executive of Chrysalis Radio, was not alone when he wryly noted: \"It's easy for a company with no shareholders and profits of \u00a375m a year to make that statement. It's not so easy for commercial radio groups who are suffering erosion of ad revenues and shouldering years of digital investment.\" Channel 4's presentation contended that on radio, \"unlike on TV, digital hasn't led to greater choice or diversity\". While overall listening figures continue to rise, fewer under 45s (the most important listeners to commercial stations) are tuning in. Channel 4's new director of radio, Nathalie Schwarz, formerly head of strategy at Capital, believes that existing commercial stations are under-serving listeners who want more diversity and more choice. \"I believe that commercial radio has a bright future - radio is an amazing medium that has always enjoyed a strong connection with its listeners,\" she said. \"There is no reason why this can't continue, but to do this radio needs to adapt to listeners' evolving needs. We can grab these younger listeners back and engage with them. We think Channel 4 can offer something new to commercial radio by investing in areas that traditionally have been exclusively the preserve of the BBC, providing a genuine alternative and also delivering radio in new ways that tap into changing media consumption habits.\" The charge sheet against the commercial sector implies there has been a creative failure at its heart. When the sector was awash with ad revenues five or six years ago, with the prospect of industry consolidation offering the chance to build national scale and investment in digital radio offering commercial operators the chance to compete with the BBC on a level playing field, the prognosis was good. Some now believe that, as a result, too much attention was paid to internal politics, structures, licence bids and paperwork and not enough to anticipating the creative challenge of continuing to engage young people in a fast changing world. Instead of investing in new talent and genuinely new ideas, they rushed for the middle ground - resulting, as one former radio executive put it, in \"wall-to-wall pop and prattle\". Looking back even further, some say the rebellious spirit, inventiveness and fun that once pervaded the sector has given way to staid conformity. Meanwhile, the anti-BBC brigade wail at the commercialism of Chris Moyles while conveniently forgetting that commercial radio let him go. It was a point robustly made by BBC director general Mark Thompson in these pages (Future of the BBC, May 22 2006), when he challenged commercial rivals: \"What happened to your 5.1% annual growth in radio ad revenues? Did you spend it on content? Did you focus on your audiences and core creative proposition? If not, be careful before laying the blame for your problems at our door.\" Resurgent BBC Even in the world of digital radio, there is insufficient choice with too many \"me too\", pre-programmed music stations, argue critics. Add in a resurgent BBC, with Radio 1 once again connecting with its target audience and Radio 2 remodelled for a new era with a host of big names, and an advertising dip and there is a problem. That is partly why the industry has launched a new trade body, the Radio- Centre, and appointed an outsider - former Coca-Cola and Nestl\u00e9 marketing man Andrew Harrison - to run it. Its chairman Paul Brown, a vociferous critic of Radios 1 and 2 in his former position as head of the Commercial Radio Companies Association, said: \"Commercially funded broadcasters are going through a tough time and the advertising economy is uncertain. We have to give advertisers practical ideas of what radio advertising can do, sales solutions, which we haven't been good at,\" adding that while radio remained \"intimate and hugely popular\" they had to work harder to put \"more excitement back in to commercial radio\". \"It doesn't help when your market leader is on fire, because it burns you all,\" adds Virgin Radio chief executive Fru Hazlitt in reference to GCap's post-merger woes. GWR and Capital Radio's \u00a3711m merger has been difficult, with the culture clash leading to boardroom battles and plummeting listening figures. The new company, GCap Media, is now worth around \u00a3390m. \"GCap has been in turmoil, which is unwelcome for the industry, but the company suggests the problems are behind them and having an industry leader on the front foot rather than the back foot will be helpful,\" says Numis media analyst Paul Richards, in the understated manner beloved of the City. \"The merger is complete, morale is sky-high and we're building a very confident GCap culture,\" says Steve Orchard, operations director at GCap, not entirely convincingly. But it is important, says Emap managing director of radio programming Mark Story, not to mistake short-term problems for long-term decline. \"I just don't feel there is any sort of creative desert. We're doing some stuff that's really exciting and we're preparing for the future,\" he says. Other executives say that the industry is learning to be creative again, coming up with new formats to woo back listeners after years of relying on new licences alone for continued growth. Hazlitt was a sales chief at Capital before leaving to join Yahoo!, where she rose to European head, and then returning to radio at Virgin. In the intervening years, she says, not enough has changed in the way advertising is sold and the medium marketed. Riley, too, says that away from talk of high-profile breakfast DJs and marketing campaigns, the more prosaic but perhaps biggest issue is the way advertising is sold. \"Our trading system isn't fit for the 21st century. We've got to start selling against individual demographics,\" he says. Hazlitt adds that radio must stop being sold as a commodity. All agree that digital is the route back to the listener's heart. Orchard points to the rise in listeners at stations such as Planet Rock, up 61% in the last Rajar figures, and its success in building Xfm into a quasi-national network. Story points to the storming success of Kerrang! radio. Each group has its examples of green shoots of digital growth. While Hazlitt and Story say a multiplatform approach is preferable, Orchard and Riley prioritise DAB. Because commercial radio will have a bigger presence than the BBC on digital radio, which is now in 3m homes and within the next decade will also become ubiquitous in mobile phones, cars and the home, the idea is that a greater variety of brands will appeal to a wider spread of people. The extent of the problem - and opinion on who is to blame - differs depending on who you talk to. Radio veterans tend to believe that the big problem remains the BBC. Riley, who oversees station brands such as Heart and Galaxy, says the idea that commercial radio was distracted is a \"red herring\" - the emergence of the internet as an advertising force and the strength of Radio 1 and Radio 2 are the key factors. Blinkered Others are more damning. Hazlitt believes the sector needs to look at its problems more strategically. \"An awful lot of people who are in radio have only ever worked in radio and that's part of the problem. Radio's view of itself is a critical factor and radio's view of itself is a bit blinkered.\" She believes there is a tendency to become obsessed with the BBC or with how radio has fallen out of favour with advertisers, rather than focusing on the fact that listening is still going up and the medium reaches more than 90% of the population. Even Orchard, determined to stay upbeat in the face of the company's travails, admits there has been a tendency towards \"introspection\". Story is clear that the sector as a whole needs to adopt a more sunny disposition and stop blaming others for its problems. \"We've got to get out of the denial stage and say, that's the game,\" he says. \"If you want to be in the game, acknowledge that and move on.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
