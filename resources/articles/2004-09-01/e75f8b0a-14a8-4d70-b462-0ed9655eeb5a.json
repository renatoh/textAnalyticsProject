Evil Genius, shown on the stand of publisher Vivendi Universal, is the second game developed by Camden outfit Elixir - and marks the transition of its creator, Demis Hassabis, 28, from child prodigy to industry bigwig. Hassabis came to prominence aged just 17, when he co-created the hugely successful Theme Park with industry legend Peter Molyneux. Hassabis then headed to Cambridge University, where he picked up a double first in computer science. A chess Master from the age of 12, he won the Mind Sports Olympiad five times between 1998 and 2003 and, after this year's E3 show in May, he participated in a satellite tournament at the World Series of Poker in Las Vegas. Despite an auspicious start, it has not been plain sailing for Hassabis. He founded Elixir in 1998, but it took the company until last year to release its first game, Republic: The Revolution. Republic fostered a belief that perhaps Hassabis was too clever by half. Although sufficiently innovative to win several awards, it arrived late and over budget, and proved somewhat impenetrable to many of the mere mortals who played it. Evil Genius, however, manages to preserve originality while providing a more mainstream gameplay experience. \"We consciously wanted to do something that was more light-hearted and humorous,\" he says. \"Obviously Republic was quite dark and gritty. We were trying to make a crazy statement that a game can be about politics and so on. So with Evil Genius, we wanted to go back to making a game, as opposed to making some kind of art, I suppose. The concept is be Dr Evil or be Dr No.\" The game casts you as a megalomaniac Bond-style villain aiming to achieve global domination. You must build a base, fill it with traps for enemy spies, research technologies and send out your own spies on specific missions. It is an amusing and absorbing game and, to Hassabis's relief, it has been completed on time and on budget, ready for release at the start of next month. Lack of originality in games from major publishers - who play safe with games they know will sell regardless of merit - is a subject of major debate in the games industry. The Hassabis stance is that of an uncompromising, idealistic developer in an unhelpful climate. \"It's getting scarily hard now to do any original intellectual property (IP). From the point of view of a big publisher that has to come up with predictable quarterly revenues, why should they take the risk on original IP? Especially when consumers are buying Spider-Man 2, Shrek 2 and so on. \"We'll try to fight to the bitter end in terms of originality, but even we may have to do some kind of licence at some point. It's a massive challenge to get a game like Harry Potter out on time on all four platforms, but - from a creative standpoint - you're being a third-class citizen, because you're writing a game that is based on a film that is based on a book. What's the difference between the people who make the game of Finding Nemo and the people who make the soft toys?\" Nevertheless, Elixir is working on another original game. \"We can't talk about it, but it's signed to a big American publisher and is a very different game from Republic and Evil Genius, although it is in the strategy/simulation genre. It's more of a story-telling game, and we'll probably announce it before the end of the year.\" Elixir is also developing a prototype of a game that will appear on the next generation of consoles which, with their increased power and graphics abilities, will present a new set of challenges. Hassabis explains: \"You will need armies of animators to make games for the next generation of consoles - I think outsourcing will help. Any independent developer will have to use that for their art resources. I am quite worried about the next generation. Maybe in 10 years' time, when technology is not an issue, things will turn round again, and it will be easier to create an independent game - just like it's easier to create an independent film with a handheld camera and amateur cast.\" Hassabis can now indulge in a rare period of relaxation - although one thing he has planned sounds stressful. He is one of the world's best players of the board game Diplomacy. \"I played in the World Diplomacy Championships two months ago, came sixth out of 250 people, and we won the World Team Diplomacy Championship. Diplomacy is not really relaxing to play - it's like being in a 10-hour business meeting. \"Strangely, the French are the best at it - they have won it for the past four years. But I'm going to play in the European Championship in Munich in October, at the same time as the Oktoberfest.\" Let's hope the latter does not dull his competitiveness in the former."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
