Scotland's biggest annual music event now boasts something like cult status. This could be ascribed to the punters' enthusiasm for getting (as they say round these parts) blootered. But the event, now in its 15th year, is also highly regarded by bands for the civility, nay luxury, of the backstage facilities, and loved by fans for the user-friendliness of the site. There's even a foodie enclave filled with Scottish haute cuisine. Yes, there is such a thing. Glasgow's Glasvegas were a huge hit, Amy Winehouse turned in a sober if listless set, Rage Against the Machine and the Prodigy produced Richter Scale beats, and local heroes Paolo Nutini and Biffy Clyro induced mass hysteria. REM, repeat visitors to T, were crowd-pleasing winners on the Sunday night, with a mass singalong to 'Man in the Moon' filling the huge sky. Defying the doom-mongers talking of a saturated festival market - and despite the brutal stabbing of a 22-year-old in the campsite - next year's 40,000 'early bird' tickets sold out within a day of going on sale last week.
