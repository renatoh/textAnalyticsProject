The party\u2019s leader urged colleagues to throw themselves into the campaigns to stop Ukip\u2019s leader Paul Nuttall from winning in Stoke-on-Trent Central and the Tories\u2019 candidate Trudy Harrison from winning in Copeland, Cumbria. The warnings, delivered at a weekly parliamentary meeting, came amid jitters among those close to Corbyn that a loss in either seats could result in further internal party turmoil and speculation over his position. Challenged over new polling figures which show Labour 18 points behind the Tories, a party aide blamed last summer\u2019s leadership battle for the big gap between the parties. A senior source said Corbyn had asked MPs to back the party\u2019s campaign to win both seats, which is being led by the MP Andrew Gwynne. \u201cThe byelections are on a knife-edge and we are going to have to fight for every vote and people need to support Labour\u2019s campaign in Stoke and Copeland,\u201d the source said. The Conservatives have extended their lead over Labour to 18 points, according an ICM poll for the Guardian. It shows that the Tories are on 44% nationwide \u2013 up two points since a similar survey two weeks ago \u2013 while Labour have moved down one to 26%. The Tories have enjoyed a larger lead in just three polls in this series, which dates back to 1983, said ICM. Two of these came shortly before the 1983 general election, when Michael Foot went down to a crushing defeat at the hands of Margaret Thatcher, and the other at a low-point in Gordon Brown\u2019s premiership in 2008. Corbyn was returned as Labour leader for the second time in two years in September, beating a challenge by Owen Smith. The senior party source said Labour had been in the lead in the polls in May last year but has fallen away since last summer\u2019s string of resignations from the shadow cabinet that followed the Brexit vote result, and the subsequent leadership battle. \u201cIn the last round of local elections in May, Labour was ahead of the Tories by one point,\u201d the source said. \u201cAfter the leadership challenge and the dissension in the Labour party, that was held back. Ever since the changes in the Tory leadership, the Tories have been in a strong position. \u201cBut we are confident that won\u2019t continue and Labour\u2019s position will improve in the polls. That kind of gap won\u2019t last.\u201d Corbyn believes Labour will bounce back as negotiations over Brexit begin with Europe. \u201cAs soon as the government goes to Brussels over Brexit they will be confronted with the reality of 27 countries briefing against it and I think the internal dissension within the Tory party will be exacerbated by that,\u201d the source said. The Copeland byelection, which was called after Labour\u2019s Jamie Reed announced his resignation from the post in December, could fall to the Tories according to Labour sources. Labour won the seat in the 2015 general election with a majority of 2,564 over the Conservatives in second place. The bookmakers Paddy Power has made the Conservatives favourite to win in Copeland. Corbyn also briefed Labour parliamentarians on plans to expose growing inequality and the \u201cunprecedented\u201d health and social care funding crisis when the chancellor, Philip Hammond, delivers his budget next month."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
