Right now, a small neighbourhood known simply as El Born, off all the usual tourist tracks, has been transformed almost overnight into the stylish, in-vogue heart of the city. Just imagine Soho, Covent Garden and Notting Hill all rolled into one. Small, intimate, friendly and funky, 'Born' (as those in the know call it) is where just about everything fashionable is happening now - in art, clothes design, interior decoration, smart restaurants, cool cocktail lounges, chic wine bars and hip dance clubs. Visiting the Catalan capital for a weekend, it is all too easy to spend your time in crowds of other travellers wandering down the Ramblas, lining up to get into the splendid Picasso or Miro museums, following the trail of Gaudi monuments or exploring the Barrio Gotic - yesterday's trendy quarter, today already a sticky tourist trap. So wander off the well-trodden path to discover El Born, before it gets unmasked for everyone in guide books. The heart and soul of this community is the wide open, tree-lined Passeig del Born. From the thirteenth to the seventeenth centuries, this was pretty much the main square of Barcelona, the site of the city's public festivities, which included jousting tournaments, carnivals and even the burning of heretics during the Inquisition. At one end of the Passeig is an impressive metal and glass structure, the former Mercat del Born covered market, while at the other end is one of the most important Gothic churches in all Catalonia, Santa Maria del Mar. Although the Boquer\u00eda, on the Ramblas, may be the city's most famous food market, the main wholesale business was always done here at El Born and this 1870 building is more impressive architecturally. At the moment, though, it is empty as the traders have been moved to another part of the city, and no one can seem to agree what to do with such a magnificent structure. But with El Born transformed into the cultural hub of Barcelona, it seems almost certain that the market will be transformed into some sort of arts, film or book centre. The Eglesia de Santa Maria del Mar has no such identity problems. Known as the People's Cathedral, this is one of the most popular and frequented religious centres for city inhabitants, and whenever you choose to visit there is the feeling that this is an authentic, functioning place of worship rather than a tourist attraction. Built in the fourteenth century, both the exterior and interior have been wonderfully preserved and restoration work on paintings and stained-glass windows is in continual progress to ensure everyone's favourite church stays in an immaculate state. El Born has two distinct personalities, one daylight, the other nocturnal, the former geared up to shop till you drop, the latter dedicated to some serious partying. Here are a mixture of day and night locales, but just remember that to explore the neighbourhood's vibrant nightlife, you need to pace the evening well by not starting out too early. Most bars and restaurants do not even open till 9pm. Shopping E&amp;A Gispert Carrer Sombrerers 23 Walking along the narrow Carrer Sombrerers - once the hat-making street of Barcelona - you cannot help noticing the enticing smell of freshly roasted coffee that is wafting out of an ancient shop called Gispert. This is an aromatic Aladdin's Cave of spices and herbs, teas and coffees, dried fruit and nuts from around the world. Founded in the 1850s, this venerable establishment feels and looks more like a museum than a simple food emporium. Make sure you take a peek in the back room where an ancient wood-burning stove is still used to roast the coffee. Galeria Principal Sombrerers Carrer Sombrerers 1 Just a couple of doors down from Gispert is a bright, minimalist gallery, run by a friendly English woman, Lucina Fearon. It is the perfect place to get a feel for what is happening in the vibrant avant-garde art scene in Barcelona. As it specialises in prints and lithographs produced by young, up-and-coming artists, prices are surprisingly reasonable. So you may well end up buying an artwork to take home rather than the usual souvenirs. The city's main gallery-land is just round the corner, in Carrer Montcada. Las 40 Ladronas Carrer Esparteria 17 The '40 Thieves' of this boutique's name are actually two young women fashion designers who create fun, daring one-off outfits out of secondhand clothes. Tucked down an alley, the boutique displays finished garments outside, stacked all over the place, while inside the scene is even more anarchic as the two women sit over sewing machines surrounded by piles of old clothes. Shoppers watching their budget can choose something cheap from the heaps; expect stiffer prices for the reworked garments. Vila Viniteca Carrer dels Agullers 7 Wine enthusiasts from all over Barcelona are drawn to this respected store, which has been a feature of the since 1932 and boasts the city's most extensive selection of wines. There is only a small sign on the street, but expect a shock as you walk in, coming face to face with thousands of different bottles stacked on top of each other. Shop assistants have to climb tall ladders then teeter along narrow ledges to reach the highest shelves. Saturday morning is a good time to visit, as there are often free tastings of Catalan vintages. Atalanta Manufactura Passeig del Born 10 Like many of the shops in El Born, Atalanta Manufactura is half-boutique, half-atelier, where you can watch artisans at work creating the merchandise on display. Here the speciality is hand-painted silks, linen and velvet, along with a small, offbeat selection of interior design objects. The genial owner will describe to you in delightful broken-English that the philosphy of her designs is seduction, but should you fail to be seduced then check out the shop next door, Rafa Teja Atelier, whose hand-painted cloth is more conventional. Nayamau Passeig del Born 12 Many passers-by walk straight past the messy workshop of interior designer Mauricio Gosalvez, but it serves as his shop too, and you will soon realise that many of the fashionable furniture and ornaments decorating El Born's trendy bars and restaurants are created here. Items like the pastel-coloured one-off lamps are small enough to take straight back home with you, but Gosalvez is also able to propose unique furniture designs to order. Bars and tapas Pitin Bar Passeig del Born 34 (Metro Jaume I) The area has only recently become the trendiest part of the city, but the friendly Pitin Bar has been an stylish outpost here for more than 20 years. Opened originally as a restaurant, it has been turned it into a cool bar and lounge by the owner's son Ram\u00f3n. It still serves light snacks and has a sunny terrace in the main square during the day, but it is best as a late-night hang-out, for cocktails or a glass of excellent Spanish wine. La Vinya del Senyor Pla\u00e7a Santa Maria 5 (Metro Jaume I) With more than 300 different bottles on its wine list, this is Barcelona's prime wine bar and it also boasts one of the most beautiful terraces, looking out over the grandiose Santa Maria del Mar church. Unlike a typical bodega, this is both chic and expensive, but the incredible choice of vintages - from all over the world - make La Vinya an indispensable stop for wine-lovers. It also has an inventive Asian chef who creates original tapas. El Xampanyet Carrer Montcada 22 (Metro Jaume I) The Xampanyet (pronounced 'champanyet') is simply the greatest tapas bar in Barcelona. Just past the Picasso Museum, it has been in the friendly Esteve family for three generations. You may pop in just for a quick glass of cava, but be warned, you will end up staying an hour, as an irresistible stream of tapas start arriving - the best anchovies, tiny toasts with grilled peppers, spicy sausages and slices of Serrano ham. Gimlet Carrer Rec 24 (Metro Jaume I) Gimlet is nothing less than a classic cocktail bar, oozing the kind of style and elegance you would usually find in downtown New York. It is not the easiest bar to find, with just a discreet neon sign outside. Walk in though and the atmosphere is immediately electric, the long wooden bar crowded with the hippest elements of Barcelona society, the statuesque barman calmly shaking a perfect cocktail. This is the preferred haunt for Barcelona bar owners to come to relax on their night off, enjoying a whisky sour, Manhattan or ultra-dry martini. There may be actors, artists, musicians or politicians, but this remains essentially an anonymous locale, where no one takes any notice of celebrities, even if Pedro Almod\u00f3var were to walk in. Restaurants Passeis del Pep Pla\u00e7a de Palau 2 (Metro Barceloneta) It is difficult to find a better restaurant serving fish and sea food than the discreet but very smart Passeis del Pep. There is no sign on the street; gourmets in the know fol low a long corridor down the side of a Caixa bank and a door at the end suddenly opens out into an elegant dining room. There is no menu and no prices - this is not for budget watchers - but let yourself be guided through a wonderful meal by the knowledgeable waiters. If the season is right, do not miss the espardenyes , exquisite sea cucumbers. (Tel: 00 34 93 310 1021) Set Portes Passeig Isabel II 14 If you are looking for one of the swish spots to watch Barcelona's movers and shakers making deals over a power lunch, then go no further than the famous 'Seven Doors'. Opened in 1836, the restaurant really does have seven doors - though only one is open as the entrance. This is one of the best places to come and try a classic paella, and although the atmosphere is pretty formal and booking essential, the prices are surprisingly reasonable. (Tel: 00 34 93 319 2950) Hofmann Carrer Argenteria 74 (Metro Jaume I) The restaurant, run by charming female chef Mey Hof mann, should be an obligatory stop-off for any inquisitive gourmet. The elegant salon features a gastronomic menu of Catalan dishes, but the surprise here is that Hofmann also functions as a cooking school. Down on the street, just by the entrance, diners can see into the open kitchen where future chefs and enthusiastic amateurs are learning culinary skills. As some courses, such as for pastry (organised in conjunction with the famed Parisian patisserie, Lenotre), can be condensed into four or even two lessons, this can even become part of a holiday weekend. (Tel: 00 34 93 319 5889) El Foro Cafe Carrer de la Princesa 52 (Metro Jaume I) The intriguing sign outside this cavernous new address reads: gastronomy, art and culture. It turns out to be a fair description of what is a very eclectic venue. Walk in during the day and you enter a busy caf\u00e9/restaurant, where the walls are decorated with bright contemporary art exhibitions. But turn up after midnight at the weekend and you will see most people disappearing down a flight of steps into the cellar that hosts the funky nightclub Galaxy, where the dancefloor is packed and the sound system blasts out the latest House music hits at high volume. Sandwich &amp; Friends Passeig del Born 27 (Metro Jaume I) With its anglicised name and cosmopolitan cuisine, Sandwich &amp; Friends is pretty much a 'fast-food bodega'. But do not be put off, as it fits in perfectly with the fun, fashionable crowd drawn to the neighbourhood. For lunch, there is a big outdoor terrace right opposite the spare metal and glass construction that once housed Barcelona's main market, while at night the airy dining room is dominated by a huge, cartoon-like mural that could have come straight out of a Fellini movie. After hours Plastic Bar Passeig del Born 19 (Metro Jaume I) Outrageous kitsch decor and punky barmen who specialise in lethal tequila slammers makes this bizarre new club one of the liveliest nightspots in town. The dance floor is minuscule, but that does not stop most customers abandoning their drinks on the bar, as the infectiously enthusiastic disc jockey manages to make most nights feel like a fun party. Woman Caballero Estaci\u00f3 de Fran\u00e7a, Avenida Marqu\u00e8s de l'Argentera 6 (Metro Barceloneta) If you decide to sample only one club from Barcelona's diverse nocturnal scene, then it has to be the very hot Woman Caballero. This is not for the faint-hearted though, as doors do not even open till two in the morning, while the last clubbers stagger out about 9am. The location itself is original, as this maze-like subterranean club is beneath the grand train station, the Estaci\u00f3 de Fran\u00e7a - meaning that the station buffet is the perfect place for breakfast after a night of dancing. You can hop between three separate dance floors, each with a different ambience, dancers and music - funk, latin and techno. Borneo Carrer Rec 49 (Metro Jaume I) Bars seem to open up every week in El Born and the names are confusing - Borne, Riborn, Born 21, Taverna del Born and Suborn to name just a few. So it should come as no surprise that Borneo is nothing to do with headhunters, but is rather a arty new nightclub, opposite Gimlet. The mood and accent here is jazz and, apart from the excellent mix played by the DJ, there are occasional live concerts. Borneo is a very laid-back place to end an evening's entertainment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
