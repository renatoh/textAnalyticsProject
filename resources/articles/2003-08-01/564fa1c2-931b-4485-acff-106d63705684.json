Josep Maria Subirachs, who is currently working on the facade of Gaudi's Sagrada Familia in Barcelona, has converted the lobby into a breathtaking vista of flights of steps with waterfalls and spheres next to a futuristic lift. Ten of the rooms have literally become artists' canvases with everything, including the walls, ceiling, sheets and towels, painted. Since artist Antonio Xaus decided to turn room 105 into a work called Performance, including bright murals of people and even a small foot mat with his name scrawled across it in large letters, nine other artists have copied the idea with different styles in rooms called Sunrise, Pilota Automatica and Blue Dreams. Check out which one you want to stay in on www.hotelestela.com, but don't be surprised if the bright colours mean you can't sleep. The terraces feature sculptures and even the underground garage has been decorated with murals.

Broomhill Art Hotel, Barnstaple, Devon Not every hotel has a 17-ft high red stiletto in the garden, but then this seven-room property is not every hotel. The 10 acres of gardens boast 300 sculptures, from Antonia's Dress in aluminium with all the markings of an upturned crinoline, to The Transformation of the Candle, four headstand-performing figures who gradually shrink in size and posture like melting candle wax. The hotel's rooms are stacked full of antiques and its corridors are lined with paintings; there are eight international exhibitions a year. Everything you see you can buy, and if you can't afford it there's a special credit facility available. If that's not arty enough, there is live jazz on the first Friday of every month, a ceramics shop, and a regular programme of events, ranging from be-bop to lectures. The hotel also runs regular jazz weekends with special deals for rooms, dinner on both nights and entry to the concerts. Contact: 01271 850262 Price: \u00a334pp B&amp;B and \u00a355 half board. La Colombe D'Or, St Paul de Vence, Provence In days gone by, visitors to this small stone-built Proven\u00e7al-style hotel stood a good chance of bumping into artists such as Matisse, Picasso, Miro and L\u00e9ger. Now visitors are more likely to bump into actors and celebrities including the Beckhams, Elton John and Roger Moore, who go to eat in the hotel's renowned restaurant, which serves up good Proven\u00e7al cuisine. But the artists have left their mark - many were cash-strapped when they stayed, and so paid by leaving some artwork, which is displayed in the restaurant. The hotel has added to those donations to build up a surprising collection of art. There are also sculptures around the outside pool, including one by Calder. Each of the 26 rooms, which include 11 suite apartments, are decorated differently. The hotel is just at the entrance to the village of St Paul de Vence, about 15 minutes from Nice.

There are also themed fancy dress evenings and a Summer Arts Ball. And don't forget the exhibitions of paintings by local artists which are changed every fortnight in the bar and lounge. The rooms are full of rugs on polished floors, with French windows opening on to a balcony and small walled garden. The seven bedrooms in this house, owned by textile designer Belinda Rushworth-Lund, are simple but stylish, though slightly scruffy.
