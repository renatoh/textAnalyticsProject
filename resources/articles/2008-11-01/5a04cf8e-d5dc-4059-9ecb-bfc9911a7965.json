But what was the cabinet told before Lord Goldsmith made up his mind? This week, the information tribunal has been hearing the government's appeal against an order by Richard Thomas, the information commissioner, to release the minutes of two cabinet meetings, on March 13 and 17 2003. The stakes are very high. According to cabinet secretary Sir Gus O'Donnell, they include the future of effective cabinet government. O'Donnell appeared before the tribunal on Tuesday to make the government's case that the confidentiality that is necessary for effective cabinet discussion will be irreparably damaged if the papers are released. The commissioner believes that the damage will be very limited and that the public interest in showing what went on at this hugely controversial moment in history outweighs it. There is also the question of whether the current system is as effective as has been made out, which is something the papers could help us with. Professor Peter Hennessy, a witness for the commissioner, said that the episode represented a major failure of collective cabinet government. So the content of the minutes could determine not just the value in their release but the strength of the case for maintaining cabinet confidentiality. If collective cabinet government doesn't work, why protect it? Ironically, in a hearing that has largely taken place in closed session, it has been the Cabinet Office counsel, Jonathan Swift, who has given the biggest hints about what the papers show. He has revealed that the commissioner believes that the minutes of March 17 will reveal not just \"the absence of sufficient discussion\" but the \"real reasons\" for the cabinet's decision to sign up to Blair's war. There have also been strong suggestions that the meeting on March 13 could be highly significant. This took place while Goldsmith was coming to his definitive view that war would be legal without a further UN resolution. I suspect that at this meeting Blair strung the cabinet along with premature reassurances as to the legal position. A previous decision by Thomas required the government to publish a narrative account of the process that took Goldsmith from his equivocal and very long advice on March 7 to his unequivocal and very short opinion on March 17. For me, this was one of the commissioner's worst freedom-of-information decisions. Rather than requiring the government to publish the paperwork \u2013 some of which was admittedly legally privileged \u2013 he allowed it to construct its own narrative. Because this was a mixture of documented fact and spin, it is impossible to know what is true and what isn't. The key date happens to be March 13, when Goldsmith is said to have concluded that the war was legal, based on UN security council resolution 1441 and without the further resolution that could not be obtained. According to the narrative, Goldsmith told his legal secretary that he had reached this conclusion, which the legal secretary then recorded. He then met Sally Morgan from Blair's office and Lord Falconer and told them he would give the green light for war. The claim that Goldsmith made up his mind before meeting Morgan and Falconer is a key part of the government's case that he wasn't leaned on. But we only have the government's word for it. Neither the commissioner nor the Cabinet Office have been willing to confirm that this sequence of events is based on documentary evidence rather than spin. I'll be making a new freedom of information act (FOI) request to find this out. It seems likely that when the cabinet met on the morning of March 13, Blair did not know that Goldsmith would sign up to war. Goldsmith did not attend, but there was a discussion about the legality of the war and it looks as if Blair told the cabinet that it would be legal. There is clear evidence that Blair and cabinet allies jumped the gun on the issue. According to Clare Short's memoirs, Blair told her on March 11: \"Attorney-General said 1441 enough.\" On March 12, defence secretary Geoff Hoon said on the Today programme that war would be legal, based on resolution 1441 alone. When this was put to the prime minister's official spokesman (PMOS), \"the PMOS said that Mr Hoon's words were correct\". The PMOS speaks with the direct authority of the prime minister so effectively Blair made this claim. So we know that some members of government were claiming prematurely that war would be legal without a further UN resolution and it appears that at least one cabinet minister was told that this was the attorney general's view. The minutes of the meeting on March 13 could tell us whether the cabinet was misled in this way and whether Goldsmith was subsequently bounced into his \"decision\". If that does turn out to be the case, we might expect less smugness in future about the effective working of cabinet government."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
