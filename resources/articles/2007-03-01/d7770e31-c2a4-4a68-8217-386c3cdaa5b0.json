With the stroke of Governor Schwarzenegger's pen, the state's days as an afterthought in primary season were over. Now New York and a crowd of other big states are poised to follow suit in a scramble for influence that will alter the fortunes of this cycle's presidential hopefuls. Republicans and Democrats in New York's capital, Albany, may not be able to agree on much, but they are coming together to bring that state's primary forward to February 5. The state's lawmakers are pushing for an early primary to give a lift to their home state candidates, Rudolph Guiliani and Hilary Clinton. Besides New York, other big, mostly non- southern states including Ohio, New Jersey, Michigan and Florida, are set to block out Feb 5 on their calendar as well. When the dust settles, as many as twenty states may all elect delegates on a single day, replacing March's so-called \"Super Tuesday\" with an Absolutely Fabulous Tuesday one month earlier- a one night gladiatorial bonanza that will seal the votes of eighty percent of GOP delegates and two thirds of Democrats', effectively ending the nomination process by Wednesday morning, February 6. AbFab Tuesday will significantly change the nature of presidential campaigning, de-emphasizing retail politics and unleashing a media war in big states - where TV trumps handshakes. Political purists may rue the change, but it will be a boon for addicts of fast paced, raw political theatre, and those who dread the prospect of a drawn out \"death by a thousand cuts\" process of years past. Iowa and New Hampshire will retain their \"first in the nation status\", but out will go the traditional two month meander through minor states, and in will come a three week cross- country dash where candidates will have to be in many more than two places at once. The only way to achieve that miracle is through the magic of television. The accelerated timetable will consequently favour candidates with big name recognition and big war chests (to compete in expensive media markets). Hello Giuliani, Clinton, Obama and McCain. Goodbye almost everyone else. A super-sized primary, chock full of northern and mid-western states will also favour these same northern, moderate candidates over southern conservatives, because the new timetable will reduce the influence of the South. For years political scientists and campaign strategists have been obsessed with the question of whether a moderate candidate can win a presidential election bypassing the South. Guardian contributor Thomas Schaller wrote 350 pages on the subject in Whistling Past Dixie. Mega Tuesday would suddenly put that possibility into sharp focus. Candidates with squishy positions on abortion and gay marriage would no longer have to worry so hard about recalibrating their positions for folks on the other side of the Mason Dixon line. All this is giving the conservative rump of the Republican Party heartburn. They have yet to coalesce around a single candidate and so far they have no one credible to choose from. Sam Brownback simply won't cut the mustard on the national stage. They had hoped that they could wait it out; let the existing Republican field bloody itself and then rally around a late entry, but the jumpstarted race has robbed them of the luxury of time. Christian conservatives are bickering among themselves over who of the viable contenders is the lesser evil: John McCain, who once called them \"agents of intolerance\" or Mitt Romney, a Mormon, who has flip-flopped on abortion, stem cell research and gay marriage. Absent a deus ex machina, the biggest fallout from Supercalifragilistic Tuesday may be that the Christian Right gets shunted to the sidelines of presidential politics for the first time in a decade. As Dan Glaister has already commented, US politicos have to come up with another name for the day they have dubbed \"Super Duper Tuesday\", a term that when uttered will turn serious political commentators into Disney characters on speed. Glaister has suggested Super-Size Tuesday. This column has road-tested some other possibilities, and you can feel free to suggest your own."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
