If the 17th century monument in the city of Agra were to open every night of the year, it would have to be floodlit, according to Mr Sinha. But artificial lighting is not permitted because it could damage the monument or attract insects which could lay eggs on its white marble, UNI quoted Mr Sinha as saying. The Taj Mahal was built by the emperor Shah Jahan as a tomb for his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal. Tourists have been prohibited from visiting it at night since 1984, when India was battling militant Sikhs and feared an attack on the monument."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
