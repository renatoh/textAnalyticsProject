So far only \u00a314m of the \u00a320m pledged by the government for this year has been given to the foundation and there is no indication yet as to how the shortfall will be met. The government is one of three organisations, along with the Premier League and the Football Association, who pledged to give \u00a320m a year to the foundation when it was formed three years ago. The Premier League and the FA have both given their share of the money this year. The government's share is given via the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the bulk of it coming from national lottery funds. Foundation officials have been involved in a series of meetings with the DCMS in which they have tried to obtain funding guarantees and have been pointing out that they desperately need the money to put into place programmes for the developmet of the game. A source said: \"The day of reckoning is likely to come quite soon. Both the FA and the Premier League pay their share of the money up front but as yet we are still waiting for the remainder of the government's funding. In the grand scheme of things it's not a lot of money, but it is vital for the Football Foundation if it wants to carry on doing the work it has been doing since its formation.\" There could be further funding problems for the foundation given that the FA is likely to review its annual commitment under the overall financial review being carried out by its new chief executive Mark Palios. And concerns are being raised over whether the Premier League will be able to continue giving such a large sum. Its share comes from its broadcasting deal and its new television deals, currently being negotiated, are much less lucrative than the current ones."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
