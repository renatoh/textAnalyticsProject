However Real were also indebted to their goalkeeper Iker Casillas for several fine saves, while Kiev contributed to the defeat with some poor shooting Zinedine Zidane and Raul also hit posts. Real now lie third on goal difference from Kiev and Leverkusen, who stay top. All three have six points. \"It's been a fantastic night,\" Owen said later. \"Going away with the England team probably helped me; being back with my mates has given me a lot of confidence. I've come back with a fresh spring in my step. \"I wasn't expecting to come here and play in every game; I knew I was going to have to bide my time. I've always been one to back myself and I can't think of anyone who would turn down the chance to play at a club like this.\" Owen's goal owed much to to the efforts of Ronaldo and the substitute Santiago Solari, who had just come on for Luis Figo. He made an excellent break down the right and laid the ball off to the Brazilian, who ran at the defence. He, in turn, left Tiberiu Ghioane on the edge of the box before crossing to Owen, who beat the goalkeeper to give Real their deserved lead. \"I knew I would have to fight to get minutes on the pitch,\" Owen added. \"The first few months have been difficult but it's all starting to come together now.\" It is looking increasingly likely that Europe may be Real's only chance of major success this season. At the weekend they dropped into the bottom half of the table thanks to a 1-1 draw at Real Betis and they trail the unbeaten leaders, Barcelona, by nine points after seven matches. Bayer Leverkusen won 3-1 against Roma, still without a point and who finished the game with nine men after first Cristian Panucci and then Daniele De Rossi were sent off. The match had begun promisingly enough for Roma, Dimitar Berbatov giving them the lead by putting through his own goal. But Roque Junior levelled it after the interval, Jacek Krzynowek put them ahead and Franca completed the scoring in injury time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
