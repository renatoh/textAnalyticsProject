And sometimes the women who report from conflict zones around the world qualify for a jolly good lunch. But not always. For last Friday, the Royal British Legion pushed the boat out for half a dozen defence correspondents. And where did they do it? At White's, the exclusive men-only club once chaired by David Cameron's father. It's not Spearmint Rhino or Stringfellow's: this we know. But Martha Gellhorn might have looked at it askance. And as for the BBC defence correspondent Caroline Wyatt, she is in Afghanistan. Just as well. \u2022 Gender headaches aplenty at the satellite news channel al-Jazeera, where on-screen reports of strife and conflict are matched by the level of discord in the office. Five women presenters have already resigned from the station in Doha after being accused of not dressing modestly enough. But sources close to the station say the dress code row, while eye-catching for the media, is only part of it. They say that of 65 news bureaux worldwide, only one \u2013 in Venezuela \u2013 is headed by a woman. Among 80 reporters only eight are women. Only one of 12 news producers is now female. It was more like 50:50 at the station's inception. Following the fallout, there is a round-robin protest letter being compiled by the great and the good in London, we are told, and yesterday the station was taken to task by the main organisation for Arab women in Italy. There has also been criticism on the United Nations Forum. Growing coverage of the row everywhere, except for the Qatari Press. But then the channel was launched by the Emir of Qatar. Go figure. \u2022 They don't know what they are doing. No, not Fabio Capello and his team, or David Cameron and his. What was the point of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference, asked Jeremy Corbyn at the beginning of June. It \"was an important milestone in our long-term vision for a world without nuclear weapons\", replied minister Alistair Burt. And what of Trident, asked Cambridge MP Dr Julian Huppert last week. \"Britain should retain the nuclear deterrent, and we should always keep that insurance policy against great danger,\" said the PM. A world free of weapons \u2013 apart from ours. \u2022 Time to applaud the heroes of Glastonbury. The roadies, the security staff. And a big hand for whoever operated rocker Shaun Ryder's Autocue as he chanted his oft-repeated line \"It's coming up\" during the ecstatically received performance of Dare with the Gorillaz. When the prompter stopped during an earlier performance in Manchester, so did he. \u2022 Must have been a trial being down south for those whose hearts really belong elsewhere. When Mark E Smith of The Fall added vocals to another Gorillaz track in their London studio, he deliberately sang towards the north. \u2022 Who can help us unmask the creator of Claude Grinley, a fictitious, thrusting new MP whose invented pitch for a high-powered select committee was discovered by one of our correspondents on a photocopier at Westminster? We suspect a class-obsessed Labourite author, but in these days of political cross-dressing, nothing is assured. Claude, according to this prospectus, \"was educated at St Fee's School (motto: Who Pays Wins)\", where he \"became blackboard monitor and for two weeks, Deputy Milk Monitor\". His talent was initially spotted on the rugby pitch by none other than Sir Clive Woodward. \"He pointed at me and I heard him say distinctly, 'who's that rucking flanker?'\", the introductory letter says. Claude, as here described, conforms to many stereotypes \u2013 Trinity College, Oxford, a member of the \"Bulliedon Club\", a banker, and he seeks the endorsement of his peers \"for the select committee. Or any other select committee. Or any committee. Or anything.\" Someone came up with this grotesque caricature. But then look at the new intake. Whoever it was had a lot of help. \u2022 Can't wait for the World Low Cost Airlines Congress, to be held near Heathrow in September. Dress: smart casual. One bag allowed and 10 pence to use the toilets. For dinner, a choice of chicken or beef. This article was amended on 29 June 2010. The third item originally ended \"A world with weapons \u2013 apart from ours\". This has been corrected"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
