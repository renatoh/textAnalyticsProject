Se\u00e1n Fitzpatrick was once head of the country\u2019s biggest bank, Anglo Irish, which ended up requiring a \u20ac30bn (\u00a326bn) government bailout and sent the country cap in hand to the International Monetary Fund for support. But on Wednesday, after the longest criminal trial in Irish history, a judge ordered the jury to acquit him on all charges. Later Fitzpatrick stood on the steps of the Republic\u2019s criminal courts of justice and declared: \u201cIt\u2019s wonderful day.\u201d Twenty-four hours earlier Mr Justice John Aylmer had told jurors he was going to direct them to acquit Fitzpatrick. The former executive had pleaded not guilty to misleading the Anglo Irish bank\u2019s auditors about loans to him and people connected to him. On Wednesday, the 126th day of an at times a bewildering and complex trial, Fitzpatrick\u2019s defence had argued that the case should not go before the jury because of flaws in the investigation and in the prosecution case, which involved coaching witnesses and shredding documents. The trial judge told Fitzpatrick: \u201cYou are free to go; thank you very much for your attendance.\u201d Fitzpatrick replied: \u201cThank you, judge\u201d before leaving Dublin circuit criminal court. Apart from his \u201cwonderful day\u201d comment, Fitzpatrick refused to answer reporters\u2019 questions. He told them: \u201cI don\u2019t want to be rude, but I\u2019m not going to speak. I\u2019m not making any comment.\u201d Fitzpatrick had pleaded not guilty to 27 offences under the Republic\u2019s 1990 Companies Act. These include 22 charges of making a misleading, false or deceptive statement to auditors and five charges of furnishing false information in the years 2002 to 2007. The Irish director of public prosecutions had dropped some of these charges in the past four weeks. The case against Fitzpatrick at the Dublin circuit criminal court was a retrial after his first trial in May 2015 ended after weeks of legal argument over the flaws in the investigation by the Republic\u2019s anti-corruption corporate watchdog. Ireland\u2019s Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement said on Tuesday it accepted witnesses were coached during the investigation into Fitzpatrick and that their evidence was contaminated. It also admitted that other documents held by the watchdog were shredded by one its officials. He was said to be under enormous stress at the time. \u201cThose actions clearly should not have occurred,\u201d the ODCE said. The watchdog admitted there had been \u201cserious failures\u201d in its investigations into the Anglo Irish bankers\u2019 loans. It also confirmed that some of the statements taken in evidence against Fitzpatrick were carried out by \u201ccivilian staff\u201d who did not have proper training. Taoiseach Enda Kenny joined opposition parties in the D\u00e1il in criticising the ODCE\u2019s handling of the investigation. Kenny said if a government minister had performed as badly as some ODCE officials they would be sacked. Miche\u00e1l Martin, leader of the main opposition party Fianna F\u00e1il, also criticised the Garda Sioch\u00e1na for their role in the investigation into white-collar crime that he said had been proved to be \u201cinept, negligible, wasteful and virtually redundant\u201d. In 2009, Anglo Irish was nationalised, with the Irish taxpayer having to pay \u20ac30bn (\u00a323bn) to rescue an institution that was once the preferred bank of builders and property speculators. The sharp practices at the bank during the Celtic boom, when it became the major financier for overstretched Irish developers and investors playing the global property market, caused national outrage. At a time of austerity cuts and the country losing its financial independence in the IMF/European Central Bank bailout programme, the sight of billions of taxpayers\u2019 money being used to save Anglo Irish provoked widespread public anger. One of those who used Anglo Irish to play the global property casino was Ireland\u2019s one-time richest man, Se\u00e1n Quinn. Quinn is the former billionaire whose rise and fall while overborrowing from Anglo Irish personifies the collapse of Ireland\u2019s Celtic Tiger economy. The 65-year-old County Fermanagh-born tycoon used to employ up to 5,000 people in construction and his family\u2019s insurance corporation. He had been previously listed at the richest Irishman in history \u2013 with a personal wealth of about \u20ac4.7bn. But Quinn went bankrupt with huge debts, having bought a significant number of shares in the former Anglo Irish Bank with a view to buying a global property empire stretching from North America to parts of the former Soviet Union."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
