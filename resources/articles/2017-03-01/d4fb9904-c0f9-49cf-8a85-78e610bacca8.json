The developer and his brother Nick Candy, who is married to the soap star Holly Valance, were in the high court this week to deny accusations of using blackmail and threats to extort repayment of a loan. Businessman Mark Holyoake is suing the brothers for \u00a3132m. He accuses Christian of threatening to \u201ctake a wrecking ball\u201d to his assets, and of telling him during a confrontation at an office near Candy\u2019s headquarters in Guernsey \u201cyou need to think about your pregnant wife\u201d, saying he \u201cwould feel terrible if anything were to go wrong during the pregnancy\u201d. Holyoake\u2019s wife had previously suffered a miscarriage. Candy, with his brother Nick sitting nearby, took the stand in a packed courtroom in London on Wednesday. In a written witness statement, he described himself as a \u201chard negotiator when I need to be\u201d, but denied that he would resort to threats or illegal acts in order to complete a transaction. Holyaoke approached the Candys in 2011 for a short-term loan to finance the acquisition of a period mansion block in London\u2019s Belgravia, which he planned to refurbish and sell on at a profit. Having originally borrowed \u00a312m, he ended up repaying Christian Candy\u2019s CPC Group \u00a337m. \u201cI do recall saying to Mr Holyoake that the situation must be stressful for his wife, who I knew was pregnant at the time,\u201d Candy said. However, he categorically denied creating a situation that would be stressful for Holyoake\u2019s wife, or intending to intimidate her husband. \u201cIn making such a statement, I was expressing genuine concern for Mrs Holyoake,\u201d he said. His appearance in the witness box followed Emma Holyoake\u2019s testimony the day before. Describing Christian Candy as \u201ccharmless\u201d and \u201cpathologically competitive\u201d, she told the court she feared he was \u201chellbent on destroying Mark and us as a family\u201d. After receiving the alleged threats, the Holyoakes claim to have hired armed security guards to patrol their Ibiza home. Emma claims to remain so worried for her children that she sleeps in a bunkbed in the bedroom of her daughters while her husband is on business trips. She told the court she also feared for her husband\u2019s life as a consequence of his decision to bring the case against the Candy brothers. Christian described being rushed into agreeing to loan money to Holyoake. He said: \u201cThe first I heard of Mr Holyoake\u2019s request for a loan was when Nick called me in the early hours of the morning on 12 October 2011, while I was still in bed in Los Angeles. \u201cThe terms proposed by Mr Holyoake were very good, but that appears to have been as a result of the timeframe in which he required the money ... With hindsight, I can now see that the terms were too good to be true.\u201d He described repeated efforts over a two-year period to recover the money. Holyoake, who was investigated but not charged by the Serious Fraud Office over the collapse of his fish importing business, British Seafood, was only able to make the payment after selling Grosvenor Gardens House, his Belgravia development, in February 2014. Candy said he had originally been hopeful of making a quick return on the loan. In his statement he claimed to have lost a bet with a CPC executive, Steven Smith, that Holyoake would return the money with interest by 31 March 2012. The sum wagered was \u00a310,000. \u201cI note that this was in reality a one-way wager as I would never have sought to collect from him if I had won: it was really a way of demonstrating to him (and the rest of the CPC team) that I was confident that Mr Holyoake would repay as promised,\u201d Candy said. \u201cThis bet was ultimately won by Mr Smith and the \u00a310,000 payment made to him.\u201d The case continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
