Mental strength MS Sharapova was really unusual at 17. She was tougher mentally than Serena Williams, whom she beat in the final in straight sets, 6-4 6-1 when winning her Wimbledon title in 2004. And, look at who else she beat on the way: those women included Daniel Hantuchova and Lindsay Davenport, so Maria at such a young age must have been playing without an element of fear. LR Laura is potentially terrific in this department but she's still very green. I was very impressed with her in the first match when she managed to hang in as she did [when beating Angelique Kerbe in three sets]. I know that people who've worked with her always said this girl had something different \u2013 a real fighter's heart. Serve MS Her serve was very important when she won her Wimbledon title, though I was not as crazy about it as I was her other strokes, although it was quite effective. LR She has a good action in her serve, she's got to understand what she's doing with it all the time. When you're playing the other youngsters, you can just go up and switch it on. But when you're playing people who are a little more durable on the other side of the net, you've really got to be thinking every point out. Sometimes I think she is not quite experienced enough to stay in the points. Return of serve MS Has Maria's return of serve got any better now from when she was 17? She's been through stages in her career in her physical development and, when she won Wimbledon, this shot, like all her shots apart from less so her serve, was awesome. LR I like Laura's return. I think she's got some huge talents in this department. She sees the ball early, she clubs the ball and has good timing and, if she's growing taller, she'll have more reach. Movement MS In 2004 Maria was as she is now: she was tall, she was strong and she had incredible stamina and was very determined, so in this department she was a little more polished than Laura. LR I think you're born quick or not so quick. You can improve it, though. What tends to happen sometimes is that she bails out of points. But, if you do some specific training where you can make her chase balls even if it's a second bounce, before you know it she's picking up balls quicker. She's not naturally as quick as she could be but maybe she can improve that. \u2022 Virginia Wade is commentating for the BBC at Wimbledon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
