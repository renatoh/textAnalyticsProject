Bayern have made the Frenchman their No 1 target to take charge for the rest of the season before considering who will take over long term. Rangnick and Wenger had been the club\u2019s top two alternatives after the sacking of Kovac on Sunday following a string of poor performances. The agent of the 61-year-old German, Marc Kosicke, said on Wednesday, however, that his client was not interested in the Bayern job. \u201cNo, Ralf Rangnick is not available,\u201d he said. \u201cWe do not believe that what Ralf Rangnick brings is currently being sought after by Bayern. And that\u2019s why it makes no sense to hold concrete talks.\u201d Rangnick, who is head of sport and development at Red Bull, would like to work in England if he leaves his post. Bayern, meanwhile, are expected to start negotiations with Wenger this week, with the Frenchman having said on beIN sport recently that he would be interested in taking over. \u201cYou miss the intensity,\u201d the Frenchman said. \u201cThere\u2019s some things you miss a lot and some things you don\u2019t miss. Winning football games, preparing a team for a game, developing players and getting satisfaction and shared emotions is something that you miss. \u201cI was responsible at 33 years of age and coached until 69 without interruption at top level. That is 36 years without stopping. So on the other hand, even if I miss it, to get a little bit out of that pressure for a year was not too bad for me. People who know me well say I\u2019m more relaxed.\u201d The Bundesliga club would give Wenger a contract until the end of the season and then explore whether one of their long-term targets, such as Ajax\u2019s Erik ten Hag or Paris Saint-Germain\u2019s Thomas Tuchel, is available. Max Allegri is another name interesting Bayern in the summer but they are wary of appointing a non-German speaker after Carlo Ancelotti\u2019s difficulties in 2016-17. Allegri, who managed Juventus between 2014 and 2019 but left last summer, may still have a chance to get the job, however, as he is represented by Giovanni Branchini, who has dealt extensively with Bayern in the past and is trusted by the club. Bayern have appointed Hansi Flick, who was Kovac\u2019s No 2, as the interim coach. Hermann Gerland, who has previously worked under Jupp Heynckes, Louis van Gaal, Carlo Ancelotti and Pep Guardiola is the new assistant. \u201cIt was clear that I would step in out of loyalty to the club. It\u2019s an honour, but it\u2019s a huge challenge for me,\u201d Flick said this week. \u201cI want to talk to all the players and tell them again what they are capable of and what they do, and I want the team to take initiative and show their quality. We have to focus on what\u2019s ahead.\u201d Bayern face Borussia Dortmund in Der Klassiker on Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
