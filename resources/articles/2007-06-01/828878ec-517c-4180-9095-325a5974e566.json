Asked whether the London start would be tainted by Riis's recent confession of drug-taking and Landis's positive test for testosterone, which has meant the 2006 Tour winner cannot yet be officially confirmed, Livingstone echoed Henry Ford's assertion that history is bunk. \"You're asking a politician about problems in the past? We are judged by what we're doing today. We judge the athletes who compete and they don't carry the burden of anything that happened in the past. They are not responsible for anything other than their own actions in trying to achieve their physical best.\" This was, presumably, meant to be taken rather more seriously than Livingstone's follow-up: a call for London to annex Kent on the grounds that the Tour's first stage will unite the capital and the county. The citizens of the Garden of England, he said, should petition to be included within the city's boundaries \"under my regime\". Back to the Tour, the mayor's view was that \"the cycling event will offer Londoners an incredible opportunity for a wonderful weekend.\" That is not in doubt: the Tour will be a fine spectacle. However, the \"actions\", as the mayor put it, that the Tour riders take to enhance their abilities are open to question at present. It will also be argued that the latest wave of confessions, from Riis and his former Telekom team-mates, together mean that the Tour's drug-taking baggage is now too weighty to be discounted, with its validity as a competition in question. The mayor said he expected some negative press coverage for the event, which includes an opening five-mile time-trial that takes in London's major landmarks on Saturday July 7, starting on Whitehall and finishing in the Mall. That is followed by the ceremonial start for the Tour's first road stage through Kent to Canterbury on Sunday July 8. \"People will turn up one day and open the [press] pages the next day and wonder if they were at the same event, but that's the story of my life. There's a mismatch between reality and what I read.\" Yesterday, however, had he flicked through the pages of one daily, France's L'Equipe, the mayor would have read yet more revelations from the Spaniard Jes\u00fas Manzano, the cyclist whose confessions led the Madrid police to open their Operation Puerto inquiry into blood-boosting. That inquiry has ended the careers of the two men who should have contested the 2006 race, Jan Ullrich and Ivan Basso, and has thrown a shadow over Spanish cycling. Manzano alleged cyclists at recent Tours had received consignments of drugs from a woman courier nicknamed the \"White Dove\" and said he felt there would be more deaths from drug-taking to follow that of the 1998 winner Marco Pantani. More pertinently for the 2007 event, he alleged that blood-doping is still going on in Spain in spite of Puerto. The Tour de France organiser Christian Prudhomme, in his first year running the event, was adamant that the contest should be taken seriously, but the only justification he could offer the sceptics was that the Tour organisers themselves are against doping and are doing the maximum they can to fight the problem. Prudhomme asserted the recent Tour of Italy had seen television audiences increase by 300,000 and that viewers would be delighted by views of the French and English countryside. But, asked if the 2007 Tour de France would be the \"cleanest\" ever, he rightly replied: \"I can't say.\" Asked how he would feel if the winner of the 2007 event were to test positive, Livingstone again stressed the plus points. \"People who've never seen the Tour de France come past will stand in their hundreds of thousands and watch the best cyclists on earth go past at speeds they can barely imagine. It's electrifying.\" Relentlessly upbeat, Livingstone would like the Tour to return. \"I have no doubt Londoners will see a huge spin-off from the Tour and the moment it's not too indecently hasty, we'll bid to do it again.\" By then, perhaps, the 2006 winner will have been decided."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
