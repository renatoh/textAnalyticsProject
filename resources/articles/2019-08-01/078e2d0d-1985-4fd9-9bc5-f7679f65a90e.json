The flights allowed the finance minister and home affairs minister to attend swearing-in ceremonies after they resigned from Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s ministry before taking back their positions in Scott Morrison\u2019s cabinet. Royal Australian Air Force flight records tabled in parliament show on 28 August Cormann flew from Canberra to Perth on a CL604 at a cost of $23,000. A further $14,720 cost was incurred to return the empty aircraft to Canberra. On 26 August, the Sunday following the spill, Dutton flew from Canberra to Amberley at a cost of $5,980 and Amberley to Canberra at a cost of $6,900. According to the ABC, Dutton declined to comment but said at the time \u201cthe swearing-in today will allow me to travel to the Gold Coast to attend the Five Country ministerial meeting\u201d, involving security and immigration ministers from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the UK and the United States. Cormann was sworn in with the remainder of the ministry on Tuesday 28 August, after which the Morrison cabinet held its first meeting. A spokesperson for Cormann reportedly said the role of defence jets was to allow ministers to meet commitments associated with their official, parliamentary or political responsibilities, and the cost of travel was higher for MPs from Perth. \u201cIn the context of the high frequency of necessary work-related travel from Perth to Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne and back, Senator Cormann is an infrequent user of the special purpose aircraft \u2013 and only if that use is appropriate in the circumstances. \u201cOn 28 August 2018 Senator Cormann was required both in Canberra and back in Perth later that day. \u201cInevitably that travel from Canberra to Perth is more expensive than travel to locations on the east coast. \u201cTwo senior staff also travelled with the minister on this occasion to facilitate dealing with office work on the five-hour trip back from Canberra to Perth that day.\u201d Ministerial travel rules allow for use of defence jets if suitable commercial alternatives are not available. Cormann\u2019s spokesperson said no commercial flight options were available \u201cto accommodate all these commitments\u201d and the use of the jets was approved \u201cin the appropriate way\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
