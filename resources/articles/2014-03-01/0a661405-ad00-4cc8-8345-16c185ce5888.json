Billy Bragg has rarely seen a grander stage in the 30-plus years since he hit the road with his collection of abrasive, wise songs about politics, love and points in between. In the splendour of the Sydney Opera House on Sunday night, it was impossible not to reflect on the journey he has made from post-punk proselytiser to master singer-songwriter, carrying the conscience of a couple of generations with a passion undimmed by the decades. But although he will always be seen as an acutely political artist \u2013 he is appearing on ABC\u2019s Q&amp;A on Monday night \u2013 and his views will guarantee him a platform for as long as he wants one, it is the enduring power of his songwriting that is most remarkable. The opening song, Ideology, sounds fantastically fresh as his band, complete with keyboards and pedal steel, soften the old edges. The band has a distinctly country twang and they carry on in this satisfying vein, showcasing songs such as Chasing Rainbows from his most recent album, Tooth and Nail, which was recorded in the US. Adding to the flavour, he is wearing a western pearl-snap shirt and has grown a beard. Bragg \u2013 who would have made a good stand-up comedian if all else had failed \u2013 confronts head-on suggestions by some critics that he has somehow gone country, quipping that the facial hair hides \u201ca multitude of chins\u201d and that he\u2019s always had a twang \u2013 an Essex twang. But, despite his inherent Englishness, his career has been inspired by American music and he proudly tells us Tooth and Nail put him on the Americana charts for the first time. Bragg\u2019s love of Americana, a sound defined as coming from American roots music, led to a spat with singer Pokey LaFarge because of his claim that British artists started it all. To prove his point, he launches into a cover of the Stones\u2019 magnificent Dead Flowers, a British Americana classic if ever there was one. He doesn\u2019t need to justify himself. Later comes a beautiful version of California Stars, one of the Woody Guthrie songs he put to music for the Mermaid Avenue album with Wilco, while Bragg\u2019s hobo hero would have been proud to call There Will Be A Reckoning his own. Throughout, we\u2019re peppered with Bragg\u2019s standards. Between The Wars and Milkman of Human Kindness are still spine-tingling, while A New England, Kraftwerk-style, is a joy. He closes with the traditional, stirring Waiting for the Great Leap Forwards and even though some of the well-heeled audience look as though they might be dreading, not waiting, for the revolution, it still delights and we leave with spirits recharged."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
