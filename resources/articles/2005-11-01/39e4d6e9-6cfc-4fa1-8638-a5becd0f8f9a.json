WILD ANIMAL MAGNETISM There was a great deal of excitement on David Davis's blog this week as supporters debated which animal best exemplified their hero's qualities. To be fair to the Davis boys, it wasn't their idea: a focus group commissioned by the Today programme had asked punters which living mammals the Davids most resembled. \"Whilst David Cameron was described as a Rottweiler and a Rover ('full of promises but doesn't deliver'), the panel were more favourable towards DD,\" his acolytes write. \"Davis, the group said, had the 'character and charisma' of Aslan and the 'fighting spirit' of a tiger.\" Whichever beast Davis resembles - and long-term supporters will remember that he sent them cards promising \"the dark horse will return\" after his last leadership bid - it isn't a domesticated animal. \"Life becomes a bit separate because you get used to doing your own thing,\" his wife Doreen told the Daily Mail this week. \"There was passion in our marriage to start with, but I suppose some of that goes after 32 years ... He likes to have a cuddle - particularly now that he's away so much.\" A tiger in need of a cuddle? Doreen, if you ever need to talk woman to woman again, the Backbencher's ear is always open. Never mind what David says. CULTIVATING AN IMAGE David Cameron confided this week that he plants garlic around his marrows to keep the slugs away. What this says about the Davis camp, the Backbencher hates to think, but she was delighted to discover that a flowering plant has recently been named in honour of the Conservative party - the Corydalis \"Tory MP\". At first sight the plant might appear droopy, but Plants Magazine describes it as \"soundly perennial\". \"The flowers are an intense blue and the stems are strongly tinged red, especially in the sun, and it may flower again after a dormant period in summer.\" Promises, promises. LAME AND LIMP The delightful prospect of Boris \"Gissanotherjob\" Johnson joining the shadow cabinet came nearer today as someone told the Times he'd be abandoning the editorship of the Spectator. This is good news for Petsy, obviously - there's nothing worse than having to work for your ex - but it leaves a gap at Doughty Street. The Backbencher fears the magazine is already losing some of its vim under Boris' lame duck editorship. How else to explain the banner ad currently running on Spectator.co.uk? \"She's got an erection problem. His erection problem affects both of you. ... Erectionadvice.co.uk. Supported by an educational grant from Pfizer Limited.\" FEEDING THE TIGER AGAIN We all know about David Blunkett's brief and unfortunate connection with the Sloaney London nightclub, Annabel's. But the latest edition of the register of members' interests reveals that David Davis has an unexpected connection with the club, too. Its owner, Robin Birley - largely famous for having been mauled by an Aspinall's tiger in his youth and for subsequently backing his stepfather Lord Goldsmith's Referendum party - has given the man who can win over the north his \"financial support\". Other highlights of the new edition include the revelation that George Galloway earned more than GBP75k for his Mail on Sunday column and a further sum for \"advice on the Fidel Castro Handbook\". Other big earners include, predictably, William Hague, who fitted in no less than 47 lucrative speeches to bolster his contract with the News of the World. Boris is a relative minnow with an income of between GBP70k and GBP75k for his Daily Telegraph column. The Backbencher notes in passing that Keith Vaz has a Leicester City season ticket and is sometimes invited to watch matches from the directors' box, while Peter Hain has been indulging his Formula One passion with free hospitality in Monaco and at Silverstone. And David Blunkett's passing interest in DNA Bioscience? No sign of it. It seems that the directorship occurred when parliament was prorogued during the election and when the register is not \"open\". Mr Blunkett resigned the directorship the day Labour was re-elected and before parliament returned. Handy. Meanwhile, Anthony Wright (Labour, Great Yarmouth) is taking no chances, post-Blunkett: \"I won runner-up prize in parliamentary pool competition sponsored by Rileys Snooker. The prize money will be donated to local charities.\" LAST WEEK'S COMPETITION Last week, the Backbencher invited readers to predict John Hutton's successor as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Little did she suspect that, seven days later, the Cabinet Office would still be leaderless and the \"transformational government\" agenda lying unwanted in a corner. A number of tip-offs have been received, but until the post is filled none can win the prize. In the meantime, she can reveal that Hazel Blears is hotly tipped to succeed Mr Hutton, with some readers suggesting that Tony is keeping her at the Home Office until the terrorism bill is safely steered into harbour. The names of Gwyneth Dunwoody, Keith Vaz and, of course, David Blunkett also came up, as did Harriet Harman's - \"a second chance to think the unthinkable\", as one reader put it. More plausibly, Dawn Primarolo, Vera Baird and Yvette Cooper were suggested. But the Backbencher thinks Hazel would be perfect for the job. In case anyone's forgotten, she did a fantastic job while Charles Clarke was on holiday in August, coming up with the notion of hyphenated-British identities for ethnic minorities. Who says the French have all the best ideas when it comes to integration? THIS WEEK'S COMPETITION This week - and just in time for Sir Ian's appeal tonight - the Backbencher has a copy of Alastair Hannay's On the Public from Routledge's Thinking in Action series to give away. It's not an easy read for your average cop, but chapter openings like \"The emptiness of public space goes together with the abstractness of the private citizen\" would certainly give Plod something to mull over as he treads the beat. For a chance of winning it, tell the Backbencher whose daughter is currently suing her father, citing gender discrimination, after he failed to give her a job in his party. Nepotism, eh? You just can't rely on it any more. Email backbencher@guardianunlimited.co.uk with the answer. Terms and conditions are here. FROM MICHAEL WHITE IN WESTMINSTER \"If anybody's wondering whether Tony Blair bounced back after his defeat last week - well, is the Pope a Catholic? One thing Blair's really good at is bouncing back and he was in characteristically aggressive and even humorous form. He's not a particularly humorous man, but he told a couple of jokes today. \"Quizzed by Charles Kennedy about the Child Support Agency and its many failings, Mr Blair in effect said there is a review on. We knew that. The CSA doesn't really work because the agency has to investigate complaints, adjudicate on them and enforce them and this triple role is expensive - which is why Mr Kennedy was able to say that they're spending about a third of the money they receive from absent parents on administration. \"Mr Howard chose to ask about invalidity benefit reform. I think the last time I looked 2.7m people were getting it. Successive PMs and ministers have said that surely there aren't that many disabled people wandering around Britain. There aren't, but it was used initially as a convenient alternative to putting people on the unemployment roll at a time when unemployment was 3 million and not well below 1 million as it is now. They exchanged fairly unrewarding pleasantries about who was to blame. Mr Howard said, not unreasonably, that invalidity benefit reform had been promised for a very long time and that the reform white paper had been postponed until January. Mr Blair said there's been a fairly well publicised change of management at the Department for Work and Pensions. Mr Howard said we've had four secretaries of state in barely a year. Is it back to square one every time we get a new one? And so it went on. Michael Howard ended by saying, 'Let me give the PM a word of advice: we're both on the way out and he'd be much better spending the time left not abusing those who agree with him on reform.' Tory MPs loved all that. Mr Blair replied: 'Thank you kindly, I'm sure it was well meant, but when you've won an election you can start giving advice to someone who's won three.' \"Ed Vaizey, who's very much a David Cameron ally, asked a question about budgetary problems in the Oxfordshire healthcare system. He started off by saying, 'We have excellent doctors and nurses in Oxfordshire,' whereupon a Labour MP shouted, 'Good, then sit down.' Mr Vaizey ploughed on and I'm afraid didn't do it very well and the Speaker had to shut him up. Just before he got up there was another Blair riposte. Meg Hillier, who's an MP in east London, got up and said how wonderful the no drinking zones in the streets were in Hackney. Mr Blair gratefully agreed: 'Contrast that with the way the Tories voted on this act and the remarks made by a certain honourable member for Witney.' That's David Cameron, who said in a Guardian Unlimited column that he wrote 'endless papers about scrapping our licensing laws'. So Mr Blair's researchers have been working on Mr Cameron's file, and we'll be getting plenty more of that in the months ahead.\" LISTEN TO PMQS Prime Minister's Questions is now available in MP3 format on Guardian Unlimited.
