On Friday night, less than a month after being forced into exile in Mexico, Morales flew out of the country on a plane bound for Havana. Mexico\u2019s foreign relations ministry confirmed that Morales had left for Cuba on Friday, on what it called a temporary visit. The Mexican newspaper El Universal said official sources had confirmed Morales\u2019 departure for the communist-run Caribbean island. Last month a commentator from the same newspaper, Salvador Garc\u00eda Soto, had predicted Bolivia\u2019s first indigenous president would relocate to another Latin American country \u201cwhere he would be able to organise his resistance plan and strategy to attempt to return to Bolivia to recover power in the near future\u201d. Morales touched down in Mexico on 12 November after Mexico\u2019s leftist leader, Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez Obrador, sent an airforce plane to rescue him from the South American country he had governed since 2006. Morales fled Bolivia after being forced to resign on 10 November in what political foes celebrated as a popular uprising against an increasingly authoritarian leader but which Morales\u2019 supporters branded a right-wing coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. \u201cIt is a racist coup,\u201d Sacha Llorenti, Morales\u2019 former ambassador to the United Nations, said in a recent interview. L\u00f3pez Obrador\u2019s administration had welcomed Morales to Mexico and offered him political asylum. However, Garc\u00eda Soto, the Mexican commentator, argued that a lengthy stay in Mexico would have damaged already fragile US-Mexico ties. Donald Trump\u2019s White House would not have appreciated seeing Mexico\u2019s government \u201csupport, and much less finance, a campaign by the deposed president to retake power in Bolivia\u201d, he argued. \u201cThat is why Evo\u2019s presence cannot last too long ... because the more time that passes the more likely it is to become a source of tension between Mexico and the US.\u201d On Friday, Spain\u2019s El Pa\u00eds reported that Morales was also unlikely to spend much time in Cuba and instead planned to relocate to Argentina once that country\u2019s new leftist leader, Alberto Fern\u00e1ndez, took office next week. The Mexican newspaper Reforma said Morales had travelled to Cuba with his former vice president, \u00c1lvaro Garc\u00eda Linera, and his former health minister, Gabriela Monta\u00f1o. \u201cPresident Evo Morales is in Cuba for a medical appointment with the Cuban medical team that treated him in Bolivia,\u201d Montano told Reuters. In a recent interview with the Guardian in Mexico City, Morales hinted that his political aspirations had not ended with exile. \u201cStruggle, struggle, struggle, struggle, that is where I come from,\u201d he said. For now, a return to Bolivia looks highly unlikely. Morales has ruled out taking part in a fresh round of presidential elections, called as a result of suspicions of vote rigging in his favour. Last month the interior minister of Bolivia\u2019s rightwing interim government vowed to jail Morales for the rest of his life for allegedly inciting anti-government protests that he claimed amounted to terrorism. \u201cAny terrorist should spend the rest of their life in prison \u2013 any terrorist \u2013 Evo Morales or whoever. It\u2019s not about whether you\u2019re an ex-president or white or black or a campesino \u2026 In fact, it\u2019s even worse when it\u2019s an ex-president,\u201d Arturo Murillo said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
