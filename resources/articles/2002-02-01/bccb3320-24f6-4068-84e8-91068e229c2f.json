A few weeks ago a senior figure in the racing industry had this to say on the subject of internet betting exchanges: \"What they do is make everybody an unlicensed bookmaker. It may be that the government will decide, because of the implications in terms of licensing, integrity and the impact on racing and betting, that they should make them illegal.\" It is a measure of the rapid growth of exchange betting that some of those with the most to lose are already pondering whether it should be banned. And if a serious campaign against the exchanges ever gains momentum, the issue of integrity will be vital. Exchanges allow punters to lay individual horses, just as a bookie does. They have been around for barely two years, but already you can hear muttered rumours at the track about this jockey or that trainer, who is doing rather nicely laying their losers on the exchanges. It is the sort of thing that can sound fairly plausible, perhaps even to be expected, given the apparent anonymity which the internet provides. How will anyone ever know it's them? As with so many racecourse rumours, though, the truth appears rather different. Anyone with inside information who wanted to lay a horse to serious money would have only one possible port of call in the current exchange market, since the takeover of flutter.com by betfair.com, its main rival, last month. And as Mark Davies, Betfair's head of business development, is eager to stress: \"Betting exchanges may seem anonymous to the user, but they're certainly not anonymous to us.\" Security and integrity are touchy subjects for any website, so widespread is the public image of geeks in attic bedrooms collecting credit card numbers from the web in the same way they would once have collected stamps. For that reason, Davies is reluctant to go into too much detail about the checks Betfair operates, \"because the more we say, the more people will try to get around it.\" However, he insists that the process is detailed and comprehensive. \"We conduct tests on a daily basis, not just to look at possibilities such as a trainer laying his own horse, but also to counteract credit card fraud, money-laundering and all the other issues which are inherent risks within the site unless they are being monitored. \"We know who has won every bet, how that bet has been placed and exactly when that bet has been placed, arguably in a way which makes us more secure than the conventional cash bookmaker.\" Betfair's checks also show whether someone is winning (or, for that matter, losing) more often than the law of averages would suggest is reasonable. \"We had one guy who was losing so much money on our site that I found myself locked in a management meeting where we were discussing whether it was our responsibility to do something about it,\" Davies says. \"We found that in fact the sort of money he was losing was the same as me going out and losing a tenner - he had it to lose so it wasn't an issue. But that should give people an idea that we are always aware of what people are doing.\" Jockey Club investigators are also welcome to inspect Betfair's data if they have serious suspicions that a client is up to no good. None of this will put a stop to the racecourse rumours, of course, but it might just make a few punters think twice before they believe them. \u00b7 Today's meeting at Kelso hinges on a 7.30am inspection with recent heavy rain having put the fixture in doubt. After the stewards inspected the track yesterday afternoon clerk of the course Jonnie Fenwicke-Clennell said: \"We would not want any significant rain overnight or in the morning.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
