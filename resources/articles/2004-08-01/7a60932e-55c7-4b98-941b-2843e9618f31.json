David James, a corporate consultant who carried out a review of the \u00a3757m scheme for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport in 2002, told Radio 4's Today programme that Palios's decision on Sunday to quit his post as chief executive of the FA would affect corporate confidence in football's governing body. \"I think they should reinstate Palios. I think that is their first priority,\" said James. \"I think they can do it and I think it is legitimate to do so. I think if they don't they are going to have lost the plot completely and put the whole future of the Wembley project at risk. \"The national interest is surely that we get Wembley Stadium built on budget on time and prepare ourselves for a reasonable stab at a World Cup coming to this country. And we are not going to do that if we lose Palios. \"They should bring him back and say, 'You can come back on your original package but you are going to be on a formal notice that you do one more thing out of line and you go without any compensation.' \"The FA has been a borderline solvency case for some time. It was hanging on the thread of solvency until about a week ago when Palios himself managed to refinance the FA and secure the necessary corporate stability. If he goes, I would seriously doubt whether anybody else has got the clout to do it.\" The timing of the comments is unexpected, particularly with Wembley's directors announcing last week that \u00a3100m of the \u00a3433m loan underwriting the project had been taken on by Barclays and Lloyds TSB. \"The FA made its final payment to Wembley in August last year, which means the FA's contribution was completed last summer,\" said an FA spokesperson.\"The project and its finances are completely secure.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
