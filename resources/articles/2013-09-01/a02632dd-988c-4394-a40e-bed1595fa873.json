UPDATE: Here's a summary of what Rouhani said: \u2022 Rouhani said Iran was willing to enter nuclear talks. \"This is a unique opportunity,\" he said. \"The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that all challenges can be met successfully,\" and that includes the nuclear file. \u2022 Rouhani named two principles upon which he said a nuclear deal might be built. One, an agreement that Iran's nuclear program \"must pursue exclusively peaceful purposes\", and two, Iran must have the right to nuclear enrichment inside Iran and \"other nuclear rights.\" \u2022 An un-numbered third condition for nuclear talks was that negotiations occur on \"equal footing\" in a climate of \"mutual respect.\" The Iranian president returned frequently to an insistence on respectful treatment. \u2022 Rouhani said he listened to Obama's assembly speech but he didn't really say what he thought of it. He said for a long time Iran has been hearing saber-rattling out of Washington and he's hoping for a new tone. \"We expect to hear a consistent voice from Washington,\" he said. \u2022 Rouhani condemned international sanctions on Iran, saying that \"coercive economic policies\" would \"negate peace.\" \u2022 Rouhani's speech went long on the offenses of the United States \u2013 unnamed \u2013 Israel, and allies around the world. He mentioned helping Saddam Hussein build its chemical stockpile and arming the fighters in Afghanistan who would become al-Qaeda. He mentioned drones and the assassination of Iranian nuclear scientists, and \"structural violence\" against Palestinians. \u2022 Rouhani positioned Iran as a peaceful actor that would lead the world away from violence if allowed to do so. \"Iran poses absolutely no threat to the world or the regions... in fact my country has been a harbinger of just peace and security,\" he said. \u2022 Rouhani said access to chemical weapons by \"extremist terrorist groups\" in Syria poses the greatest danger in the region. He said the \"use of force\" \u2013 meaning US military strikes \u2013 \"will only lead to a further exacerbation of violence.\" \"A good and bright future awaits the world,\" Rouhani says. He's done. Applause from the gallery. Rouhani says he listened to Obama: I listened carefully to the statement made by President Obama today at the GA. .. [I'm] hoping that they will refrain from following the short-sighted interests of warmongering pressure groups we can arrive at a framework to managing our differences. Talks can happen; equal footing and mutual respect should govern the talks, he says. Of course, we expect to hear a consistent voice from Washington,\" he says. The dominant voice in recent years has been for a military option, he says. He has a different idea. Then Rouhani drops an acronym: The Wave: WOrld Against Violence and Extremism. I propose as a starting step... I invite all states... to undertake a new effort to guide the world in this direction... we should start thinking about a coalition for peace all across the globe instead of the ineffective coalitions for war. He says Iran invites the globe to join The Wave. Now Rouhani turns to the nuclear issue. \"Iran seeks to resolve problems, not to create them,\" he says: There is no issue... that cannot be resolved by mutual respect... Iran's nuclear dossier is a case in point. Acceptance of the inalienable right of Iran constitutes the best and the easiest way of resolving this issue.... \"Put otherwise,\" he says, \"Iran and other actors should pursue two common objectives... for the nuclear dossier\": 1) Iran's nuclear program... must pursue exclusively peaceful purposes. ... I declare here ... this has been and will always be the objective of the Islamic Republic of Iran. Nuclear weapons... have no place in Iran's security and defense doctrine... 2) Right to the enrichment Iran and other related nuclear rights. ... Nuclear technology has already enriched [on an] industrial scale Rouhani asserts that the nuclear program is too far along to deny. Rouhani says Iran will \"act responsibly\" to cooperate with \"other responsible actors.\" He says Iran believes in \"peace based on democracy\" and \"believe there are no violent solutions to world crisis.\" Rouhani turns to the war for the soul: Violence and extremism nowadays have now gone beyond the physical real... and infected [spiritual] life. Intolerance is the predicament of our time. We need to promote and reinforce tolerance.... Then he makes sounds that optimists will highlight: We should not just tolerate others. We should rise above mere tolerance and work together. People around the world are tired of war. This is a unique opportunity. The Islamic Republic of Iran believes that all challenges can be met successfully. Rouhani condemns the use of chemical weapons in Syria and says access to them by terrorist groups is a regional danger: The access by extremist terrorist groups of [chemical weapons] is the gravest danger to the region... the actual use of force will only lead to a further exacerbation of violence. Rouhani condemns drones: Extreme action such as the use of drones on innocent people in the name of combatting terrorism should also be condemned. Then Rouhani says he should say a word about the Iranian nuclear scientists who have been assassinated. For what crimes have they been assassinated? ... Have the perpetrators been condemned? Rouhani begins to lay crimes at the door of the United States and its allies. He lists \"the arming of the Saddam Hussein with chemical weapons\" and establishing al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. Iran, on the other hand, is irreproachable: \"Iran poses absolutely no threat to the world or the regions... in fact my country has been a harbinger of just peace and security.\" Rouhani lists what he says are infractions in North Africa and west Asia (Afghanistan, Iraq and Kuwait); the \"brutal oppression of the Palestinian people\" and \"terrorist bombings in countries like Iraq, Afghanistan and Lebanon.\" He says \"structural violence\" is being carried out on \"the people of Palestine.\" Israel, incidentally, has boycotted Rouhani's address. Rouhani is describing a perilous global balance threatened by brinksmanship and \"strategic violence\" meant to upset regional actors. \"Efforts to redraw political borders and frontiers is extremely dangerous and provocative,\" he says, without naming names. \"The center of world powers is hegemonic. Relegating the south to the periphery has led to the establishment of a monologue at the level of international relations,\" he says. It sounds like this speech was written by a foreign affairs academic who came back to life, barely, for the occasion. Rouhani criticizes the \"cold war mentality\" and \"bipolar mentality\" that separates the world into \"superior us and inferior others.\" Any miscalculation of one's position and of course of others will bear historic damages. A mistake by one actor will have a negative impact on all others... at this sensitive juncture... the age of zero-sum game is over, although a few actors continue to rely on archaic ways... to retain their domination. Military means to subjugate others are failed examples of the perpetuation of old ways in the new circumstances. He also calls out \"coercive economic policies\" that negate peace \u2013 sanctions, it seems. Rouhani begins with an invocation and some formalities. Then he says the world is made up of fears and hopes: Fear of war... fear of deadly confrontation, of religious, ethnic and national identities... fear of poverty.. of disregard for human dignity and rights, and fear of neglect of morality. Alongside these fears, however, there are new hopes... Of 'yes to peace' and 'no to war.' and the preference for dialogue over conflict, and moderation over extremism. The recent election in Iran represents... hope of the people of Iran... The people transfer of executive power manifested that Iran is an anchor of stability in an ocean of regional instability. He praises \"reliance on the ballot box as the basis of power.\" Liberian president Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf is done. Rouhani is up. Rouhani is next. While we wait for Rouhani, here are four Iran news and analysis pieces getting some traction today with readers: US and Iran: The art of the nuclear deal by Ali Gharib: Despite their differences, each side has clear motivation to seek a deal: Iran's economy has suffered considerable pain under Western sanctions, and its need to break out of its isolation and reintegrate into the global community can only be realized by resolving the nuclear dispute. For the U.S., the failure of seven years of sanctions to force Iranian capitulation has raised the prospect of the standoff escalating towards a potentially disastrous confrontation. Gharib outlines the consensus among analysts on what a nuclear deal might look like. Full piece here. Enigmatic Leader of Iran Backs Overture, for Now by Thomas Erdbrink: This year, in a surprise to almost all Iran watchers, Ayatollah Khamenei has seemed to get behind Mr. Rouhani\u2019s diplomatic push, talking in somewhat opaque but nevertheless conciliatory terms of \u201cheroic flexibility.\u201d And on Monday, in another gesture of support for Mr. Rouhani, Iran released 80 political prisoners. But the question for many here is, how much room will the supreme leader allow for diplomacy before pulling the rug out from under Mr. Rouhani? Five Reasons Not to Trust Iran on Nukes by Jeffrey Goldberg: 1. Rohani, so far at least, hasn't indicated that Iran is open to reversing course on its nuclear program. He has actually said that the regime will not even talk about suspending uranium enrichment. Tehran Turns On The Charm Offensive, On Steroids by Suzanne Maloney: I think there can be no doubt that this is real, and that it is qualitatively different \u2014 and more significant \u2013 than any prior outreach from Iran. I was convinced on the night of Rouhani's election that Tehran had decided it was time for a nuclear deal, and everything that has transpired since then has only strengthened that conviction. His rhetoric, his appointments of Zarif (both to head the Foreign Ministry and to take responsibility for the nuclear negotiations) as well as former defense minister Ali Shamkhani as national security advisor, the improvements in the domestic atmosphere and other gestures such as the release of nearly a dozen prominent political prisoners earlier this week \u2014 all of these steps confirm my confidence that Rouhani is intended to serve as the instrument for staunching the economic costs of Iran\u2019s nuclear standoff and beginning a broader rehabilitation of the regime. And if you missed our post about it earlier, be sure to go back and read Narges Bajoghli on why Rouhani's diplomatic initiative appears to be genuine. \"Hassan and Hussein\" will have to wait. But we should hear from president Rouhani within an hour. Speaking now is Latvian president Andris B\u0113rzi\u0146\u0161. On deck is Liberian president Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, and then it's Rouhani. The Times correspondent in Tehran provides a little context for this: Here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 A prospective handshake \"encounter\" between presidents Obama and Rouhani will not happen after all. US administration officials said the White House had offered an \"encounter\" but Iran took a pass, saying it was \"too complicated.\" \u2022 Perhaps more significantly, US secretary of state John Kerry is scheduled to meet Iranian foreign minister Mohammed Javad Zarif on Thursday for preliminary talks in what both sides have signaled they hope may become full-blown negotiations over Iran's nuclear program and international sanctions. \u2022 In his address to the assembly, President Obama focused on Iran and Syria, although he said the two foci of his foreign policy would be Iran and the Arab-Israeli conflict. Obama called for new cooperation with Iran to resolve the \"nuclear issue\" and embark on a \"long road\" to overcome \"deep roots\" of \"mistrust.\" \u2022 Obama's speech was received as a likely good start to encouraging a conversation to develop between Tehran and Washington. \u2022 Obama said Russia and the United states had \"reached an agreement\" to destroy Syrian chemical weapons, and \"the Syrian government took a first step by giving an accounting of its chemical stockpiles.\" He called for a binding UN resolution on Syria's chemical arsenal. \u2022 Obama called for wider peace talks on Syria. \"An agreement on chemical weapons should energize a larger diplomatic effort\" in Syria, he said. He said it's a \"fantasy\" that Syria could return to its pre-war status. \u2022 The Israeli embassy to the US has created a fake LinkedIn page to poke fun at Iranian president Hassan Rouhani's professed desire to engage in negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. \u2022 Obama announced $340m in new aid for Syria, and calls for additional help surfaced in speech after speech. \"Millions of Syrians are refugees and the country is destroyed,\" French president Francois Hollande said. Jordanian king Abdullah said \"my people cannot be asked to shoulder the burden of what is a global and regional challenge.\" \u2022 Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff vehemently condemned spying by the NSA and GCHQ. She said the practice constituted a serious human rights violation and a crime. Now speaking: president Laura Chinchilla Miranda of Costa Rica, #19 on the list of speakers. Rouhani, at #24, is getting closer. Rouhani's entourage for his UN trip appears to be about half the size of his predecessor Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's last year, a detail not lost on the Iranian media, writes the Guardian's Saeed Kamali Dehghan (@SaeedKD): In 2012, Ahmadinejad made headlines in Tehran for taking almost 140 people with him, including his wife, his son and many relatives of his cabinet members. [...] Wary of the backlash Ahmadinejad received at home, Rouhani appears to have a relatively modest entourage, including his chief of staff, Mohammad Nahavandian; Hesamodin Ashena, his special aide; and Mohammadreza Sadegh, his press advisor. The head of Iran\u2019s cultural heritage, handcrafts and tourism organisation, Mohammad Ali Najafi, is also accompanying Rouhani in order to promote Iran\u2019s tourism industry after its significant decline under eight years of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. [...] Two members of Iran\u2019s parliament, including the country\u2019s sole Jewish MP, are also accompanying Rouhani. Ahmadinejad did not take a single MP to New York last year, according to Fararu, perhaps due to his feud with the parliamentarians in his final years in office. Iranian media said Rouhani was staying in Millennium UN Plaza. Ahmadinejad stayed in Warwick Hotel last year. Fararu estimated that Ahmadinejad\u2019s stay at the Warwick for 5 days cost nearly $500,000, against an estimated $175,000 for Rouhani\u2019s visit. Separately, Iranian foreign minister Mohammed Javad Zarif has been writing on Facebook about his New York trip. The diary (translation here) began with an entry last Thursday: Hello Friends, Around noon yesterday, after a 15-hour flight and a two-hour stopover, I landed in New York and went directly to the United Nations. For those friends who have not travelled to this part of the world, New York is eight-and-one-half hours behind Iran. A good friend and colleague of mine, Mohammad Khazaee, Iran\u2019s ambassador to the United Nations, put on an honorable program that was attended by more than 100 U.N. ambassadors and secretariat officials. [...] Read it here. Finally, Saeed flags a spot that aired on Iran state TV Monday night, featuring a 3D preview of Rouhani's UN trip: Security council members should voluntarily forfeit their veto rights in the case of war crimes or massacres, French president Francois Hollande argued in his speech Tuesday. Guardian Paris correspondent Angelique Chrisafis (@achrisafis) reports on a new UN \"code of conduct\" Hollande proposed: Criticising indecision, stalemate and lost time at the UN over the Syria crisis, Hollande made a thinly veiled dig at countries who have vetoed moves to deal with the Damascus regime, saying veto rights must be shelved in the case of major war crimes, adding: \u201cIf the UN is powerless, peace is threatened\u201d. Hollande's UN visit was designed to reassert France's firm position on Syria after he was attacked in the French media for allowing Paris to be sidelined by the US and Russia in dealing with the chemical weapons crisis. France, the former colonial power in Syria, had been the most outspoken on sanctions of the regime and had in recent weeks insisted on \u201cpunishing\u201d Syria. Before meeting the Iranian president Hassan Rouhani at the UN, Hollande said he expected \"concrete gestures\" by Iran to show it would give up its military nuclear programme, \u201ceven if it clearly has the right to pursue its civilian programme.\u201d Hollande said \"I am in favour of dialogue but just as strongly, I am firm on the issue of nuclear proliferation.\u201d The Guardian's Paul Lewis sends a follow-up pool report on the non-meeting between Obama and Rouhani. \"To be clear, the US offer of 'an encounter' was one between President Obama and President Rouhani,\" the report quoted senior administration officials as saying: \"We have said publicly and we also said privately to the Iranians, that we're open to having discussions on the margins of UNGA - informal discussions not a bilateral meeting. That proved to be too complicated for the Iranians to do at this point,\" a senior administration official said. Back in the general assembly hall (a temporary facility while the real hall is under renovation), Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych is speaking, with Sri Lankan president Mahinda Rajapaksa on deck. About that handshake: Guardian Washington correspondent Paul Lewis sends along the White House pool report, which says that senior administration officials appeared at around 2:45pm \"to say that the White House had offered to have 'an encounter' on the sidelines of UNGA with Iranian President Rouhani, but the Iranians informed the US today that it is 'too complicated for Iranians to do at this point.'\" So no handshake then? CBS News' White House correspondent Mark Knoller quotes anonymous White House officials as saying \"Iran passed\": A web site of Iranian state TV reports that Rouhani skipped the UN luncheon not because of a desire or need to avoid an awkward run-in with potential historic negotiating counterpart Barack Obama but because there was wine. The Iranian-French talks: Prince Albert II closes with a quote from Antoine de St. Exupery. Up next: president Jacob Zuma of South Africa. Iran analyst (and filmmaker) Narges Bajoghli thinks Rouhani's diplomatic initiative is genuine (the LinkedIn humor of the Israeli embassy notwithstanding). Bajoghli writes in the Guardian: Having spent nine years in Iran researching among Basij, Revolutionary Guards, and veterans from all across the political spectrum, I know that Hasan Rouhani's recent overtures to the west are neither shocking nor are his intentions suspect. What has been rarely discussed is the combination of the broad cross section of voters that coalesced behind Rouhani in June, the sheer number of the Islamic Republic's political elite who were utterly opposed to Ahmadinejad and are vying for a different direction in Iran, and the realization by Iran's political elite following the eruption of the 2009 Green Movement that a significant number of the population is unhappy with the hardline direction in the country, and in order for the Islamic Republic to survive, it must change its course. Read the full piece here. Rouhani sits down with Hollande, who called forcefully for action in Syria. The Qatari emir is done. Next up: Prince Albert II of Monaco. A list of today's speakers is here. Now Sheikh Hamad speaks obliquely of Egypt, in context of the Arab Spring, saying that people did not rise up \"so that despotism can be exchanged for chaos or another kind of despotism.\" \"We should not jump to hasty conclusions about the nature of Arab revolutions... the Arab peoples have become more aware of their rights,\" he says. Speaking now, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, emir of Qatar. He has been speaking of the need for a two-state solution. Turning to Syria, he says the regime has \"crossed all red lines dictated by morality and mandated by law.\" He has not yet spoken on Egypt, where Qatar spent billions $8bn in one year to fortify the government of former president Mohamed Morsi, seemingly for nought. Egypt has tried to pay some of the money back, the AP reported earlier this month: Egypt\u2019s Central Bank paid back $2 billion in aid to Qatar despite its faltering economy and refused a request by Qatari airlines to increase flights, authorities said Thursday, marking a new low in relations between the two countries. The Israeli embassy to the US has created a fake LinkedIn page to poke fun at Iranian president Hassan Rouhani's professed desire to engage in negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. Rouhani is merely a slick talker with ulterior motives and no real desire to cut a nuclear deal, suggests the page, which is hosted on the official Israel Embassy web site. It bills Rouhani as \"president of Iran, expert salesman, PR professional, nuclear proliferation advocate.\" Eli Lake (@EliLake), senior national-security correspondent for Newsweek and The Daily Beast, obtained comment from the official who created the page, Noam Katz, the embassy\u2019s minister of public diplomacy: He told The Daily Beast on Tuesday, \u201cLinkedIn was our way to highlight Rouhani\u2019s long history in Iranian politics and his true position as the leading PR face for the regime that the public is largely unaware of on a platform they\u2019re familiar with.\u201d The full text of Obama's remarks before the UN general assembly is here. Lunch time. The president of the host country offers a toast: But president Juan Manuel Santos Calder\u00f3n of Colombia isn't there \u2013 he's speaking in the general assembly hall. Neither is Iranian president Hassan Rouhani, who did not RSVP. Abdullah criticizes the increase of visits by Jewish worshippers to the Temple Mount. He says the peace process hinges on a cessation of provocations, meaning \"no continued settlement construction and no unilateral actions that threaten the status quo in east Jerusalem and its Christian and Muslim holy sites.\" Abdullah concludes. Next up is president Ivan Ga\u0161parovi\u010d of Slovakia. \"Syria's future will depend on the Syrian people,\" Abdullah says. \"But the world has the .. interest and the duty to help.\" The flow of Syrian refugees in Jordan already equals one-tenth of our population... it could reach 1m by next year... These are not just numbers, they are people... not even the strongest global economies can absorb this demand on infrastructure and resources, let alone a small economy and the fourth-poorest water infrastructure in the world. I say here and now, my people cannot be asked to shoulder the burden of what is a global and regional challenge. Abdullah begins with an invocation in Arabic and then switches to stentorian, effortless English. \"The Syrian crisis is a global humanitarian and security disaster,\" he says. Jordan currently hosts about 520,000 Syrian refugees. Abdullah continues: Extremists have rushed to promote and exploit ... differences... We have a duty to reject those destructive forces. He says Jordan convened a conference of 100 Islamic scholars who roundly condemned the vision for an Islamic state purveyed by militants fighting in Syria. \"The modern Islamic state should uphold equality,\" Abdullah says. Hollande has wrapped. Next up: Jordanian King Abdullah. Hollande urges international participation in the planned global climate conference of 2015. The conference must produce a binding resolution, not just a statement of principle, he says. \"If there are no sanctions, there will be no progress, and therefore there will be an increase in the temperature of the world.\" \"My message is simple,\" Hollande says, across issues of climate, war and politics: The worst threat is inaction. The worst decision is to not take any. And the worst danger is to not see it. Therefore the United Nations must act. Hollande turns to Mali. He says the French intervention in northern Mali has, in short, saved the country, restoring its borders, its control over its territory, and its internal security. He welcomes the new Malian president, Ibrahim Boubacar Ke\u00efta. He says challenges lie ahead, including the spread of extremists to neighboring Libya, and the resilience of extremist groups elsewhere. \"The attack on Kenya reminds us that even if groups like al-Shabaab have been conquered, they have not been eradicated,\" Hollande says. He calls for an international security force for the Central African Republic and new support for the Democratic Republic of Congo. Hollande announces that France will convene next year \"a meeting for peace and security of Africa.\" All African countries have been invited, he says. The EU and UN will attend. Hollande says the Iranian nuclear \"situation\" is dangerous. He says Iran must demonstrate that it is not pursuing nuclear weapons but should be allowed to construct a civilian program. \"I am in favor of dialogue but just as strongly I am firm on the issue of nuclear proliferation,\" he says. Hollande turns to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.He calls for a two-state solution. He says the conflict has regional and international repercussions. \"To negotiate a peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians, this would be an historic act,\" Hollande says. Indeed. Hollande continues on Syria. He says nearly 20% of the Lebanese population is now Syrian refugees. France is attached to this country because we know how much it has suffered in these recent years from the [turmoil] in the Middle East. Hollande begins with a call for action on Syria. \"In Syria, it is urgent,\" Hollande says. \"It is urgent because 120,000 people have died in the last two years, 90,000 in the last year alone.\" The numbers are on the high end of previous estimates. \"Millions of Syrians are refugees and the country is destroyed,\" Hollande says. The worst, he says, was the chemical attack of 21 August: France wanted a strong reaction... This pressure which my country carried out with others and specifically the United States... has produced results... Negotiations are under way. Hollande calls for a binding resolution under chapter 7 of the UN charter and that \"those who have committed these crimes must be held accountable.\" Speaking now at the UN general assembly: president Armando Em\u00edlio Guebuza of Mozambique. Up next: president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande of France. Ahmed Shihab-Eldin, the Huff Post Live host, convened Iran analyst Ali Gharib and Steve Clemons of the Atlantic to talk about Obama's speech. Watch the conversation here. Obama's speech was \"something that the Iranians would have wanted to hear to start negotiations,\" Gharib said: There was not a lot of threatening military action against Iran. There was an acknowledgment of Iran's grievances. And even a nod to Iran's right to peaceful nuclear energy... I think it will probably be welcomed in diplomatic halls ranging from Turtle Bay to Tehran. Clemons said \"you're seeing, being played out in public, a potential major shift in US-Iranian relations\": [Obama] also said something US president's don't often say, was that president Rouhani received a mandate from his people. We don't often talk about Iranian elections, the Iranian political system, as being legitimate. Gharib said that for all the talk of a handshake between Obama and Rouhani, the real mesh of gears could happen Thursday, when US secretary of state John Kerry meets Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif: A lot has been made of a potential handshake... I actually don't think it's a very big deal... If Zarif and Kerry sit down across from each other, that's already going to be progress beyond what was even imaginable six months ago. Watch the whole thing here. Obama's focus was on Iran. Eurasia group director Ian Bremmer counted mentions of countries in Obama's speech. The breakdown, via Bremmer: Iran 25 Syria 20 Israel 15 Palestine 11 China 1 Japan 0 India 0 Koreas 0 All ears: Iranian president Hassan Rouhani is evidently missing Chilean president Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era Eche\u00f1ique's speech, running for a while now. Here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 President Obama called for new cooperation with Iran to resolve the \"nuclear issue\" and embark on a \"long road\" to overcome \"deep roots\" of \"mistrust.\" He said he had directed secretary of state John Kerry to pursue a settlement with the Iranian government on its nuclear program. \u2022 Referring to \"Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons\" (there's no such pursuit, Iran says), Obama called for a \"transparent and verifiable\" process that would satisfy global concerns. He said crippling international sanctions on Iran were of Tehran's own making. \u2022 \"I don't believe this difficult history can be overcome overnight,\" Obama said. He referred to \"America's role of overthrowing the Iranian government in the Cold War\" and to American \"meddling.\" \u2022 Obama described Iran's nuclear program as one of his two top foreign policy priorities, the other being initiating new Arab-Israeli peace talks. \"The time is now right for the entire international community to get behind the pursuit of peace,\" he said. \u2022 Obama said Russia and the United states had \"reached an agreement\" to destroy Syrian chemical weapons, and \"the Syrian government took a first step by giving an accounting of its chemical stockpiles.\" He said it was an \"insult\" to imply that anyone but the Assad regime was responsible for the 21 August attack. \u2022 The American president announced an additional $340m in aid for Syria and called for global mobilization to address the country's humanitarian crisis. \"Our response has not met the scale of the challenge,\" he said. \u2022 \"An agreement on chemical weapons should energize a larger diplomatic effort\" in Syria, Obama said. He said it's a \"fantasy\" that Syria could return to its pre-war status. \u2022 Obama dismissed the notion of a chess match between the US and Russia playing out over Syria. \"We're no longer in a Cold War. There's no great game to be won,\" he says. \u2022 Obama delivered an apologia for the US role in the Middle East. \"The US is chastised for meddling... at the same time blamed for failing to do enough to address the region's problems,\" he said. He said the US had won a \"hard-earned humility\" in Iraq, which \"shows us that democracy cannot simply be imposed by force.\" But \"we reject the notion that these principles are western exports incompatible with Islam or the Arab world.\" \u2022 Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff delivered the loudest, most public condemnation yet by a world leader of spying by the NSA, the GCHQ and associated intelligence services. She said the practice constituted a serious human rights violation, a crime, and an act of disrespect to the sovereignty of targeted countries. Rousseff said the UN needs to establish international protections for Internet users from spying. Gul has wrapped. Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan is next. The C-SPAN video feed of the UNGA proceedings has been spotty; this UStream feed from PBS seems to be working better Rouhani did not appear to be in the hall as Obama spoke, the Washington Post's Max Fisher reports: Gul says Turkey is behind an Arab-Israeli peace deal but it \"mainly depends on the Israeli government's acceptance... of the need for a viable Palestinian state.\" Gul says West Bank settlements are threatening regional stability: \"The continued expansion of illegal settlements on Palestinian land undermines the prospects for a two-state solution.\" Now Gul gets a bit more specific on the war to his south. \"Turkey welcomes and supports the US-Russian agreement,\" he says. That agreement must be \"translated into a tangible UN security council resolution,\" he says. He says chemical weapons were used and \"the perpetrators of this crime against humanity must be held accountable and brought to justice,\" he says. He says the international community is turning \"a blind eye to the deaths of more than 100,000 people\" and people are dying even as he speaks. \"Syria, a great country and a great nation, is consuming itself,\" Gul says. Gul says the actions by Syrian \"leaders\" have \"implications beyond their own borders.\" Regional peace and security depend on the \"maintenance\" of security within each country, he says. He's speaking broadly, generically, in favor of security council intervention against \"aggressive regimes\" and \"perpetrators of brutal action.\" Next up: Turkish president Abdullah Gul. As he begins background chatter in the hall is audible. Obama spoke for 40 minutes \u2013 quite over the allotted 15. Obama finishes. The hall applauds. Remarkable speech by Obama. He goes out of his way to admit the CIA overthrew the last popularly elected leader of Iran. He borderline ridicules the contradictory bent of theories about the US role in the Middle East. \"There's no great game to be won,\" he said. He asserts a global need for American leadership. He points out that things didn't go well for the United States in Iraq and says the US has a \"hard-earned humility\" from the experience. He's arguing with the world about what the US is and does, in a speech seeded with concessions of American fault and American weakness. It's a cunning rhetorical gambit. It's a characteristic swing for the fences. Obama defends US participation in the intervention in Libya. \"Does anyone truly believe that the situation in Libya would be better if Ghadafi had been allowed... to brutalize his people? \"It's far more likely,\" Obama says, that Syria would be \"engulfed in civil war and bloodshed.\" The United States has \"a hard-earned humility when it comes to our ability to\" determine events inside other countries, Obama says. There's an idea that America works constantly to expand its \"empire,\" he says, but that idea \"isn't born out by America's current policy or by public opinion,\" he says. \"The danger for the world is not that the United States\" is overly engaged, it's that the US \"... rightly concerned about difficulties back home.. may disengage, creating a vacuum of leadership that no other nation is ready to fill,\" Obama says. Then Obama says he frankly believes that America is exceptional, because: \"We have shown a willingness to sacrifice blood and treasure to stand up not only for our own narrow interests but in the interests of all,\" he says. Obama says democracy is for everyone. \"We reject the notion that these principles are western exports incompatible with Islam or the Arab world,\" he says. \"We will be engaged in the region for the long haul,\" he says. Obama turns to Egypt. \"When peaceful transitions began in Tunisia and Egypt, the entire world was filled with hope,\" he says. \"...We chose to support those who called for change.. in the belief that societies based on democracy and openness... will ultimately be more prosperous and more peaceful.\" \"Mohamed Morsi was democratically elected but proved unwilling or unable to govern in a way that was fully inclusive,\" Obama says. The interim government is supported by a large number of Egyptians but has taken non-democratic action by imposing emergency law, restrictions on the press, civil society and opposition parties, Obama says. Meanwhile, the United States is \"simultaneously accused of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood and engineering their removal from power!\" he says, sounding incredulous. \"In fact the United States has avoided choosing sides,\" Obama says. Obama turns to a conflict he aptly describes as older than tensions between the US and Iran: the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \"The time is now right for the entire international community to get behind the pursuit of peace,\" he says. He says Abbas has expressed a willingness to negotiate and the Netanyahu has released political prisoners and reaffirmed his commitment to a Palestinian state. \"And so the rest of us must be willing to take risks as well,\" Obama says. He says friends of Israel such as the US must recognize the need for a Palestinian state. Likewise friends of Palestine (he doesn't say \"Palestine\") must recognize the need for a two-state solution and for Israel's security. \"The roadblocks may prove to be too great but I firmly believe a diplomatic path must be tested,\" Obama says. Obama says the supreme leader has issued a fatwa against nuclear weapons. He says mutual action to eliminate them must proceed in a way that is \"transparent and verifiable.\" \"It is the Iranian government's choices that have led to the sanctions that are in place,\" Obama says. \"I am directing John Kerry to pursue a settlement with the Iranian government in close cooperation\" with international partners, he says. Now Obama turns to Iran. He makes a remarkable acknowledgment of the US role in taking out Mossadegh,the democratically elected president of Iran, who was deposed in a CIA-led coup in 1953. \"This mistrust has deep roots,\" Obama says. Iranians complain of America's meddling, Obama says, including \"America's role of overthrowing the Iranian government in the Cold War.\" Americans complain of Iranian taking hostages, threatening US troops and allies. \"I don't believe this difficult history can be overcome overnight. The suspicions run too deep.\" But resolving the nuclear question could serve as a first step down a long road, he says. Obama says US policy will turn on Two particular issues: Iran's pursuit of nuclear weapons, and the Arab-Israeli conflict. Obama articulates guidelines for what he says will be his Middle East policy going forward. He says the US depends on the region for oil and will directly confront terrorist threats and proliferation threats. But the US also sees a direct interest in \"peace and prosperity\" in the region, he says. It's not possible to act unilaterally though. \"Iraq shows us that democracy cannot simply be imposed by force,\" he says. Obama announces new Syria aid \"We will be providing an additional $340m in aid for Syria,\" he says. No aid can replace a truce, he says, but \"it can help people survive.\" Then he describes a frustrating contradiction around the US role in the Middle East. \"The US is chastised for meddling... at the same time blamed for failing to do enough to address the region's problems.\" \"These contradictory attitudes have a practical impact\" for the support of American people for US action in the Middle East, Obama says. Obama calls for a broader truce in Syria. \"An agreement on chemical weapons should energize a larger diplomatic effort\" in Syria, Obama says. He says the idea that Syria can return to its pre-war power structure is \"a fantasy.\" \"We're no longer in a Cold War. There's no great game to be won,\" he says. Obama pushes back against the Russian line that opposition groups may have been responsible for the 21 August chemical attack. \"It's an insult... to suggest that anyone other than this regime carried out this attack,\" he says. Then the president turns to his vision for a political settlement: As I've discussed with President Putin for more than a year... my preference has always been a diplomatic solution... We have reached an agreement to place Syria's chemical weapons under control ... The Syrian government took a first step by giving an accounting of its chemical stockpiles. Obama says what's needed next is an enforceable resolution with consequences to destroy the weapons. Obama begins to outline US policy on Syria. \"As a starting point, the international community must enforce a ban on the brazen use of chemical weapons.\" The ban is \"older than the United Nations itself,\" Obama says. He invokes \"the searing memory of soldiers suffering in the trenches, Jews... in gas chambers, Iranians slaughtered...\" Obama turns to Syria. \"Peaceful protest ... were met with oppression and carnage,\" he says, and \"many retreated to their sectarian identities.\" \"Our response has not met the scale of the challenge,\" Obama says. ...\"The peace process is stillborn... America and others have worked to support the moderate opposition,\" he says, but extremist groups have taken over. Then Obama at the UN accuses the Assad regime of using chemical weapons on Syrians: \"On August 21, the regime used chemical weapons in an attack that killed 1,000 people,\" he says. In fact Obama's speech does contain a reply to Rousseff, if just one line: \"We've begun to review the way that we gather intelligence\" to balance security concerns of Americans and allies with \"privacy concerns that all people share,\" Obama says. Then he says the \"world is more stable than it was five years ago.\" \"Each year we come together to reconfirm the founding vision of this institution,\" Obama begins. It does not sound like the entirety of his remarks will be cued to Rousseff's attack on his intelligence services. Indeed the American president works his way through a series of filigreed sentences paying tribute to the glory of the institution, which now, he says, faces one of its most difficult challenges. Rousseff is done. Obama is next. Rousseff turns to other topics. But it's fair to say the 68th UNGA has delivered early on its promise of action. Rousseff acquitted herself of the loudest, most public condemnation yet by a world leader of spying by the NSA, the GCHQ and associated intelligence services. She said the practice constituted a serious human rights violation, a crime, and an act of disrespect to the sovereignty of targeted countries. She expressed disbelief that friendly countries would spy on one another as intrusively as the NSA has done. Rousseff said the UN needs to establish international protections for Internet users from spying. Here's what Rousseff is so exercised about: NSA documents reported on in part by Glenn Greenwald on the Brazilian news program Fantastico showed that the American intelligence service had records of her internal communications: A separate document displayed communication patterns between Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff and her top advisers, Fantastico said, although no specific written passages were included in the report. Both documents were part of an NSA case study showing how data could be \"intelligently\" filtered, Fantastico said. Read the full piece here. Rousseff snubbed Barack Obama in mid-September by postponing an official visit to Washington in protest at the spying activities. Rousseff calls on the UN to \"properly regulate the behavior of states regarding these technologies...\" She announces that Brazil will put forth proposals to establish an international framework for Internet use and communications. \"We must establish multilateral mechanisms for the world wide web. She names five guiding principles: Freedom of speech; multi-lateral governance with transparency; the principle of universality and non-discrimination; cultural diversity without imposing values; and network neutrality. Rousseff is warming to her theme. \"What we have before us is a serious case of a violation of human rights... and disrespect to the sovereignty of my country. We have sought guarantees that the spying \"will never happen again,\" she says. It's impossible to allow \"illegal\" actions to go on \"as if they are ordinary,\" she says. \"They are unacceptable.\" She says Brazil is taking steps to protect its communications and to \"defend the human rights of all citizens of the world.\" Rousseff launches a diatribe against international \"spying activity.\" She calls it \"a global network of international spying.\" She says surveillance is a \"breach of international law and an affrontment to the principles that should govern relationships among countries, especially friendly countries.\" \"In Brazil the situation was even more serious, since we as Brazil figure as a target.\" Rousseff says. She says individuals' and businesses' communications have been \"indiscriminately\" targeted. THe issue is \"utterly important and serious,\" she says. Here's the schedule of today's speakers before the assembly. \"Statements should be no longer than 15 minutes,\" warns current assembly president John Ashe, former UN ambassador for Antigua and Barbuda. Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff has just begun speaking. Welcome to our live blog coverage of the 68th United Nations General Assembly. The session is stirring unusual excitement: it could produce the first face-to-face meeting between a US and an Iranian president since the hostage crisis, open a new way forward on negotiations over Iran's nuclear program; render a map for future international involvement in Syria's civil war, and set the stage for a new round of Israeli-Palestinian diplomacy. Both US president Barack Obama and Iranian president Hassan Rouhani are scheduled to address the group of more than 200 national leaders in New York today (Obama speaks at 10am ET). Both leaders are expected to elaborate on expressions in the last weeks of mutual respect and a desire to interface. Rouhani is not two months in office and is the center of a great deal of optimism. Furthermore, according to former Iranian president Mohammad Khatami writing in the Guardian on Monday, Rouhani has the power to negotiate: Explicit public support from the supreme leader of the Islamic republic provides Rouhani and his colleagues with the necessary authority for a diplomatic resolution of a number of foreign policy issues with the west, not just the nuclear issue. The EU foreign policy chief, Catherine Ashton, met with Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif in New York Monday. She said Zarif would meet with US secretary of state John Kerry on Thursday, in what would be the first ministerial talks between Tehran and Washington since the Islamic revolution in 1979. Seasoned observers on all sides, and not just Israel, are counseling caution as a potential new phase of international conversation begins. The leaders of both Iran and Syria have projects they would like more time to complete \u2013 time that could be created by ultimately fruitless talk. But the assumption is the talks in New York this week don't have to be fruitless and might yield a breakthrough. Headlines may also be provided by an early speech by the Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff. She cancelled a state visit to the US in protest at revelations that the National Security Agency had been spying on her personal communications and those of her aides. She may use the UN platform to tell Obama what she thinks of him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
