And the delicate frame and gentle voice of Ben Whishaw as MI6\u2019s resident geek, Q, make watching the process all the more delicious. This time, the actor, who returns to the screen role of Bond\u2019s gadget-man in Spectre is allowed to tease 007 in a running gag about a highly desirable, top-spec car. Sam Mendes, the director, has also let Whishaw wander out of the spies\u2019 workshop. Q can even be spotted clambering on to a ski lift in the set-up for a snowy Bond showdown, which is not something Desmond Llewelyn ever got to do in the role. To crown his Bond glory last week, Whishaw had the honour of presenting a special screening of the new film to the spooks themselves inside their Thames-side lair. Having endeared himself to a mass audience once more as Q, the 35-year-old can look back on an extraordinarily productive period. First, in Tom Hooper\u2019s recent film, The Danish Girl, he fell in love with a transgender Eddie Redmayne, then he appeared as Carey Mulligan\u2019s unsympathetic husband in Sarah Gavron\u2019s Suffragette. In The Lobster, the surreal English-language debut of Greek Yorgos Lanthimos, he played alongside Rachel Weisz and Colin Farrell and he will soon be seen as Moby-Dick author Herman Melville in the whaling saga In the Heart of the Sea, directed by Ron Howard. Before that, however, Whishaw will be back in the world of espionage in BBC1 drama, London Spy, in which he plays a naive, gay man who falls for an apparently conventional City banker. All this screen activity comes after demanding performances on stage, opposite Judi Dench in John Logan\u2019s play Peter and Alice in 2013 and then as Dionysos in Bakkhai, part of the Almeida\u2019s trilogy of classic Greek plays. But for Whishaw, public acclaim first kicked in quite a while ago, despite his relative youth. He was just 23 when he enjoyed the \u201covernight success\u201d of a theatrical fairy tale in Trevor Nunn\u2019s 2004 Hamlet at the Old Vic. Bowled over, the Daily Telegraph\u2019s theatre critic Charles Spencer hailed his Danish prince as a fine successor to a line of theatrical knights: John Gielgud, Alec Guinness, Laurence Olivier and Derek Jacobi. \u201cThis is the kind of evening of which legends are made, one of those rare first nights that those who were present are never likely to forget,\u201d Spencer declared, explaining that the actor\u2019s \u201clight, tremulous voice, painfully thin body\u201d, not to mention \u201cthe kind of cheekbones that will have adolescent girls swooning in the stalls\u201d all added up to \u201cthe most raw and vulnerable\u201d Hamlet he had ever seen. Whishaw\u2019s slight form is something he once said dictates the roles he is given: \u201cBeing very thin has had a lot to do with how I\u2019ve been cast, because you can be young and vulnerable or slightly undernourished and feral and edgy, and they seem to be the two ways it\u2019s gone so far.\u201d The truth is, for most punters, Whishaw effortlessly seems to make a space around himself, rather like Mark Rylance or, before that, Paul Scofield. Pippa Harris, Mendes\u2019s production partner, regards Whishaw as a stellar presence, capable of transforming himself on set. \u201cHe is the most mercurial of actors. He somehow manages at one time to be so totally serious that you believe him to be an intellectual, or a king, and then in another role, like Q, he flips into being this mischievous imp. He has an incredible range, more than any other actor I know,\u201d she said this weekend. Whishaw played Richard II in Harris\u2019s Hollow Crown Shakespeare series for the BBC and she recalls being astonished by his graceful facility with the soliloquies. \u201cThe other really exciting thing for me was watching him perform on set opposite Rory Kinnear, who was playing Henry VI for us. They were like two ballet dancers together, the finest actors of the age.\u201d (Kinnear, who played Laertes to Whishaw\u2019s triumphant Hamlet, has been partnered with Whishaw again by Mendes on screen in both Skyfall and Spectre.) Rupert Goold, who directed Richard II, said he picked Whishaw for his unworldly quality: \u201cI wanted someone who had an \u2018otherness\u2019 \u2013 someone who was poetically distant in their soul.\u201d For Otto Bathurst, the director who made the television drama series Criminal Justice with Whishaw in 2008, the difficulty was taking his eyes off the actor. \u201cWe were filming meaty courtroom scenes, with actors such as Lindsay Duncan and Con O\u2019Neill pulling out all the stops. All Ben had to do was sit in the dock, watching his life being carved up in front of his eyes. For most of the day, I had to resist the urge to point my camera at him and only him. The expression on his face was just mesmerising,\u201d he has said. When Whishaw got the part of Hamlet, he had been out of Rada for a year and only appeared in small parts, including as Brother Jasper in the National production of Philip Pullman\u2019s His Dark Materials. At his audition with Nunn, the director was drawn to his fragile physique. \u201cHe has a face of great sensitivity and astonishing youthfulness. He seems to be still in his teens, which suits the purpose well of presenting Hamlet as a university student,\u201d the director said. The teenager\u2019s feel for acting, discovered while a pupil at the Samuel Whitbread community college in Shefford, came out of the blue. His parents and his non-identical twin brother, James, were not theatrically inclined. His father was an IT consultant who had played football for Stevenage and his mother was a cosmetics saleswoman at John Lewis. \u201cI was pretty middle of the road academically and I didn\u2019t really enjoy learning. Drama was my way of staying in touch with the part of myself that was playful,\u201d Whishaw has said. Winning plaudits on the Edinburgh fringe in an adaptation of Primo Levi\u2019s Holocaust memoir If This Is a Man, he had secured a London agent before he faced his A-levels. At 17, he was cast in William Boyd\u2019s directorial debut, The Trench, about life and death on the Western Front. \u201cHe seemed to know \u2013 as all really good actors do \u2013 that less is always more,\u201d Boyd said later. As Whishaw\u2019s fame grew, \u201cless is more\u201d also became a watchword when it came to his private life. He was not interested in personal celebrity, he told one early interviewer. More recently he has argued that this stance is for the benefit of his craft as much as his privacy: \u201cFor me, it\u2019s important to keep a level of anonymity. As an actor, your job is to persuade people that you\u2019re someone else. So if you\u2019re constantly telling people about yourself, I think you\u2019re shooting yourself in the foot.\u201d It is a tactic endorsed by Julian Jarrold who directed him as Sebastian Flyte in Brideshead Revisited. \u201cIt is Ben\u2019s unknowability that makes him such an exciting actor to watch,\u201d he said. Yet Whishaw told the press he was gay in 2013 after a newspaper suggested that it might \u201cout\u201d him. \u201cI wasn\u2019t trying to hide anything, but I am naturally quite private, I suppose,\u201d he said later, once his civil partnership with Australian composer Mark Bradshaw was made public. Given a big role, Whishaw recognises he becomes obsessively involved and wants no separate identity. When cast as Hamlet and as Bob Dylan in the film I\u2019m Not There, and then as the poet John Keats in Jane Campion\u2019s Bright Star, he said that he fell in love. \u201cThat\u2019s why it feels like such a loss when I lose them, as if I\u2019ve had to let go of their hand,\u201d he said. He had a similar emotional commitment when playing BBC reporter Freddie Lyon in Abi Morgan\u2019s enjoyable television series The Hour and was reportedly crestfallen when it did not get a third series. He wanted to finish the story. For such an ethereal star, being cast as Q in an action franchise was a surprise. \u201cI absolutely did not see the offer coming,\u201d he said before the release of Skyfall. He thought more Shakespeare was on the cards when he was invited to dinner with Mendes. There are no ambitions, he claims, to make more money or win Oscars: \u201cIt\u2019s not about that for me. I\u2019m very lucky to have found the thing that makes me tick.\u201d He will be ticking away next on stage in New York in The Crucible. The Arthur Miller revival is directed by the Belgian Ivo van Hove, recently acclaimed for A View From the Bridge at the Young Vic. Soon, no one on either side of the Atlantic will need to be told, as an interviewer was in 2004, that his unusual surname is pronounced with a \u201cwish\u201d sound, not a \u201cwhy\u201d. THE WHISHAW FILE Born with twin brother, James, on 14 October, 1980 in London, to Linda, a John Lewis employee, and Jose, an IT expert. Raised in Clifton, Bedfordshire. Attended Shefford\u2019s Samuel Whitbread Community College before studying at Rada and winning the drama school\u2019s best newcomer prize. Whishaw is not the original family name; Jose has European and Russian ancestry. Best of times His astonishing performance as Hamlet at the Old Vic in Trevor Nunn\u2019s 2004 production, critics saluted him as \u201ca legend\u201d; his portrayal of Richard II in the BBC\u2019s Hollow Crown Shakespeare series. Worst of times Facing pressure to talk about his private life and homosexuality despite a decision to let his stage and screen performances do the talking. What he says \u201cI was quite a shy child \u2013 but I tended to blend into the background. What I liked about the theatre was that it was a controlled place where you can be heard. Where your words are given to you. Where you can express things that you wouldn\u2019t express normally. I think I felt more confident there than I did in real life.\u201d What others say \u201cThere is a fragility about Ben that is inspiring. It\u2019s like he\u2019s in touch with some other ether.\u201d \u2013 Jane Campion, who directed him as John Keats in Bright Star."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
