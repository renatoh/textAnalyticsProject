A gay photographer (Ewen Leslie) heads to Athens to scatter his Greek Orthodox father's ashes and discover his roots; instead, he stumbles over the knots and tangles of a continent-spanning network of prejudice and exploitation. Footage of the austerity protests lends it an of-the-moment vibe, but essentially it's a historical horror movie, turning on the snapper learning what's been polluting his bloodline. The film's restlessness \u2013 schlepping from one Mitteleuropean hellhole to another \u2013 saps some momentum, but director Tony Krawitz pulls off several unsettling moodshifts, and takes extremely seriously the old-world traditions and superstitions a gorefest like Hostel could only sneer and snigger at."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
