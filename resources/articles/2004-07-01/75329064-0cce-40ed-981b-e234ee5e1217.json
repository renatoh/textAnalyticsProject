The key words here are \"up to\". The \u00a360,000 will only be on offer to advanced skills teachers of proven experience, so don't imagine you can brush up your calculus on a refresher PGCE and immediately double your salary. However, the government has said it will increase the golden hello for maths teachers by \u00a31,000 to \u00a37,000, so you might be lucky and qualify for this. But as you'll have to forego your current salary in order to retrain, you're going to be out of pocket at first. I'm also not sure you are aware just how difficult teaching maths can be. There's a world of difference between teaching times tables to eight-year-olds and drilling GCSE geometry into reluctant 16-year-olds. As for maths AS and A2, you probably don't have a prayer. So do you really have the drive and, dare I say it, the ability to handle relatively advanced maths? Because the odds are not in your favour. Look at it this way. Maths teachers know how difficult their subject is, which is precisely why there are so few of them. Imagine it: at the same time you discover a talent for maths as a kid, you discover that everyone else thinks you're a nerd. But you persevere, because Fermat's last theorem is the most beautiful thing you've ever seen. You pass your A-levels with ease and go on to university, where you continue to live a marginalised existence. And then what? Do you devote your life to explaining over and over again to a particularly dim group of 12-year-olds that the internal angles of a triangle always add up to 180? Do you hell. You haven't put yourself through all this misery for a salary of \u00a335,000 or so. You are now one of the most desirable commodities in business. Merchant banks will be throwing six-figure salaries, Porsches, a Docklands penthouse and the proceeds of failed pensions schemes at you to acquire your services. It's not a difficult decision. Which is why even the government's decision to lift the \u00a350,000 cap on salaries is unlikely to make much difference to the maths teacher recruitment problem. But suppose you have a genuine affinity for maths, are prepared to put in the hours, and stand a reasonable chance of qualifying for the advanced skills bonus. Do you really think you'll get the money? All the government has done is to change the salary scales. It hasn't, as yet, chucked any more dosh into the kitty, and given that school budgets are still tight, your extra money is going to have to come at the expense of someone else's payrise. Does that seem likely? But keep those rose-tinted specs on a moment longer. You're looking good in your Armani suit on \u00a360,000 a year, but it's not an easy gig. It's bad enough keeping the kids away from your BMW, without having to worry about the odd kick from resentful, underpaid colleagues. People rather like your good self, come to think of it. \u00b7Send your problem to education@ theguardian.com marked Career doctor"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
