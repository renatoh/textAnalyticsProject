Here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 The US, UK and France said a UN report showed the Assad regime was responsible for a sarin nerve gas attack east of Damascus last month. Russia said the Western powers had \"jumped to conclusions.\" \u2022 The UN said it had \"indisputable\" evidence that sarin was used in the attack. A UN report described rockets, trajectories and launch systems that analysts said implicated the Assad regime. \"The facts speak for themselves,\" UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said. \u2022 It was unclear whether an initial UN resolution on Syria's chemical weapons would be backed by a use of force. A deal over the weekend between Russia and the US called for \"measures under Chapter VII\" to be imposed in case of noncompliance. But the UN security council may pass a nonbinding resolution first. \u2022 \"There's a lot of different ways this can play out at the UN in terms of language,\" a state department spokeswoman said. US leaders have insisted on an allowance for force. Russia has resisted. \u2022 Syria accused Turkey of being \"hasty\" in shooting down a Syrian helicopter that Turkey said crossed its border Wednesday, according to a state media report. Video of the crash has emerged. Turkey said it would explain further what happened to the UN and NATO. \u2022 A presidential authorization by Barack Obama opened the way for the US to send chemical weapons-related personal protective equipment to international organizations working in Syria. \u2022 The activist Local Coordination Committees counted 60 deaths from violence on the opposition side Monday, including 17 in Damascus and environs. \u2022 The number of Syrian refugees crossing into Jordan jumped nearly tenfold last week to an average 900 people per day, the Associated Press reported. The refugee flow is at its highest level in months, Jordanian officials said. However many Syrians were returning home as well, if only temporarily. \u2022 Iran lifted controls on Twitter and Facebook for some areas. Damascus has accused Turkey of being \"hasty\" in shooting down a helicopter Monday and of trying to escalate tensions, according to a state media report quoted by Reuters. Russia argued that the Western powers had \"jumped to conclusions\" with their declaration that today's UN report established the Assad regime's culpability in last month's chemical attack, Guardian diplomatic editor Julian Borger reports: Russia said claims of rebel use against their own supporters to provoke foreign intervention \"should not be shrugged off\". There was also sharp disagreement about what kind of UN resolution was needed to implement the agreement struck by the US and Russia on Saturday in Geneva on dismantling the Assad regime's chemical weapons programme. The differences \u2013 on whether an initial resolution should include the threat of punitive measures for Syrian non-compliance \u2013 were a reminder that the Geneva agreement could still unravel before it is put into force. Read the full piece here. The Associated Press publishes a montage of video of the downing of a Syrian helicopter Monday by Turkish warplanes. The craft falls from the sky in a ball of flames trailing black smoke. The men filming the videos speak today's date to establish authenticity. Earlier we linked to Brown Moses' roundup of videos of the crash and aftermath. The Turkish foreign minister has said Istanbul will report to NATO and the UN on the circumstances surrounding the altercation. Video (warning: graphic) has surfaced of a dead man said to be a pilot. (h/t: @erinmcunningham) President Barack Obama is clearing the way for the U.S. to send non-lethal assistance to the Syrian opposition to help them prevent the use or proliferation of chemical weapons, the AP reports: The president's authorization also allows the U.S. to send chemical weapons-related personal protective equipment to international organizations working in Syria. It also allows for the transfer of assistance to local health care providers in Syria to help them treat victims of chemical weapons attacks. A senior administration official says the U.S. had already started making plans to send the assistance before a chemical weapons attack in Syria on Aug. 21. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the aid by name and insisted on anonymity. Iran has lifted \u2013 temporarily? \u2013 restrictions on tweeting and Facebook. Here's the New York Times correspondent: Also in Iran news from the last 48 hours: a positive response by president Hassan Rouhani to a letter from president Obama could lead to the first face-to-face meeting between the US and Iranian presidents since 1979; Iran's new atomic energy chief has pledged greater cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog; and Rouhani has delivered a \"carefully worded\" speech inviting the elite revolutionary guard to stay out of politics. The main reform bloc in Syria welcomed reports of a US-Russian deal on chemical weapons but said it should quickly lead to a ceasefire and transition talks, reports the Guardian's Jonathan Steele from Damascus: \u201cThe withdrawal of Syria\u2019s chemical weapons is only one issue. The main agenda must be a comprehensive political solution negotiated at Geneva\u201d, Rajaa Nasser, the general secretary of the National Coordination Body for Democratic Change, told the Guardian Sunday. The group is an umbrella for some 20 parties and organisations, a few in exile but most in Damascus. Many have spent years in Syrian prisons. Nasser described the claim by Ali Haidar, the minister of national reconciliation, that the chemical weapons treaty was a victory for Syria as \u201ca joke\u201d. \u201cIt is definitely not a victory\u201d, Nasser declared. As for the Syrian National Coalition, the rebel group which is backed by Western governments and has so far refused to attend the planned conference in Geneva, he said, \u201cWe don\u2019t take their objections seriously. The SNC is not independent. If the United States wants Geneva to take place, the SNC will have to agree\u201d. [...] As long-standing Arab nationalists and critics of Israeli policies, the NCB believes that Syria\u2019s chemical weapons should be restored to any new government that emerges after the civil war, Jonathan reports: \u201cWe want to expand the chemical weapons treaty to the whole Middle East and balance it against Israel\u2019s weapons of mass destruction,\" Nasser said. \"Now Syria has lost that balance\u201d. Here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 The US, UK and France said a UN report presenting \"indisputable\" evidence of a sarin nerve gas attack in Syria also established the culpability of the Assad regime. The UN report did not name a culprit but included details of the rockets and launching systems used \u2013 as well as the gas used \u2013 in the 21 August attack. \u2022 \"This is a war crime, and grave violation,\" UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon said. \"This is the most significant use of chemical weapons against civilians\" since Saddam Hussein used them in Halabja in 1988, he said. \u2022 Debate continued over whether the weekend Geneva deal between the US and Russia provided for military action to back up demands that Syria destroy chemical weapons. The deal mentions \"measures\" under Chapter VII but it's unclear whether those measures would be imposed under an initial UN resolution currently in draft. \u2022 Negotiations on a resolution continued at UN headquarters in New York. \"There's a lot of different ways this can play out at the UN in terms of language,\" a state department spokeswoman said. \"...Obviously our goal is to have the strongest enforcement possible.\" \u2022 Turkish foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu said he would inform the United Nations and NATO members of the circumstances of the downing of a Syrian helicopter Monday by Turkish forces. Turkey said the helicopter crossed into Turkish territory. War crimes blamed on the Syrian opposition are predominantly being carried out by foreign fighters, a U.N. human rights investigator said on Monday. Reuters reports: \"If you're going to look for the (opposition) groups that are committing the worst crimes, look particularly for the foreign fighters, where the foreign fighters are fighting,\" Karen Koning Abuzayd told reporters in Geneva.[...] Abuzayd is one of the four lead members of the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria, a body set up by the U.N. Human Rights Council two years ago to investigate war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Syrian conflict. [...] Paulo Pinheiro, chairman of the U.N. Commission of Inquiry on Syria, said there were now foreign fighters from about 20 countries in Syria including some from Europe. Read the full report here. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry will host China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi at a meeting and working lunch on Thursday at which Syria and North Korea will be discussed, the State Department said on Monday. Reuters reports: \"While this meeting has been planned for some time, we do expect the secretary and foreign minister to discuss current issues, such as the DPRK (North Korea) and Syria,\" spokeswoman Marie Harf told a regular news briefing. China has welcomed a deal reached by the United States and Russia to eliminate Syria's chemical weapons arsenal. American, British and French diplomats have been quick to say that the UN report delivered to the security council today conclusively establishes the culpability of the Assad regime in the 21 August chemical attack. British Ambassador Mark Lyall Grant told reporters there was \"no remaining doubt that it was the regime\" that was responsible for the attack, Reuters reports. U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power echoed his remarks, as did French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius. \"When you look at the findings carefully, the quantities of toxic gas used, the complexity of the mixes, the nature and the trajectory of the (gas) carriers, it leaves absolutely no doubt as to the origin of the attack,\" Fabius told RTL radio Monday evening. \"...It reinforces the position of those that have said the regime is guilty.\" US ambassador to the UN Samantha Power says the United States \"will impose measures under Chapter VII\" in the case of noncompliance by Syria in dismantling its chemical weapons program. It's worth noting that the US could not impose such measures without the assent of security council member Russia. The Assad regime was clearly behind the 21 August chemical attack, Power says. UN evidence show the rockets came from regime-controlled areas; it does not make sense that rebels would have infiltrated those areas only to fire on their own territory, she says. Power urges the security council to \"take the kind of credible, binding action warranted.\" Building on today's findings, we think it's very important for countries... to speak, and make public their conclusions. ... Our impression again is that the technical details will lend themselves to an even more unmistakable conclusion. It is critical that Assad would be losing his chemical weapons program. Question for the state department: Why would Assad fear US strikes? Don't you think the Syrian regime has seen that the Congress won't agree to strikes and the American people don't support war? Harf replies: \"I think they should listen to the words of the commander-in-chief, who makes these decisions.\" \"We believe the opposition is becoming more coherent,\" Marie Harf, the US state department spokeswoman, says. \"The election of the prime minister speaks to that.\" The Istanbul-based Syrian National Coalition chose moderate Islamist Ahmad Tumeh as opposition prime minister at the weekend. Harf rejects the notion, backed by wide reporting, that the opposition inside and outside Syria is exasperated with the United States for the failure of military strikes to materialize. \"We work very closely with the opposition on a daily basis,\" Harf says. \"I'm not going to speak for the opposition. \"If there's no [regime] compliance [on dismantling chemical weapons]... the threat of military indeed is still very much on the table.\" Ban deflects a question about who was responsible for the sarin attack: It is for others to decide whether to pursue this matter further to determine responsibility. It was a grave crime and those responsible must be brought to justice as soon as possible. Ban says he's asked the chemical weapons inspectors to return to Syria \"as soon as we have an agreement with the Syrian government.\" State department deputy spokesperson Marie Harf is trying to explain the conflicting Russian and US statements on whether the deal signed in Geneva included support for a potential use of force. \"We and the Russians agreed to a text... that clearly states that Chapter VII needs to be part of a security council process.\" Harf says. That is true; the text of the \"Framework for the Elimination of Syria Chemical Weapons is here. The pertinent bit is paragraph four: The United States and the Russian Federation concur that this UN Security Council resolution should provide for review on a regular basis the implementation in Syria of the decision of the Executive Council of the OPCW, and in the event of non-compliance, including unauthorized transfer, or any use of chemical weapons by anyone in Syria, the UN Security Council should impose measures under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. However it's unclear whether the UN resolution currently being drafted \u2013 Harf says the work is continuing at UN headquarters \u2013 falls under Chapter VII, or whether there will be an initial nonbinding resolution, potentially to be followed later by a binding resolution if the Syrian regime is found to be in noncompliance. \"There's a lot of different ways this can play out at the UN in terms of language,\" Harf says. \"... obviously our goal is to have the strongest enforcement possible.\" Ban begins his statement at the UN: \"This is a war crime, and grave violation,\" Ban says. \"This is the most significant use of chemical weapons against civilians\" since Saddam Hussein used them in Halabja in 1988, he says. Turkey's deputy prime minister has confirmed that Turkish warplanes shot down a Syrian helicopter on Monday. Deputy PM Bulent Arinc said the helicopter was shot down after it violated Turkish airspace, Reuters reports: \u201c[Monday] at 1420 (1120 GMT) an Mi-17 helicopter belonging to Syria violated the Turkish border in the Guvecci area of Yayladagi in Hatay province by 2 km,\u201d Arinc told reporters in Ankara after a regular cabinet meeting. \u201cIt was repeatedly warned by our air defence elements. When the violation continued, our planes ... hit the helicopter at 1425 with a missile causing it to fall on Syrian soil.\u201d Turkish foreign minister Ahmet Davutoglu will inform the United Nations and NATO members of the circumstances of the downing of a Syrian helicopter by Turkish forces, Reuters reports. Oil is down, AP reports: The price of oil fell to near $107 a barrel Monday on waning fears of a wider Middle East conflict thanks to an international deal intended to halt the use of chemical weapons in Syria. The benchmark oil contract for October delivery fell $1.11 to $107.10 a barrel in midday trading in New York. The contract for November delivery for Brent crude, the benchmark for international crudes used by many U.S. refineries, fell $1.60 to $110.10 a barrel in London. UN staff has just announced that Ban is still meeting with security council members, and so his planned 12.50pm ET news conference is \"running a little bit late.\" We're going to monitor the US state department daily briefing, also scheduled to start shortly, and the White House daily briefing set for 1.30 pm ET. Ban's address at the United Nations will be carried live by C-SPAN here. UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon is scheduled to address reporters shortly. Here's a summary of where things stand: \u2022 Ban said UN investigators had found \"overwhelming and indisputable\" evidence that the nerve agent sarin was used in the east Ghouta attacks of 21 August. \"The facts speak for themselves,\" Ban said in a statement. \u2022 Eighty-five per cent of the blood samples tested positive for sarin, the UN report found, according to Ban. \"A majority of the rockets or rocket fragments recovered were found to be carrying sarin.\" \u2022 In its report on the chemical attack, the UN identified the surface-to-surface rockets used, their launching systems and their trajectories. Ban did not mention the Assad regime by name but the findings implicated forces linked to Assad. \u2022 The Geneva deal between the US and Russia on dismantling Assad's chemical weapons program provides for \"measures under Chapter VII of the UN charter\" in the event of noncompliance, according to text of the agreement quoted by Ban. Chapter VII provides for \"action by air, sea, or land forces as may be necessary to maintain or restore international peace and security.\" \u2022 Turkey said it shot down a Syrian helicopter that had crossed its border, according to AFP and local reports. Footage of a downed craft said to be outside Latakia emerged on social media Monday. \u2022 Jabhat al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda-linked opposition group, says it killed at least 30 members of the Alawite sect during an attack on three villages in central Syria last week, the AP reported. \u2022 The number of Syrian refugees crossing into Jordan jumped nearly tenfold last week to an average 900 people per day, the Associated Press reported. The refugee flow is at its highest level in months, Jordanian officials said. The Geneva agreement between the US and Russia includes a clause that provides for the use of force in case of noncompliance, UN secretary-general Ban Ki-moon says in a statement today upon the release of a report by UN chemical weapons inspectors. Ban quotes from what he says is the Geneva agreement: The unity of the Security Council will be crucial. Given the gravity of the situation, I urge the Council to consider ways to ensure enforcement of, and compliance with, the plan through a clear resolution. In that regard, I draw your attention to a significant element in the agreement reached in Geneva, and I quote: \"The United States and the Russian Federation concur that this UN Security Council resolution should provide for review on a regular basis the implementation in Syria of the decision of the Executive Council of the OPCW, and in the event of non-compliance, including unauthorized transfer, or any use of chemical weapons by anyone in Syria, the UN Security Council should impose measures under Chapter VII of the UN Charter.\" End quote. I agree there should be consequences for non-compliance. Any use of chemical weapons by anyone, anywhere, is a crime. Ban's full statement is here. The Ban statement on the UN investigation's findings is crafted with unequivocal, strong language: The results are overwhelming and indisputable. The facts speak for themselves. The United Nations Mission has now confirmed, unequivocally and objectively, that chemical weapons have been used in Syria. The UN report on chemical weapons use in Syria includes details identifying rockets used and their trajectories, Guardian diplomatic editor Julian Borger reports. The UN report names three areas where surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were used: Ein Tarma, Moadamiyah and Zalmalka in the Ghouta area of Damascus. Julian writes: The report has detailed pictures and descriptions of the rockets apparently used in the attack. The letters engraved on the bottom ring of the engine of one of the rockets highlighted were Cyrillic. \"The rockets are believed to have arrived from the northwest\", the report says. Munition used in Moadamiyah \"matches one of the variants of the M14 artillery rocket, with either an original or improvised warhead. The dispersion pattern commonly associated with rockets luanched from a single, multi-barrel, launcher. In Ein Tarma: \"The munition related to this impact site by observed and measured characteristics indicatively matches a 33 mm caliber, artillery rocket.\" It came on an east/Southeast trajectory. Four key factual findings from Ban's report, including \"Eighty-five per cent of the blood samples tested positive for sarin\": The samples were sent for analysis to four laboratories designated by the OPCW. The Mission\u2019s factual findings are as follows. (a)The environmental and biomedical samples demonstrate the widespread nature of the attacks. Eighty-five per cent of the blood samples tested positive for sarin. Biomedical samples were taken from 34 of the 36 patients selected by the Mission who had signs of poisoning. Almost all tested positive for exposure to sarin. (b)These results were corroborated by the clinical assessments, which documented symptoms and signs consistent with nerve agent exposure. A number of affected patients were diagnosed with intoxification by an organophosphorous compound, and clearly showed symptoms associated with sarin, including loss of consciousness, shortness of breath, blurred vision, eye inflammation, vomiting and seizures. (c)A majority of the environmental samples confirmed the use of sarin. The samples were taken from impact sites and surrounding areas \u2013 locations where survivors were also found to have been affected by sarin. (d)The team was also able to examine impacted and exploded surface-to-surface rockets that are capable of carrying a chemical payload. These were carefully measured, photographed and sampled. A majority of the rockets or rocket fragments recovered were found to be carrying sarin. On the basis of its analysis, the Mission concluded that it \u2013 and I quote \u2013 \u201ccollected clear and convincing evidence that surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were used in the Ein Tarma, Moadamiyah and Zalmalka in the Ghouta area of Damascus.\u201d Due to the security situation and other limitations, the Mission was unable to document the full extent of the use of chemical weapons on 21 August or to verify the total number of causalities. The results are overwhelming and indisputable. The facts speak for themselves. Read the full report here. The UN has just released a statement by secretary-general Ban Ki-moon on its report on chemical weapons use last month in Syria. \"It is with a heavy heart,\" Ban says, \"that I submit to the Security Council the report [...] of the United Nations Missions to Investigate Allegations of the Use of Chemical Weapons on the incident that occurred on 21 August 2013 in the Ghouta area of Damascus. [...] The Mission has concluded that chemical weapons were used on a relatively large scale in the Ghouta area of Damascus in the context of the ongoing conflict in Syria. The attack resulted in numerous casualties, particularly among civilians. Full statement here. Eliot Higgins, who blogs the Syrian conflict under the moniker Brown Moses, has been collecting footage today of an aircraft reportedly downed inside Syria, near Latakia, in the north \u2013 within 50 miles of the Turkish border. Brown Moses says it's not certain that this new footage, which emerged today, is connected with the incident in which Turkey said it shot down a Syrian helicopter that had violated its airspace. Turkey says it has shot down a Syrian helicopter, Agence France-Presse reports. Today's Zaman, one of three Turkish English-language dailies, said the helicopter violated Turkish airspace. Turkish deputy prime minister has said its fighter jets shot down a Syrian helicopter after it violated Turkish airspace. Earlier reports said opposition fighters shot dead two pilots after they ejected themselves after their chopper was hit. [...] In response to stray bullets or shelling arriving from the Syrian side, Turkish Armed Forces have on numerous occasions returned fire since the beginning of the civil war in Syria. In 2012, Turkish artillery fired on targets in Syria after Syrian shells landed inside Turkey and killed several Turkish civilians in one instance. Full story here. Iran's new atomic energy chief has pledged greater cooperation with the UN nuclear watchdog, in advance of talks this month about activities that the West suspects are aimed at developing a nuclear weapons capability, Reuters reports: Iran said on Monday it wanted to settle a decade-old nuclear dispute with the West that has raised fears of a new Middle East war, but the United States said it must back words with action. New Iranian atomic energy chief Ali Akbar Salehi pledged greater cooperation [...] \"This time we are coming with a more full-fledged ... desire for this,\" he said. Salehi was speaking at the annual meeting of the 159-nation International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Read the full story here. Separately Reuters reports that Iranian president Hassan Rouhani has delivered a \"carefully worded\" speech inviting the elite revolutionary guard to stay out of politics: Rouhani's speech, which included praise for the IRGC's increasing economic might, could be an attempt to maintain its support, something that might be in doubt if the Guards see their interests threatened by the new president who has pledged more moderation in Iran's foreign and domestic policies. A centrist cleric who won a surprise landslide victory over more conservative candidates in a June election, Rouhani told an assembly of IRGC commanders and officials that the founder of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, had recommended the military stay out of politics. \"The IRGC is above and beyond political currents, not beside them or within them,\" Rouhani said, according to the ISNA news agency. \"The IRGC has a higher status, which is that of the whole nation.\" Read the full report here. Jabhat al-Nusra, the al-Qaeda-linked opposition group, says it killed at least 30 members of the Alawite sect during an attack on three villages in central Syria last week, the AP reports: Jabhat al-Nusra said in a statement posted online that its fighters attacked the predominantly Alawite villages of Maksar al-Hasan, Jab al-Jarrah and al-Massoudiyeh in Homs province on Tuesday. It said it seized Maksar al-Hasan for 10 hours before being forced to withdraw. The group says it killed more than 30 Alawites and seized 10 Russian-made weapons, ammunition, cars and other equipment in the assault. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group said late Sunday that activists have confirmed the death of 22 villagers from Maksar al-Hasan. On Friday Channel 4 News and Human Rights Watch released a collaborative documentary of a massacre by regime forces in which at least 169 men, women and children were killed \u2013 many executed over hours following an exchange of gunfire \u2013 in the northwestern village of al-Bayda. The number of Syrian refugees crossing into Jordan jumped nearly tenfold last week to an average 900 people per day, the Associated Press reports. The refugee flow is at its highest level in months, Jordanian officials said Monday: At the same time, the number of Syrians returning home has also surged, climbing to 600 per day, said Col. Zaher Abu-Shehab, who oversees refugee camps for the Jordanian government. Syrian families often move back and forth across the border multiple times as fighting ebbs and flows. Many find conditions in desert refugee camps in Jordan to be only marginally better than their battle-scarred homes. Refugee arrivals were high early this year but dwindled to an average of 100 per day in May and thereafter, Abu-Shehab told The Associated Press. He said up to date, there are 127,604 Syrian refugees living in Jordanian refugee camps, while hundreds of thousands more live in local communities. Ali Bibi, a liaison officer with the U.N. refugee agency, said the increased number of Syrian refugee arrival was due to the \"security situation in southern areas bordering Jordan.\" Two officers with the rebel Free Syrian Army coordinating the movement of refugees between Syria and Jordan said there were additionally thousands of refugees waiting to cross into Jordan. They said the refugees moved recently from areas in the suburbs of the Syrian capital Damascus into two villages in Syria's south, namely Tal Shahab and Zeizoon, near the Jordanian frontier. \"They are anxious about a potential U.S. strike on Syria and are now just across the border waiting to see how things will develop,\" said one of the officers, estimating their number at nearly 40,000. Read the full story here. AP has more on the UN investigation into the 21 August attack. Its update appears to be based on a close scrutiny of that photograph of the report being handed over that inadvertently revealed the first page of document (see earlier). UN inspectors said Monday there is \"clear and convincing evidence\" that chemical weapons were used on a relatively large scale in an attack last month in Syria that killed hundreds of people. The inspectors said \"the environmental, chemical and medical samples we have collected provide clear and convincing evidence that surface-to-surface rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were used ... in the Ghouta area of Damascus\" on 21 August. The report mentioned the areas of Ein Tarma, Moadamiyeh and Zamalka. \"The conclusion is that chemical weapons have been used in the ongoing conflict between the parties in the Syrian Arab Republic ... against civilians, including children, on a relatively large scale,\" the inspectors said on the first page of their report to Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon. Ban was scheduled to present the report to the UN Security Council later Monday morning. The Associated Press saw the first page of the report. Here's a roundup of the main developments on Syria so far today: \u2022 A US-Russian agreement on Syria's chemical weapons showed signs of beginning to unravel over whether the Assad regime would face the threat of force if it didn't comply. US Secretary of State John Kerry said the agreement would have no meaning unless it was backed up by a forceful UN security council resolution. \"The framework fully commits the US and Russia to impose measures under chapter 7 of the UN charter in the event of non-compliance,\" he told a news conference in Paris. But his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, said a UN resolution based on the agreement would not initially be made under chapter 7. \u2022 An eagerly-awaited report by UN investigators into last month's chemical attack in Syria is about to be presented to the security council. It is expected to implicate the Assad regime in the attack. A photo of the report being submitted by the lead investigator, \u00c5ke Sellstr\u00f6m, appeared to inadvertently reveal that it concluded sarin gas had been used. \u2022 A group of 55 doctors and medical professionals, including three Nobel prize winners, has warned that Syria's healthcare system is \"at breaking point\" because of attacks on hospitals, staff being attacked, imprisoned or fleeing the country, and humanitarian organisations being denied access to patients. In an open letter to the Lancet, they say large parts of Syria are completely cut off from any form of medical assistance. \u2022 Syria's main opposition group has rejected the Geneva chemical weapons deal claiming it will embolden the Assad regime to carry on killing civilians. The Syrian National Coalition expressed alarm at a number of crucial omissions in the agreement including the absence of any threat of force for non-compliance, and the lack of a commitment to prosecuting those who ordered chemical attacks. \u2022 Barack Obama has raised the prospect of Iran getting involved in broader talks on Syria if Tehran recognised \"that what's happening there is a train wreck that hurts not just Syrians but is destabilising the entire region\". In an interview with ABC News, Obama presented the Geneva deal on Syria's chemical weapons as an opportunity to bolster diplomacy with Tehran and invited Iranian involvement in international talks about a broader settlement to the Syrian conflict, something Washington had previously resisted. The report into last month's alleged chemical attack will be presented to the security council in the next few hours and then presented to the public by the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, the New York Times reports. The security council briefing is due to start at 11.15am EST (4.15pm BST). The Guardian's new Moscow correspondent, Shaun Walker, has more on Russia's row with the US over what was agreed about forcing Syria to comply with the agreement on chemical weapons. The Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, speaking after meeting the Egyptian foreign minister in Moscow, has rejected calls for a swift UN resolution including chapter 7, and said it was made clear in Geneva that this would not happen. \u201cIf there are problems in carrying out the conditions of the agreement, if the experts are put in danger or if anyone uses chemical weapons, then the issue will be quickly looked at by the security council \u2026 and then a new resolution could be taken, which might include chapter 7. But that would be a completely different resolution.\u201d Any resolution this week cannot include chapter 7, Lavrov insists. \u201cI am certain that despite the statements we are hearing from certain European capitals [see earlier], the American side will firmly adhere to what was agreed.\u201d Lavrov is also calling on the west to force Syrian opposition groups to attend the planned Geneva 2 conference. He says Russia is ready to start work on planning the conference immediately, and that the Syrian government has long given assurances that it would send a delegation to the conference with no conditions. \u201cI am certain that if all external participants in the drama in Syria work to include all Syrian groupings, including the government and all opposition groups, then we will achieve a result,\" he said. A UN panel investigation human rights abuses in Syria says it is looking into 14 alleged chemical attacks in Syria. The work of the Commission of Inquiry into Syria is separate from a specific UN investigation into last month's alleged attack east of Damascus, which will be published later today. The commission chairman, Paulo Pinheiro, told a news conference that the \"vast majority\" of casualties in Syria's civil war were from conventional weapons such as guns and mortars. He said his panel believed rebel groups had perpetrated war crimes but not crimes against humanity \"because there is not a clear chain of command\". Pinheiro also said Syria had invited the commission member Carla del Ponte to visit Syria in a personal capacity, but the commission wanted an official visit, including him. Del Ponte said it was assumed she had been invited because she said in May it had allegations that opposition groups had used chemical weapons. Earlier Pinheiro confirmed that his commission had found an increased in killings, crimes and other abuses by rebels, including foreign fighters invoking jihad. \"Across northern Syria, there has been an upsurge in crimes and abuses committed by extremist anti-government armed groups along with an influx of rebel foreign fighters,\" Pinheiro told the UN's human rights council. Pinheiro also said President Bashar al-Assad's government had continued a relentless campaign of air bombardment and artillery shelling across the country. The commission published its latest report last Wednesday. Russia has emerged from the talks in Geneva insisting there was no threat of force. Kerry disagrees. When asked today in Paris about whether military action would be threatened under chapter 7 of the UN charter, this is what he said: We are going to work hard to have a resolution that is as strong and forceful as possible. Russia did agree in Geneva that chapter 7 is mentioned specifically as the route for compliance if there is non-compliance or any use of chemical weapons by anyone in Syria. Under both of those circumstances, use of weapons or non-compliance, you are already automatically under chapter 7 according to the agreement we came out of Geneva with. So that mention is there. Update: Russia has already accused the US of misunderstanding the Geneva deal. Reuters quoted the foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, as saying that calls for a resolution under chapter 7 show a \"lack of understanding\". The Geneva agreement on chemical weapons is meaningless without a tough UN resolution, Kerry said. \"The announcement we made in Geneva will not have meaning until this is ratified at the United Nations in the strongest most forceful terms possible, and until it is implemented and complied with by the Assad regime,\" he told the press conference in Paris. We will not tolerate avoidance or anything less than full compliance by the Assad regime \u2026 If Assad fails in time to abide by the terms of this framework, make no mistake, we are all agreed \u2013 and that includes Russia \u2013 that there will be consequences. The framework fully commits the US and Russia to impose measures under chapter 7 of the UN charter in the event of non-compliance \u2026 President Obama has made clear that should diplomacy fail, the military option is still on the table. Kerry insisted that the Geneva agreement should be translated into a UN resolution that \"has to be strong \u2026 forceful \u2026 real \u2026 accountable \u2026 transparent \u2026 timely and enforced.\" He added: \"If the Assad regime believes this is not enforceable and that we are not serious, they will play games.\" William Hague agreed, saying: \"We now have to have a [UN] resolution which crystallises a binding commitment and makes sure that that is dealt with credibly reliable and promptly.\" John Kerry warned the Assad regime of \"consequences\" if it reneged on the terms of the Geneva deal to hand over its chemical weapons. Speaking at a press conference in Paris alongside his French and British counterparts, Kerry said: \"We will not tolerate any avoidance.\" Kerry said the UN resolution should be as forceful as possible. William Hague called for a \"binding\" UN resolution that involved the \"full weight of the UN\". France, Britain and the United States have agree to seek a \"strong and robust\" UN resolution that sets precise and binding deadlines on removal of chemical weapons, Reuters reports, citing the office of the French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande. The statement followed talks involving the foreign ministers of the three countries and Hollande in the French capital two days after Russia and the United States hammered out a deal on chemical weapons. A UN photo of Sellstr\u00f6m handing over his report into Syria's alleged chemical weapons attack could reveal tantalising hints about what it may contain before the official publication. Can you work out what it says? Eagle-eyed Denis Fitzgerald from the UN Tribune made out the phrase: \u201cThe environmental and medical samples we have collected provide clear and convincing evidence that \u2026 rockets containing the nerve agent sarin were used.\u201d A group of 55 doctors and medical professionals, including three Nobel prize winners, has warned that Syria's healthcare system is \"at breaking point\" because of attacks on hospitals, staff being attacked, imprisoned or fleeing the country, and humanitarian organisations being denied access to patients. In an open letter to the Lancet, they say large parts of Syria are completely cut off from any form of medical assistance. The signatories, who span five continents, cite figures suggesting 469 health workers are currently imprisoned and about 15,000 doctors have fled the country. In Syria's largest city, Aleppo, there are just 36 physicians, compared to 5,000 before the civil war began, they say. We are appalled by the lack of access to healthcare for affected civilians, and by the deliberate targeting of medical facilities and personnel. It is our professional, ethical, and moral duty to provide treatment and care to anyone in need. When we cannot do so personally, we are obliged to speak out in support of those risking their lives to provide life-saving assistance. Syria's main opposition group has rejected the Geneva chemical weapons deal claiming it will embolden the Assad regime to carry on killing civilians. The Syrian National Coalition expressed alarm at a number of crucial omissions in the agreement including the absence of any threat of force for non-compliance, and the lack of a commitment to prosecuting those who ordered chemical attacks. The US secretary of state, John Kerry, is meeting his British and French counterparts to try to draft a UN resolution that will hold Syria to the deal agreed in Geneva over the handover of Syria's chemical weapons. The key issue is whether they will insist that the Assad regime is threatened with force over non-compliance, as France has suggested. Russia has repeatedly indicated it would veto any UN resolution that threatened Syria with force. After thrashing out the detail of an agreement on Syria's chemical weapons, Russia's foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, pointed out that it contained no military threat. \"Nothing is said about the use of force or about any automatic sanctions. All violations should be approved by the security council,\" he said. The leading Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham said the deal was \"meaningless\" without a threat of force backed by a UN resolution. The UN inspectors' report into the attack on the eastern Damascus suburb of Ghouta has been the subject of much pre-briefing. Officials and diplomats told Foreign Policy's Cable blog that the report would point to enough circumstantial evidence to implicate the Assad regime. \"You can conclude from the type of evidence the [identity of the] author,\" it quoted one official as saying. France's foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, also suggested the report would point to Syrian government involvement. However, the investigators were not asked to assess who was to blame for the 21 August attack, but only whether chemical weapons were used. They spent just under two weeks in Syria investigating the evidence. The US, France and the UK have presented separate intelligence reports claiming the Assad regime was behind the attack. Welcome to Middle East Live. Here's a roundup of the latest developments on the crisis in Syria: \u2022 The United Nations is expected to release the much-anticipated results of an investigation into allegations of a chemical weapons attacks last month near Damascus. The lead investigator, \u00c5ke Sellstr\u00f6m, has submitted his report to the UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon. Diplomats claim the report will implicate the Assad regime in the attack. \u2022 An exchange of letters between Barack Obama and the Iranian president, Hassan Rouhani, has set the stage for the possibility of the first face-to-face encounter between a US and Iranian leader since Iran's 1979 revolution. Britain's foreign secretary, William Hague, is also due to meet his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, at the UN general assembly meeting in New York. \u2022 Obama raised the prospect of Iran getting involved in broader talks on Syria if Tehran recognised \"that what's happening there is a train wreck that hurts not just Syrians but is destabilising the entire region\". In an interview with ABC News, Obama presented the Geneva deal on Syria's chemical weapons as an opportunity to bolster diplomacy with Tehran and invited Iranian involvement in international talks about a broader settlement to the Syrian conflict, something Washington had previously resisted. \u2022 Fran\u00e7ois Hollande has defended France's hawkish approach to Syria in the face of increasing unpopularity on the issue and a perception that Paris is being marginalised by the new emphasis on diplomacy. In a TV address, he insisted that if France had not threatened force, \"Assad would have continued to threaten the population\". \u2022 France, Britain and the United States are due to meet in Paris on Monday to draft a UN resolution based on the agreement for Syria to hand over control of its chemical weapons. The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius, is then due to discuss it with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov on Tuesday. \u2022 A Syrian minister has hailed the deal on chemical weapons as \"a victory \u2026 won thanks to our Russian friends\". In the first comments from Damascus since the accord to disarm Syria of its chemical weapons, Ali Haidar paid tribute to its longstanding ally, praising \"the achievement of the Russian diplomacy and the Russian leadership\". \u2022 The man chosen by the Syrian opposition to head a government-in-waiting has pledged to confront atrocities being committed by rebel extremists. In an interview with Reuters, Ahmad Tumeh said: \"On top of the destruction and killing and displacement the regime has brought, people are now suffering from militants' behaviour' \u2026 The people pursued a basic quest for freedom [rather than] deeper despotism.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
