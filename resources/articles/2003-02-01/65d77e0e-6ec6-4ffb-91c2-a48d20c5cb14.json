The racing driver Sarel van der Merwe, who was attending the function at the match between India and Holland, said the 52-year-old lawyer 'literally fell out of his pants'. It is worth pointing out that Paarl is home to some of South Africa's finest vineyards. Sonn's England counterpart, David Morgan, was there too and apparently felt the ragged edge of Percy's lubricated tongue. Sonn, not a man to disguise his feelings, had earlier threatened to pull South Africa out of a tour of England this summer over England's refusal to play their opening match in Zimbawe, and he was keen to press the point. Again. And again - even though he had no authority to make such a threat and has since been chided by his board for doing so. Morgan, a quietly spoken Welshman new to the chairmanship of the England and Wales Cricket Board, has not been moved to comment publicly on Percy's spectacular performance, an art he is learning with disconcerting speed. Sonn, meanwhile, reached for the last vestige of his dignity in an apology released by his board on Friday. 'I realise that my conduct... fell short of standards which people find acceptable for a person in my position.' He might be surprised to learn most people hold no such illusions about self-important men in suits. Elsewhere, Sonn was more candid. 'I am a person who likes my liquor. I was not confronted [at the match] and I don't know what I was supposed to have done. If I used foul language, it was probably suitable to the circumstances.' He is also said to have remarked to another guest: 'Brother I am so fucking drunk I don't know where the fuck I am.' Unlike Shane Warne, who has apparently ingested substances of a different sort and knows only too well he is back in Australia. All of which stuff and nonsense serve only to contrast with the actual cricket in the first week of the tournament. Against all the odds, despite the best efforts of buffoons in and out of their trousers, there have been some astounding displays. And some class, too. A moment some might have missed came at The Wanderers on Tuesday when Shahid Afridi walked on one, caught behind by Adam Gilchrist off Jason Gillespie. The edge was clear but not thick (unlike some cricket administrators), yet Afridi resisted the temptation to stand and pout incredulously, which has become the norm among cricket's elite. It is hard to remember when a player last did such a thing in an international - and this was an emotion-charged game between the winners and losers of the last World Cup final. It was sad, therefore, in the same game to see Gilchrist lose it when he thought he heard his brother wicketkeeper and supposed friend Rashid Latif call him a 'white cunt' - echoes of a similar sentiment (with chromatic adjustment, obviously) expressed by Darren Lehmann about the Sri Lankans in Australia last month. Gilchrist told the team manager Steve Bernard, who told Clive Lloyd, the man who sat in judgment on Lehmann in Adelaide. Lloyd said the stump microphone could not provide conclusive evidence and dismissed the charge. Latif threatened to sue the entire Australian team - only to be told by his board that he could not. This used to be such a quiet old game, and we can only pine for the days when these tiffs were sorted out quietly - or noisily, but away from the headlines. One would hesitate to suggest the upright Gilchrist was seeking to get back at the world on behalf of Lehmann, who was suspended for his idiocy until yesterday, although the sight of an Australian objecting to being sledged at least had rare comic value. The memory that will linger longest from this match, however, was the batting of Andrew Symonds, whom many had thought fortunate to be here in the first place. He has been in wretched form all summer and, given the absence of Steve Waugh, must owe his selection to youth rather than runs. On Tuesday, the investment paid off. Symonds arrived at the crease, five down, with the tournament favourites staving off the speed of Shoaib Akhtar and the dipping, darting swerve of Wasim Akram. Unbeaten at the finish, having survived two beamers by Waqar Younis, Symonds finally looked the major talent that was first spotted when Gloucestershire registered the Birmingham-born player as an Englishman. There was hardly a false shot, and a welter of wonderful ones, all from the meat of the bat, most of them finishing up at or over the boundary, square and straight. His fielding was characteristically brilliant too. For an afternoon, we could forget about lawyers and boycotts and dithering officials. Speaking of Gloucestershire, it is to be the new home of Jonty Rhodes, who left the tournament with the safest hands in cricket cracked all over the place. It is a strong rumour that Rhodes's 'retirement', along with the impending exit of several other leading white South Africa players, represents the final protest by them against the colour quota system imposed on the national side - by Sonn, as it happens. It would be desperately sad for cricket in this country if it were so. Generally, it was good week, purposefully designed by the organisers to give the World Cup as thrilling a start as the teams could manage. West Indies beating South Africa in the last over on the first day, with Brian Lara re-emerging with a fine century, was as dramatic a start as they could have wished for. It was good to see that Lance Klusener, failing to cross when caught on the boundary and thus robbing Nicky Boje of the strike, has lost none of his capacity for boneheadedness. They're only human, though, these geniuses. Lara ran himself out cheaply in the next match, a losing effort against New Zealand at St George's Park in Port Elizabeth, and West Indies will need him to shake off his demons if they are to make the impression they are capable of here. This was New Zealand's game, though. They brought all of their bristling commitment to bear. Their fielding was near perfect, Jacob Oram pulling off a diving catch every bit as amazing as that of Glenn McGrath's against England in the Adelaide Test. If they could play like this every match, the Kiwis would go close to winning the Cup. Which, lest we forget, is what it is supposed to be about. First, we have to go through the tiresome process of shedding the lesser lights before the Super Six, and it has to be said that, for all the sympathy one felt for Kenya losing to South Africa by 10 wickets and Bangladesh doing the same thing against Sri Lanka, this is no place for also-rans. When Chaminda Vaas took a hat-trick with the first three balls of the match against Bangladesh at Pietermaritzburg Oval on Friday, it was hailed as a wondrous feat. And who would want to take it away from him? But it was difficult to dislodge the notion that it was as easy a record as he is ever likely to post in his career. Bangladesh, simply, are not worthy of their Test status, nor are they even vaguely competitive in this competition. The odd upset does wonders for the ratings but such results more often than not represent a remarkable performance on the day rather than signs of emerging development. If these teams must come to the World Cup, let them play among themselves. So, after all that excitement in the first week, we must now endure several days of what are likely to be turgid and irrelevant affairs. Apart from today's crucial Pool A match between South Africa and New Zealand, the fare on offer this week is ordinary: Pakistan v Namibia; England v Namibia; Sri Lanka v Canada; Australia v Holland. Good bets to be walkovers, all of them. Then again, there is the Upton Park factor...."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
