Prosecutors say the suspect \u2013 Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr, also known as Abu Omar \u2013 was snatched off the streets of Milan six years ago and flown to Egypt. There, he has claimed, he was tortured under interrogation. The constitutional court decided that in building up their case against the US intelligence operatives and another eight defendants the prosecutors violated state secrecy. In particular, the judges upheld objections to the use of material gathered in a raid in 2006 on an unofficial outpost of the intelligence service in Rome. The court revoked several passages in the indictment. But it was not immediately clear if their ruling would mean the trial had to be called off. The case represents the most comprehensive effort anywhere to apply the law to an alleged extraordinary rendition, in which a terrorist suspect is seized by US officials in a foreign country. In several renditions since the Bush administration launched its \"war on terror\" the suspects are alleged to have been transferred to third nations where torture was used. Among the defendants in the Milan trial is a former Italian spymaster, accused of endorsing the plot to kidnap Omar and providing facilities to the US operatives alleged to have seized him. Italy's prime minister, Silvio Berlusconi, headed a previous government at the time of Omar's disappearance. He and the head of Italy's last, centre-left administration, Romano Prodi, both endorsed challenges to the trial's legality. The court did not uphold all the state's arguments. In its one-page ruling, it said the prosecutors were entitled to order wiretaps to be put on the telephones of Italian intelligence officers. But it threw out an objection by the trial judge to a circular issued by the Berlusconi government last November reminding Italian intelligence officials who had been called as witnesses that the \"historical fact\" of the abduction was covered by state secrecy. The trial is due to resume next week. It was suspended pending a decision by the court, which has delayed its ruling several times. The Italian government denies any involvement in the abduction of Omar. The CIA has declined to comment on the case."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
