It is true that his books comprised oral testimonies of soldiers who served in 20th-century conflicts, from the world wars to the Spanish civil war, the Falklands and Northern Ireland. But as Max often pointed out, there were no commanders or generals in them, and nothing of military strategy or tactics. His fascination was with how ordinary people behave under extreme stress: how they overcome the most horrible conditions, fear and injury, and risk their lives for their brothers-in-arms. His books \u2013 of which the best known are Forgotten Voices of the Great War (2002) and Forgotten Voices of the Second World War (2004) \u2013 are about \u201cthe inside of men and the springs of their courage\u201d, as one observer, The Rev David Cooper, padre to 2 Para during the Falklands, put it. That is what gave them their universal appeal. Max, who has died aged 80, did not have a background in academia \u2013 something more traditional historians often disparaged. But what he had, in spades, was empathy and charm. In particular he knew how to make veterans talk about their experiences, often for the first time. As a friend and collaborator, I went on many trips around Britain with Max as he gathered his material. Often we would be picked up from the station by a stooped septuagenarian who, it transpired, was not the veteran, but his son. Once at the house, his ancient father might turn out to have forgotten all about his service at Ypres, or simply not feel up to talking. In these instances Max would graciously withdraw and promise to come again, without a trace of irritation for the wasted day and rail fares. More often, though, if we waited patiently enough, Max would be rewarded with the most moving stories of grit and fellowship. Once he had gently convinced the veterans that their stories really were worth telling, the memories flowed. Responding to Max\u2019s huge warmth, humour and knowledge, extraordinary tales flooded out. Afterwards, as the elderly offspring drove us back to the station, they would confide with great emotion that they had known nothing of their parent\u2019s experiences. Max was born in Shoreham, West Sussex, and never knew who his father was. His mother, Irene Costa, had fled a violent marriage in London, with Max\u2019s elder brother, Adrian, some years earlier, and the family eventually settled in Bognor Regis. A younger brother, Julian, was born soon after Max, and neither boy was ever sure of their paternity \u2013 Arthur was a surname bestowed on them by their mother. Yet despite an impoverished upbringing, Max remembered his childhood as a happy time, with a positive male role model in the form of \u201cPop Kench\u201d, the beloved leader of a local boys\u2019 club. The friendships he made at the club endured throughout his life. Money being short, all the brothers left school at 14 to help keep the family afloat. Max set aside his footballing ambitions for work on a building site. In 1960 he was among the last cohort of national servicemen to join the RAF. While it seemed bad luck at the time, it proved pivotal for his future, as his superiors recognised his intelligence and arranged for him to study for O-levels. After the RAF, Max led a peripatetic life, pursuing \u2013 and abandoning \u2013 many careers. He trained as a primary school teacher, had a brief stint as a medical student and became a mental health worker at the Maudsley hospital in London. He worked for a while as a painter and decorator, a children\u2019s entertainer, a journalist, a property developer and a keep-fit teacher. Eventually, in the late 1970s he became a singularly undistinguished actor, whose career highlights included a brief appearance on Doctor Who. It was on a train, on the way to an acting gig in February 1983, that the lightbulb moment came. He read in the paper that it was the 25th anniversary of the Munich air crash in which eight young Manchester United players had been killed. As a young fan Max had been devastated by the disaster, and on a whim he resolved to talk to every survivor of the crash, plus the mothers, managers and landladies of those who had perished, and put their stories in a book. He bought a cheap cassette player at the nearest Woolworths, and set about tracking down his interviewees. The result was The Busby Babes: Men of Magic (1983), and while he did not make any money from that first book, Max discovered his passion \u2013 and the power of his interview technique. Moving from football to the military, he spent the next 17 years compulsively collecting testimonies for books that were well received but paid little. Commercial success arrived only with the Forgotten Voices series, published with the Imperial War Museum. These books proved a publishing phenomenon, and kickstarted a fascination with oral history that continues to this day. You need only scan the military shelves of any bookshop to see how many volumes ape the style and structure of what Max began, from the format to the fonts on a thousand book jackets. In 2013 Max was appointed OBE in recognition of his services to military history. For a boy who left school at 14, it was a welcome recognition of his work, and he was impishly delighted to be able to thumb his nose to those who had dismissed him as a dilettante. Optimistic, exuberant and immensely charismatic, Max had a large circle of friends and was particularly close to Sir Martin Gilbert, another highly successful historian who was, for different reasons, also an establishment outsider. Max\u2019s relentless positivity extended to his health, which was poor for many years \u2013 he was diagnosed a decade ago with leukaemia. Yet he cheerfully outlived every prognosis, to the bafflement of his doctors, and spent the last six weeks of his life in a hospice (which he insisted on calling a spa), filling his days with visits from friends, fun and laughter. He is survived by Julian. \u2022 Max Arthur, military historian, born 25 February 1939; died 2 May 2019"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
