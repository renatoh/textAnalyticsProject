The Speaker, Michael Martin, said he had agreed \"in principle\" to a request from the prime minister, Tony Blair, for parliament to be recalled, although no date had been fixed yet. In a letter to Mr Martin, Mr Blair said he wanted, with the Speaker's permission, to recall parliament for a one-day debate on the adjournment of the house. The debate - during the week beginning September 23 - will be led by the foreign secretary, Jack Straw, but preceded by a prime ministerial statement. Mr Blair has been under mounting pressure to allow MPs to debate possible military action against Baghdad, with the Tory leader, Iain Duncan Smith, and the Liberal Democrat leader, Charles Kennedy, both giving their support to the idea. No 10 announced earlier today that Mr Blair is to brief both Mr Duncan Smith and Mr Kennedy on Iraq at Downing Street tomorrow afternoon. The Liberal Democrat conference takes place from Sunday of the week of the debate, and Mr Blair keen to publish his government's long-awaited \"dossier\" evidence against Saddam Hussein before MPs debate Iraq, probably at the beginning of the week. However, to the dismay of anti-war MPs, Downing Street made clear that there will not be a vote at the end of the debate. This official recall of parliament means that the attempts by the Labour backbencher, Graham Allen, to hold an impromptu parliament to discuss Iraq have been cancelled. In his letter to Mr Martin, Mr Blair wrote: \"As I have said in recent days, parliament must and will be at the heart of the national debate on the issue of Iraq and weapons of mass destruction, and I thought it would be helpful if I set out my thinking on the recall of parliament. \"I would like, with your permission, to recall parliament for a one-day debate on the adjournment, led by the foreign secretary, and preceded by a statement by me, during the week beginning September 23. \"By then, important discussions at the UN will have taken place. And the government will be in a position to publish the dossier that is being prepared on what we know of the Iraqi regime and its WMD programme. This should allow parliament to debate the issue with the fullest possible knowledge. \"We will discuss with your office and with other parties the best day for the recall, but our preference at this stage would be early in that week. \"I understand why members are calling for an earlier recall, and earlier publication of the dossier. I would point out that a rigorous process is being gone through to ensure that the document is as detailed and comprehensive as possible, without compromising sensitive intelligence material. \"I would also repeat that we are not at the stage of making decisions about military commitments with regard to Iraq, and that should we be so in the future, parliament would obviously be given every opportunity to express its view. \"I am copying this letter to the leaders of the other parties, and I have written to the lord chancellor in similar terms, so that he may consider the response of the House of Lords.\" The leader of the House of Commons, Robin Cook, said: \"I said last week that we were keeping the recall of parliament under review. \"When I saw the prime minister this morning, we resolved that the logical time for parliament to meet would be when the government has published its dossier on the threat from Saddam. \"The session will give MPs the opportunity to hear a statement from the prime minister and to debate the dossier.\" \u00b7 Later, government sources suggested that it was likely cabinet would meet on Monday September 23, with parliament sitting to debate Iraq on the following day, Tuesday September 24."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
