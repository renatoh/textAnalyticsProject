Powell, 72, grabbed her laptop and her border collie Jemma and drove off in a blue Prius while her husband searched for their other three dogs. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to leave without my dogs,\u201d George Powell, 74, said by phone Friday. \u201cBy the time I got on the road, this huge wall of fire was coming. Between the fire and the smoke, you couldn\u2019t see anything.\u201d He drove through burning trees until he reached a safe parking lot, where he waited for his wife. She never arrived, and he spent three days searching shelters and hospitals. The couple had met on a blind date when George was working as a photojournalist with the Los Angeles Times, and he followed her back to Albuquerque, where she was a principal flutist for the New Mexico Symphony Orchestra before her retirement. \u201cWe took one look at each other and that was it,\u201d he recalled. On Wednesday, George got a call from a detective: authorities believe his wife of 33 years drove off the side of the winding canyon road and had died after leaving her car. They asked for the name of her dentist to identify the remains. \u201cI went by her,\u201d he said, recalling his harrowing escape. \u201cIf I could have gotten out of the car, I would have gone back and died with her.\u201d A temporary respite from the weather has allowed firefighters in northern California to make progress in containing the region\u2019s deadly wildfires \u2013 and search and rescue teams to embark on the grim task of finding and identifying the dead. Thirty-five fatalities have been recorded so far, making this the deadliest week in California wildfire history. But that number could rise as search-and-rescue teams are deployed to sift through the remains of 3,500 burned buildings. \u201cWe have found bodies almost completely intact, and we have found bodies that were nothing more than ash and bones,\u201d the Sonoma County sheriff, Robert Giordano, said Thursday. With as many as 25,000 having evacuated their homes, anxious relatives began posting photographs of missing loved ones on Facebook on Monday morning. \u201cHas anyone seen my mom?\u201d Cathie Merkel, a Sebastopol resident, wrote in a Facebook post with photographs of 79-year-old Sharon Robinson. \u201cSalt and pepper hair, 79 years old. She could be at a shelter in Sonoma County.\u201d And though hundreds of missing persons reports have been resolved, stories continue to emerge of people who did not make it out alive. On Tuesday, Merkel shared a photograph of a pile of rubble where her mother\u2019s house once stood. \u201cHer car is in the garage so she either walked out, got a ride out, or is still there,\u201d she wrote. On Thursday came a final update: \u201cWe received the news today that she did not make it out of her home night of the fire \u2026 We know she found peace in her passing.\u201d On Friday, in Santa Rosa, dozens of search and rescue personnel were on site at Journey\u2019s End mobile home park, where authorities believe there may be two or three more bodies. The mobile home park catered to senior citizens, and most of the deceased who have been identified so far have been elderly. Among the first to be identified were Charles and Sara Rippey, aged 100 and 98, who had been married for 75 years and died in their home in Napa. Another elderly couple, 95-year-old Arthur Tasman Grant and 75-year-old Suiko Grant, \u201cwere not able to to escape the fires\u201d in their neighborhood of Santa Rosa, their daughter Trina wrote on Facebook. \u201cDad I know you\u2019re back flying a corsair again,\u201d Grant wrote of her navy veteran father. \u201cMom, you\u2019ll always be the most beautiful woman in the world to me.\u201d Carmen and Armando Berriz, aged 75 and 76, sheltered in the swimming pool of the Santa Rosa house they had rented for a wine country vacation as flames engulfed the neighborhood, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. Armando burned his hands holding on to the brick sides of the pool while his wife clung to her husband of 55 years. Around daybreak, as the fire began to abate, Carmen died. Armando survived, though he was badly burned, and managed to hike to safety. A few younger victims have been identified. Christina Hanson, 27, was born with a spinal defect and used a wheelchair, the San Francisco Chronicle reported. She died in her apartment in Santa Rosa. Kai Logan Shepherd, 14, died when the car his family was escaping in caught fire and the four Shepherds attempted to flee on foot, according to a family member. Sara Shepherd, 40, and her daughter Kressa, 17, were found by a neighbor lying on the ground near their Montecito county home, more than half their bodies burned. The neighbor, Paul Hanssen, found eighth-grader Kai\u2019s body further down the road. Jon Shepherd, 44, was discovered by emergency workers, also badly burned. \u201cOur minds are swirling,\u201d said Mindi Ramos, Sara\u2019s sister. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost our nephew. Everyone is in critical care right now \u2026 We don\u2019t know if they know that Kai is gone.\u201d For survivors, the path ahead will be difficult. Lynne Powell had been treated for mouth cancer in recent years, and the couple had discussed what would happen if she predeceased George Powell. She created a \u201cdoomsday file to support me in the event of her demise\u201d, George said, with important files, contacts, and financial information that he would need. But the file is gone, burned along with the house they had retired to. \u201cI have no idea if I have the will to keep living,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was the absolute love of my life.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
