According to Mourinho that fixture is Liverpool. He has demoted Chelsea to the ranks of \u201cany normal game\u201d. The ramifications of Sunday\u2019s result at Old Trafford ensure it is anything but. The United manager will find few dissenters to his argument that Chelsea\u2019s visit has lost an edge as neither team is competing for the title, despite sitting second and fourth at the start of the weekend. On a personal level he claims the memories of delivering three Premier League titles to Stamford Bridge fade with every encounter against his former club. The importance of victory over a Champions League rival and competitor has not diminished, however, not when those supporters who Mourinho claims have Liverpool\u2019s arrival on 10 March circled in their diaries are craving signs of genuine progress at Old Trafford. A six-point lead over Antonio Conte\u2019s champions with 10 league games remaining would be an encouraging step. Being level on points following a third defeat in four league outings would shift the spotlight at United away from Paul Pogba and firmly on to the club\u2019s direction under the Portuguese coach. Normal is not riding on Sunday\u2019s fixture. Mourinho maintained: \u201cIt is any normal game and probably to play Liverpool in a couple of weeks\u2019 time means more because for my club \u2013 and of course everyone knows the most important thing is not me \u2013 to play Liverpool really has a special meaning. That\u2019s the way I have to look at things. I don\u2019t have any bad feeling in relation to Chelsea to say: \u2018Oh, I\u2019m going to prove this and that against my former club.\u2019 I\u2019m not going to prove anything. In fact, every club I left \u2013 by my decision or by the board decision, and Chelsea was the only one [by the board] \u2013 I have very good feelings towards them. I\u2019ve never played against Inter since I left but I\u2019ve faced Porto, Real Madrid and Chelsea, the feeling is a good one. It\u2019s not a special thing.\u201d The United manager insists Liverpool\u2019s visit will mean more because of history and not because J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s men pose a greater threat than a Chelsea team who, like United, have suffered two defeats in their last three league games and also drew the first leg of their Champions League last-16 tie. \u201cNo, it is still three points,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the feeling for the fans, that little extra adrenaline, is not about Chelsea, it is more about Liverpool. I think Chelsea was almost winning against what just about everyone agrees is the best team in Europe in midweek. I don\u2019t think Chelsea are in bad form at all.\u201d Ander Herrera was instrumental in United\u2019s 2-0 win in the corresponding fixture last season, scoring the second and man\u2011marking Eden Hazard to telling effect in what was Chelsea\u2019s last league defeat before lifting the title. Herrera could be absent for up to six weeks with the hamstring injury he suffered at Sevilla in midweek but Mourinho claims he might not have repeated the tactic had the Spanish midfielder been available. \u201cIt was a special game in the sense that we were also trying to win the Europa League,\u201d the manager explained. \u201cWe had lots of matches and lots of tired players. In that match I chose to rest some players. Ibrahimovic was so important to us so I kept him on the bench. With so many changes we had to go for a certain strategy where we felt that with the players available Ander\u2019s job on Eden Hazard was important. He did an amazing job but these are different matches, conditions, circumstances, players. \u201cIn that match Eden Hazard was playing with Diego Costa as the No 9. In this match I don\u2019t know what they will do, but in their last match against Barcelona Hazard was the most offensive player. With different circumstances I don\u2019t think it\u2019s the same situation that Ander had on him. Of course Hazard is a very important player for them but Willian is also an important player for them. They have other players who are very important but he [Hazard] is difficult to neutralise because of his individual qualities.\u201d With Herrera sidelined and Pogba\u2019s position not guaranteed \u2013 though Mourinho praised the France international\u2019s professional reaction to being dropped against Sevilla \u2013 Scott McTominay may get another opportunity to showcase the potential that has left England and Scotland competing for his international services. The 21-year\u2011old was born in Lancaster but his father is Scottish and the midfielder has yet to confirm his allegiance. Mourinho said: \u201cI\u2019ve given him my advice but I think the advice of his parents is more important. His own heart is more important than my advice, because mine is purely from a career point of view. More important than his career is his feeling, his family\u2019s feeling and also the overall situation with him. \u201cHe\u2019s going to have a very good career independent of his international choice \u2013 if he has the choice, because maybe Scotland or England don\u2019t want to select him, which is also possible. The most important thing is for him to feel good with himself.\u201d Mourinho was asked whether he would say what he advised. \u201cNo,\u201d was the reply."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
