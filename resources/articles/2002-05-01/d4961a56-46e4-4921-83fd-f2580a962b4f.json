Over the years, it has produced such memorable fare as The Three Faces Of Eve, The Snake Pit, Spellbound, Fear Strikes Out, Charley, Rain Man and Forrest Gump. But recent times have produced a particularly bounteous harvest of works of this genre. This steadily expanding canon includes such high-profile films as Shine, in which Geoffrey Rush plays an emotionally disturbed third-rate Australian pianist who briefly achieves international stardom because the concert-going public doesn't get to hear that many emotionally disturbed third-rate Australian pianists; Fight Club, which focuses on a young man whose harmless schizophrenia devolves into full-scale insanity after he spends too much time with a lycanthropic female played by Helena Bonham Carter; The Other Sister, in which Juliette Lewis and Giovanni Ribisi play star-crossed mentally challenged lovers who have a hard time convincing Diane Keaton that they are responsible enough to share an amazingly posh San Francisco apartment; and Girl, Interrupted, in which Winona Ryder plays a suicidal young woman having difficulty regaining her psychological equilibrium in an asylum staffed by people like Vanessa Redgrave and Whoopi Goldberg. To this list one might also add two Gallic curiosities: The Messenger, which suggests that Joan of Arc, long thought to be merely loopy, was in fact completely bonkers; and Quills, which suggests that the Marquis de Sade, long thought to be completely bonkers, was in fact merely loopy. Let us also not forget Nurse Betty, starring Ren\u00e9e Zellweger as a young woman so disoriented by her thuggish husband's murder that she submerges herself in a dream world of soap operas, where the men aren't that much of an improvement; and Requiem For A Dream, starring Ellen Burstyn as a diet-pill addict and game-show junkie who suspects that her own refrigerator may be plotting to kill her. And that's without even mentioning K-Pax, showcasing Kevin Spacey as an affable lunatic who believes he hails from a distant planet where there are no lawyers; The Caveman's Valentine, starring Samuel L Jackson as a man who cannot persuade the police that he has witnessed the aftermath of a ritualistic sadomasochistic murder because the police never believe testimony about ritual sadomasochistic murders provided by middle-aged men with dreadlocks who live in a cave in Central Park and claim to be terrorised by a demon living at the top of the Chrysler Building; and A Beautiful Mind, in which Russell Crowe plays a Nobel Prize-winning schizophrenic mathematician convinced that the Russkies are poised to blow up the United States of America with atomic weapons concealed in attache cases. (Mercifully, it was not this theory that won him the Nobel Prize.) There is also a burgeoning canon of memory-loss cinema, including Memento, in which Guy Pearce plays a particularly forgetful amnesiac trying to track down his wife's killer, whose name presently escapes him; The Majestic, starring Jim Carrey as an annoying screenwriter who loses his memory and turns into an even more annoying war hero; and Mulholland Drive, starring Naomi Watts as a starry-eyed young actress who finally achieves her fantasy of sleeping with a gorgeous bisexual amnesiac who may already be dead. Of this genre, this film is by far my favourite. In many, though not all of these motion pictures, a dominant theme is that people with serious mental disorders often experience stronger, more direct feelings than the rest of us, because they live life closer to the ground and probably read fewer Margaret Drabble novels. (Actually, nobody ever mentions Margaret Drabble novels in these films, but the message is clearly implied.) The upshot is: Despite our high IQs and impressive academic credentials and perfectly adequate salaries and apparent sanity, the rest of us have much to learn from these misunderstood individuals. Though, in the case of the Marquis de Sade, you still might be reluctant to let him date your daughter. While I realise that it is somewhat unfair to lump all these films together, I do so simply to make the larger point that Hollywood seems to have mental illness or mental retardation on the brain. For the life of me I cannot imagine why. I Am Sam is the latest film to deal with the problems of the mentally challenged. A shameless tearjerker, though not an utterly mawkish sham like Garry Marshall's typically vile The Other Sister, I Am Sam stars the unpredictable Sean Penn as a Starbuck's attendant with the mental age of a seven-year-old, far below the nine normally encountered in the java-jerking industry. Beloved by friends and co-workers, Penn has hooked up with a homeless woman who quickly gives birth to a baby girl and then abandons her new family. Penn has no choice but to raise the child himself. The first few years, things go along well enough, thanks to help from sympathetic friends and neighbours - most of whom are also mentally challenged (or handicapped, or slow learners, or special-needs people, or whatever it is I'm supposed to say). But once the child (played by the delightful Dakota Fanning) starts school, the authorities step in and inform Sam that his daughter needs to be placed in a foster home. With Laura Dern, of all people. Unwilling to accept this harsh verdict, Sam launches legal proceedings to get his daughter back. In this unprecedented, seemingly quixotic quest he is assisted by Michelle Pfeiffer, who plays a hideously self-involved yuppie lawyer, who is tricked into taking him on as a pro bono client. (We know that she is horrible because she wears eyeglasses and is always yakking away on her cell phone.) While Pfeiffer's character is entirely generic, she does as much with the role as she can, and her courtroom confrontations with the cogent, believable Richard Schiff are relatively effective. While defending her blabbering, emotionally volatile client, Pfeiffer learns much about her own failings as a human being. Her relationship with her husband - a pig - is a disaster. Her pre-teen son resents the enormous amount of time and energy she devotes to her work. Slowly, this avaricious, amoral, appalling attorney comes to realise that there is a lot more to life than money, prestige and power. Hollywood loves films about avaricious, amoral, appalling people who come to realise that there is a lot more to life than money, prestige and power. For the life of me, I cannot understand why. In portraying the mentally challenged Starbucks employee, Sean Penn delivers a performance in the same general class as Dustin Hoffman's in Rain Man. That is, you admire the verisimilitude but you can't wait for him to stop acting. Pfeiffer, as noted, does her usual fine work, and Ms Fanning is one of the few tykes in recent films who is actually believable in the part she plays. (Most of her peers look like precocious lawn gnomes.) Still, I Am Sam is far too long, and its premise is absurd; Jessie Nelson, who wrote, produced and directed the film, seems to believe that banalities culled from the oppressive faux Beatle's soundtrack that dominates the film are a substitute for common sense. Not in child custody hearings. Like, duh. But even if I Am Sam were a classic, the feeling here is that we've had enough of these types of films lately and it might be time to move on to new territory. Where that territory is and what it might encompass, I can only conjecture. But a film where at least one character is not neurotic, sociopathic, retarded or insane might make a nice change. Just one. \u00b7 I Am Sam is out now"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
