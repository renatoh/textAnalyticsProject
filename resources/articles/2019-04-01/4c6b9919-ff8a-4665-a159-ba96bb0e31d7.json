The week that was It was the first full week of the campaign \u2013 but by Thursday afternoon, it felt like it wasn\u2019t. With a gradual winding down and dropping of arms agreed for Easter, week two initially spluttered into action, slumped, flickered, then hit the wall early, as both major parties settled in for the break. Last weekend was rich with gaffes: Scott Morrison said \u201cni hao\u201d (the Chinese greeting for hello) to a Korean-Australian, Peter Dutton finally apologised for comments about opponent Ali France\u2019s disability and, in better news, the seat of Chisholm hosted the first debate conducted (partly) in Mandarin \u2013 between Liberal Gladys Liu and Labor\u2019s Jennifer Yang. But the week soon petered out into a stop-start, low-stakes game. The leaders criss-crossed the country \u2013 Morrison played lawn bowls and dug up carrots and Bill Shorten roamed through food courts. The bookends came through two goodbyes. Melissa Parke stood down last weekend as Labor candidate for Julie Bishop\u2019s former seat of Curtin, and the independent South Australian senator Tim Storer announced his retirement on Thursday morning. The big issue The numbers. This was a week for the facts, the figures and the various abacuses of the public service. On Monday, the debate was around Labor\u2019s budget \u201choles\u201d, and the health minister, Greg Hunt, produced a departmental estimate that Labor\u2019s centrepiece cancer policy was $4.5bn short. This turned out to be an estimate for free treatment for everyone \u2013 which Labor\u2019s policy does not actually promise. Labor returned fire after Pefo (the Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlook) arrived, using an earlier Grattan report that suggested the government would need to cut expenditure by $40bn a year by 2029-30 to meet its budget aims. But the week was more about things people could not remember or get a grip on. On Tuesday, Shorten forgot that Labor would actually be introducing changes to superannuation, and on Wednesday, the Liberal MP Michelle Landry said she didn\u2019t how much Adani donated to her campaign. Good week for \u2026 Josh Frydenberg. But thanks only to the self-inflicted car-crash interview from the GetUp director, Paul Oosting, who in trying to identify Frydenberg as a key plotter in the Liberal spill, ended up flubbing his lines. Frydenberg received a short-lived promotion when Oosting accidentally called him \u201cdeputy prime minister\u201d on Melbourne ABC radio. After being corrected, Oosting then called him \u201cthe finance minister\u201d, which is also wrong. Eventually, the treasurer was exonerated from any role in the spill, and GetUp removed that line of attack from its campaign material in his seat of Kooyong. Bad week for \u2026 Gladys Liu. The Liberal candidate for the marginal Victorian seat of Chisholm was caught out erroneously claiming she was misquoted, after audio was released of an interview from 2016. At a debate on Sunday, Liu said she had been misrepresented in a 2016 Guardian Australia article, where she said the Chinese community opposed same-sex marriage. But after audio was uploaded, she cancelled an interview on Sky News, the former Liberal senator Arthur Sinodinos called it \u201ca rookie error\u201d, and her immediate predecessor in Chisholm, Julia Banks, blasted the original comments as \u201ccompletely abhorrent\u201d. Meme warfare It was also a bad week for the in-house social media teams of both main parties. A very poor photoshop from Labor put Scott Morrison\u2019s head, unconvincingly, on to a dinosaur for 15 seconds. On Saturday, Tony Abbott\u2019s team decided to upload a picture of the News Corp columnist Piers Akerman in a campaign shirt, before deleting it. Some laughs were had when Bill Shorten bafflingly asked an adult man if he was \u201chaving an OK school holidays\u201d. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t affect me,\u201d he replied. Finally, back to Warringah, where most of Tuesday was spent making fun of Abbott\u2019s announcement that he would lead the Liberal party again, if asked to do so. Campaign dog of the week Scott Morrison and the Liberal MP Luke Howarth met a St Bernard named Mouse in Brisbane on Sunday. They said it I\u2019m only sorry I didn\u2019t bring a pocket of nails today, because with this soil I could have easily thrown them into the ground and grown crowbars ~ Michael McCormack practises his standup set in Tasmania In case you missed it in the Guardian Our Queensland correspondent, Ben Smee, visited several seats in the state\u2019s central belt, where voters are at the sharp end of the national debate about jobs, coal and climate change. One farmer in beef country outside Rockhampton said: \u201cPauline Hanson has got a really big hook in this area because she says the sorts of things that people want to hear, that other politicians are scared to say.\u201d Christopher Knaus reported that the Liberal MP Jason Wood gave a $1.5m novelty cheque to a sports club in his marginal seat, despite the club being told by the deputy deputy prime minister, Michael McCormack, that the funds were yet to be approved. And political editor Katharine Murphy analysed the meaning behind Scott Morrison\u2019s apparently bland slogan about getting a fair go. \u201cBy his own account, the fair go has some footnotes attached to it. The fair go applies if you have a go and if you don\u2019t seek to \u2018take\u2019 a contribution. It doesn\u2019t automatically apply to everyone equally.\u201d What we read elsewhere A story from Anthony Galloway and Rob Harris in the Herald Sun revealed that the Nationals MP George Christensen charged taxpayers $3,000 for domestic flights en route to flights to the Philippines to visit his fiancee. Michael Slezak and Stephen Long at the ABC obtained handwritten notes that appeared to contradict the government\u2019s claim that Adani \u201caccepted in full\u201d advice and recommendations from the CSIRO. What do the polls say? There was just one national poll this week, Monday\u2019s Newspoll, which had the two main parties unchanged on 52%-48% in Labor\u2019s favour, two-party-preferred. But it showed a sharp drop in the primary vote for One Nation, to just 4%, which could have huge ramifications for the lower and upper house if replicated in actual votes on 18 May. Coming up The Easter break and then Anzac Day next Thursday creates a sandwich of becalmed air that promises to provide low activity next week. However, expect things to heat up from 26 April.
