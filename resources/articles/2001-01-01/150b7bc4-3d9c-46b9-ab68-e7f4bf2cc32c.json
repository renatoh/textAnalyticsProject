Different media are complementary and of excellent quality. The search facility helps pupils not only to compare but also, through the note-making facility, to synthesise information, so they are encouraged to think through their own ideas. This is an appropriate and convenient study aid, highly recommended. A copy held in the library would be of benefit to groups of up to three students studying at their own pace. \u0095 Read full evaluations of these programs at www.teem.org.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
