Clearly City cannot be blamed for scoring six, but the goals were the glue that held together an extremely fragile team fabric and on this evidence it would come as no great surprise if Kevin Keegan's team conceded half a dozen at Chelsea next Saturday. There was little internal cohesion, notably in the first half when Bolton should have established a significant lead. Bolton's crime was that after Sylvain Distin had put City ahead just after half-time they immediately began to chase the game, leaving rolling meadows of space at the back which Nicolas Anelka gambolled over with unfettered delight. What should have been Shaun Wright-Phillips's day came to a joyless conclusion when he raised his foot on Simon Charlton. The City midfielder had taken both his goals well but this was an act of crass stupidity which, if his foot had been a little higher, could have ended Charlton's season. \"He's not a dirty player but now he will be out for three matches and someone else will get their chance,\" said Keegan, who believes Wright-Phillips has the capability to play for England, although it is not only the mental side of his game which remains undisciplined. In this respect he has much to learn from Anelka - not a suggestion that might have been made two or three years ago. \"This is the way it is going to be this year,\" said Keegan, although he was not referring to either this sudden splurge of goals or the continuing vulnerability of his defence. Rather he was stressing the need to conserve and preserve the energies of his players - Trevor Sinclair and Paulo Wanchope were rested and Steve McManaman was replaced after 12 minutes of the second half. These days it is called rotation, although there are those within the club who are more inclined to regard it as tinkering. The Keegan dissenters argue that the signing of McManaman and Claudio Reyna has confused rather than clarified the midfield selection, whereas a defence that needed strengthening has remained largely unchanged. Bolton's second-half spiral was all the more alarming for their manager Sam Allardyce because he believed he had eradicated defensive naivety of the sort that has afflicted Keegan's teams. If anything Bolton have erred on the side of negativity in their attempts to stabilise their Premiership status. But there was considerable glee in the new stadium among the City fans. \"We've got to get them going while they find their way around this stadium,\" said Keegan. The same might be said of his players. Man of the match: Nicolas Anelka (Manchester City)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
