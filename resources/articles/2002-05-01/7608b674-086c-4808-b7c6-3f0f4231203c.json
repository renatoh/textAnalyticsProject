In comparison, hungry students can't be blamed for treating company presentations on campus in a similar way. However, campus visits by employers are a great opportunity to find out more about a company and the jobs it has on offer. It's also a unique chance to mingle with company employees and make an impression. Some universities host more than 100 company presentations a year and it won't be possible for undergraduates to attend them all, so they need to be discerning about which ones they choose to attend. But once you have singled out the presentations you want to attend, how should you prepare? Should you invest precious time conducting in-depth research to find out as much as you can about the company before introducing yourself? That depends on what you want from the presentation says Tony Butler, director of the careers service at Oxford University. \"If you just want to find out information about the company and the types of jobs it has on offer, then there's no need to do detailed research, but if you are genuinely interested in working for the company, then you ought to do your homework on them,\" he explains. Tony advises finding out which jobs are available, what skills the company is looking for and whether you fulfil their criteria. There's no single technique to employ, but a grounding in the company's current activities and fortunes means you will be able to talk confidently and knowledgeably about the company and demonstrate that you're keen and interested. Sam Caine, graduate recruitment manager for Tesco, agrees. \"I think it's important that undergraduates do some research before attending company presentations. Some universities have hundreds of company presentations and if graduates don't research and select the companies whose presentations they want to attend, they could be overwhelmed,\" she says. That's fine if you've already decided upon a career path, but if you are still unsure of what you want to do and are considering several types of occupations in different industries, then company presentations can, says Keith Dugdale, director of graduate recruitment at KPMG, be an effective information-gathering exercise. \"However, if you know what you want to do, do your research and are really clued up, company presentations are a great opportunity to network and make an impression,\" he says. When the presentation comes around, rather than singling out a particular represenative, aim to speak to as many people as possible - not just recent graduates, but graduates who are four or five years into their careers as well as senior managers. Sam Caine cautions against button-holing a senior manager to try and impress them. \"Employees are the true representation of a company's culture and if I were an undergraduate attending a company presentation and I had an idea of the areas in which I wanted to work, I would seek out and speak to people who work in these areas. Then I'd try to speak to people who work in completely different areas to get a balanced picture of the company, its culture and the types of job they have. \"Also undergraduates shouldn't feel that they need to ask questions all the time. If you feel that you've run out of questions, then stand aside and listen to other conversations going on because you can learn a lot from the questions asked by other students.\" Are company presentations a good time and place to hand out CVs or completed application forms? \"That depends on the company,\" says Tony Butler. \"Some employers like collecting CVs but it may not be appropriate in all situations.\" Sam Caine advises checking with the company to find out their policy on receiving applications. Keith Dugdale agrees: \"At KPMG we wouldn't accept an application form at a company presentation since all applications have to be made online.\" Knowing the company's policy regarding applications will prevent you from doing the wrong thing - but being knowledgeable and confident (without being arrogant) could result in you making such an impression that you may be offered an interview. \"Company presentations are an excellent opportunity for undergraduates to meet with company employees at different levels and stages in their career and if a candidate is exceptional and makes a good impression, then we may make a note of their name and consider fast tracking them through to our final stage assessment centre,\" says Keith. However, Lea Brindle, a business psychologist, points out that making an impression is a fine balance: \"You don't want to appear too pushy. Undergraduates should see this as an opportunity to practice their networking skills and view it as a rehearsal for future interviews.\" tolaawogbamiye@hotmail.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
