So don't let your heart sink if your first big task is to write a report. It's likely to be read by a whole raft of people - and that could include the managing director. But forget all those essays you wrote at university; there's no room for waffle here. Nor is this your opportunity to prove that you're the next Zadie Smith. Stick to the rules of report writing and you'll stand out from the rest of your colleagues. \"A great deal of thinking should go into the report before you actually start to write anything,\" says Park Sims, adviser to Industrial Society Learning and Development and a director of Park Sims Associates. Regardless of the content, all reports should contain certain elements. Structure \"Any report no matter how brief should have an introduction, body and closing,\" says Park. \"If you work for a particularly large organisation, chances are they have a particular way that a report should be written in terms of format and layout. Without headings and subheadings it's like a motorway without road signs. You're in there, going like hell, you don't know where you've been, where you're going and you don't know what's coming next. The headings guide the reader and steer them to the part that they might be interested in.\" Audience assessment \"You cannot overestimate the importance of audience analysis,\" says Park. \"Are they friends or enemies, competitors or customers? All that will influence mightily what level of detail you go into and what language and style of writing you use. What do they know about the subject already? Can you use jargon?\" And if it's for a select audience only? \"If it's highly confidential and you're worried about it being leaked, you should write it on a secure computer and mark it 'company confidential'.\" The body You need to make clear to the reader why it is being written, what it talks about and then give an overview to say what's coming next. Writing the main body of the report tends to cause a lot of anxiety but there's a straightforward way to overcome that. \"You just write,\" says Park. \"Use the smallest word and simplest sentences.\" Plain English is crucial to clarity and readability. Don't even think about editing until you've got all the writing down. Stream of consciousness is the key to success here. Edit and finish Once you've written all that you need to, check for wordiness, incorrect spelling and ungrammatical sentences. Move things around and don't repeat the same word too often. \"It should also look professional and inviting to the reader,\" says Park, \"which means that the layout of the page should not be wall-to-wall, floor-to-ceiling small print, so that it looks like some kind of legal tome.\" To make the information easier on the eye, he suggests bullet points and indentations. \"Put a cover on it, a title page, a table of contents, glossary of terms, an index, appendices, lists of figures, acknowledgement references and footnotes.\" And don't overdo the diagrams. Executive summary \"This should be a separate document though some organisations like it to be at the front of the report,\" he says. Park suggests writing no more than one side of A4 so it's easy to photocopy and circulate. The summary should tell the reader why the report was written and what the findings, conclusions and recommendations are. \"It's designed for people who don't have time or inclination to read the whole report. People don't read reports unless they've got nothing better to do.\" Common mistakes Many problems arise when the report is not sufficiently planned, says Park. \"People start to throw ink or rather their finger tips at the key board before they've thought through the planning stage. That's probably the most common mistake. Alternatively people don't conclude properly. \"They are so relieved to finish the report, they don't bother to go back and fine tune it.\" He recommends that when a document is finished it should be put away and returned to at a later date so you can view it more objectively. \"Report writing is not meant to be particularly creative,\" says Park. \"It's meant to report the facts in a simple, straightforward way that people can read, digest and use easily.\" And the secret to good report writing, he believes, is to have a system. Plan, write and polish - and don't allow those activities to overlap too much. hainsworth357@hotmail.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
