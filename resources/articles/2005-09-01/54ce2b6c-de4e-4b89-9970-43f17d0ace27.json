Simon Cawkwell, known in the market as Evil Knievil, has made a name for himself in the City as a \"bear raider\" - pricking stock market bubbles by selling shares short. He shot to fame by picking a fight with Robert Maxwell over the finances of his media empire. Last year, however, he switched sides and took up his first position on the board of a plc, as deputy chairman of Tajikistan gold prospector Kryso Resources when it floated on Aim at 10p, valuing the business at \u00a36m. On September 7 Mr Cawkwell was ousted from the company after a row with Kryso's financial adviser Ruegg &amp; Co over his share dealings. Mr Cawkwell bought 100,000 shares in the company at 11p on August 26 and a further 250,000 at 11.3p four days later. The shares were held on trust for his brother-in-law. The company's financial year ended on July 31 and it is expected to report annual results tomorrow, meaning the trades were carried out within the company's closed period. A penitent Mr Cawkwell admitted yesterday: \"The essence of it is that I made a mistake. I should have checked with the nominated adviser before dealing.\" He said he had not checked with adviser Brett Miller of Ruegg &amp; Co because the two had developed a personal animosity during Kryso's flotation. Asked whether he would like to become the director of another company, Mr Cawkwell said: \"I would if I was invited. But after this I am unlikely to be invited.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
