Nicky Henderson, Binocular's trainer, was forced to scratch him from the feature event on the first day of the Festival when it became clear that he would fail a post-race drugs tests if he took part. The gelding, who was found to be suffering from an allergic reaction two weeks ago, had been treated with a steroid, believed to be cortisone, which had failed to clear his system as expected. Punters had been backing Binocular for the Champion Hurdle almost from the moment when he passed the post 12 months ago. Most bookmakers have been offering a \"non-runner, no bet\" concession on Festival bets for the last seven days and will refund all bets placed in that time, while several firms, including William Hill, Bet365 and Paddy Power, also agreed to refund all bets on Binocular as a goodwill gesture. Long-range bets are normally placed and accepted on the basis that a non-runner is a loser, however, and the sudden disappearance of Binocular from the Champion Hurdle will leave many backers out of pocket. It will come as a greater shock since Henderson, who writes a weekly column for the Racing Post and also appeared at a Festival preview event at Sandown on Saturday night, had not reported any problems with Binocular before Sunday morning. \"Binocular was probably the best-backed horse in the runup to this year's Festival,\" Simon Clare, spokesman for Coral bookmakers, said. \"The big races attract all the money before Cheltenham, and Binocular had been shortening in the market very steadily over the last couple of months. If you'd had to single out one horse that would be the biggest kick in the solar plexus for punters if it came out, it would have been Binocular.\" Henderson would have expected to overtake Paul Nicholls, the current leader in the trainers' championship, had Binocular won the Champion Hurdle."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
