Shaw is commercial director for G4S, which provides security services for the British embassy, but he works on the wider Afghanistan team and not on the Foreign Office contract (New anti-corruption court hauls in British security manager, 26 March, page 28). \u2022\u2008An article about a visit by Prince Charles to British troops serving in Afghanistan described him as being commander-in-chief of a number of regiments. He is, rather, colonel-in-chief, as he correctly described himself in a direct quote (Charles: Troops in Afghanistan 'having a bloody awful time', 26 March, page 8). \u2022\u2008A report about the Lost Man Booker prize, a one-off award to honour books published in 1970 which were not eligible for consideration for the Booker due to a change in entry criteria, listed Patrick White and JG Farrell among the authors shortlisted. An accompanying panel had two photographs of JG Farrell; one was correctly captioned but the other was labelled as showing Patrick White (Spark gets posthumous stab at Booker for 1970 novel, 26 March, page 24)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
