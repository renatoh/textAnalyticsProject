Prince Andrew\u2019s bizarre defence that he chose to stay at convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s home because it was \u201cconvenient\u201d and \u201chonourable\u201d has gone down badly in the court of public opinion. And now his defence of their relationship and his explanations for where he was on key dates when he is alleged to have had sex with women procured by Epstein has met similar derision. The prince was confronted about his relationship with the financier: why did he visit him in New York in 2010, despite knowing Epstein had been convicted of sex offences against underage girls? Did he know Epstein was still committing offences against children then? And had he himself had sex at several of Epstein\u2019s houses with Virginia Giuffre, then known as Virginia Roberts, when she was 17? She claims in court papers she was trafficked and forced to have sex with the prince. He seemed unconcerned by the seriousness of the matter, laughing and smiling at several points during the interview \u2013 including when Maitlis reminded him that Epstein was dead \u2013 and expressed no regrets or concern about Epstein\u2019s victims. No, the duke said repeatedly, he had not slept with Roberts. \u201cI have no recollection of ever meeting this lady, none whatsoever.\u201d He later added: \u201cIt just never happened\u201d, saying: \u201cI am not one to, as it were, hug, and public displays of affection are not something that I do.\u201d His relationship with Epstein was based entirely on the fact that he was the boyfriend of the prince\u2019s friend Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late newspaper tycoon Robert Maxwell. Epstein was \u201ca plus one\u201d who was invited to various royal events. It had been \u201cbeneficial\u201d to know him, he told Maitlis, in one of several exchanges that provoked astonishment from viewers. She asked if he felt any \u201cguilt, regret or shame\u201d about his behaviour or friendship with Epstein. The prince did not. He said only that it was \u201cthe wrong decision to go and see him in 2010\u201d. He went on: \u201cDo I regret the fact that he has quite obviously conducted himself in a manner unbecoming? Yes...\u201d Maitlis interrupted, with visible amazement: \u201cUnbecoming? He was a sex offender.\u201d \u201cYeah, I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m being polite \u2013 I mean in the sense that he was a sex offender,\u201d the prince replied, before continuing his justification for remaining in contact with Epstein until 2010. The prince insisted that, as patron of the NSPCC\u2019s Full Stop campaign, he \u201cknew what the things were to look for\u201d when it came to sexual abuse. But later in the interview, when asked about his time in Epstein\u2019s properties, he said there was \u201cabsolutely no indication\u201d that anything was going on. Epstein must have concealed his activities, the prince explained, and suggested that his status as a member of the royal family meant he was used to \u201cmembers of staff\u201d being around the building. The prince\u2019s answers are likely to ensure he remains in the headlines for the conceivable future, and several commentators have condemned his approach. Catherine Mayer, founder of the Women\u2019s Equality Party, tweeted that the prince was \u201ctoo stupid to even pretend concern for Epstein\u2019s victims\u201d. Charlie Proctor, editor of the Royal Central website, said: \u201cI expected a train wreck. That was a plane crashing into an oil tanker, causing a tsunami, triggering a nuclear explosion level bad.\u201d It is known that some close to the prince had reservations about how the interview \u2013 reportedly the result of six months of negotiations with the royal household \u2013 would play out. Jason Stein, who previously worked for the former work and pensions secretary Amber Rudd, recently quit as an adviser to the prince after less than a month. It is understood he had disagreed with the decision to go ahead with the interview. It is claimed that the prince sought permission from the Queen before giving it, and that she gave her consent early last week. In the interview, the prince said that with \u201chindsight\u201d his decision to stay at Epstein\u2019s house was \u201cdefinitely the wrong thing to do\u201d. Giuffre\u2019s lawyers did not respond to requests for comment but her Twitter account retweeted a comment from the former editor of the Northern Echo, Peter Barron, who said: \u201cAstonishing decision by the royal family to go ahead with this Prince Andrew confessional interview in the hope it would draw a line under the scandal. It will have the opposite effect.\u201d It is the first time the prince has answered questions on his relationship with Epstein, who was found dead in his Manhattan jail cell in August. In 2015, Prince Andrew used a public appearance at Davos in Switzerland to deny the claims. In 2010, he had been photographed walking with Epstein in New York\u2019s Central Park \u2013 two years after Epstein\u2019s first conviction for soliciting a minor for prostitution. Addressing his decision to stay with Epstein following the financier\u2019s conviction in 2008, the prince said: \u201cThat\u2019s the bit that \u2026 as it were, I kick myself for on a daily basis because it was not something that was becoming of a member of the royal family, and we try and uphold the highest standards and practices and I let the side down, simple as that.\u201d The prince denied his relationship with Epstein had damaged the monarch. \u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u2019s been damaging to the Queen at all \u2013 it has to me, and it\u2019s been a constant drip, if you see what I mean.\u201d Giuffre\u2019s lawyer, Jack Scarola, told Mail Online the prince should agree to an interview \u201cunder oath\u201d instead of giving statements to the media that carry \u201clittle weight\u201d. He said: \u201cI believe there is an ongoing investigation in New York by the FBI under the supervision of the US Attorney\u2019s office into those involved in facilitating Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s abuse. \u201cI would love to see Prince Andrew submit to an interview under oath with the investigating authorities. Talking to the media doesn\u2019t quite cut it. Statements that are not under oath carry little weight.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 18 and 22 November 2019: to correct a description of Epstein\u2019s offending; and to remove an implication that the prince went to university \u2013 he went to naval college."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
