But in the simpler time before football and society were placed into suspended animation, Jota looked to be building towards something sensational. His devastating bursts from the left side of Wolves\u2019 attacks brought six goals in five matches before the hiatus, taking his tally for the season to 15 goals. Wolves were well placed in both the Premier League and the Europa League. Then the whole world pressed pause and none of that was important. Jota has no complaints, he understands. As he and everyone else wait for the pandemic to subside, the 23-year-old agreed to reflect on his career and the season so far. What harm can that do? He talked about his and Wolves\u2019 improvement, as well as Liverpool\u2019s title credentials and the unique impact made by his Portuguese compatriot Bruno Fernandes at Manchester United. First, though, he said how strange it is to be so far from his family in Portugal at a time of crisis while acknowledging he has a lot for which to be thankful, nonetheless. \u201cIf I was in Portugal it might be even more difficult to manage, as I would be closer to them and the temptation to have social contacts would be greater,\u201d he said. \u201cBeing here, that is harder, and [staying indoors] is what we must do. I obviously hope my family does not receive bad news and I try to pass on to them all the messages that I get from the club: to avoid leaving home unless it is extremely necessary. The goal is for us all to be together again once this situation ends.\u201d Wolves were the first top-flight club to close their stadium following the suspension of the league with their chairman, Jeff Shi, saying his ties to China made him \u201cacutely aware\u201d of the dangers of the coronavirus and immediately pledging to ensure all staff continue to be paid throughout this \u201cperiod of uncertainty\u201d. The company that owns the club, Fosun, donated 2,300 coverall and face masks to local hospitals. The players, meanwhile, have been benefiting from an enviable level of care. \u201cThe club have helped us in everything,\u201d said Jota. \u201cThe club managed to find a basket with all kinds of food, so we don\u2019t have to go shopping. And in the medical area, we were given a kit with everything we need. I\u2019m talking about masks, hand sanitiser and everything. The club does everything in their power so that we don\u2019t miss anything.\u201d As for keeping fit before the notional resumption of the season, \u201cthe coaching staff drew up a plan for this first stage, which is said to last until the end of April but from the looks of it, it will last beyond that\u201d, Jota told the Portuguese newspaper Record. \u201cWe have an individual work plan, with the idea of being as close to our best shape as possible.\u201d For Jota, football is a passion that never stops. So during his confinement he has been playing a virtual version of it. \u201cI happen to be training Telford United on Football Manager. I\u2019m already in 2029.\u201d Being a playtime coach makes him appreciate all the more the work that Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo and Wolves\u2019 backroom have done in real life to lift the club to where they are now from the Championship, which is where they were when Jota joined from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 2017, initially on loan. \u201cDetaching myself from it, you understand more clearly why this and that happened the way it did,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is clearly influence from the coaching staff. From the physical part, where Antonio [Dias] helps us a lot. Then we have a mental coach, Julio [Figueroa], who helps us a lot too. We know that for every problem we face we will always have someone related to that specific area who can help us. \u201cFor example, if we look at last season compared to this one, we see that we have been changing the tactical system a few times, adapting to the opposing teams, taking away from them any chance of breaking our system. And with these systems enhancing our qualities, we players have to adapt and help the team as well as possible.\u201d Jota also admires work done at other clubs. He would have no quibble with Liverpool being crowned champions if this season were to be cancelled. \u201cIf we were to have the misfortune of not being able to end the season, I think that few people would oppose this. Of course, there are always rival clubs that could be against that but I think 95% of people would agree. For me they would be fair champions.\u201d Which is not to say that Liverpool are his favourite Merseyside club. When he was growing up in Portugal, the English team he most enjoyed watching wore blue. \u201cI loved to watch Everton play, especially when they were playing at home. It was not a club that fought for the title but that always made life very complicated for the big teams. And I loved that drive and competitiveness. They were relentless.\u201d Attitude is a quality Jota cherishes as much as skill. He reckons Fernandes, for instance, has uplifted Manchester United by inspiring the club\u2019s other players to raise their standards. \u201cI don\u2019t know if he is the best [player at United] but he\u2019s the most ambitious. And that makes a difference. \u201cYou can clearly see the difference between United with and without Bruno Fernandes. He takes on the responsibility and aspires for more than what they are doing. I think they owe him a lot already. And that is not only related to his quality, but also to his ambition and personality.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
