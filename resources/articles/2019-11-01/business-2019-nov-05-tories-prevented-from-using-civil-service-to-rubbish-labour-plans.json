Forcing a dramatic climbdown before the general election, Britain\u2019s highest-ranking civil servant, Mark Sedwill, ruled that the publication of Treasury analysis with only weeks to go before the 12 December poll would be improper. Government sources said the cabinet secretary blocked the documents being released after a last-minute call with the shadow chancellor, amid criticism that the civil service was being used for political aims in close proximity to the election. The intervention, which is understood to have enraged the chancellor, Sajid Javid, effectively blows apart Conservative plans to open their election campaign with a blitz of attacks on Labour\u2019s economic credibility. Sources said the Treasury analysis had been completed after weeks of work, while Javid is understood to have been so confident it would be released that he told the cabinet on Tuesday morning it would be published in the afternoon. However, opposition sources said the government had instead been slapped down by civil service mandarins, to force a U-turn before the election campaign gets underway. A Labour source said: \u201cThis is an embarrassing slapdown to Tory ministers who were blatantly trying to use the civil service for political purposes.\u201d McDonnell is believed to have personally complained to the Treasury\u2019s most senior mandarin, Sir Tom Scholar, hours before the planned launch of the costings, about the use of the civil service for political ends . The shadow chancellor made the complaint after weekend press reports said the Conservatives would publish official costings of Labour\u2019s spending plans on Tuesday \u2013 the last day before purdah pre-election restrictions on the use of the civil service come into force. Labour\u2019s legal team also wrote to Treasury civil servants to complain about the \u201cethics and propriety\u201d around publishing the analysis. After the complaint from the shadow chancellor, the Cabinet Office wrote in an email to the Labour party, seen by the Guardian: \u201cTo confirm our conversation, these costings will not be published.\u201d McDonnell said he warned the civil service that the Conservatives\u2019 exercise was an abuse of power, telling the Independent: \u201cI said first of all\u2026 you do not know what is in the manifesto so that is pure speculation. Secondly, this being done within hours of the formal campaign being undertaken. Thirdly, I think it\u2019s an abuse of power.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m happy for anyone to examine our policies, but to do this hours before a general election campaign is I think an abuse of power. Unacceptable.\u201d Previous governments have used the Treasury machine to criticise opposition party spending plans. George Osborne used a dossier of civil service reports to attack Ed Miliband\u2019s policies in 2015, although its publication was in the January of that year, significantly ahead of the May 2015 election. Labour has ramped up its policy announcements in recent days, including promises to end rough sleeping and a pledge to remove all traces of privatisation from the NHS. Labour\u2019s plans for wide-scale nationalisation came under scrutiny last month from the Confederation of British Industry, which warned the scheme would cost almost \u00a3200bn. The lobby group was later criticised for exaggerating its analysis. Earlier on Tuesday, Labour\u2019s proposals for a four-day week with no loss of pay was given a \u00a317bn price tag by the Centre for Policy Studies, a centre-right thinktank. Both Labour and the Conservatives have yet to publish manifestos with their full spending proposals ahead of the election. While the Tories were hoping to attack Labour\u2019s economic record, Boris Johnson\u2019s party has also faced criticism over its proposals to loosen the government purse strings. The Resolution Foundation thinktank said earlier this week that spending sprees aimed at ending austerity were central to the plans of both major parties and would drive spending up to levels last seen in the 1970s."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
