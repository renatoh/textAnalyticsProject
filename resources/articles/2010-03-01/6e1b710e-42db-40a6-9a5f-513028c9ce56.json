Obviously, it can't single-handed. But what it can do, as this vigorous if unsubtle play by Anders Lustgarten proves, is expose the gulf between the party's emollient tactics and its extremist views. Lustgarten's play depends upon two rather shaky propositions. One is that a discontented old Marxist militant would be naive enough to fall for BNP propaganda and become a party agent. The other \u2013 harder to believe \u2013 is that the BNP would field a mixed-race, female candidate. But, even if the play is built on wobbly foundations, it successfully punctures the divisions within the BNP. Gina, the candidate, wants to appeal to traditional notions of patriotism. The party leader suggests that political speeches are like erotic films: you hint at the naughty bits without revealing them. Meanwhile, the regional boss is an unreconstructed racist who fantasises about a return to an all-white Britain. David Edgar's Destiny, which explored the muddled motives that drive people into ultra-right groups, remains the best play on the subject. But Lustgarten latches on to something important: the ability of the BNP to shift its stance depending on its audience. The party leader privately talks of \"third world sewage\", but one of the best scenes shows Pete, the Marxist convert, gaining new recruits by leading a community rubbish-clearing day. Ryan McBryde's production, though a bit shouty, contains good performances. Though no play can \"beat\" the BNP, this play confirms it would be crazy for theatre to bury its head in the sand."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
