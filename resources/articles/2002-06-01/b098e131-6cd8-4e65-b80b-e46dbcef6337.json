While 52% of teachers currently leave the profession within three years of qualifying, only 13% of those who take a year out to travel and work abroad leave the profession after 10 years. The study has been launched in conjunction with a campaign by the overseas voluntary work charity, VSO, calling for extended sabbatical leave for teachers. Glenda Smith, VSO education advisor, said that they were advocating \"time out, not burn out\". \"Paradoxically, letting teachers leave the classroom for one year may be the thing that keeps them in there long term,\" she explained. Richard Ewen, head teacher at Islington Arts and Media School in London, said that he was offering his full support following the return of two of his staff from VSO sabbaticals abroad. \"They have learnt so much from voluntary work experience, particularly about classroom management and professional teaching skills. I think they bring back with them confidence to issues relating to classroom management and broader strategies for dealing with behaviour and learning in the classroom situation. \"I think it can have a positive effect on retention because it gives teachers opportunity to broaden their experience and to return with a renewed commitment to the profession and the importance of education in the lives of all children.\" VSO offer placements for techers in classrooms in 60 countries, mainly in Asia in Africa. Teachers with a couple of years experience can take on teacher training roles in schools or within regions. Others opt to work in policy. One teacher on a VSO placement is currently developing an education policy for girls in the ministry of education in Gambia."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
