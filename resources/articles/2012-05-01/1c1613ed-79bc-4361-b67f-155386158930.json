The report by the National Housing Federation, Shelter and the Chartered Institute of Housing highlights areas where the coalition is in charge of deteriorating housing conditions. It points out that while there has been a small increase in new builds, the 109,020 completed homes in 2011 is almost 40% below the 2007 peak of 175,560 \u2013 and less than half the number the government admits would be required annually to meet demand. The knock-on effects are that poorer people will find it harder to pay for a roof over their head as the combination of rising rents and falling benefits make housing less affordable. Homelessness is also increasing. The number of councils' \"acceptances\" of homeless households reached 12,830 in the final quarter of 2011 \u2013 up 27% from the period during which the government came to power. The report also says that overcrowding is becoming an issue - with more families squeezed into ever smaller spaces. The report, for the first time, says the number of households living in overcrowded conditions continues to rise, from 630,000 in 2009-10 to 655,000 in 2010-11. The authors argue that building more homes would also boost the economy \u2013 crucial at a time when the country has entered a double dip recession. Grainia Long, chief executive of the Chartered Institute of Housing, said the \"government needs to step up its efforts in response and be more ambitious in its strategy to boost housing supply and activity in the wider housing sector. Addressing the housing crisis in this way would also be a much-needed and powerful stimulus to economic growth.\" Charities that backed the report were more critical of government strategy. Kay Boycott, director of communications, policy and campaigns at Shelter, said: \"Every day we see families up and down the country whose lives are being torn apart by the shortage of affordable homes. This government has had two years to start delivering on housing, yet this report paints a pretty bleak picture of its current record on housing in all its forms.\" Jack Dromey MP, Labour's shadow housing minister, pointed out the report said the government is failing to deliver or making no progress on eight out of 10 key housing indicators. He said: \"The report paints a bleak picture \u2026 housebuilding is down, homelessness is up and rents are increasingly unaffordable. \"The deterioration in outcomes outlined in this report show this out of touch government still isn't listening. They're failing to help the young couples who can't get on the housing ladder. They're failing those families struggling with high rents in the private sector and the millions on waiting lists. And they're failing the increasing number of people sleeping on our streets."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
