Inimitably, the president also likened the Fed to \u201ca powerful golfer who can\u2019t score. He can\u2019t putt!\u201d On Sunday, after stock markets suffered their worst week in a decade, the treasury secretary, Steve Mnuchin, revealed he had spoken to the heads of six major banks and convened the working group on financial markets, a presidential advisory panel known colloquially as the \u201cplunge protection team\u201d. Digesting that news on Monday, markets failed to rally. Trump\u2019s reported musings about firing Jerome Powell, his own appointee who has raised interest rates against the president\u2019s wishes, have stoked Wall Street jitters. So have the president\u2019s tariffs-based trade war with China, the government shutdown and the resignation of Jim Mattis, the respected secretary of defense. Over the weekend, Mnuchin and the acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, attempted to dowse controversy over Trump\u2019s urge to get rid of Powell, which he is thought to be unable to do, the Fed being by design independent. Mnuchin issued a statement in which Trump denied he had ever asked the question, a position Mulvaney seemed to undermine by saying the president \u201cnow\u201d understood he could not make such a move. Undaunted, and following bilious tweets about Mattis and the diplomat Brett McGurk that indicated a lack of Christmas cheer at the White House, Trump returned to the subject. \u201cThe only problem our economy has is the Fed,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a feel for the Market, they don\u2019t understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders.\u201d Trump then reached for a trusted club with which to beat an opponent. \u201cThe Fed is like a powerful golfer who can\u2019t score because he has no touch,\u201d he wrote. \u201cHe can\u2019t putt!\u201d Though he famously chided Barack Obama for spending too much time on the fairways, Trump spends many weekends at his properties up and down the east coast, driving, chipping and putting, sometimes using a companionable 18 holes to spend time with aides, allies or foreign leaders. The cost to the taxpayer has become a contentious subject. According to the Washington Post, in his spare time Powell \u201cplays golf and the guitar\u201d. That profile did not mention his handicap, but it did add that the Fed chair \u201cdoesn\u2019t drink much\u201d \u2013 a point of similarity with the teetotal Trump \u2013 and \u201chas an odd ability to repeat people\u2019s sentences backward to them, a quirk former colleagues say is a reminder of his smarts \u2013 and how closely he listens\u201d. It was not immediately clear if Powell had read Trump\u2019s Monday tweet, let alone read it to him backwards."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
