Sanchez is the current Northern Ireland boss, while Kerr was in charge of Republic of Ireland until they failed to qualify for the World Cup and his contract was not renewed. Mandaric has also approached Southampton to speak to Harry Redknapp - who departed as Pompey manager almost a year ago - although it is understood permission was refused by Saints chairman Rupert Lowe. His request to speak to Alex McLeish was rejected by Rangers while Neil Warnock opted to remain at Sheffield United. \"These are another two names on our list who we will talk to and see what they have to say and offer,\" said Mandaric this afternoon. \"We are leaving no stone unturned in our search for the right man and these are another line of enquiry in that quest.\" \"In line with my previous statement there is nothing more to say about this at present and we are just keeping the public informed of our options,\" he concluded."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
