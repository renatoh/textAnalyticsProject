The midfielder has impressed for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s side in recent matches, the World Cup winner a key factor in United\u2019s uplift in form. United and Pogba have won their last three matches, including Wednesday night\u2019s impressive 2-1 victory at Juventus but the Frenchman was unable to take part in full training on Friday. Instead Pogba undertook an indoors session at United\u2019s training complex due to what is understood to be a \u201csmall injury\u201d. Mourinho\u2019s squad have a final session on Saturday before the trip to City so the manager will hope Pogba can take part before any decision about his availability for the match is taken. The United manager, meanwhile, wants his side to take the fight to the Premier League leaders in the derby. United are nine points behind City after 11 matches as they travel to the Etihad but they are enjoying a fine week, having won at Bournemouth and Juventus, while last month they drew at Chelsea after leading until the closing moments. Mourinho, asked whether the wish was to go toe-to-toe with Pep Guardiola\u2019s team, said: \u201cWe are going to try. I cannot say we are going to be successful in our motivations, in our desire, but we played two different matches away against two very good teams \u2013 Chelsea and Juventus \u2013 and we managed to get good results. \u201cAnd even if the good results were not in our pockets the performances were there, the positive attitude was there so we are going to try but Manchester City are a very powerful team.\u201d Mourinho refused to be drawn on the alleged breaches of FFP rules by City but did praise their football operation. \u201cIt is difficult for me to answer because I focus on my job, I focus on the four lines [pitch], focus on football. If you want to speak about their football potential we can speak and football potential starts with investment, and after that of course there is a quality of the work, of the organisation \u2013 I think that is untouchable. \u201cBut what is behind I cannot say but in this moment I have only to think about football, and to think about football is to think about Manchester City as a football team there.\u201d Romelu Lukaku could be available again following a hamstring injury. Mourinho said: \u201cLukaku is training with the team this [Friday] morning. If his response is positive \u2013 and we have of course one more session tomorrow \u2013 he is ready.\u201d Victor Lindel\u00f6f has stated he never doubted himself when struggling to convince Mourinho of his first-choice credentials. Lindel\u00f6f was signed from Benfica for \u00a331m in June 2016 shortly after Mourinho\u2019s arrival but failed to establish himself in his first season. The Swede was also dropped this term, following the defeat at Brighton in August, but has started the last five matches. Asked if he was ever concerned regarding his ability, Lindel\u00f6f said: \u201cNo, I never doubt that. I\u2019ve always been confident. You have to work hard. It feels good \u2013 I\u2019ve been playing a lot of games since the start of the season. I\u2019m just trying to keep on going and doing the best for the team. At the moment I feel good \u2013 my body is fresh. \u201cEver since I came he\u2019s [Mourinho] been very important to me. He talks to me, tries to help me, he gives me \u2013 how do you say it in English \u2013 advice to improve my game. He\u2019s been very important. I think he\u2019s been fantastic and I\u2019m very happy to have him as a coach.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
