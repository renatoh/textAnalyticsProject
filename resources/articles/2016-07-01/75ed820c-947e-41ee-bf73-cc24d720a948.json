That is not exactly surprising. Pichai\u2019s call was a victory lap, coming on the heels of the announcement that Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, had posted a 21.3% increase in second-quarter revenue \u2013 exceeding analysts\u2019 expectations \u2013 driven by strong advertising sales on mobile devices and for video content. Pichai also hinted at the future direction for Google, saying that while today, \u201cmobile is the engine that drives us\u201d, the company is looking to machine learning for future growth. \u201cThrough investment in AI, we are investing in our future,\u201d he said. The strong revenue growth suggests that Google is successfully navigating the transition to mobile, said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners. Advertisers typically pay less for user clicks on mobile ads than on desktop ads, Google\u2019s traditional strength, but the strong earnings performance suggests that is beginning to change, he said. \u201cThey\u2019re doing an excellent job of pulling the mobile landscape through to being more efficient,\u201d Gillis said. Net income rose to $4.88bn, while Alphabet\u2019s consolidated revenue rose to $21.5bn in the three months ending 30 June, from $17.73bn a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting revenue of $20.76bn, according to Thomson Reuters. Google\u2019s ad revenue increased 19.5% to $19.14bn, while it notched a 29% rise in paid clicks, where advertisers pay the company only if a user clicks on the ad. Alphabet, which dominates the mobile ad market along with rival Facebook, has been trying to beef up ad revenue from mobile and video businesses, both of which until last year were a little less profitable than its desktop business. Despite the strong revenue growth, the falling cost-per-click on advertisements is cause for concern, said analyst Patrick Moorhead of Moor Insights &amp; Strategy. \u201cAdvertisers aren\u2019t willing to pay as much for Google advertising,\u201d he said. Revenue at Alphabet\u2019s Other Bets division \u2013 which includes broadband business Google Fiber, home automation products Nest, self-driving cars and X, the research facility that works on \u201cmoon shot\u201d ventures \u2013 rose 150% to $185m, while operating losses widened to $859m."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
