It is now possible for a visitor leaving the city\u2019s central station to walk across the main shopping district, almost to the banks of the Mersey, on private land owned by one company. Described as a shopping, residential and leisure development, Liverpool One incorporates 34 streets, all owned by the Duke of Westminster\u2019s Grosvenor estate. A huge swath of a British city centre has been effectively put into private hands. And the same phenomenon is being repeated in cities as diverse as Birmingham, Exeter, Portsmouth and Bristol. \u201cThe situation is critical. It\u2019s depressing that Britain is not interested in preserving its post-industrial legacy for the people,\u201d said Bradley Garrett, academic geographer and campaign organiser. In Liverpool, the visitor can then head towards the central docks, listed along with Stonehenge and the Great Wall of China as a world heritage site. This vast 60-acre plot \u2013 about a mile along the Mersey \u2013 is also owned by a single company which has recently made one of the biggest planning applications in the UK. Despite fears that Liverpool\u2019s historic skyline could be ruined, the city\u2019s council has approved Liverpool Waters\u2019 proposals for new skyscrapers and 9,000 apartments. A council source said Peel Holdings will be left to manage the site, empowered to sell off sections to whomever it chooses. Over a coffee in Bluecoats arts centre \u2013 a place sociologist Paul Jones calls an \u201coasis\u201d because it is surrounded by Liverpool One-owned sites \u2013 the University of Liverpool academic warns that the campaign to resist the privatisation of pivotal city space provokes a deeper question. \u201cIt\u2019s a question of what are cities for? Who gets the right to these spaces? Who has rights to be where, when and how?\u201d A heatmap of Liverpool \u2013 red denoting affluence and blue deprivation \u2013 would show Liverpool One as a splodge of scarlet surrounded by a circle of blue at the city\u2019s periphery. Jones believes it is a profoundly undemocratic model of urban public space, welcoming to wealthy consumers \u2013 John Lewis is a flagship store \u2013 in a city that remains one of the most deprived in England. Anna Minton, author of Ground Control, which documents the gradual privatisation of British streets, said: \u201cIt\u2019s about whether we have a city that looks to people first and foremost as consumers, is welcoming only to a certain class of ABC1 shopper, or is a diverse, open and inclusive city that offers a wealth of experiences for all sorts of people, young and old. \u201cBut then Liverpool One is not for the people of Liverpool, it\u2019s basically a regional centre where you can drive straight into an underground car park, come out for an all-day shopping experience, head back and not even know you\u2019ve been in Liverpool. It\u2019s like a hermetically sealed bubble that could be anywhere in the world.\u201d Undoubtedly, Liverpool One is significantly cleaner, its streets and fittings of a higher specification than the surrounding city which suddenly feels slightly shabby in comparison. Student Connor Campbell, 18, said he visits the development for its sense of calm. \u201cI come here for a bit of peace, it\u2019s less crazy here. Outside is like how Liverpool was.\u201d Others are less enthusiastic, complaining that it has sanitised the very essence of the city. Hair stylist Samantha Hipwell, 34, believes the development has deliberately sterilised one of the country\u2019s most evocative cities. \u201cIt is nice but it is just lots of posh shops at the end of the day and it can feel a little bit soulless compared to other bits of Liverpool.\u201d Critics also claim the privatisation of urban outdoor spaces restricts the possibility of public protest. Minton said: \u201cThe right to assembly is a key political right, it\u2019s at the heart of democratic representation from the 19th century onwards and now it\u2019s being threatened.\u201d A spokesman for Grosvenor estate denied it prohibited political protest or any form of mass assembly and said it complied with local regulations. The private guards who operate in such areas have no power to arrest but critics claim they nevertheless act like the police. Minton, who also lectures at the University of East London, said: \u201cOne of my students was at Canary Wharf doing a project. There\u2019s an art installation tucked away somewhere and he was there taking notes, but was taken to a control centre to prove who he was. These sort of places don\u2019t welcome young people so where should they hang out?\u201d Some developments raise issues of legacy. The Liverpool One lease lasts 250 years, a timespan that the company says rewards the size of its investment. Yet Jones is convinced future Liverpudlians will look back and wonder why the city opted to give away so much key real estate until 2258. \u201cFor 250 years Liverpool\u2019s capacity to leverage private monies into the local authority have been diminished by this one agreement. It\u2019s good for whom? A legacy for whom?\u201d Then there is the prospect of private companies becoming so powerful they become key players in public life. \u201cThe planning proposal for Liverpool Waters sees Peel deliver public services such as schools and training in areas of the city that are extremely deprived. The local authority cannot afford to do it,\u201d said Jones. Garrett believes the problem is the UK\u2019s dedication to a regeneration model that raises cash but neglects cultural priorities. Partly to blame, he says, is the government\u2019s austerity agenda, which has forced cash-strapped councils to sell off land to developers, often at unfavourable terms for the public. Garrett compares the UK model with Germany whose post-industrial landscape is being preserved for future generations. In Duisburg, in the Ruhr basin, huge steel and iron works have effectively been kept as public art installations. By contrast, say critics, the UK approach is often so secretive that land agreements are opaque. Jones said: \u201cIf you look at these developments, London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross and the South Bank for instance, they do in effect become black boxes, very difficult to illuminate for journalists, academics and communities interested in what\u2019s going on in their cities.\u201d Other places where disquiet has surfaced over the privatisation of key public spaces include Bristol, where the centre is now dominated by the huge shopping development of Cabot Circus, which has been blamed for the closure of smaller stores in a city that prides itself on localism. In Birmingham Brindleyplace \u2013 which boasts of its \u201ctree-lined squares, international cuisine and \u2026 enviable canalside location\u201d \u2013 has provoked a similar debate to that in Liverpool. In Exeter, the Princesshay \u201cshopping destination featuring over 60 shops, set in a series of interconnecting open streets and squares\u201d has also raised concerns. The new King\u2019s Cross development at Granary Square, around the same size as Trafalgar Square, is also a highly securitised area where photographers have been removed by private guards if they are unable to produce a permit. Shiny, gleaming, sanitised, the rise of privately owned public space in Britain\u2019s cities goes on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
