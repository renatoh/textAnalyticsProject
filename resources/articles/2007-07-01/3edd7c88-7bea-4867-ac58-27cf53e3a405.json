The breakthrough raises hopes for thousands of girls who survive childhood cancer each year but are left infertile by chemotherapy. Until now, fertility specialists had thought it impossible to retrieve usable eggs from girls so young, but a team of Israeli doctors managed to extract early-stage eggs and mature them in a laboratory before storing them in deep freeze. Around 1,500 children are treated for cancer in Britain each year, but because the disease is often diagnosed late it can be far more advanced than in adults and require more aggressive treatment. Progress in childhood cancer therapy has seen cure rates rise substantially in recent years to between 70% and 90%. In principle, the procedure could be used to overcome various forms of female infertility caused by disease. \"There is no other option for preserving the fertility of these girls at the moment. This kind of treatment gives them hope,\" said fertility specialist Ariel Revel of Hadassah University hospital in Jerusalem. The work is to be announced at the annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Lyon tomorrow. The doctors collected tissue from the girls' ovaries and isolated the immature eggs, which were then matured in a Petri dish over one to two days until they resembled those of a 20-year-old woman. The team obtained seven eggs from a five-year-old girl with a type of kidney cancer called Wilms' tumour, a further eight from an eight-year-old with Ewing's sarcoma, and 17 from a 10-year-old who also had Ewing's sarcoma. They attempted to mature 130 of 167 eggs extracted from 18 girls, and achieved full maturation in 41. The team expect to wait around 10 or more years before they will know if the eggs are capable of leading to live births. \"No eggs have yet been thawed, so we do not know whether pregnancies will result. But we are encouraged by our results so far, particularly the young ages of the patients from which we have been able to collect eggs,\" said Dr Revel. \"We believe that no younger patients have ever undergone egg collection, in vitro maturation and egg freezing. We are hopeful that the mature eggs can offer these girls a realistic possibility of preserving their fertility.\" Doctors have previously removed ovarian tissue from adults and frozen it while the woman undergoes cancer treatment. Worldwide, only two babies have been born after the frozen tissue was thawed and transplanted back into the woman. Gillian Lockwood, who runs Midlands Fertility Services, the only clinic in Britain to have had live births from frozen eggs, said that the new procedure could make a dramatic difference to girls who develop cancer at a young age. \"If it works it's good news, because the big block has always been that we thought you had to wait until they reached puberty before getting the eggs,\" she said. But she added that the treatment raised ethical issues. \"The parents will be making the decision in these cases, and it may be that they are keen to have grandchildren, and I don't know if a very young girl will fully appreciate all of the arguments.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
