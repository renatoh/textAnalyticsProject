Jim O'Neill, a partner at Goldman Sachs, already owns shares in the club worth \u00a33.5m and his investment banking background is seen as a huge asset at a time when Malcolm Glazer has not given up his takeover ambitions. O'Neill, 47, is a friend of Sir Alex Ferguson and knows the Irishmen JP McManus and John Magnier, whose Cubic Expression fund has a 29% stake in United. He even offered to act as a mediator in the dispute between Ferguson and Magnier over the stud rights to the racehorse Rock of Gibraltar, having been concerned the affair was disrupting the club. He is head of global economic research at Goldman and is regarded as one of the world's experts in predicting currency movement. As a partner at the investment bank since 1995, O'Neill was one of the beneficiaries of the firm's flotation in 1999 and his personal wealth is estimated conservatively at about \u00a330m. His United stake represents 0.5% of the company, making him one of the largest individual shareholders. He is a United season-ticket holder, having played for Manchester schoolboys. The son of a nurse and postman, he grew up in the Gatley area of the city and in recent years has made substantial donations to Manchester schools and hospitals. O'Neill's recruitment was already in progress before Glazer voted three United directors off the board at last week's annual meeting and the club is still looking for two more non-executives. It is thought the chairman Sir Roy Gardner and chief executive David Gill have abandoned the idea of reappointing Maurice Watkins and Philip Yea, two of the victims of Glazer's hostile action. However, the board is expected to try to reappoint the commercial director Andy Anson at some point. He joined only in February and is continuing to perform the same day-to-day job in a non-board capacity."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
