The Accountancy Investigation and Discipline Board is filing complaints against David Donnelly, the ex-finance director, and PwC which audited the company in 2002. The watchdog has decided not to make a complaint against Andersen, which was removed as auditor after being implicated in the Enron scandal. An inquiry into Ian Shelton, a former employee of Transbus, one of Mayflower's main subsidiaries, is still being finalised."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
