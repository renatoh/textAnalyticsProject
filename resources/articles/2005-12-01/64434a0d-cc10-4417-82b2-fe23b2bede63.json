A family is throwing bread to ducks which are standing on the frozen surface of the lake. The birds are enthusiastic and hurry to the food, but soon find that walking on ice is not as easy as swimming in water. First one foot shoots sideways, then the other - or both splay out at the same time, so that the birds land on their stomachs. And when eventually they reach the bread and stretch out their beaks to snap it up, it shoots across the ice as soon as they touch it. Undaunted, they persevere and slither off in pursuit. With several birds after the same bread, it is like a game of avian ice hockey as each try to gain the prize for itself. The calmer it is on a winter day in late afternoon, the more noise a cock pheasant considers it necessary to announce the whereabouts of his bedroom. These birds are wary through the day, but when dusk falls the male of the species needs to get things off his chest to help him get aloft into the branches of his favourite tree. Today, as dusk falls, I am entertained by wheezings and chucklings and what I think is an argument between two pheasants who have, either by design or accident, selected the same branch of a tree. There is a lot of shuffling and wing clapping. The tree is a Norway spruce and already has a hen in residence. Finally, after verbal argument, one of the birds departs with a lot of wing-flapping to a less popular branch of a nearby tree. Wild birds are shifting their habitation to dodge the vagaries of tide and weather. Small woods and open fields are now silent, patrolled only by grim pairs of carrion crows, winter flocks of woodpigeons and a few starlings. On the seashore, isolated cliff sites usually teeming with guillemots, razorbills and kittiwakes have been abandoned, but the shore sands' comparative immunity from frost, and its food reserves, makes it an avian winter assembly ground. Salt marshes, whins and our dunes are winter homes to big and little birds."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
