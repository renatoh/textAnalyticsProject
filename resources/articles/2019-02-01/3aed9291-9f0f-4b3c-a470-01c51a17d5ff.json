Justifiably so, too. Celtic progressed to this last-32 tie in the Europa League after emerging from a group in which RB Leipzig were left behind. \u201cThis is a challenge for us,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cI said to the players this morning: \u2018Listen, we are playing against a good team, everyone recognises that, but let\u2019s not forget we\u2019re a good team as well.\u2019 That\u2019s why we are at this stage of the competition. We are through on merit. We had good teams in our group and we qualified. We deserve it. So let\u2019s go and attack the game and enjoy it. \u201cYou are just trying to constantly reinforce the belief. Sometimes you don\u2019t play well and if you don\u2019t play well against teams like Valencia you get hurt. But that\u2019s always a constant. The players arrive into this game having been playing well \u2013 their commitment in the games has been very good.\u201d Since the turn of the year, Celtic have won seven domestic fixtures in succession without conceding a goal. Their task, quite obviously, is to adapt from matches in which they dominate possession towards handling a La Liga side. Valencia are eighth in Spain\u2019s top tier, where they have only lost four games. \u201cValencia is a club I know well,\u201d Rodgers said. \u201cThey have a great history and there is always a demand to do well. They have very good players and some of their recent results tell you everything about the level they are at. But it\u2019s an opportunity for us. I never see a good team as an obstacle. No matter how good they are or how much money they have, they can\u2019t put 12 players out there. It\u2019s 11 v 11 and we have to give everything we can to get a result. The longer we are together, the more experience the players are getting.\u201d Sixteen season have almost passed since Celtic reached the Uefa Cup final under Martin O\u2019Neill. Interim accounts this week showed Rodgers has presided over a business in rude health \u2013 the club had \u00a338m in the bank at the end of 2018 \u2013 but the manager was circumspect over whether the Scottish champions can ever emulate the run of 2002-03. \u201cYou always have to believe you can,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if you look at the teams in it, there\u2019s a real array of top teams. \u201cThe competition gets stronger each year because now there is a real onus on it where you can qualify for the Champions League. Because of that there is a real hunger there for teams to do well in it. But you always have to go in and do the very best you possibly can, that\u2019s the idea. And that\u2019s what we\u2019ll always believe.\u201d Key to Celtic\u2019s attacking hopes will be Oliver Burke, the West Brom loanee who has seen his career reinvigorated since moving north of the border. The 21-year-old had struggled elsewhere despite moving for combined fees of close to \u00a330m. \u201cThere\u2019s a perception of him,\u201d Rodgers added. \u201cIf you dig deep you\u2019ll find out. Some players aren\u2019t learners and they will struggle. The one thing I found with him is that when I spoke to him on the phone I felt there was a hunger to improve. \u201cHe\u2019d been on the sidelines for a while and I loved his strengths. If you focus on his strengths and polish up other aspects and give him clarity then you can help him and for me he\u2019s been a joy to work with.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
