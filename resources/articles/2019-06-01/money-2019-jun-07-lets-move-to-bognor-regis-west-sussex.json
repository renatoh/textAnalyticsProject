Bognor is still waiting for its Brighton moment. Or its Margate moment. Even an Eastbourne moment would do. A House of Lords report demands that seaside resorts reinvent themselves, and Bognor\u2019s local council has promised future creative digital hubs and, doubtless, co-working spaces and yuzu juice for all. Bognor is a curious beast. To the east, Butlin\u2019s. To the west, the private estates and get-orf-my-land of Aldwick Bay. In the middle, a humdrum town centre. Alas, Bognor Regis is used to being the butt of jokes, by fortune of its name, a magnificently British combination of highfalutin Regis, undercut by lavatorial Bognor, perfectly encapsulated in George V\u2019s fabled \u201cBugger Bognor\u201d cry. The town seems destined for self-mockery and understatement. It stars in Don\u2019t Forget The Driver, the Toby Jones comedy about coach parties; \u2019nuff said. The International Birdman Competition takes place on its pier, a celebration of plucky, inventive failure. But, dammit, this is where James Joyce wrote part of Finnegans Wake, where William Blake lived. This is where the magnificent Picturedrome is. With form like that, bugger Brighton! The case against With gumption it could make more of itself. It has the usual seaside despond slapped beside the regal mansions of Aldwick Bay. Butlin\u2019s dominates the town. Well connected? Trains: half-hourly direct to London (1hr 45 mins) via Gatwick (69 mins); other lines require a change at Barnham, with three or four an hour to Chichester (14 mins quickest), to Brighton hourly (55 mins) and half-hourly to Southampton (75-90 mins). Driving: 20 mins to Chichester, 25 mins to the A3, 30 mins to Portsmouth, an hour to Southampton. Schools Primaries: Rose Green Infant and Junior, Nyewood CofE Infant and Junior, Bersted Green, South Bersted, Edward Bryant, St Mary\u2019s Catholic and Downview are all \u201cgood\u201d, says Ofsted. Secondaries: The Regis School is \u201cgood\u201d. Hang out at\u2026 The lovely new ice-cream parlour, Sweet Flamingo. Where to buy Between Waterloo Square and West Street you\u2019ll find the small old town, full of Regency townhouses far, far cheaper than a few miles east, though many need a good update. Plus the usual seasidey Victorian streets. West towards Pagham, the Witterings and Selsey, the private estates of Aldwick and Aldwick Bay, full of grand and less grand 1920s and 30s homes. Also nice are the former villages almost swallowed up by the town, like Flansham and North Bersted, often with thatched cottages. Large detacheds and townhouses, \u00a3500,000-\u00a31.5m. Detacheds and smaller townhouses, \u00a3275,000-\u00a3500,000. Semis, \u00a3200,000-\u00a3500,000. Terraces and cottages, \u00a3185,000-\u00a3350,000. Flats, \u00a3120,000-\u00a3375,000. Rentals: a one-bed flat, \u00a3550-\u00a3750pcm; a three-bed house, \u00a3975-\u00a31,500pcm. Bargain of the week Four-bedroom grade II-listed townhouse in the centre, \u00a3340,000, with charlespeck.co.uk. From the streets Becky Smith \u2018Butlin\u2019s is good for daytrippers \u2013 a new pool opened in April. The Lobster Pot in Felpham has great food, amazing ice-cream.\u2019 Peter Roland \u2018A good library and trains, although the service to London is slow.\u2019 \u2022 Live in Bognor?
