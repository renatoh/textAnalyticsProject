The squad for the current Test included off-spinner Jamie Dalrymple. Dalrymple is, by all accounts, posh. He studied at Oxford. Even more clinching, his name is \"Dalrymple\". With this in mind an Ashes game plan is starting to emerge. Having tried winning ugly and, more recently, not winning at all, England have a new approach - winning posh. A Strauss team talk will have certain subtle variations. Where Freddie or Vaughany might demand that players \"come to the party\", Strauss is more likely to be concerned with his team \"arriving in good time to be announced\" or, for a larger reception, making a prompt appearance relative to one's level of intimacy with the hostess. Similarly, there will be less \"getting in the faces\" of the opposition but plenty of animated discussion on the state of the roads and, later, perhaps a round of semi-competitive charades. Even England's injury crisis is due a shift in tone. Never mind tendons and ligaments, the first-choice attack might soon find itself laid low by proper posh injuries - inherited insanity, fits of \"the hysterics\" and a world-weary cynicism that can only be relieved by lounging on a French sofa making sardonic remarks. English football has already made its own tentative efforts at poshing itself up. The pre-eminence of Chelsea only lacks the addition of a rambling country feeder-club somewhere in Hampshire. Similarly, the emergence of foreign players with names like Lauren and Geremi is a nod towards that section of English society where middle-aged men with weak chins are still known simply as \"Sandwich\" or \"Marlborough\". And the West Ham captain Nigel Reo-Coker sounds like he might be happier taking afternoon tiffin than taking a car-load of glamour models home from an Essex night spot under the influence of Dom Perignon and Red Bull. Even the language of the game is on the verge of an experimental poshing-over. The furious training ground bust-up is being replaced by loaded remarks about the origin of one's family wealth. A penalty shoot-out will no longer be a lottery; instead players will talk fearfully about \"the bridge party of penalty kicks\". The educated left foot is slowly evolving into a left foot that was sent down from Winchester and is becoming the most terrible burden on papa. There will be teething problems of course. Under the influence of poshness the phrase \"mark your man\" becomes the frankly unintelligible \"instruct your man to man-mark your man's gentleman's gentleman's gentleman\". Strauss, meanwhile, will have to deal with players he has instructed, baseball-style, to \"step up to the plate\" having a discussion about which component of a 70-piece bone china service would be most appropriate. Will a posh England team have more chance of retaining the Ashes? Probably not. But then, one doesn't like to presume. It's a beastly business all round, as they say at the drawing in of the evening."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
