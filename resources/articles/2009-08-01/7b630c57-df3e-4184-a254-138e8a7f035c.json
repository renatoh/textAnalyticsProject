Under plans to be outlined by Straumur executives, assets at the collapsed Icelandic bank, which now owns 70% of West Ham through CB Holding, will be managed for future sale under a \"composition agreement\". For that to happen, new equity in Straumur will be issued and key creditors will be asked to accept those shares in place of their debts in the bank. But executives admit the new company would be \"cash-flow negative for three or four years\" and if more than 30% of creditors by number or value reject the proposal, Straumur will be put into liquidation. \"If the attempt to seek a composition agreement is unsuccessful the winding-up committee is obliged to request that the district court place Straumur's estate into bankruptcy proceedings,\" Hordur Felix Hardarson, who has been managing the process, told creditors at a previous meeting. That would force a fire-sale of assets such as West Ham, meaning that in an uncertain market the club would have a third owner in less than six months. Straumur's chief executive, Ottar Palsson, has urged creditors not to fold the firm. \"I feel there is only one option for creditors, and that is a managed workout,\" he said. \"It is likely to lead to far better results for creditors.\" Although Straumur has presented today's meeting as a formality, several major creditors yesterday told Digger they would not back any plans before seeing the details. Transfer backlog gripe Red tape in the football transfer market is causing Football League clubs to gripe only a few days before the season kicks off in tiers two to four. The Football Association has been unable to process international transfers and suspicious minds are linking the upheaval of the move from Soho Square to Wembley with the delay. However, given the sensitivity of the relocation's timing, the registrations team were among the last out of Soho Square and the first in to the new offices, and all IT systems were up and running on arrival. The FA is instead hampered by Fifa rules that allow 30 days for national associations to process the paperwork, with many \u2013 including those who should know better \u2013 leaving it until the 11th hour. Surely Spain's football authorities did not really need 29 days to register Fernando Torres's 2007 switch from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid to Liverpool? Gibraltar loss rocks Levy William Hill's announcement that it is moving its online-betting operations to Gibraltar at a cost of \u00a31.5m to the horse racing Levy (and much more to the exchequer) was made possible by a rushed amendment to the 2005 Gambling Bill. Bookmakers may think twice if such a move meant they could not advertise their wares around racecourses and the law states: \"A person commits an offence if he advertises foreign gambling other than a lottery.\" Yet no one has ever got to the bottom of why a specific exemption for Gibraltar-based bookies was then inserted during the rush to get the Bill \"washed up\" and through parliament before the 2005 general election. Now, as other bookies inevitably follow Hill's lead, that seemingly innocent decision threatens to strip beleaguered British horseracing of many millions in annual revenues. Rugby seeks its Bosman Jonny Wilkinson, left, James Haskell and Riki Flutey have been in the vanguard of the English cross-Channel exodus to French rugby but a fightback is under way. There are 76 French \"rugbymen\" who find themselves out of work today, many of them victims of an invasion that has led to more than 40% of France's professional-club squads coming from overseas, according to figures given to Digger by the French players' union, Provale. Now the Ligue Nationale de Rugby is introducing from next season a home-grown players' rule under which 50% of players must have been trained in France; the following year it will be 70%. Provided, that is, rugby does not produce a Bosman to challenge the rules through the European courts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
