It seems, though, that the search has now been abandoned for this year, with no one prepared to bite, even at the sub-\u00a3400,000 package that has reportedly been offered to several major betting firms in recent weeks. For the first time since 1983, the greatest Classic will be the plain old Derby again. In simple financial terms, this is clearly an embarrassing setback for Jockey Club Racecourses, which controls Epsom, though it could, in a wider sense, have been more embarrassing still. The Kentucky Derby, remember, is \"presented by Yum! Brands\". A few hundred grand is a big hole in anyone's budget, and the temptation to flog off the Derby at a rock-bottom price must have been difficult to resist. The Derby managed to survive for over 200 years without a sponsor, of course, so one more running as The Derby Stakes, pure and simple, is not the end of the world. Over-optimism is a fatal flaw for sellers in any market, and the simple fact that a sponsor has not been found strongly implies that the initial price was set too high, and by the time it was reduced, it was too late. That lesson will presumably be taken on board when the search resumes after the latest running, and sooner or later, a sponsor will no doubt be secured. Epsom has done a great deal to revive the Derby in recent years, too. Having a sponsor was the least of anyone's worries in the early 1990s, when anyone who loved the Derby could see that it was dying on its feet. The first Wednesday in June was still special for the true fans, but everyone else had found better things to do. Switching to Saturday has brought back the crowds, and with it the Derby's air of history and spectacle. And for all the sideshows that come with it \u2013 the fairground rides, the bands on the big stage and so on \u2013 the race itself remains at the heart of the whole experience. This is what needs to be reinforced in the coming weeks, as a way, perhaps, to salvage something from a difficult situation. This year's Derby will not be a billboard to help sell beer, batteries or mobile phones. It is all about the horses, the jockeys, the trainers and the odds. That last part, as always, is an obvious sticking point. Epsom, like so many tracks, promotes its major race as an event, rather than as something to bet on. But, to offer just one small example, why is it not possible for either Epsom or the BHA to upload a five-minute video to YouTube a couple of weeks before the race, with the important form from all the major trials and footage of the top six in the betting? Anyone who wanted to spread the word could email the URL to their friends, post it on internet forums and so on. I think Horse A looks like the best, but what about you? That simple question, after all, is the basis of every race and every betting market. Anything that extends the Derby's reach can only help search for a \"proper\", blue-chip sponsor. And that, in turn, would reassure the rest of us that, in a small way at least, horse racing still matters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
