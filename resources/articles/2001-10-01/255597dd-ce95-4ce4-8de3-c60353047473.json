A survey carried out for internet bank Intelligent Finance (IF) found that whether we realise it or not, mothers and fathers have an \"inescapable influence\" on the way people look after their finances. The research found that more than 52% of people questioned were strongly influenced by the way their parents handled cash, though only one in five people admitted that their attitude to money had been shaped by them. The only people who actively did not copy their parents were those who had had a traumatic experience growing up. IF said people whose parents had handled money badly and over-spent were likely to go to the opposite extreme when it came to handling their own cash. Psychologist Donna Dawson said: \"When it comes to our attitude towards money, there is no escaping the financial example set by our parents. \"Whether directly or indirectly, the way our parents dealt with money while we were growing up will have affected us and we will end up subconsciously emulating them. \"However, this is not something that we would readily admit to as part of growing up and away from our parents is becoming our 'own person', with seemingly different values.\" The group said people can be divided into three groups according to the way they handle money - aficionados, carefuls and carefrees. One in four people claim to be aficionados, saying they find money interesting and think looking after it is rewarding. People who start off as aficionados are likely to remain so throughout their adult life, and are four times more likely to have aficionados than carefrees as parents. Almost half the population are carefuls, who think money is important and must be looked after even though they do not find it interesting. Young people are most likely to fall into the carefree group, saying money is nice to have although they are not particularly good with it. But Ms Dawson said their attitude to money was likely to change with age, with most becoming carefuls in their mid-30s and aficionados by the time they reached middle-age. One in five people are carefrees, and they are most likely to spend more than they can afford, with nine out of 10 admitting they have been in debt. Ms Dawson said the way people handle money cuts across other differences such as social class, wealth and sex. She said: \"Attitudes towards money are classless because personality differences, and thus financial attitudes, cut across all classes. \"Also, the general rule in society is to have fun when you are young and to spend money on yourself before accumulating too much responsibility.\" The survey also found that one in 10 people claim to monitor their finances on a daily basis, while one in 20 say they rarely open their bank statements."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
