Buckingham Palace provided the sumptuous backdrop for the US president, who had long desired the endorsement of an official state visit, and took the opportunity to bring four of his five children with him. At the white-tie-and-tiara affair for 170 guests in the grand ballroom, his daughters, Ivanka and Tiffany, and sons Donald Jnr and Eric joined politicians, including the prime minister, royals, dignitaries and business people. Trump was seated between the Queen and the Duchess of Cornwall, while the first lady, Melania Trump, was placed next to the Prince of Wales. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were also on the top table. The three-day state visit had begun, perhaps unsurprisingly, with controversy. Shortly before Air Force One touched down at Stansted airport Trump launched a Twitter tirade against his old adversary Sadiq Khan, condemning the mayor of London as a \u201cstone cold loser\u201d, comments the mayor\u2019s office rebuffed as \u201cchildish insults\u201d. However, by the time the president\u2019s helicopter, Marine One, landed at Buckingham Palace for his long-desired ceremonial visit, he was wreathed in smiles, with his arrival marked by two 41-gun salutes, a guard of honour and a white-tie-and-tiara banquet. More than 100 protesters demonstrated outside the gates of Buckingham Palace against the US president being handed \u201cthe red-carpet treatment\u201d and more than 250,000 protesters are expected to take to London\u2019s streets on Tuesday, when the Trump baby blimp is expected to appear once again. The Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, who will address the protesters in London, tweeted: \u201cTomorrow\u2019s protest against Donald Trump\u2019s state visit is an opportunity to stand in solidarity with those he\u2019s attacked in America, around the world and in our own country \u2013 including, just this morning, @SadiqKhan\u201d. The state visit, which is the 113th hosted by the Queen, brought together two dynasties, one ancient, one fledgling, as Trump combined the official visit with a family jaunt. Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner, a presidential adviser, watched from a palace balcony as the president and the first lady were greeted warmly by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall on the palace lawn, with Trump holding on to Prince Charles\u2019s hand for 10 seconds. The president was then officially welcomed by the Queen on the palace steps where they shared a slightly awkward half handshake. Accompanied by Charles, and to a medley of American service tunes played by the band of the Grenadier Guards, Trump inspected the guard of honour by the Nijmegen Company Grenadier Guards. The first couple later joined the Queen, Charles and Camilla, Prince Harry and other royals for a private lunch, also attended by Ivanka and Kushner. The Queen presented him with a first edition of The Second World War by Winston Churchill and a three-piece pen set bearing the royal cypher. But on a tour of Royal Collection artefacts in the palace\u2019s picture gallery, Trump was shown the pewter horse he gave the Queen on his last visit. Asked if he recognised it, he replied \u201cno\u201d, at which point Melania jumped in, saying: \u201cYes, this is one of ours.\u201d Trump did better when he was shown a book of tartans opened at the yellow design of his Scottish Hebridean mother\u2019s MacLeod clan. \u201cThat\u2019s my tartan,\u201d he said immediately. At the banquet, Ivanka was seated between Liam Fox, the international trade secretary, and the Countess of Wessex, while Kushner was placed next to Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, and Princess Anne. Prince Harry was absent from the dinner. Corbyn and the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Vince Cable, had already declined to attend. Guests dined on a starter of steamed fillet of halibut followed by saddle of Welsh lamb and a strawberry sable dessert. Trump is teetotal, though the meal was accompanied by four wines \u2013 champagne, white, red, port \u2013 and water. Six glasses were set for each guest, including a champagne glass for the toast when the Queen and Trump both referenced D-day and the shared sacrifices of both nations during the second world war. The Queen stressed a war legacy that had highlighted the importance of nations working together, but Trump\u2019s emphasis was on how Britain had stood alone. Referring to the Normandy landings, the Queen said: \u201cAs we face the new challenges of the 21st century, the anniversary of D-day reminds us of all that our countries have achieved together. After the shared sacrifices of the second world war, Britain and the United States worked with other allies to build an assembly of international institutions, to ensure the horrors of conflict would never be repeated. While the world has changed, we are forever mindful of the original purpose of these structures: nations working together to safeguard a hard-won peace.\u201d In his response, Trump praised the Queen as \u201ca great, great woman\u201d who embodied \u201cthe spirit of dignity, duty and patriotism that beats proudly in every British heart\u201d. He paid tribute to the leadership shown by the royal family during the war and said Britain had stood alone in the Blitz. \u201cIn that dark hour, the people of this nation showed the world what it means to be British,\u201d he said. \u201cThe courage of the United Kingdom\u2019s sons and daughters ensured that your destiny would always remain in your own hands.\u201d As the guests rose for the toast, the president touched the Queen lightly on the back. When he arrived in the country, the presidential plane was met at Stansted by the foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt. Even as it was taxiing in, Trump was launching his broadside against Khan, who has criticised Britain rolling out the red carpet for the visit. The president tweeted: \u201cSadiq Khan, who by all accounts has done a terrible job as Mayor of London, has been foolishly \u2018nasty\u2019 to the visiting President of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me.\u201d The president then appeared to use some downtime at the US ambassador\u2019s residence to indulge another favourite pastime, venting his anger on Twitter on the topics of \u201cfake news\u201d, China, and the US broadcaster CNN. \u201cJust arrived in the United Kingdom. The only problem is that CNN is the primary source of news available from the US,\u201d he tweeted before condemning it as \u201cAll negative &amp; so much Fake News\u201d. In the evening, he tweeted: \u201cLondon part of trip is going really well. The Queen and the entire Royal family have been fantastic. The relationship with the United Kingdom is very strong. Tremendous crowds of well wishers and people that love our Country. \u201cHaven\u2019t seen any protests yet, but I\u2019m sure the Fake News will be working hard to find them. Great love all around. Also, big Trade Deal is possible once UK gets rid of the shackles.\u201d Hastily offered by Theresa May after Trump\u2019s inauguration, the state visit brings down the curtain on her troubled premiership. Trump was vocal before his visit in criticising her handling of Brexit. Given both, there was no surprise when it emerged on Monday that there would be no formal one-to-one between the president and the prime minister. Instead, the two will meet alongside their aides on Tuesday. Asked whether the president had preferred to hold a one-to-one meeting, May\u2019s spokesman said: \u201cI\u2019m sure the answer to that is no.\u201d Waving banners emblazoned with messages declaring the president was \u201cevil\u201d, scores of protesters blowing whistles and horns massed on a green outside the palace. Demonstrators, many of who were clutching signs urging people to \u201cjust say no\u201d to the special relationship, chanted: \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s not welcome here.\u201d Outside Buckingham Palace, Weyman Bennett, 54, the co-convenor of Stand up to Racism, who helped organise the protest, said the state visit represented \u201can insult to people\u2019s basic decent values\u201d and should have been cancelled. He added: \u201cSometimes you have to say to a bully they\u2019re wrong and stand up for basic rights. He\u2019s threatened nuclear war, he\u2019s behaved like a boorish idiot, he doesn\u2019t even respect basic diplomatic values.\u201d Before the banquet, the Trumps took tea at Clarence House with Charles and Camilla, and laid a wreath on the tomb of the Unknown Warrior, accompanied by the Duke of York. Trump\u2019s visit culminates on Wednesday when he will join the Queen during commemorations of the 75th anniversary of D-day in Portsmouth. He will be escorted by May on a private tour of the Churchill War Rooms, from which Winston Churchill directed British forces during the second world war."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
