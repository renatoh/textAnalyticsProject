The privately hired minibus was close to the stadium at around 7pm when it was surrounded by fans who stoned and kicked it. A spokesman for the British embassy said: \"Roma fans entered the bus and the Arsenal fan was either stabbed or injured by broken glass when a window of the minibus was smashed.\" Police intervened, arresting one Roma fan and escorted the minibus to the stadium. The wounded fan, who has not been named, was treated at a medical centre at the stadium before returning to watch the game. In a separate incident, two other Arsenal fans were injured after a fight with Roma supporters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
