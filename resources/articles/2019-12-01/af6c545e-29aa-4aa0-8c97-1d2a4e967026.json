The world No 1 was far from his best in the second-round match and lost the first set from 2-0 up, Klaasen taking out 116 to earn a surprise lead. Klaasen then broke his compatriot to throw for a two-set lead \u2013 but Van Gerwen found a 170 checkout to turn the contest around. Van Gerwen hit his first maximum in the third set, teeing up a 130 finish to break Klaasen\u2019s throw and move 2-1 up. The outsider had a chance to move ahead in the fourth but missed an audacious double-double 19, and Van Gerwen duly broke, sealing victory on the bull. \u201cI played a poor game from the beginning,\u201d Van Gerwen told Sky Sports. \u201cMe and Jelle have a past, we don\u2019t really like each other. I wasn\u2019t too worried when I went behind, Jelle hasn\u2019t been in great form. It was a tough game, but it doesn\u2019t matter if it was close, I\u2019m through.\u201d Klaasen had booked his place in the match by winning his earlier first-round game, fighting back from a set down to beat Northern Ireland\u2019s Kevin Burness 3-1. Belgium\u2019s Kim Huybrechts also avoided an upset against Dutch youngster Geert Nentjes, eventually winning 3-2 to set up a second-round meeting with 2018 winner Rob Cross. After the first two sets were shared, Huybrechts found double 16 to break at 2-1 down in the third set, but a well-timed maximum helped Nentjes edge ahead. The Belgian hit back to level things with a 164 checkout in the fourth. Huybrechts took out 112 to take control of the deciding set, but missed three match darts in the fourth leg as nerves got the better of both men. Nentjes could not punish him and victory was eventually sealed on double two. In the other match on opening night, Luke Humphries prevailed 3-1 in a tough battle with crowd favourite Devon Petersen. World youth champion Humphries, who reached the quarter-finals here last year, took the first set as Petersen missed three set darts. The South African responded with a two-dart clearance after an unlucky bounce-out. Humphries struggled on doubles in the third set, but that changed in the fifth leg as he nailed a decisive 105 finish. There was no way back for Petersen as his opponent added a 160 finish on his way to taking the fourth set."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
