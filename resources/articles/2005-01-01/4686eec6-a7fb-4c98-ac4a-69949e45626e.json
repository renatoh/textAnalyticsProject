I am lying on a slab of marble trying not to scream as a firm-biceped Moroccan lady scrubs my body to within an inch of its life. She seems pleased, anyway. \"Du peau mort!\" she declares triumphantly, showing me the dead skin on her exfoliating mitten that has been successfully scraped from the surface of my body. I smile weakly, hoping it's nearly over. Moroccans are the masters of the body scrub. The ancient tradition of the hammam means that they are a nation well-versed in the art of serious steaming, merciless exfoliating and generally rendering you squeaky clean. I am at the Cinq Mondes spa in Marrakech - a small, swanky French spa chain (its other branches are in Paris and Mauritius). So here you get all the traditional expertise of the Moroccan therapists, combined with the sense of luxury that the French do so well. Cinq Mondes is to be found at Club Med's newly built La Palmeraie resort, which is somewhat surprising since Club Med is not traditionally considered to be a hugely upmarket brand. The collaboration is part of a more general drive by the French resort company to upgrade its image - they are also in the process of completing a more \"exclusive\" and luxurious hotel, Le Riad, adjacent to La Palmeraie, due to be completed around February and the first of its Finest collection. The thinking is that Club Med, established in the 50s, needs to grow up with its customers, whose demands are changing as they become older, wealthier and more picky. A quick glance around La Palmeraie suggests that they may be on to something - the clientele is overwhelmingly mature and relatively affluent looking. It's also very French (sorry to reinforce stereotypes, but there's a lot of smoking at breakfast, well-groomed ladies and topless sunbathing at every opportunity). The idea behind Cinq Mondes spas is to combine beauty rituals from all over the world, so you can choose from a wide variety of treatments, from Ayurvedic and Taoist massage to a Balinese facial or a slimming cr\u00e8me de caf\u00e9 ritual that originated in Brazil. I opt for a two-day package. Having been comprehensively steamed, cleaned (with local black olive soap) and exfoliated, I am led, a little dazed, to the lounge area overlooking a pretty garden and pond, and served tea. The discomfort of the gommage , or skin-scrubbing, was well worth it - I am glowing afterwards, and my skin feels fantastically smooth and soft. Next up is a bath of rose petals and essential oils, designed to make me feel like \"une princesse\" as the therapist puts it, removing my robe for me, maid-style. The hi-tech bath is a rather ingenious son-et-lumi\u00e8re-style invention - it has a hi-fi and underwater coloured lights built in. I choose green as my colour (more soothing than red which makes the water look a little like someone has been mauled by a shark). It is very relaxing, and, yes, I do feel vaguely princess-like, particularly when I get out and the therapist insists on drying me, which, I dare say, if you really are a princess, you get used to after a while. Next was a massage. The masseuse worked wonders on my knotted muscles. Like the formidable body-scrubbing lady, she was fierce but effective - she even told me off for having let my body get so tense, a big \"faux pas\", she said. To be honest, it was all a bit overwhelming, so I had to go for a little lie down - and ended up falling into a deep coma-like slumber all afternoon. La Palmeraie is a peaceful spot, set in 55 acres of landscaped gardens, which, combined with the spa facilities, makes it a good bet if you're looking for a quiet oasis retreat after the bustle of Marrakech. After a busy day's haggling at the souk, there's nothing quite like a massage followed by a tranquil stroll in the garden or a swim in the pool. It's an all-inclusive resort, and the food is good, with traditional Moroccan tagines a speciality. They do charge you for still mineral water, though, which I thought was a bit mean - the wine is free, so why not the water? For a relaxing, hassle-free mid-winter break, this does very nicely - you can soak up some much-needed sunshine, and the spa makes it a good choice if you're suffering from post-festive-season over- indulgence and in need of a little beautifying. It certainly worked for me, particularly the scary body-scrub - when you shed your old skin, snake-like, you can't help but feel shiny and new. The indignity had been worth every moment - like they say: no pain, no gain. Having completed my treatments, I took my place by the poolside next to the perfectly polished French ladies and felt that, though I say so myself, I'd scrubbed up rather well.
