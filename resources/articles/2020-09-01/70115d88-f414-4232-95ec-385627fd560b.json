They all dutifully wore face coverings. Just nothing else. The socially distanced nude art installation is the work of Spencer Tunick, an artist who has been organising and documenting large crowds of cheerfully naked volunteers for more than 25 years. Commissioned by Sky Arts to mark its transition to a free-for-everyone channel, 220 people from all walks of life, including jobs which have been at the coronavirus frontline, gathered on a by no means warm Saturday morning for the photoshoot. Titled Everyone Together it was, said Sky Arts, the first major participatory artwork since lockdown and a celebration of freedom and participation. For one doctor, taking part was also about a wider health message. The 30-year-old man, who worked in intensive care during the height of the pandemic, said: \u201cI think it\u2019s incredibly important to reach people in different ways about mask-wearing and other precautions than the didactic way that can sometimes happen, so I think this is a great project.\u201d Organisers said the event was scrupulously compliant with Covid-19 guidelines, including temperature checks and being arranged into position, whether standing or flat on their back, in a one-way queue system via megaphone. Tunick said the commission had been \u201cliberating and life-affirming\u201d. He added: \u201cThe reality of masses of people close together \u2013 shoulder to shoulder, skin touching skin \u2013 may be something of the past for now, but still the desire is there for that natural connectivity, perhaps more so now than ever. \u201cThe work is about breaking down barriers.\u201d Philip Edgar-Jones, the director of Sky Arts, said the intention had been to create a landmark cultural moment that invited Covid-safe participation. \u201cWhile the pandemic has presented challenges to the cultural sector, we\u2019ve also seen a great deal of innovation in the arts, and thousands of people have created their own artworks or reconnected with their artistic abilities. The sense that the arts is for a self-selecting group of people is disappearing, and that can only be a good thing.\u201d Sky Arts is available on Freeview and Freesat from Thursday. The channel also announced new programmes, which include an exploration of the right to offend, by Irvine Welsh; the conductor Charles Hazlewood marking the 250th anniversary of the birth of Beethovenand Sky Arts Book Club Live."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
