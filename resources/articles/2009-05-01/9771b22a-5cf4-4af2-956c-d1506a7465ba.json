Harry Cohen has asked us to make clear that he has not made any expense claims under the Additional Costs Allowance relating to the caravan and therefore has not agreed to repay them: there is nothing to repay. \u2022\u2008In an article, Mau Mau veterans sue for colonial abuses (11 May, page 11 and theguardian.com, 10 May), we suggested that more than 150,000 Kenyans were held in detention camps as a result of the uprising against the British colonial administration in the 1950s and early 1960s. We should have said that the figure for the number of people detained between 1952 and 1960 is disputed and that the official estimate is 80,000. We said that books written by the historians Caroline Elkins and David Anderson significantly increased estimates of the number of people who died, but we did not make clear that the death toll is disputed and that Elkins and Anderson do not agree on a figure. Anderson estimates that more than 20,000 people died, while Elkins suggests that 130,000 to 300,000 people are unaccounted for. A 2007 paper by John Blacker in the journal African Affairs challenged Elkins's calculations and provided an alternative estimate of 50,000. The official figure for deaths is 11,000."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
