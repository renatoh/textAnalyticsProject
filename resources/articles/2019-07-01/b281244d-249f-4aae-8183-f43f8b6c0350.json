Scientists have found that goats are able to distinguish emotions from each other\u2019s calls and also respond to the feelings of their peers, a phenomenon known as emotional contagion. \u201cDespite its evolutionary importance, social communication of emotions in non-human animals is still not well understood,\u201d said Luigi Baciadonna, the lead author of the study from Queen Mary University of London. Baciadonna and colleagues selected goats as a promising candidate for having emotional intelligence as previous research had revealed them to be surprisingly clever and to have complex social lives. One experiment had indicated they could distinguish the calls of goat \u201cfriends\u201d from strangers\u2019 calls, raising the question of whether they could also tell how their companions were feeling. \u201cExpressing emotions using vocalisations and being able to detect and share the emotional state of another animal from the same species may facilitate coordination among the individuals in a group and strengthen social bonds and group cohesion,\u201d said Elodie Briefer, a co-author of the study, who was based at ETH Zurich during the research and is now at the University of Copenhagen. The researchers recorded goat calls when the animals were being given food pellets or being reunited with other goats from the herd (happy) and when they were watching another goat eating food pellets without having access to the food themselves (sad). They then played these sounds to other animals and recorded their reaction. They found the goats could distinguish between the different types of calls. They also had different physiological responses depending on the emotion they heard. When listening to positive emotions, the goats\u2019 heart rate became more erratic. \u201cThey potentially can perceive the emotional content and be affected by the emotions of the calls they hear,\u201d said Livio Favaro. \u201cThere might be the first suggestion of emotional contagion through vocalisations.\u201d The findings, published in the journal Frontiers in Zoology, could have implications for the way livestock are housed. Frans de Waal, a primatologist and expert in animal cognition at Emory University, said: \u201cGoats being sensitive to the emotions of others is a form of empathy. Empathy is a mammalian trait, so this makes sense.\u201d Rachel Sparkes, a goat keeper and spokeswoman for the British Goat Society, said the findings were in line with her experience. \u201cI find goats to be much more sensitive to change than other livestock, so it would make sense that they notice emotional changes in the calls from other goats,\u201d she said. \u201cI have found over the years that goats are excellent listeners. They seem able to read human emotions well and if I\u2019m having a bad day the goats will always cheer me up. They know when you\u2019re upset or happy or stressed.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
