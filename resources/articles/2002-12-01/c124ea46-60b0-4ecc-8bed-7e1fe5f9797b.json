Richardson burrowed beneath Ellis's cheap peroxide dye-job and into the poor woman's head to find a complex mixture of survivor and victim, able to be tough for others but not for herself, given to letting her voice rise to a thin, out-of-control screech whenever she was tormented by her rotten lover Rupert Everett. One couldn't help wondering why one had never come across her before, but that was simply because, apart from doing TV like Crown Court and Jackanory, she'd mainly performed on the stage. There was nothing extravagant about her acting, but the rich, often hugely unflattering details she filled the role of Ellis with instantly suggested that there was a great career looming for Richardson. After Dance, one expected her career to thrive mainly in a tragic vein, but thankfully, Richardson was also possessed of a gift for comedy that found a welcoming home in the second, Elizabethan (and still the best) series of Blackadder. Her Queen Elizabeth used the Ellis screech to comic advantage (\"I'm Queen!\"), proving that she functioned as well in a broad register as in a narrowly defined one. Perhaps it's the perfect Peter Pan face, which is admirably mobile and expressive, with great androgynous possibilities etched into the smooth, clean jawline, and eyes that sometimes seem to be looking out from a deep burrow, then just as suddenly bulge with indignation or evil intent. \"What I basically like,\" she has said, \"is doing something I haven't done before.\" And thus she's carved out a rich career as a character player both in Britain and the US, working for the likes of Robert Altman (Kansas City), Robert Duvall (The Apostle), Louis Malle (Damage - a movie she stole as the woman scorned) and Neil Jordan (The Crying Game - bad girl!). She always prefers the interesting part to the starring role, as in Stephen Daldry's forthcoming The Hours, where she's up against Streep, Kidman and Julianne Moore, and will wipe the floor with all of them. She weaves her special web from Friday in David Cronenberg's Spider. Career high: Dance With A Stranger is still her most famous work, but her other great performances must include Damage, an otherwise depthless movie which she walks away with in the last reel. Career low: She's never, ever bad herself, but no one will thank her for lending her integrity to trash like the Get Carter remake, Fatherland, or Tom And Viv. Need to know: Turned down the Glenn Close role in Fatal Attraction, saying it was utterly regressive in its attitudes toward women. Quote: \"I would rather do many small roles on TV, stage or film than one blockbuster that made me rich but had no acting. And if that's the choice I have to make, I think I've already made it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
