For their French manager G\u00e9rard Houllier winning the Uefa Cup by beating Alaves of Vitoria in the Westphalia stadium here will be the most significant step yet in restoring the prestige of the past. \"We've succeeded on the domestic side for our fans,\" Houllier declared last night, \"now we want to do it on the European side for ourselves. What winning the FA Cup meant to our English players on Saturday is what winning in Europe means to me.\" Backed by a good luck message from the prime minister (presumably the English one, not the French) Houllier trusts his team will complete a unique cup treble tonight and then ensure themselves of a place in next season's Champions League qualifiers by winning at Charlton on Saturday to finish third in the Premiership. \"This is part of our progress,\" said Houllier. \"My players have got something about them which makes me believe they can become an extremely formidable side. I know we were not at our best for most of the game in Cardiff, but if you can still win when you are not playing well that must be good.\" Houllier insists there is more to his Liverpool team than lying doggo and waiting for opponents to nod off. Certainly that tactic would invite trouble from an Alaves side which has already disposed of Internazionale in this tournament and also routed Kaiserslautern 9-2 on aggregate. The Spanish team are the mice that roared, coming from nowhere to reach a European final at the first attempt. Michael Owen, on the evidence of eight goals in his last four games, is well capable of adding the Uefa Cup to Anfield's silver collection but will need the belated service he received in the Millennium stadium much earlier this time. While Owen's two goals in five minutes late on in Saturday final provided a breathtaking finish as Arsenal saw their 1-0 lead vanish, Liverpool surely cannot risk handing a similar initiative to the opposition now. Houllier's squad is not short of flair. It is just that he has often adopted a belt-and-braces attitude to his starting line-ups, keeping the better technicians on the bench until it becomes obvious, as it did in Cardiff, that in football there is no substitute for imagination. Certainly the Liverpool manager will invite trouble if he again begins a final with a negative in the hope that something positive will develop. Take away Robbie Fowler's exceptional goal against Birmingham City and Owen's fusillade against Arsenal, and so far Liverpool's overall performances in cup finals this season have been less than memorable. They are due something better tonight but this will only happen if Houllier is prepared to take more risks than he has done so far. If, as is anticipated, Gary McAllister, Patrik Berger and Robbie Fowler stay in the side after coming off the bench on Saturday, Dortmund will see a more positive Liverpool performance. But this would mean starting without Emile Heskey, whom Houllier regards as a talisman. For Alaves the situation looks simpler. \"Winning tomorrow is of tremendous importance in terms of building the future of our club,\" declared their coach Jose Manuel Esnal, better known as Mane, yesterday. \"We don't want to have to fight our way back into Europe all over again next season.\" Mane is expected to deploy Jordi Cruyff behind Javi Moreno, the Spanish League's leading scorer, while encouraging the Alaves full-backs Cosmin Contra and Delfi Geli to attack on the flanks. Having had the worst of it against Arsenal's Patrick Vieira on Saturday, Steven Gerrard will now be required to curb the influence of Ivan Tomic, a busy Yugolsav midfielder, while taking opportunities to go forward himself. Vitoria was the scene of the Duke of Wellington's decisive victory over the French in the Peninsular war. Now a French general has reached the pivotal moment of a European campaign largely through defensive, hit-and-run tactics of which the great duke would have approved. Liverpool ought to beat Alaves to win their first European trophy for 17 years. Their greater pace up front, allied to the solidity at the back of Sami Hyypia and Stephane Henchoz, should successfully counter the opposition's own propensity for striking on the break. But Alaves, given similar scoring chances, would surely accept a greater proportion of them than Arsenal did . And Hyypia probably used up his month's ration of goalline clearances in Cardiff. Liverpool (probable, 4-4-2): Westerveld; Babbel, Henchoz, Hyypia, Carragher; Gerrard, McAllister, Hamann, Berger; Fowler (or Heskey), Owen. Alaves (4-4-1-1): Herrera; Contra, Karmona, Eggen, Geli; Magno, Tomic, Desio, Ibon Begona; Cruyff; Moreno. Referee: G Veissiere (France). \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
