Were they to go ahead, these projects would produce as much capacity as 17 Hazelwood power stations and mean half of Australia\u2019s electricity was supplied by renewables. But many are likely to never get the finance they need, since the government\u2019s 2020 renewable energy target is already set to be exceeded by projects now under construction, according to the latest renewable energy index produced by Green Energy Markets and funded by GetUp. The government\u2019s target is for 33,000GWh to be produced by large-scale renewables by 2020 but wind, solar and bio-energy projects already under construction are likely to produce almost 40,000GWh of electricity by then. The further 27GW of large-scale renewable projects proposed, combined with the expected growth in rooftop solar, would mean just over half of Australia\u2019s electricity supply could be met with renewables by 2030. \u201cMost of these projects will remain dormant until the government puts its long-term Paris agreement commitments into a legally enforceable policy,\u201d the report, authored by Tristan Edis from Green Energy Markets, concludes. The proposed emissions target in the national energy guarantee \u2013 a mere 26% cut in emissions from the national electricity market below 2005 levels by 2030 \u2013 would not provide the policy incentive to get the projects built. It is estimated they would deliver 13,443 jobs during construction, were they to go ahead. \u201cThere\u2019s going to be another investment drought in renewables unless we get better targets than those proposed under Malcolm Turnbull\u2019s NEG,\u201d said Miriam Lyons, energy campaign director at GetUp. \u201cThese are projects that are already under development, that could be sabotaged by our own government\u2019s lack of vision.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
