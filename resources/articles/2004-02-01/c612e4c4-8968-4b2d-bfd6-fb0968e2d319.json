A heavy pre-season investment in new players plus an average home gate of more than 15,000 make Hull's manager Peter Taylor the envy of most First Division clubs and, barring a major accident, will see Hull escape the basement division for the first time in eight years. Indeed, there is little reason why they cannot emulate Brighton's feat of back-to-back championships en route to the First Division. By contrast Carlisle, whose wage bill is less than a third of the side they largely outplayed on Saturday, have finished out of the bottom three only once since 1999, a sorry tale of missed opportunity and wasted investment. Their local-born player-manager Paul Simpson has had to wheel and deal in the free transfer market to bring in the experience of the former Huddersfield defender Kevin Gray and Andy Preece, who put them ahead with his second goal since being dismissed as the player-manager of Bury. What Simpson lacks in financial clout he more than makes up for in endeavour and optimism, but Hull's late equaliser from another Cumbrian in Stuart Green, in addition to the results elsewhere, means that Carlisle remain bottom, nine points adrift of safety. Yet they are unbeaten in their past six home games, which gives them hope of pulling off another act of escapology. \"We've come a long way in a short time,\" Simpson said. \"It's a blow that the other teams around us have won but there are still enough games left to get ourselves out of trouble. If we continue to battle like we have then we'll give ourselves a fighting chance.\" Man of the match: Boaz Myhill (Hull City)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
