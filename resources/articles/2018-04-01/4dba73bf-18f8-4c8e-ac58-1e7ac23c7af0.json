A \u201csafe space\u201d, she calls it, where the pressures of an itinerant housing situation and the legacies of childhood trauma seemed to ease for at least a few hours every day. \u201cStill, though, I was always stressed at school,\u201d she says. \u201cI was worried about falling behind. I guess I acted up a few times. I don\u2019t think my school knew how to deal with it to be honest. I was just lost and they didn\u2019t know what to do with me.\u201d Nelson, now 23, had moved from her home near the small town of Mooroopna in regional Victoria to neighbouring Shepparton, where high youth unemployment and welfare dependency has a symbiotic relationship with one of the state\u2019s worst high school completion rates. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning She moved from place to place, staying with friends. Money was scarce, and all of a sudden that short trip to school \u2013 half an hour on the bus \u2013 became another in a growing list of pressures. \u201cI had to pay for the bus back and forth to school and, it was only a couple of dollars but I couldn\u2019t really afford it, she says. \u201cAnd because I didn\u2019t have a lot of support I got really scared of homework and things like that.\u201d So, at 17, she dropped out. A few months later she fell pregnant. Her mental health deteriorated and she was diagnosed with postnatal depression. \u201cThings got out of hand for a little while,\u201d she says. Located on the Goulburn River in Victoria\u2019s most productive agricultural region, Shepparton has long grappled with a school system beset by inequality. Driven in part by pockets of social housing on the north and south end of town, the area\u2019s high schools have become deeply stratified. That divide has had challenging consequences for three of the town\u2019s four public schools \u2013 since 2008 enrolments have fallen and the proportion of students from low socio-economic and non-English speaking backgrounds has risen. In 2014 the town\u2019s state MP, the independent Suzanna Sheed, spoke in parliament of a pattern of \u201centrenched\u201d disadvantage emerging in the three schools, as middle-class and Anglo Australian parents pulled up stumps. Sheed said disadvantage was being centralised in certain schools, leading to some of the lowest high school completion rates in Victoria. Stories such as Ebony\u2019s go to the heart of a problem that Shepparton \u2013 and towns and cities across Australia \u2013 have struggled with. How do mainstream schools stop at-risk teenagers from disengaging and dropping out? Teresa Deshon, the assistant principal at the independent Berry Street school in Shepparton, says it would take an overhaul of the entire education system for state schools to be able to help the most vulnerable children properly. Berry Street caters for children who have suffered significant trauma and no longer fit the mainstream education model. Its students usually have a history of some combination of physical abuse, sexual abuse, malnourishment, abandonment, drug and alcohol abuse, and crime. The school develops individual learning plans for students, has one teacher for every six students and places a huge emphasis on building trust and relationships with the students. But enrolments are necessarily kept low \u2013 this year the school has 32 students \u2013 and the goal is always to get students back into mainstream schools if possible. \u201cWe find a lot of the students who come through here, when we ask them what would make it easier for them to go back to school, they say \u2018work that I will actually understand\u2019,\u201d Deshon says. \u201cWith big classes, 25 to 30, one teacher who has their training but not necessarily trauma-informed training, they\u2019re doing the best they can, but that system model isn\u2019t really going to work for these sorts of students. \u201cResources and funding in mainstream schools is not there and perhaps the training is not there for teachers to deliver lesson plans at so many different levels.\u201d But at McGuire College, a state school in the heart of one of Shepparton\u2019s most disadvantaged suburbs, teachers and principals are trying to change the way they teach at-risk teenagers. It\u2019s a school of low-slung brick buildings and halls scattered with rose petals from a blossoming garden at the front gate. The school has been a victim of the stratification that Sheed warned of in 2014. In 2008 the school had 658 enrolments. But by 2015, as the school underwent what principal Brad Moyle describes as a period of \u201cinstability and decline\u201d it had fallen to 448. As enrolments fell, the demographic makeup of the school\u2019s cohort began to skew radically more disadvantaged and multicultural. By 2017, 67% of the school\u2019s population came from the bottom socio-economic quartile and 50% from a language background other than English, a 17% increase in less than a decade. Compare that to Notre Dame College, a Catholic school a few kilometres away. Its enrolments have increased from 1,402 in 2008 to 1,673 in 2016. Only 26% of its students come from the bottom socio-economic quartile, and 11% have a language background other than English. \u201cIt\u2019s certainly fair to say it has been a problem,\u201d Moyle says. \u201cWe have students from a really diverse range of backgrounds and some from very challenging backgrounds. We know that the best place for those children to be is at school, so finding ways to keep the kids who might be at risk of disengaging here is one of our biggest challenges.\u201d This year the school introduced what it calls the alternate pathways program in a bid to keep students it identifies as being at risk in school. Using money from the Victorian government\u2019s equity funding program, the school began taking students it could see were struggling with mainstream classes and placing them in a smaller, less conventional classroom setting. The students learn a different curriculum, with a heavier focus on engagement, and are given an individual learning plan. When the Guardian sat in on one of the alternate pathways classes, the students were making stop-motion animation films on iPads. Earlier, they had used graph paper to design their ideal home using a limited number of resources. Teacher Sam Owen is one of the program coordinators. He said the goal was to find ways to make the mainstream education system bend to stop students dropping out. \u201cThe issue is, if you put these kids in a science or maths class they\u2019re going to misbehave or just sit there and not do anything, and usually that\u2019s because they don\u2019t want to put themselves in a position to fail,\u201d Owen says. \u201cIt\u2019s about giving them a chance to engage with learning.\u201d The program also focuses on building trust and relationships with the students, something Owen says did not always happen easily. \u201cEvery kid in there has experienced some sort of emotional or physical trauma in their lives,\u201d he says. \u201cBecause of that their development has been stunted [and] they\u2019re not where they should be in terms of learning, but it also means they have individual issues outside of school. Sometimes it\u2019s about being someone that they can look to and trust.\u201d The program has limitations, of course \u2013 only about a dozen students are currently enrolled \u2013 and it is too early to say whether it will be successful in improving dropout rates. \u201cIt might sound silly, but honestly I think if we can save one kid\u2019s life it will be worth it,\u201d Owen says. Ebony Nelson has begun training at a local TAFE, and hopes to eventually become a counsellor. How does she explain life in Shepparton? \u201cThere isn\u2019t a word,\u201d she says. \u201cChildhood trauma is embedded in every home. Whether you\u2019re rich or you\u2019re poor. I\u2019m a textbook childhood trauma victim, but I guess I\u2019ve learned to process it and deal with it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
