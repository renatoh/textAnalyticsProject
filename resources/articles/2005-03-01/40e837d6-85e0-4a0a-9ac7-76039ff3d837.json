The group was also unable to boost near flat like-for-like sales figures for the six months to January 23 and saw them slip into a 1.9% decline for February. \"We are not panicking,\" said chief executive John Hudson but he admitted: \"February was a disappointment.\" Declines in like-for-like bar sales for the half-year were more than offset by strong earnings from pub meals, which now account for a quarter of Wetherspoon's revenues. However, the move towards lower-margin food sales, combined with slowing bar sales, meant like-for-like profits declined by 5.9%. Pre-tax profits fell 20% to \u00a322.3m, excluding exceptional charges of \u00a38m relating to pub value writedowns on 16 sites earmarked for disposal and to a distribution restructuring. Analysts noted that the disappointing performance came as Wetherspoon's budget beer business model looked increasingly strained. \"The company will have to succumb to cost pressure to raise prices,\" predicted analysts, including Douglas Jack at Panmure Gordon. Margins fell 1.4 percentage points in the half year, to just 8.5%. Mr Jack said this \"continued a trend of falling margins every half-year since 1997 - and is likely to continue into the foreseeable future\". Mr Hudson said the group was reviewing its cost base, considering measures such as cutting pub managers to save costs. The group has an average of 5.5 managers per pub. Meanwhile, the chairman, Tim Martin, said he was pressing ahead with a smoking ban across all 640 of the group's pubs by May 2006. He provided a list of 61 pubs which would be the first to introduce the ban in two months' time. \"Customers are generally becoming more health conscious and there is an increasing desire from staff and customers to avoid passive smoking.\" Mr Martin said an initial two non-smoking pubs, in Exeter and St Albans, had been attracting a slightly different type of customer, with higher wine and food sales. Mr Hudson said only a quarter of the UK population were smokers and claimed there was no reason to believe the figure was any higher among Wetherspoon customers. Nevertheless, the group's decision to press ahead with a self-imposed ban has baffled many other operators and industry analysts.
