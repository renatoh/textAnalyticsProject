Neighbouring mines had to pay bills for crucial equipment including the pumps needed to clear the flooded colliery in south Wales of water, the Guardian has learned. One mine spent \u00a370,000 from its own funds during the rescue operation and a month later has not been compensated. Police officers who were involved in the rescue expressed surprise and concern that there is no central fund to draw on with rescuers instead having to rely on the goodwill of others to pay for such operations as they unfold. Peter Hain, the shadow Welsh secretary and MP for Neath, said that while the bravery of those taking part in the operation was not in doubt, the funding for it had been chaotic. He said the Gleision tragedy highlighted a \"potentially lethal flaw\" in the way mine rescues are organised and funded. Hain submitted a report on Monday to the government on issues raised by the events in the Swansea valley and is calling for a fundamental change to the way mining accidents are dealt with. \"Otherwise, should there be another tragedy, both the rescue and investigation could be badly compromised,\" Hain said in his report. \"Only goodwill prevented that happening at Gleision.\" Since the privatisation of the coal industry the responsibility for rescue operations has been taken on by a limited company called Mines Rescue Service (MSRL). It is approved by the government but is not funded by it. Instead MSRL receives a levy from mines of 18p for each tonne of coal produced and supplements its income by providing training to private companies and public sector organisations. But unlike most other emergency services it does not have access to additional funds when it suddenly needs to pay for extra equipment. In his report Hain said that on the first day of the rescue, when there was optimism the men were still alive, there was a scramble to work out who was going to pay for pumps and the diesel to drive them. Two nearby mines, Aberpergwm, which is owned by American company Walter Energy, and Unity Mine, agreed to help. Hain said the rescue effort was \"effectively being funded from the internal budgets of Walter and Unity\". After the last of the men's bodies was found at 4pm on Friday 16 September, the operation morphed into an investigation, and South Wales police will pay for this part of the effort. A senior police officer involved in the operation also told the Guardian of his surprise when he learned there is no central fund to make sure vital equipment, such as pumps, is available and working. Chief Superintendent Mark Mathias, said he was \"taken aback\" that there had been no central fund to draw on. \"I didn't know it was an issue,\" he said. \"It is a debate that should be had.\" Rhidian Davies, managing director of Aberpergwm Colliery, said there was never any doubt that it would provide men to help with the rescue and the resources to fund it, but it was a scandal that it had to do so. \"It's shocking. We've been saying for years there needs to be a central fund but it falls on deaf ears.\" Accidents following the Gleision tragedy have continued to focus attention on the industry. Last month a man was killed in a roof fall at a colliery in North Yorkshire and on Friday a man had to be rescued from Unity Mine back in south Wales. In his report, Hain says those involved in the Gleision tragedy, including MRSL, \"performed heroically\". But he adds: \"That should not detract from the very serious flaws Gleision has revealed. These must be urgently addressed by the government. We cannot have similar problems arising in the future, especially with an expanding local mining industry due to a significant and growing demand for anthracite mined in the Swansea, Dulais and Neath valleys.\" He is calling for: \u2022 The government to establish its own review of the lessons of Gleision separate from the investigation conducted by the police and the Crown Prosecution Service. \u2022 MRSL to be properly resourced and provided with access to the Treasury reserve so that its rescue and investigation duties can be properly and professionally discharged without the chaos and dependence upon local goodwill evident at Gleision. \u2022 Any attempt to water down or merge mines regulations to be resisted. The Wales Office, which at the time of the tragedy promised that all available resources would be made available, declined to comment on the way the rescue operation was funded. A spokesman said: \"The secretary of state is receiving regular updates as investigations continue into this accident. The Wales Office is working with the relevant Whitehall departments and the emergency services during this ongoing investigation.\" Dave Lumley, finance director for MRSL, said it was common for other mines to provide both manpower and equipment in emergencies like Gleision. He accepted that many mines would prefer the rescue service to be state-funded."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
