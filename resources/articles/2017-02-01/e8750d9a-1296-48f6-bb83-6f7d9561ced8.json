That Liverpool should be on the wrong side of that gap even though \u201cSpursy\u201d, denoting incorrigible flimsiness, is a longstanding entry in the English football lexicon, is a tribute to Pochettino\u2019s redefinition of Tottenham since taking over two and half years ago. \u201cThat opinion makes us very proud because I think Tottenham deserve that respect,\u201d said Pochettino when it was put to him after Saturday\u2019s gradual suppression of Middlesbrough \u2013 not his most spectacular feat but a significant one \u2013 that his team are now regarded as serious title challengers, not just for this season but for years to come. \u201cThat motivates and inspires us to go forward and try to push on. I think we are building a very strong structure, a winning mentality and I think it\u2019s not just the players to speak well of, it\u2019s the whole club.\u201d Pochettino had a head start on Klopp insofar as he has been in his role for more than a year longer than the German has been at Anfield but, given the culture of flakiness that risked engulfing him when he walked into White Hart Lane, it still seems remarkable that he looks closer to building \u201ca bastion of invincibility\u201d, as Bill Shankly famously put it. On one level it is daft to mention Shankly at this stage but, on the other hand, one of the endearing things about Pochettino is that he is unafraid to bugle his grand ambition while \u2013 and this is the most important bit \u2013 putting together a powerful cavalry. It was neither arrogance nor delusion that led to him declaring after the win over humble Middlesbrough that his aim is to make Tottenham one of the finest teams on planet. It was a way of indoctrinating his players, girding them to fulfil their potential. He says they may not quite be there yet \u2013 the nine points separating them from Chelsea make that a statement of the obvious \u2013 but he is confident in the direction of travel. \u201cA few trophies, that would be perfect,\u201d he said of medium-term plans. \u201cBut we can\u2019t get ahead of ourselves. We need to be patient. We need time to try to create a strong team, a strong club, a strong mentality. A winning mentality, finish the new stadium. At that point we will be ready to fight like now but with more tools and to be one of the best teams in the world.\u201d The immediate task is to beat Liverpool in their next match and demonstrate why Spurs are ahead of Klopp\u2019s team. Plainly it is because their foundations are more solid. Spurs may sometimes lack precision in the opposing box \u2013 which is why their only goal in their last two matches, against Sunderland and Middlesbrough, was a penalty by Harry Kane \u2013 but they do not suffer from chronic malfunctions like Liverpool. They can keep clean sheets and that helps keep their minds clear. How many defensive players \u2013 meaning here goalkeeper, defender or deep midfielders \u2013 would Liverpool contribute to a combined XI made up by the two clubs? Maybe Jordan Henderson or Jo\u00ebl Matip on a good day, but probably not. Now come the caveats. For a start, Spurs will be without two of their first-choice defenders on Saturday because Danny Rose and Jan Vertonghen are injured. Ben Davies generally did well at left-back against Boro but looked uncomfortable on the few occasions that Adama Traor\u00e9 ran at him, which was in a dazzling manner that Sadio Man\u00e9 is capable of repeating time after time. Then there is the fact that Liverpool tend to play better against top teams than they do against supposed inferiors \u2013 even in their recent goofy streak their best performances came in the draws against Manchester United and Chelsea and their last league win was against Manchester City at Anfield. Spurs have not won away to a top-six team this season and their only two defeats of the campaign were at Old Trafford and Stamford Bridge. And although Pochettino seems to be leading Spurs inexorably upward, having guided them to fifth- and third-place finishes in his first two seasons and currently has them in second spot with five points more than they had at this stage last season, his young team need to do more to render \u201cSpursy\u201d an entirely antiquated term. They say they have learned from their late loss of the plot in last season\u2019s title race but they froze in this season\u2019s Champions League when they looked like impostors at Wembley. At Anfield they will have an opportunity to stoke belief in them, and spread doubts about Klopp\u2019s team."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
