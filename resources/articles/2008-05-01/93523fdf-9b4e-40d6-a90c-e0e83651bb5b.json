Those who packed Trafalgar Square in London just over two weeks ago claimed their industry faces collapse because new immigration regulations prevent them from addressing critical staff shortages. They said the new points system introduced by the Home Office is blocking the passage of the chefs and kitchen workers they need to import. The sector's vigorous growth, coupled with the ageing of its workforce and the reluctance of their children to go into it, necessitates bringing people in from overseas. According to the Bangladesh Caterers Association (BCA), the 12,000 Bangladeshi restaurants and takeaways that make up its membership turn over \u00a33.5bn a year. It reckons these restaurants have 27,500 vacancies. It boils down to a skills crisis, which is surely just what the complex web of skills quangos built by Labour since 1997 has been designed to tackle. Policies have put employers \"in the driving seat\", to quote a well-worn phrase. Their needs are paramount. So why has this group of employers, in a major industry, not had its skills needs satisfied? Empty courses There is a complex web of reasons, says Jim Armstrong, chief executive of the Professional Association for Catering Education (Pace). College hospitality and catering departments are finding it hard to fill their cooking courses in general, and particularly to recruit students of Asian origin, he says. The latter group is much more likely to be found doing courses in information technology or business. The reluctance among the second generation in Bangladeshi communities to follow their parents into the family restaurant business is readily admitted. Dr Shyam Patiar, who runs a hotel business as well as being director of skills development at Llandrillo College in Colwyn Bay, north Wales, says jokingly: \"I am guilty. I put all my children through private schools to give them a chance.\" His elder daughter is an ear, nose and throat surgeon, her sister is an employment lawyer, and his son is a trader in the City. They did not want to work in a kitchen seven days a week for a fraction of what they can earn with their education. \"Parents like me are unhappy - I want my son to do my own business,\" says Nu-Ur Rahman Khondaka, secretary general of the BCA, who runs the Gandhi Tandoori chain of restaurants in Kent. \"But I created the problem because I made him educated.\" It is an irony that while, thanks to Gordon Ramsay and all the other television chefs, the kitchen arts have never been so admired, they do not appear to hold the same appeal for young British Asians. Any young people wanting to do catering at college with an eye to working in a Bangladeshi or Indian restaurant would usually have little option but to do a national vocational qualification (NVQ) in general cooking. \"The awarding bodies and the curriculum authority do not see any difference between cultures,\" says Armstrong, who used to run hospitality and food management at Thomas Danby College in Leeds. \"If you are peeling a potato you're peeling a potato. The fact that it's for a different culture's cuisine is by the by. The curriculum doesn't necessarily meet the market's needs.\" International slant Some colleges have tweaked the NVQ with a module slanted towards international cuisine, but there is only so far that you can adapt an NVQ, says Gordon Sibbald, Thomas Danby's assistant director of vocational skills. In what are often small family businesses, there has been a preference to bring in chefs and kitchen hands from the sub-continent, and give them the necessary training and work experience on the job. Until the government tightened up immigration rules with its points system, the industry had addressed its growing crisis in this way. But now work permits will not be issued for people who don't have at least a level 3 qualification in their occupation and don't speak English. The aim is to exclude low-skilled workers from beyond the European Union. The BCA and its fellow organisations have asked the government for some temporary flexibility in these requirements. \"You don't need people to speak English who are cooking chicken tikka massala,\" says Khondaka. People 1st, the hospitality sector skills council, is also calling for flexibility. In evidence to the migration advisory committee recently, its chief executive, Brian Wisdom, called on the government to relax its rules to help an industry in serious trouble. Authentic food \"This is needed to satisfy customer demand, which is for authenticity and provenance of the cooking,\" he says. Diners in the highest echelon of Indian restaurants would probably expect to see only Indian chefs and waiting staff, he says. He firmly believes, however, that anyone should be able to train to work in these restaurants. Many restaurateurs agree, and would be happy to get any chefs who could do the job, says Patiar. Some have employed migrants from eastern Europe, but these were generally short-term measures. One man who knows that colour is immaterial is Stephen Duffy, 2008 winner of the national South Asian Chef Competition. \"I'm the only white Caucasian male ever to win this competition,\" he says. He learned his skills running a training school in Bangladesh that was set up by Llandrillo College four years ago. \"We were teaching NVQs to Bangladeshi students coming into this country, and I picked up a lot of knowledge and experience of their food. Learning new cooking techniques and how to control spices that can be quite harsh is so interesting.\" He reckons about 50 students came through the course, not enough to make a material difference to the crisis. Fees were the problem. \"In Bangladesh you are either stinking rich or poverty stricken,\" he says. In response to the restaurateurs' call for an easing of the new restrictions, Gordon Brown indicated a month ago that he was not minded to do so. He said he believed that a \"fair\" position has been reached on immigration. \"We will make it possible for people who are in this country to be trained to be either chefs or restaurant workers in the industry,\" he said. \"We are doing far more to train than ever before. We know there are people who, if trained, could make a contribution to the industry.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
