The Republic of Ireland international has recovered from the dislocated shoulder he suffered against Arsenal at the end of last season but is uncertain of retaining his place in the starting line-up at White Hart Lane. Mancini has alternated between Given and Hart during pre-season but the latter is favourite to start the campaign on Saturday. That decision would have major implications for the 34-year-old, who was bought by the former manager Mark Hughes to replace the then inexperienced Hart in February 2009 and believes his form warrants continued inclusion at the world's richest football club. Speaking ahead of Ireland's friendly against Argentina in Dublin tomorrow night, Given said: \"I'll see how Saturday goes. The manager hasn't picked the team yet obviously and he hasn't spoken to me personally or the team as a whole. I'm just desperate to play on Saturday, I hope I'll play and I'm looking forward to the new season. But if that's not the case then I'll have to speak to the club next week and then decide what the next step is. \"I haven't joined Manchester City to sit on the bench or whatever. I've gone there to play, it's an ambitious club and I'm an ambitious person, I haven't gone there to take it easy and put my feet up. If that's not the case, I suppose I'll sit down on Monday with the club and see where I can go after that.\" Arsenal have been linked with both Hart and Given this summer although, unlike last season's arrangement with Birmingham City, Mancini says he has no intention of allowing the Englishman to leave. Given, who admits the uncertainty over City's goalkeeping position has been unsettling, is receptive to a loan move should his first\u2011team chances diminish at Eastlands, however. The former Newcastle United keeper said: \"I wouldn't say I'd be happy enough to sit on the bench all season and watch the guys play. I'm 34 and you cherish every year, every game really and you don't want to miss any football so, for me, it's very important that I play football. \"I hope to play on Saturday and if that's not the case then we'll speak next week. I know I'm at a very exciting club, a very ambitious club with great owners and great ambition to win trophies. That's why I went there in the first place. If I wasn't to play then possibly a loan thing or something just to get games really, to get playing because that's why you play football. From a young age, you just want to play football. It doesn't matter how old you are or what you've done or haven't done, you just want to play in every game. That's the bottom line for me.\" The City transfer target Mario Balotelli has been told by the new Italy coach, Cesare Prandelli, he will make his first start for the national team against Ivory Coast tonight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
