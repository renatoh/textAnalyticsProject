For this year\u2019s first \u2018celebrity historical\u2019, Chris Chibnall\u2019s Doctor Who continues its noble tradition of celebrating underappreciated figures from history. But shining a light on the pioneering inventor Nikola Tesla, who gave us AC electricity though never achieved due acclaim in his lifetime \u2026 well it\u2019s hardly The Shakespeare Code is it? For those of us largely unbothered by details of electrical current, Night of Terror is a classic story of realising your true potential. This reimagining sees Tesla (in a charismatic performance from ER\u2019s Goran Vi\u0161nji\u0107) targeted for his expertise by unpleasant scorpion race the Skithra. It\u2019s not a great predicament, with the destruction of the Earth a possibility. But his rival, the far more lucrative Thomas Edison, is nevertheless peeved that they didn\u2019t choose him to aid their plot. Edison (Robert Glenister) is portrayed broadly as a twerp \u2013 I don\u2019t know enough about the specifics to be sure if this is accurate, but he does make for a compelling not-quite-baddie. The upshot is an enjoyable enough knockabout, which reaches a frustratingly by-the-numbers resolution after a compelling setup. After the epic scale of Spyfall and last week\u2019s horrorfest Orphan 55, this does rather feel a touch straightforward. But, at the very least, it\u2019s an intriguing history lesson. And lest we forget, that\u2019s one of the things Doctor Who is there for. Life aboard the Tardis The team are getting their fair share of jollies lately, what with last week\u2019s doomed trip to Tranquility and this week\u2019s doomed jaunt on the Orient Express (has the Doctor forgotten what happened last time she boarded that train?) Meanwhile, it\u2019s refreshing to see Yaz given something palpable to do, with her police training proving crucial in resolving this particular pickle. Fear factor Things were never going to match the high watermark of last week\u2019s Dregs \u2013 the scariest beings we\u2019d witnessed in several years. But high-speed giant scorpion monsters the Skithra were still a winningly realised menace \u2026 even if there was something slightly off about their queen\u2019s cockney twang. Mysteries and questions Jodie Whittaker made some interesting comments last week about this year\u2019s supposed big story arc. But she suggested that the foreshadowed mystery of the Timeless Child may not be resolved this series. Speaking on a panel in New York, she said: \u201cI think the beauty of Chris [Chibnall\u2019s] writing is that nothing is an accident \u2026 I think you don\u2019t necessarily always rush to get the answer. So it\u2019s not to say you won\u2019t discover something. You\u2019re not going to be denied.\u201d Not quite curiouser and curiouser then, but certainly an indication that Whittaker and Chibnall are planning on sticking around. Deeper into the vortex Continuity corner: the Skithra have scavenged a gun from lizard-types the Silurians. Definitely better value for the producers than building a whole new prop. The period setting of 1903 New York was recreated in the immersive Bulgarian studio Nu Boyana, the set of London Has Fallen and various Sylvester Stallone movies. It sure keeps up the handsome nature of this current era of Doctor Who. The episode is lifted by some lovely moments of dialogue from writer Nina Metivier, among them: \u201cJust because you\u2019re a genius doesn\u2019t mean you have to figure everything out on your own.\u201d In other Who news, interactive VR experience The Runaway is now available, if you\u2019re one of those people who enjoys using cardboard headsets.
