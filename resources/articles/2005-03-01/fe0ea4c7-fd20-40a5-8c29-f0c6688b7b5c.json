Viewers of Supervolcano (BBC 1 tonight) might point to thrill-seekers with a death wish or professional vulcanologists. But why would a British couple in their 50s, who want to retire early to the sun, move to a Caribbean island famed for its recent volcanic eruptions? Roy and Lottie McDonald do not see themselves as particular risk-takers, despite purchasing a home on the tiny island of Montserrat, where serious volcanic activity over the past decade has wiped out the capital and several villages, killed 19 people and left the 39-square-mile British Overseas Territory temporarily without an airport. Not surprisingly, the population of the island has shrunk from about 11,000 to 4,000, with about 3,500 evacuating to the UK and most of the rest relocating to nearby Antigua. Roy, a former financial services executive, says: 'We lived in Birmingham and everyone thought we were crazy not only for moving abroad but for going to an island that has a live volcano.' While volcanic ash frequently taints the lush-green landscape (enough of it accumulates for some enterprising Monserrations to have established a business converting it into roof tiles) and inhabitants cannot enter an extensive total exclusion zone around the Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano in the south, Montserrat has met all the McDonalds' other requirements. Roy says: 'Having travelled around the Caribbean on holiday for about 15 years, and worked for a spell in Barbados, we always planned to retire here or at least spend six months of the year here. There were only a couple of islands we felt we would like to live on. One was Tobago and the other Montserrat. This was because of low levels of crime, the climate, which is slightly cooler than some of the other islands, and the friendly Montserrations. My view is that although there is some risk because of activity at 6km down, there has been no change in the past two years and things are very quiet. Unless you were told about the volcano you would not know it was here.' The couple sold their Victorian home in Birmingham last year and in November 2004 used part of the proceeds to buy a four-bedroom villa with pool and garage at Olveston, halfway along Montserrat's west coast. They chose a property with three-quarters of an acre of land and spectacular sea views that take in sister islands Redonda, St Peter and Nevis. It cost $210,000 (\u00a3116,666), plus legal costs and a land licence, which added 8.5 per cent (about \u00a39,300) to the bill. The couple benefited from selling when UK house prices were at a high and from buying when the dollar was low against sterling. Roy says: 'One reason for us leaving the UK was that our son was at college in the US and was hoping to get a job there after graduating. He was emphatic that he did not want to come back to the UK. We both felt that in our fifties we were young enough to try something new and there was nothing to hold us back. 'The house, which we renamed Travellers Palm, is large enough to offer bed and breakfast and provides not only some income but enables us to meet different people - useful when you're living on a small island. We set up a website and most of our inquiries come through this as we have a link to the Montserrat Tourist board website. We've already had a lot of visitors from Canada escaping the cold winter.' Their property is three miles from the Soufri\u00e8re Hills, the volcano that in July 1995 stirred into life for the first time in 350 years. The McDonalds' friends may have been sceptical about the couple's choice of destination, but as more of them pay Roy and Lottie a visit, and the volcano enjoys a prolonged peaceful spell, they are being converted. At the moment travellers fly to Antigua and then take a ferry or helicopter to Montserrat. But a new airport will open on the island later this year, allowing speedier access from its larger neighbour. The Princess Royal opened the airport building last month, although the runway has been delayed. Roy says: 'We have just had some friends over from the UK who spent a lot time looking for property as they couldn't believe how nice it was here. There are fewer properties available than when we were looking and prices are rising quite dramatically.' Montserrat makes it relatively easy for overseas buyers to purchase a property or land on which to build a home. You need to buy an 'alien landholder' licence, which must be organised through a local lawyer. Most villas are sold fully furnished and many have fresh-water swimming pools. \u00b7 For up-to-date information on volcanic activity, visit: www.mvo.ms/ www.travellerspalmmontserrat.com www.visitmontserrat.com (includes links to estate agents)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
