Lisbon lawyer Isabel Duarte told Associated Press she was notified of the court\u2019s decision to uphold Gon\u00e7alo Amaral\u2019s appeal against the order to pay Kate and Gerry McCann \u20ac500,000 (\u00a3394,000) in compensation. That ruling was handed down by a lower court in Lisbon a year ago, prompting Amaral to appeal. Duarte said she intended to fight the decision at the supreme court, though she had not yet assembled her legal arguments. Amaral was part of the police investigation into Madeleine\u2019s disappearance from a holiday apartment in Portugal\u2019s Algarve region in May 2007, days before her fourth birthday. In 2008 he published his book about the case called The Truth of the Lie. The McCanns sought \u20ac1.2m in damages from Amaral, saying they were \u201ctotally destroyed\u201d and \u201cdepressed\u201d by Amaral\u2019s allegations, and felt \u201cashamed\u201d that they might appear to have been to blame for their daughter\u2019s disappearance. Amaral had argued in his defence that his claims stemmed from the police investigation and that Portuguese media had already reported the possibility that the parents might have played a role in Madeleine\u2019s disappearance. The appeals court \u201cdecided that [Amaral] had the right to do what he did,\u201d said Duarte. \u201cIt said he can write what he wants. It absolved him, said he didn\u2019t have to pay anything.\u201d The lawyer said the McCanns took the reversal in their stride after a long time battling in Portuguese courts. \u201cThey\u2019re used to it,\u201d Duarte said. Portuguese police closed the case in 2008 because authorities had detected no crime, but British police are still looking into it. Detective chief superintendent Mick Duthie told London\u2019s Evening Standard on Monday that Scotland Yard\u2019s probe was ongoing and officers still hoped to find her alive. In April the Home Office granted the investigation, called Operation Grange, \u00a395,000 to cover another six months of the inquiry. This came after the number of officers working on the operation was scaled down from 29 to four in October 2015. Duthie, who is head of Scotland Yard\u2019s homicide and major crime command, said: \u201cThere is ongoing work. There is always a possibility that we will find Madeleine and we hope that we will find her alive. \u201cThat\u2019s what we want and that\u2019s what the family and the public want and that is why the Home Office continue to fund it. There is work that needs to be done still.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
