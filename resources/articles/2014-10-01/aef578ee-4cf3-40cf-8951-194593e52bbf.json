But for the first time in more than a decade, it will be markets outside the capital that lead the way in price rises, Rightmove said. It predicts that Southampton will see the fastest house price increases in the country, with values expected to jump 43% by 2019 \u2013 adding nearly \u00a3100,000 to local prices \u2013 while Luton, Brighton and Swindon will not be far behind. Rightmove used independent consultancy Oxford Economics to calculate the figures. The driving force for prices in the south-east will be the \u201cspillover\u201d effect of high London prices rippling through the home counties. But Rightmove said the parts of the capital that have seen the greatest price increases in the last five years will see the smallest in the coming five years. It predicts price growth of 13.6% in well-off parts of west London, and it names Enfield in north London \u2013 until now one of the cheapest property areas in the capital \u2013 as the borough that will see the biggest gains. It said average prices in Enfield will rise from \u00a3381,000 to \u00a3531,000 or 39% \u2013 equal to an increase of \u00a3575 every week for the next five years. The prospect of house prices rising at the rate forecast by Rightmove will put homes further and further out of the reach of first time buyers. It said the average price in England and Wales will rise from \u00a3244,192 to \u00a3317,967 \u2013 a gain of \u00a373,775 or \u00a314,755 a year. The report claims to be \u201cthe most comprehensive house price forecast of its kind ever created, based on property and economic data rather than opinion and short-term market factors. It takes into account both asking and sold prices, surveyor valuations and analytics from the Oxford Economics\u2019 global, industry and regional forecasting models.\u201d The figures contrast with widespread reports of a cooling in the property market after the frenetic rate of increases in the past year and a possible rise in interest rates next year. On Thursday, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors said prices in London fell for the first time since January 2011, ending the longest unbroken run of increases in more than 20 years. \u201cFading price momentum is more than just a London story,\u201d it added. Halifax this week said house price growth has peaked and will now grow at a considerably slower pace, while the Centre for Economics and Business Research is forecasting price falls in 2015. But the forecasting model used by Oxford Economics, which includes factors such as a rising population, a poor supply of new homes, and a recovery in incomes, suggests any slowdown could be short-lived. Substantial parts of Britain still have average prices which remain below their 2008 peak and separate figures published on Friday by estate agents Your Move and Reeds Rain show prices have on average risen by 2% a year nationally since the onset of the financial crisis in 2007. Anna Brosnan, head of campaigns at the National Housing Federation, said: \u201cThese new figures make disturbing but predictable reading. Every part of the country, north and south, is feeling the effects of the housing crisis and if we want the situation to improve for the next generation, action needs to be taken now to build more homes at a price people can afford. \u201cWe have found that eight in 10 people don\u2019t believe any of the main political parties will effectively deal with housing. We desperately need politicians from all sides to commit to ending the housing crisis within a generation.\u201d Rightmove/Oxford Economics forecasts Region 2014 Growth 2019 London \u00a3539,903 32.5% \u00a3715,267 East \u00a3252,111 35.6% \u00a3341,791 East Midlands \u00a3138,787 25.0% \u00a3173,503 South West \u00a3198,050 31.8% \u00a3260,938 North West \u00a3140,163 24.3% \u00a3174,289 South East \u00a3275,842 37.3% \u00a3378,636 West Midlands \u00a3152,256 26.5% \u00a3192,644 Wales \u00a3140,294 25.9% \u00a3176,695 Yorkshire and the Humber \u00a3146,440 27.9% \u00a3187,247 North East \u00a3121,852 25.0% \u00a3152,363 National \u00a3244,192 30.2% \u00a3317,967 Fastest forecast growth areas Area 2014 Growth 2019 Southampton \u00a3224,856 42.9% \u00a3321,399 Luton \u00a3197,678 41.0% \u00a3278,734 Brighton \u00a3256,189 40.6% \u00a3360,254 Swindon \u00a3182,159 40.4% \u00a3255,769 Enfield \u00a3381,119 39.5% \u00a3531,483 Slowest forecast growth areas Area 2014 Growth 2019 West London \u00a3935,694 13.6% \u00a31,063,066 Carlisle \u00a3136,720 17.4% \u00a3160,541 Lancaster \u00a3155,183 18.1% \u00a3183,343 Manchester \u00a3144,535 18.8% \u00a3171,744 Northampton \u00a3153,876 20.5% \u00a3185,379"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
