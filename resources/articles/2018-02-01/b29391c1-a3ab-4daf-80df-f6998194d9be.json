Research published in the Lancet Public Health journal provides powerful evidence that people who drink enough to end up in hospital are putting themselves at serious risk of vascular dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease. It will also raise questions for moderate drinkers about the possible long-term consequences of their social habit. The study, which used the French National Hospital Discharge database, looked at more than a million people diagnosed with dementia between 2008 and 2013. More than a third \u2013 38% of the 57,000 cases of early-onset dementia \u2013 were directly alcohol-related and 18% had an additional diagnosis of alcohol use disorders. Overall, alcohol use disorders were associated with a three times greater risk of all types of dementia. Dr Sara Imarisio, head of research at Alzheimer\u2019s Research UK, said: \u201cAs this study only looked at the people who had been admitted to hospital due to chronic heavy drinking, it doesn\u2019t reveal the full extent of the link between alcohol use and dementia risk. Previous research has indicated that even moderate drinking may have a negative impact on brain health and people shouldn\u2019t be under the impression that only drinking to the point of hospitalisation carries a risk.\u201d Experts said the new research should change attitudes. \u201cWhat is most surprising about this paper is that it has taken us so long to recognise that alcohol misuse and dependence are such potent risk factors for the development of dementia,\u201d said Robert Howard, professor of old age psychiatry at University College London. \u201cWe have long known that alcohol is directly neurotoxic, thiamine deficiency in alcoholics devastates memory, alcohol-related conditions such as cirrhosis and epilepsy can damage the brain and that vascular brain damage is accelerated by alcohol. Surprisingly, we\u2019ve not traditionally considered alcohol and its misuse as an important risk factor for dementia and we were clearly wrong not to have done so.\u201d The study was not set up to look at the effects of moderate drinking on people\u2019s dementia risk. But the lead author, Dr Micha\u00ebl Schwarzinger of the Translational Health Economics Network in France, warned that the research showed damage done to the brain by alcohol is never repaired. Heavy drinkers who had given up alcohol for a time did not reduce their dementia risk, even though they were less likely to die early. \u201cIt is very striking that for people who were heavy drinkers and had at least a period of abstinence, the level of risk of dementia is about the same,\u201d he told the Guardian. That is in line with imaging studies that have shown even moderate drinking has a permanent effect. A study published in the British Medical Journal last year found that those who drank 14-21 units a week had three times the normal odds of damage to that part of the brain concerned with memory. Guidance in the UK is not to drink more than 14 units a week. Advice on alcohol and dementia has been confusing. Some studies have suggested that one or two units a day \u2013 perhaps a small glass of wine \u2013 could be protective. But Schwarzinger said they were small studies and he personally would question whether that can be so. \u201cAlcohol is a devastating problem, whatever the organ. Now we can add the brain to the list of liver, kidney and heart,\u201d he said. \u201cA variety of measures are needed, such as reducing availability, increasing taxation, and banning advertising and marketing of alcohol, alongside early detection and treatment of alcohol use disorders.\u201d Prof Clive Ballard of the University of Exeter Medical School, UK, writing a commentary for the journal, said: \u201cTheir study is immensely important and highlights the potential of alcohol use disorders, and possibly alcohol consumption, as modifiable risk factors for dementia prevention \u2026 In our view, this evidence is robust and we should move forward with clear public health messages about the relationship between both alcohol use disorders and alcohol consumption, respectively, and dementia.\u201d Dr James Nicholls, director of policy and research development at Alcohol Research UK, said the concerns raised by the study were very serious. \u201cIf heavy alcohol use increases the risk of dementia then there are enormous social and economic implications,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must recognise that good quality, widely accessible alcohol treatment has important long-term benefits, including reducing the levels of dementia in society. And we must invest in these services, reversing the trend of recent years.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
