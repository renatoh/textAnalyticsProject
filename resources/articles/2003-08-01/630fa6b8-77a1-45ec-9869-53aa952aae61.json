The 20-year-old Swede overwhelmed the home favourite Eunice Barber and, with a final points tally of 7,001, became the first heptathlete since Jackie Joyner-Kersee at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992 to break the 7,000 barrier. Denise Lewis finished fifth with 6,254 points, and though she could feel satisfied with her placing, her dreams of retaining her Olympic title in Athens took a terrible battering - Kluft has pushed the bar way out of her reach. The first day set the tone as Kluft surpassed her best marks in each of the opening four events: the 100m hurdles, shot, high jump and 200m. Her marks of 1.94m in the high jump and 22.99sec in the 200m would have ensured respectability in the individual events. Poor Barber, who was having a decent competition herself, was almost 200 points behind Kluft's first-day tally of 4,143. Kluft had only one crisis to contend with on the second day and that came in the opening event. Chasing a fifth personal best in the long jump, the Swede twice powered down the runway and twice toe-ended the plastic marker. On the second occasion, the official had to bend to show her the minute indentation on the red plastic strip. Facing failure, the Swede, whose father had played football for eight years in the Swedish First Division, moved her starting mark a foot further back, slapped herself by way of encouragement, took off before she reached the board and still jumped 6.68m, seven centimetres longer than Barber and the longest leap in the competition. Kluft's relief was evident. After the distance went up on the scoreboard she went down on her haunches, kissed the ground like a returning exile and for a few moments lay prone on the runway. The anguish over, she returned to her seat and cuddled a small bear, and you were reminded that this was her first year as a senior athlete. There was no personal best in the javelin, but no crisis either. The Swede threw 49.90m, a fraction further than Barber, but sharing the same points total to keep her lead secure at a massive 223 points. With the title secure, her ambition in the final event, the 800m, was two-fold: to surpass 7,000 points and to break Larissa Nikitina's long-standing European record of 7,007. Kluft managed one but not the other - a fifth personal best, 2min 12.12sec, was less than half a second too slow to claim Nikitina's record. Lewis's weekend blew hot and cold. There was a season's best in the hurdles, a passably good shot, javelin and 200m, but the jumps left lots to be desired. She could have come away believing there was something to build on if it had not been for Kluft. Now she may wonder if it's all worth it."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
