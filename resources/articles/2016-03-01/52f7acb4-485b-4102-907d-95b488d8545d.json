We apologize for the hurt we have caused and we look forward to learning and growing from these recent incidents,\u201d it reads. Montague abruptly left the university last month, for reasons that are still unclear. His father said he was \u201cexpelled\u201d, but it is unknown why. The university refused to comment on Montague\u2019s withdrawal due to federal privacy laws around education. Yale police and New Haven police have no record of arrest or court hearing involving Montague. In the weeks since his departure, his teammates actively supported their ex-captain on numerous occasions, during their most successful basketball season in decades. Two weeks ago, during warm-up in a nationally televised game against Harvard, the team wore T-shirts emblazoned with \u201cGucci\u201d (Montague\u2019s nickname) and a \u201c4\u201d (his team number). The Yale Women\u2019s Center released a statement in frustration at the team\u2019s shirt protest, declaring: \u201cWe believe that their actions, and some community members\u2019 responses, reflect toxic attitudes that persist on our campus.\u201d For days after the T-shirt incident, posters appeared around campus criticising the team\u2019s support and declaring \u201cI stand with Yale women\u201d and \u201cStop silencing women.\u201d On Saturday, the dean of Yale College, Jonathan Holloway, emailed all undergraduate students about the on-campus war. \u201cI want you to know that I have been following the public reactions to this week\u2019s events involving the men\u2019s basketball team\u2019s symbolic T-shirts and the posters that appeared on campus in response to them,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI know that many of you are upset and angry, and that you are sharing deeply conflicting views. As you engage with each other, I ask that you also treat each other civilly.\u201d After Saturday night\u2019s game against Columbia, a win that sealed the Ivy League championship and guaranteed the team a berth in the NCAA tournament for the first time since 1962, teammate Justin Sears spoke to reporters about how the team spoke on FaceTime with Montague during a pre-game dinner. \u201cHe\u2019s our leader,\u201d said Sears. \u201cHe\u2019s our captain. He\u2019s still our captain. He knows how to bring people together, he knows how to motivate people and a big reason I\u2019m here is because of him. He\u2019s my brother, he\u2019s all of our brothers and we miss him.\u201d Teammate Khaliq Ghani played Saturday night\u2019s big game with \u201cGucci\u201d written on his wrist tape. Moments after the final siren, teammates held up four fingers in a salute to Montague\u2019s shirt number, according to reports. In today\u2019s apology statement, the team acknowledged its role as public ambassadors. \u201cAs student representatives of Yale we hope to use our positions on and off the court in a way that can make everyone proud,\u201d it read."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
