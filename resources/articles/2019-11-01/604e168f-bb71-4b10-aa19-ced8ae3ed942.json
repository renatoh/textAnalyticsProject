Trump made his remarks while hosting Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, just over a month after the Turkish president launched an offensive into north-eastern Syria, which has been formally condemned as destabilising by state department officials. Sitting alongside Erdo\u011fan, Trump contradicted his own officials and the Republican leadership on a range of issues, most importantly on the US military mission in Syria. In a later press conference, the Trump declared himself a \u201cbig fan\u201d of Erdo\u011fan, and made no criticism of the Turkish incursion. Erdo\u011fan, however, criticised Trump for inviting a Kurdish leader he condemned as a terrorist to the White House. Erdo\u011fan also noted he had returned a letter which Trump had sent to him on 9 October, urging his US counterpart to hold back his Syrian invasion plan. \u201cDon\u2019t be a tough guy. Don\u2019t be a fool!\u201d Trump had said in the letter, which Erdo\u011fan had said showed a \u201clack of respect\u201d. Asked about the letter on Wednesday, Erdo\u011fan \u2013 through a translator \u2013 said: \u201cWe gave back the letter that we have received.\u201d Following Trump\u2019s earlier insistence that his administration was solely interested in \u201ckeeping\u201d Syrian oil, the US military deployed mechanised military units to oil fields in the east of the country. However, seizing or benefiting from oil on a foreign territory, without permission from the sovereign authority, would be a violation of international law. Several US officials had sought to interpret the president\u2019s remarks as meaning the US was denying Isis access to the oil. \u201cOur mission is the enduring defeat of Isis,\u201d the defence secretary, Mark Esper, told reporters on Wednesday, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have about 500 to 600-ish troops there, at the end of the day.\u201d \u201cA way that we ensure the enduring defeat of Isis is deny them access to the oilfields because if they have access to the oil fields, they can generate revenue. If they can generate revenue, then they can pay fighters, they can buy arms, they can conduct operations,\u201d Esper said. On the same day however, Trump repeated his intention that the US should take possession of the oil in the region. \u201cWe\u2019re keeping the oil. We have the oil. The oil is secure. We left troops behind only for the oil,\u201d Trump said. At a joint press conference with Erdogan, the US president said the ceasefire in north-east Syria \u201cwhile complicated, is moving forward and moving forward at a very rapid clip\u201d. Erdo\u011fan praised Trump, describing him as \u201ca dear friend\u201d, but went on to denounce the US partnership with Syrian Kurdish forces. Both parties in Congress have condemned the Turkish incursion and threatened sanctions unless it is reversed. US officials have describe it as unwelcome and destabilising. In the run-up to Erdo\u011fan\u2019s controversial visit to Washington, senior officials expressed concern about reported war crimes committed by Turkish-backed Arab militias spearheading the offensive. One senior official told reporters that the US held Ankara responsible. However, sitting alongside Erdo\u011fan, Trump said: \u201cI want to thank the president for the job they\u2019ve done.\u201d \u201cThe president and I have been very good friends, we\u2019ve been friends for a long time \u2013 almost from day one,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI understand the problems that they\u2019ve had, including many people from Turkey being killed, in the area that we\u2019re talking about.\u201d It is unclear what the president meant. Turks have not been killed in significant numbers in north-eastern Syria, nor is there evidence of attacks on Turkey being launched from the area. There are strong links between the Kurdish People\u2019s Protection units (YPG), the main force in the SDF, and the insurgent Kurdistan Workers\u2019 party (PKK), which has carried out attacks inside Turkey. In blunt remarks in the White House on Wednesday, Erdo\u011fan criticised Trump for inviting the SDF leader Mazloum Kobani, (to whom he referred by his birth name, Ferhat Abdi \u015eahin) to the White House. Noting his PKK links, Erdo\u011fan blamed Mazloum for hundreds of civilian deaths and said: \u201cA person like this should not be welcomed by a country such as the United States.\u201d It is not the administration\u2019s official position that PKK attacks justify the incursion into Syria. Officials including Jeffrey have criticised Turkey for abandoning a joint security mechanism agreed with the US, and invading the safe zone along the border that mechanism was intended to safeguard. Challenged by a Turkish reporter about US links with the YPG despite its ties to the PKK, Trump said that the US had \u201ca great relationship with the Kurds\u201d, adding: \u201cA lot of that is definition \u2013 what\u2019s your definition of the various groups within the Kurds. You have various groups and some like them and some don\u2019t.\u201d But he shrugged off the broader concerns voiced by administration officials and Republican leaders about the Turkish invasion. \u201cIt\u2019s time for us not to be worried about other people\u2019s borders. I want to worry about our borders,\u201d the president said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
