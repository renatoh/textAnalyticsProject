This was their fourth consecutive win and takes them clear fifth in the table while the Tigers will now almost certainly drop out of the top six tomorrow. The build-up to the match had been dominated by the decision of Castleford's captain Danny Orr to turn down a new contract with the Tigers and move to either Hull or Wigan next season. There were more boos than cheers when Orr's name was announced before the kick-off but he could hardly have done more in the first half to show his continuing commitment to his hometown club, although it was not enough to stop St Helens leading 24-14 at the break. Orr scored all of Castleford's points starting with an eighth-minute penalty. But Saints responded with a try in their first attack as Sean Long broke the line to send his half-back partner Mickey Higham over, and the pattern of the half was established. Cas took the lead again with Orr's first try, a straightforward finish from close range after Ryan Hudson had surprised Saints by running the ball on the sixth tackle. However it took the champions less than two minutes to breach the Tigers' defence again, with the Australian veterans Darren Britt and Darren Smith combining to send Paul Wellens over. Orr put Cas ahead again in the 29th minute, this time after Hudson had charged down a Paul Sculthorpe kick. But Sculthorpe made amends for that error with a break to send Wellens over for his second and just before half-time another delicate pass by the big prop Britt sent the Great Britain centre Martin Gleeson streaking clear from 50 metres to give Saints some breathing space for the first time. They seemed to have moved out of sight with two more tries in the first seven minutes of the second half. Darren Albert scored the first after Higham had picked up a loose ball inside his own half, then the Australian wing took a long pass from Sculthorpe to send Gleeson between the posts for his second touchdown. But Cas kept competing, cutting the deficit to 26-36 with two tries in five minutes from Michael Smith and Tommy Saxton with Orr, inevitably, involved in the build-up to one and converting them both. Hudson then went within inches of another Tigers' try, with Saints saved only by a superb tackle from Sculthorpe. Instead a barnstorming charge by Keiron Cunningham sent Higham over for his second to remove any doubts about the outcome, with Long claiming a 50-metre interception try to rub it in. Fittingly, Orr had the last word with his third try, which he converted to complete a personal tally of 24 points. oBradford piled on the misery for their local rivals Halifax with a 60-12 romp at The Shay. It was Fax's 17th consecutive defeat, with the win taking the Bulls back within two points of Leeds at the top of the table.
