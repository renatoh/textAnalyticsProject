The study, by online learning resource Learndirect, found that men prioritise financial rewards in their decision to pursue a new job, whereas women are driven more by job satisfaction and the chance to do something socially worthwhile. These attitudes are reflected in the jobs that proved most popular among those retraining in 2004. Men tended to favour industries with current skills shortages and so the potential for financial rewards, whereas women preferred jobs in the social sector. The four most popular courses among men were plumbing, electrical installation, plastering and construction - sectors which all offer relatively high rates of pay. Male respondents to the survey also said that they were more motivated by the prospect of eventual self-employment and the practical nature of such work. Four of the top five most popular courses among women were in health and education. The training favoured most by women was for jobs in childcare, nursery and midwifery, teaching, beauty therapy and as classroom assistants. The research also highlighted an increase in the popularity of social sector courses among women working in the private sector and desiring a more socially worthwhile role. The fifth most popular type of training course among men was in basic skills of numeracy and literacy, which were not as in demand among women. The study was based upon calls received by Learndirect during 2004 and the reasons given by callers for their course requests. Money was identified by 40% of male respondents as their primary concern in switching career. And among women, 22% of those employed in the private sector stated a wish to move into the public sector and do more meaningful work helping others. Gareth Dent, head of advice services at Learndirect, said that the research might reflect the fact that men tend to be less proactive in their decision to retrain. He said: \"A lot of the men who ring us do so because they have been forced to consider their position because of external factors such as redundancy. \"Women on the other hand are often more proactive. For example, after a break from work to have children, they will reconsider their position and really think about what kind of work would suit them most.\" Mr Dent added: \"There's also the factor that there is a traditional expectation of the man as the breadwinner, although I'm surprised the differences are so great in what is supposedly the 21st century.\" Consumer psychologist Sue Keane said that men and women have different attitudes to work, which is reflected in their decisions about what training to pursue. \"Both men and women want to be paid well for a job well done and job satisfaction is important to both sexes. However, when talking about their work, men are much more likely to tell you about their position, prospects and recent successes, whereas women are more likely to tell you about the people they meet at work and the funny things that happened.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
