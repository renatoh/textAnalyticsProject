It is understood to have less than \u00a31m left and has recently been burning cash at a rate of \u00a3750,000 a month. The directors have called in accountants PricewaterhouseCoopers to provide an assessment of the viability of the business. The TV channel, which is broadcast on Sky Digital, was started in 1999 to provide financial advice to small investors on subjects including pension planning and investment in shares, but it has failed to win the audiences required to keep advertisers happy. An interactive advertising service, which allows viewers to respond to ads at the click of the remote control, was introduced last year. Yesterday a spokesman for the channel said the new service had performed well, but not well enough to prevent a shortfall in working capital. The Money Channel floated in 1999 at 22p but within six months were changing hands at 500p. They crashed at the beginning of last year. Yesterday, when the shares were suspended, they were down another 0.5p to 13p. Mr Faith is no longer closely involved in the company, but retains a 9.15% stake."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
