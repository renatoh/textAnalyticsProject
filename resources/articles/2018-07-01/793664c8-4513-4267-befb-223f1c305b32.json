Banks has acknowledged paying money in to the private bank account of Thesele Masirebane, a minister in the southern African country\u2019s government but denied it was a bribe. According to various reports the Brexit backer developed a relationship with Masirebane in 2013 and 2014 \u2013 when Banks was seeking permission to search for diamonds in Lesotho. He reportedly paid money to the minister personally, helped fund political campaigning and provided support after a coup in 2014. In an interview with the BBC, Banks acknowledged making payments to Masirebane. Asked if that was appropriate, he said: \u201cYes, we were doing a specific job.\u201d He said doing so was \u201cnot corruption at all\u201d. Banks said Masirebane was the \u201cminister for women\u2019s equality\u201d, adding he did not \u201cquite see how you link\u201d mining and the minister\u2019s portfolio. According to Channel 4 News, payments from Banks to Masirebane in South African rand were arranged by the minister\u2019s daughter, Moss Masirebane, in December 2013. In February the following year, she told Banks by email: \u201cMy father had meeting with the minister of minings and our application has been approved.\u201d Banks reportedly replied: \u201cFinally \u2013 now the fun begins.\u201d According to the BBC, Banks transferred \u00a365,000 into Maseribane\u2019s personal bank account in South Africa in 2013 and covered the \u00a3350,000 cost of his campaign rallies. Maseribane rejected allegations of bribery or any wrongdoing. He acknowledged to both the BBC and Channel 4 News that he had received money from the British businessman and said he and Banks were good friends. He told Channel 4 News the reference to \u201cour application\u201d in his daughter\u2019s email did not suggest he was involved in helping Banks gain a prospecting licence for his mine in Lesotho. \u201c\u2018Our application\u2019 can be implicated in so many ways. The application was, information will be relayed to Arron,\u201d he said. Maseribane added that he \u201cjust wanted to know how far [Banks\u2019] application\u201d had got because the men were friends. A South African anti-corruption investigator, Paul O\u2019Sullivan, told the BBC he intended to pass a file on the case to the prosecutors in that country, as well as to the UK\u2019s Serious Fraud Office. \u201cIf you are paying the rent, buying food, and financially supporting politicians who could influence and further your own business interests, then there are clear signs of corruption at play,\u201d O\u2019Sullivan said. \u201cPutting money into the private bank account of a government minister also raises questions. There is a serious lack of transparency. I will be filing a docket, a criminal complaint here in South Africa and I will be sending a file to the Serious Fraud Office in the UK.\u201d A spokesman for Banks has not responded to the Guardian\u2019s request for comment. In a statement given to Channel 4 News, Banks said: \u201cOur mining activities in Lesotho were restricted to one licence where we have undertaken exploration work ... We absolutely refute the allegation that payments made to Mr Masirebane were made for granting of any licences. We have made four such applications for licences in Lesotho all of which are outstanding, two years after the original applications, for the very reason we were not prepared to make such payments.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
