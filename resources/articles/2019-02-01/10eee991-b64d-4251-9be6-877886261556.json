We said a party formed midway through a parliament could have official funding \u2013 the so-called \u201cShort money\u201d used to support Commons opposition. Such a party would not be eligible (It\u2019s not yet party time but the intention is clear, 19 February, page 9). A recent Sky Data poll showed the Conservatives\u2019 vote share at 32%, not 23% (We now have a real opposition to Brexit, 21 February, page 5, Journal). And a picture captioned as showing the three Tories who resigned last Wednesday showed only two: Heidi Allen and Anna Soubry. The third figure was Joan Ryan, who defected from Labour that day (The ideas of the breakaway MPs are of the past, not the future, 21 February, page 4, Opinion). \u2022 Other recently corrected articles include: Revealed: asthma\u2019s deadly toll on young people in the UK Peter Tork obituary Winter storms bring rare snowfall to Las Vegas and Los Angeles"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
