Whyman is using the Swan for its original purpose \u2013 to show work by Shakespeare's contemporaries \u2013 and is featuring plays that give women a good shout. Maria Aberg's production of The White Devil does exactly that. With mixed results. Webster's lurid, muddling, and occasionally dazzling drama was a flop on its first showing. Which is hardly surprising. The body count is enticingly high, but it is not always clear how it is reached. The plot, which takes off from adultery, incorporates sibling seething, stabbings and an episode involving a dead child and the distribution of rosemary that looks like a straight lift from Hamlet. One of its most ingenious aspects is its inventive way with murder devices. What could be more skewering than a portrait impregnated with poison, ensuring the death of the adoring lover who gazes on it? It is almost worth the whole play for that bitter neatness. Aberg alights on the contradictory nature of the play, which blazes with misogynist statements while giving some of its most towering speeches to women. She cleverly makes the ambiguous villain a woman, played by Laura Elphinstone with slicked-backed hair, a slimy approach and sinuous intelligence. She enables a performance of full-throttle ambiguity from Kirsty Bushell, who skulks and explodes as the adulteress. Yet she undermines her feminist message \u2013 making it look imposed not innate - through anxious updating and overemphasis, with ra-ra skirts and a video that features a lolling tongue and pearls. With his dark dealings neon-lit, Webster looks splashy rather than searing. \u2022 Until 29 November. Box office: 0844 800 1110. Venue: The Swan, Stratford-upon-Avon"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
