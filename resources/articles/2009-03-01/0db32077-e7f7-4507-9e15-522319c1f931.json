Saints, who are aiming for a fourth successive victory, will travel to Headingley in a repeat of the 2007 and 2008 Grand Finals, one of five all-Super League clashes in the last 32. \"It doesn't get much tougher than that. We might as well get it on in the early rounds,\" Leeds coach Brian McClennan said. \"It's going to be a tough one and we'll look forward to it. I'm sure they'll be pretty excited about this too.\" In the other all-Super League ties, Hull, the 2005 winners, have been drawn at home to Salford, Huddersfield go to Harlequins and Hull KR are at home to newcomers Celtic Crusaders, who visit Craven Park in a dress rehearsal next Sunday. Bradford also face a dummy run when they take on the Catalans Dragons in Perpignan on Saturday, March 21. The other French survivors, Lezignan, face a trip to Championship One club Oldham while Wath Brow Hornets, the only amateur team certain to be in the fourth round, have been handed a trip to Featherstone."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
