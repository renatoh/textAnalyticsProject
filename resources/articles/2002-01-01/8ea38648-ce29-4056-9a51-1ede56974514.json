Pettersson, who was European Amateur champion two years ago, leads the year's first European Tour event by two strokes from a group that includes the Englishman Andrew Butterfield and the Scot Alistair Forsyth. The local hero, the US Open champion Retief Goosen, is a shot further back after a 67, one better than Scotland's former Open champion Paul Lawrie and a large group at four under. Significantly, perhaps, Butterfield, a recent qualifier at the European Tour school, was the only man in the top 10 to post his score in the afternoon when the wind got up and the greens waxed tougher under a hot sun. Pettersson was on the 10th tee (his first) at 7.10am and birdied his first hole of the year on his way to a back nine of 31. He played the tougher front nine in three under and set a mark that never looked like being beaten. Like Pettersson, Lawrie began his round at the par-five 10th, but hit a terrible tee shot and scrambled to a six. That seemed to concentrate his mind, however, and he birdied the next four holes and lipped out for five in a row. Goosen, whose new level of play has clearly affected his reason, said after his five-under round: \"I played pretty terribly today. I either missed the fairway off the tee or I missed the green with the irons.\" When pressed, he admitted he had hit some good shots as well. \"My chipping saved me today. I got it up and down so many times on the front nine. I had 10 putts in nine holes and I don't know if I've done that before.\" But his compatriot Ernie Els managed only a one-over 73, as did the defending champion Mark McNulty. Justin Rose, last year's runner-up, began with a one-under 71."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
