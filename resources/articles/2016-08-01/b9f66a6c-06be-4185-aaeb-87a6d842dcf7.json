Across our continent, it is suffering reverse after reverse before the onslaught of violent jihadism, which in turn can provoke Islamophobia. In vain do European liberal leaders \u2013 politicians, philosophers, civic officials and even some journalists \u2013 counsel against stigmatising an entire religion for each successive crazed killing. The wider population is less willing to hear pleas to hold its nerve. Muslims should be confronted and stigmatised. Let there be a clash of civilisations. I told a close friend I was planning to write about the several French seaside resorts that have banned the burkini, backed by the prime minister, Manuel Valls, and Germany\u2019s proposed partial ban on wearing the burqa in public places. This comes with the gathering strength of mainstream feeling in both countries that they need to affirm their secular values and identity, not least to close down opportunities for the extreme right. I don\u2019t get it, my friend said, anticipating my argument. Yes, many Muslims share our values. But liberals like you connive in not condemning a religion and culture, dimensions of which are offensive not just to what you believe in, but to any conception of universal human values. Islam \u2013 or versions of it \u2013 either indulges or actively supports misogyny, homophobia, medieval conceptions of justice, stoning, genital mutilation and oppression of women. Women covering their bodies in public is not even required by the Qur\u2019an. It is rank oppression of women by men. Yet it is left to the populist right to acknowledge these truths. Liberals like you plead for tolerance of the intolerable. We don\u2019t. Of course those illiberal dimensions are damnable and offend not just the canons of a liberal society but of any statement of universal human rights and values. One might also agree with the German interior minister who argued that burqas undermine social cohesion and are intrinsically divisive. The same is true of covering up on the beach. But is the best way to respond by descending into bans? Is it right, desirable or likely to be effective? Who ever won or wants such a clash of civilisations? It has become fashionable to lampoon multiculturalism and its respect for diversity as a source of our problems in Britain. But assimilationist, anti-multicultural France, which banned wearing the burqa six years ago, finds itself as the epicentre of Islamic terrorist attacks in Europe. The first waves of Muslim immigrants into France (from North Africa), into Germany (from Turkey) and Britain (from Pakistan and Bangladesh) were broadly secular; mosque attendance was minimal. Today in all three countries it is rising, as is the wearing of symbols of religious and ethnic identity. That\u2019s the case whether a country has championed multiculturalism, as in Germany or Britain, or assimilation, as in France. Identity, in 2016, has come to matter more, not less, for both Muslims and wider populations alike. Until that changes, the chances of an internal revolution in Islamic cultural attitudes \u2013 towards women, gays, justice and even tolerance to other religions \u2013 are minimal. The rise of identity politics is fundamental. Contemporary western societies have become very weak in offering their citizens meaning. The French writer Michel Houellebecq, whose bestselling book, Submission, in which an Islamicised France in 2022 meekly accepts the veiling of women, sharia and the compulsory teaching of Islam in schools, says that Enlightenment man and woman live barren and empty lives. The ease with which his imaginary Islamic president, Ben Abbes, elected by a coalition of left and centrist parties to block Marine Le Pen, is able to impose Islamicisation on France is down to the degenerate nature of French society itself. Or so runs the novel\u2019s argument. The elite feather their nests in remote, amoral companies, while the rest are left to fend for themselves in a world of cold suburbs and weak civic and social institutions, consoled by shopping, drugs, casual sex and the silos of social media. Abbes has a purpose and mission before which France is defenceless. This is fiction \u2013 but illuminating. A teacher of my acquaintance, in a once thriving Welsh mining and steel town, said how shocked she was at the scale of the casual misogyny, homophobia and anti-immigrant/anti-Islam prejudice she encountered among parents, children and even some teachers. The strong trade unions and chapels that had sustained better values had almost disappeared. Inevitably, the town voted for Brexit, even though, as a major recipient of EU money, it would create recession and misery. What mattered was identity. Successful liberal societies depend on multiple civic and social bodies, charged with purpose, that embody liberal values, from trade unions to sports clubs, employee-owned companies to libraries. Supporting them gives a meaning to lives and an inner self-confidence that lessens the imagined threat from diverse others and makes people readier to hear invocations to citizenship and universal values. What went wrong with multiculturalism, as Kenan Malik argues in a fine article in Foreign Affairs, is not its respect for diversity. Rather, as implemented, it created a network of competing monocultures fostering antagonistic separateness. Equally, what has gone wrong in France, with its belief in assimilation, is not the commitment to universal values. Rather, it is that such statements are cast as those of the majority \u201ctribe\u201d confronting a hostile other in a sort of war, the language too readily deployed in France. Muslims are not part of the tribe. Both mistakes should be avoided and the good components built on. What is required is not burqa and burkini bans or, indeed, measures in Britain such as Prevent, which, for all its apparent rational intent to close down opportunities for hate speech, only stigmatises Muslims as \u201cother\u201d. Instead, we need continual clarion calls to uphold universal values and a characterisation of jihadism as conducted by the deranged who need medical treatment, rather than legitimisation as warlords. We also need an insistence on mutual tolerance as the only long-term solution and a huge effort to create economic and social institutions that offer more meaning for the mass of our citizenry. If that is pie in the sky, the alternative is a war of civilisations and, with it, the collapse of liberal society. Nobody, I hope, wants that."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
