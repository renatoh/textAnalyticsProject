Labour\u2019s democratic left has for too long been defined by other currents in the party and has been without any form of organisation. The elections of Ed Miliband and now Jeremy Corbyn have not changed that. Now is the time for those who believe in equality, democracy, solidarity and the emancipating power of the left to come together. Open Labour believes that there must be a place within Labour to debate and shape these values in a respectful way, free from the divisive and intolerant voices that have come to dominate Labour debate, especially on social media. The need for a renewed democratic left within the party is clear. This debate cannot be reduced to how \u201cleft\u201d or \u201cright\u201d Labour is. It is about how we tie our opposition to austerity and concentrations of power to a strategy where we persuade those who haven\u2019t yet felt the confidence to vote for us. Open Labour is a grassroots-powered organisation and will stay that way. It will argue for and practise a new style of left politics which is tolerant, forward-looking and seeks power for a purpose. We urge anyone who sees truth in this letter to visit openlabour.org and join us.

The same accusation could be levelled at his dysfunctional definition of progressive politics. Surely we need to question the forces and motivations behind the nature, pace and shape of the insistent changing world he is so in thrall to. Change, whether socially, economically, politically or militarily, does not happen in a vacuum, it is informed by specific interests, objectives and outlooks \u2013 all of them human but not all of them benign. Global conflict and terrorism, financial meltdown, climate change and the ruinous consequences of ever-widening economic inequalities (often interchangeable) are testament to that. The job of progressive politics is not to embrace that as inevitable or preordained, consigning itself to forever adapt; it is to challenge it relentlessly and become an engine for change of a different kind \u2013 always for the greater good. Whether Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s new politics is the right vehicle to achieve that goal is debatable, but anything is better than a life spent dancing to someone else\u2019s tune. Colin Montgomery Edinburgh \u2022 It is ironic that Labour\u2019s latest divisions are attributed solely to the leader while a minority bullied its way to a free vote on bombing in Syria defying clear majorities in the party. Serious analysis of how Labour re-unites to present a decent and credible alternative government is long overdue. Hoping for a quick-fix new leader a la Hilary Benn is not sufficient. Even he, for all his great oratory, failed to address the credibility of the Syrian post-bombing \u201cplan\u201d, which is no more than an expression of hope for miraculous conversions of unreliable allies and relentless antagonists. The key to unlocking Labour\u2019s path back to power is to bridge the huge gulf generally existing between the party in parliament and the rest. The key is neither solely in the left nor right hand. It is in the decent yearning of most people that rejects the extremes of current Toryism but favours socially useful economic expansion to improve living standards and secure equitable deficit reduction. It opposes further damaging indulgence of the worlds of finance, debt and property booms. It supports fair taxation and recognises the damage of much privatisation and the need to tackle unregulated globalisation and dysfunctional corporations. It believes in the public control of well-resourced and efficient public services capable of reform within a democratic framework. The likelihood of Jeremy Corbyn converting such good policies into a general election victory could then be assessed in two to three years\u2019 time. Nigel de Gruchy Orpington, Kent \u2022 I am totally confused by the complaints about deselection of MPs (Report, 3 December). If the argument is that MPs who lose the confidence of their own constituency parties should not be held to account, then Labour MPs after their first successful election campaign would have a job for life no matter how much their attitudes and behaviour changed and opposed the views of the party membership. In the New Labour era, selection of parliamentary candidates was determined by the party centrally. Constituencies could select any candidate they wanted as long as he was a New Labour clone. It is strange to see the beneficiaries of this gerrymandering whingeing now about unfair practices. Although there is no justification for deselecting MPs at this stage of parliament, before the next election every Labour MP should have their performance reviewed and those whose performance is found wanting should be deselected. Almost everyone else faces the same sort of examination as part of their employment. No one has a job for life, apart from MPs in safe Labour seats apparently. John Cookson Bournemouth \u2022 When a leftwing grassroots movement seeks to influence Labour party policy and hold its MPs to account, it\u2019s called entryism (Momentum could yet save the Labour party \u2013 or sink it, 9 December). When a rightwing faction of Labour MPs largely funded by Lord Sainsbury seeks to influence policy and puts pressure on local parties to select its preferred candidates for vacant parliamentary seats, it\u2019s called Progress. Dr David Kiernan Barnsley \u2022 John Harris identifies a new demon group of Labour returners as \u201cwhite, male and over 55\u201d. Happy to be still able to lurk under the radar as a re-energised Hiberno-Scottish old bat.
