As the number of confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths continued to rise, Trump spent public appearances repeatedly talking about a dubious treatment and an economic comeback. The president claimed a recent US study indicating hydroxychloroquine was not an effective coronavirus treatment was a \u201cTrump enemy statement\u201d. \u201cIf you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThey were very old. Almost dead. It was a Trump enemy statement.\u201d There have only been limited studies on the drug in relation to Covid-19 so far. A spokeswoman for the president confirmed he is taking the malaria drug as a defense against Covid-19. The confirmation came hours after the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, expressed alarm that Trump was taking the drug since he is \u201cmorbidly obese\u201d, in her words. At the White House, the press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, told CBS News Trump was taking hydroxychloroquine. \u201cI can absolutely confirm that,\u201d she said. \u201cThe president said himself he\u2019s taking it. That\u2019s a given fact. He said it. The president should be taken at his word.\u201d Trump told reporters at the White House on Monday that for \u201ca couple weeks\u201d he had been taking hydroxychloroquine, which he first touted as a Covid-19 treatment in March, before the FDA warned that the drug could cause irregular heartbeats and other cardiac trouble. The FDA has approved the drug for the treatment of malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. \u201cYou\u2019d be surprised at how many people are taking it. The frontline workers, many, many are taking it,\u201d Trump said on Monday. On Tuesday, McEnany told Fox News: \u201cAny use of hydroxychloroquine has to be in consultation with your doctor. You have to have a prescription. That\u2019s the way it must be done.\u201d The White House on Monday issued a statement by Sean Conley, Trump\u2019s doctor, which read: \u201cAfter numerous discussions he and I had regarding the evidence for and against the use of hydroxychloroquine, we concluded the potential benefit from treatment outweighed the relevant risks.\u201d Trump then falsely claimed that evidence suggests hydroxychloroquine does not have negative side effects. \u201cWhat has been determined is it doesn\u2019t harm you.\u201d In reality, the FDA has said hydroxychloroquine should only be used as a coronavirus treatment in hopsital settings, due to \u201creports of serious heart rhythm problems\u201d in virus patients who had received the drug. When a reporter mentioned the FDA guidance, Trump said, \u201cThat\u2019s not what I was told.\u201d But Pelosi has expressed alarm. \u201cHe\u2019s our president, and I would rather he not be taking something that has not been approved by the scientists, especially in his age group and his, shall we say, weight group,\u201d the House speaker, 80, told CNN of Trump, 73, on Monday evening. \u201cMorbidly obese, they say. So, I think it\u2019s not a good idea.\u201d Trump is obese, as the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines the term, but he does not appear to qualify as \u201cextremely obese\u201d, the top category. The ambiguity stems from unreliable data, as Trump tends to exaggerate his height and lowball his weight. The FDA advised in April that hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine \u201chave not been shown to be safe and effective for treating or preventing Covid-19\u201d. \u201cWhile clinical trials are ongoing to determine the safety and effectiveness of these drugs for Covid-19, there are known side effects of these medications that should be considered,\u201d the FDA commissioner, Stephen Hahn, said then. The FDA has not updated that guidance. Experts warned that Trump\u2019s claim to be taking the drug could lead to a spike in demand, potentially making it harder for vulnerable patients who need the drug to fill prescriptions. After Trump hyped the drug in March, an Arizona man died from ingesting a form of chloroquine used to clean fish tanks. \u201cWe saw Trump on TV \u2013 every channel \u2013 and all of his buddies said that this was safe,\u201d the man\u2019s wife, who also ingested the drug, told NBC. \u201cTrump kept saying it was basically pretty much a cure.\u201d On Monday night a Fox News host, Neil Cavuto, expressed his concern, telling viewers: \u201cI only make this not to make a political point here, but a life-and-death point. Be very, very careful.\u201d Fox News opinion hosts Laura Ingraham, Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity swung behind the president but Trump was angered nonetheless, retweeting one Twitter user who called Cavuto an \u201casshole\u201d. Trump also bemoaned the network\u2019s output since the departure of Roger Ailes, who resigned as chairman and chief executive in disgrace, after being credibly accused of sexual harassment. Ailes died in 2017. Last month, Trump, who has declined to wear a mask as a basic prophylactic measure against the virus\u2019s spread, riffed from the White House podium that \u201cpowerful light\u201d and \u201cdisinfectant\u201d could be potential Covid-19 treatments, prompting warnings from manufacturers of some cleaning products. Those comments coincided with a spike in calls to poison control centers and prompted US disinfectant manufacturers to issue warnings that their products should not be ingested."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
