It's definitely a good feeling to be away for a bit - I'm really starting to get excited about recommencing my travels in a few weeks time. My mum and I headed into the city early(ish) to explore Queen Victoria markets - another of the many Australian places named after English people/places. The markets were huge with a fantastic selection of fresh fish, meat, cheeses, fruit... and several items I'd never seen or heard of before. It felt like a locals' market, which also made a pleasant change. Purchasing an alternative picnic of sushi roll, sundried tomatoes, bread and fruit we headed back to the Royal Botanic gardens for a late lunch. It may seem unadventurous to head to the same place twice, but when you're sitting shaded by a tree, next to a lake surrounded by black swans and tranquility, it's hard to think of a nicer place to be on a sunny afternoon. Incidentally, it hasn't rained in Melbourne for three months, so we took full advantage of the sun while residents prayed for rain. In the evening we wandered further down the Yarra river, where the shops become more up-market and water-features spring up along the pedestrianised river bank. It was a lovely area and instantly became my 'Darling Harbour' of Melbourne. The highlight of my Melbourne trip was definitely Friday night and our trip to Phillip Island. I've had loads of advice telling me to visit the Penguin Parade on the island, so I was pretty pleased to have the opportunity. Two things I wasn't told beforehand: it takes over two hours to get there (this is a very big country) and you aren't allowed to take photos. Still, neither of these things spoiled our enjoyment of the experience - one that I would certainly recommend to others. We arrived on the island just as the sun was setting and made our way across wooden boardwalks that ran down to the beach. It was here under cover of darkness that the little penguins gathered in groups before waddling up the beach towards us as fast as their little legs would take them to reach the safety of their beach nests. The penguins were enchanting - a mass of tiny black and white figures suddenly appearing at the shoreline as we gathered for this insight into their world. All around us in the bushes they stood calling, with the odd fluffy baby waiting for its parents return from the sea. Absolutely magical. Sadly, the next day we had to leave Melbourne, a city that in a short time I'd come to love. I had a brief stop at my barely seen apartment to relax before work - because good things do come to an end. At least my evening at work involved some entertainment. The party had various live acts including dancers, singers and a girl named Christina Anu with a powerful voice who's been popping up a bit in the papers round here. The evening went on far too late considering I had to be in for breakfast as well. I took a workmate's advice and experimented with having exactly 40 minutes sleep - apparently, this was proven by NASA to be good for you. I wouldn't like to disagree with them, but I wasn't even slightly refreshed. That's one experiment not to try again... At least my morning shift was short (mostly due to my inability to do anything) and then I had a free Sunday afternoon! That evening I was heading out for a last supper with my mum. Before that, however, I met up with the three friends with whom I was originally going to travel, Sapphire, Dave and Gary. They're staying in Coogee for a week before going their separate ways. Gary is heading for Melbourne, Sapphire and Dave are hoping to live and work in Manly. It's not the first time I've seen people split up from their original travelling group - I guess you really get to know people when you're with them 24/7, and sometimes it works out, but other times you want slightly different things. What the three of them (or me for that matter) will do next is a case of wait and see, which is another great thing about travelling - you don't need set plans, you can take each day or week as it comes. Back to my last supper. We headed for Rice, the Asian resteraunt I had been to with Josh a couple of months earlier. It had been great before and didn't disappoint me this time - yet again I ate til I could hardly move - with food that good its hard not to be a bit excessive. My love of Sundays was once more confirmed. On Monday morning I actually had a lie-in, which is one of my most treasured words. I'm grateful I work because it makes me really love those lazy mornings when you slowly get up, think about having breakfast or what you might do with the rest of your day and just enjoy everything. An added bonus was how ridiculously easy my day at work was, leaving me free to stop round at the Dive Hotel for the last time before my mum returns to England. I ended up staying there again - with a hotel so lovely, I'm not exactly drawn up the hill to my own apartment. On Tuesday the sun was out in honour of my mum's departure from Oz. I met her after work for a cake and a cappucino before the inevitable trip to the airport. There's something I hate about seeing other people off at the airport. It's fine when it's me coming or going, or them arriving, but there's just something about the way they disappear through the departure gates that always depresses me. I got it over with as quickly as possible - and if you're reading this, mum, thanks for a lovely two weeks - then tried to cheer myself up by sitting in the sun. It certainly got me thinking about the time I have left and what I want from the rest of my travels. Have I become too settled? How will I take to being a single traveller again? The next day involved a ridiculously quick work shift leaving me an entire day to myself. I met Sapphire and Dave on Coogee beach where we planned our night out - it was the last chance we would have to go out together. Later that evening the three of them came to my place (where Brian is adjusting to the shock of actually having a room-mate again!) to conusme the beer I'd won weeks ago but still hadn't got round to touching. We headed into Sydney to Star City casino as I wanted to show them it out of interest more than any big desire to gamble the night away. Unfortunately we found it strangely addictive (again). I think I was the only one who came away with any winnings, as the enticing machines ate all our money. That place really does have a scary pull. After this we headed to Pyrmont Bridge Hotel (really a pub), one of the many 24-hour drinking establishments round Sydney, where we stayed for the rest of the evening while I became less sober and Gary put lots of tunes on using the jukebox. Before I knew it, it was very late (or early) and I was stumbling back to Coogee for one of the many short night's sleep I've had in recent weeks. Somehow I have to pull myself together for work in a few hours time. I've managed it before but I'm not convinced this time will be so easy... Until next week (when I'll find myself alone in Coogee), Milly"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
