The attorney general offered no support for his assertion that the FBI lacked a basis for opening the investigation and made no mention of the fact that the bureau began its investigation after a Trump campaign adviser purported to have early knowledge that Russia had dirt on his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton. Barr, who has appointed a US attorney to scrutinize the origins of the Russia investigation, said the justice department has evidence there was \u201csomething far more troubling\u201d than just mistakes during the investigation that was eventually taken over by special counsel Robert Mueller. \u201cI think the president has every right to be frustrated, because I think what happened to him was one of the greatest travesties in American history,\u201d Barr said in the interview with Fox News Channel\u2019s Laura Ingraham. The attorney general asserted that the FBI launched its counterintelligence investigation into ties between the Trump campaign and Russia \u201cwithout any basis\u201d. \u201cEven more concerning, actually, is what happened after the campaign, a whole pattern of events while he was president,\u201d Barr said. \u201cTo sabotage the presidency, and I think that \u2013 or at least have the effect of sabotaging the presidency.\u201d The justice department\u2019s inspector general found in a December report that the FBI was justified in opening the investigation to protect against a potential national security threat. It did not find any evidence that the decision to start the investigation was motivated by political bias. Barr has faced previous calls to step down after he was accused of politicizing the position of attorney general, \u201cdoing the president\u2019s personal bidding\u201d and damaging the reputation of the department for \u201cintegrity and the rule of law\u201d. Trump and his supporters are counting on different conclusions from the investigation led by John Durham, the US attorney Barr selected to examine the early days of the Russia investigation. Durham\u2019s investigation is ongoing, and Barr did not provide any evidence about what Durham has found so far. Mueller concluded that the Russian government interfered in the 2016 election, but his investigation didn\u2019t find sufficient evidence to establish a criminal conspiracy between Trump\u2019s campaign and Russia. Mueller also examined about a dozen possible instances of obstruction of justice and has pointedly said he could not exonerate the president. The inspector general\u2019s report identified significant problems with applications for warrants to monitor the communications of former Trump campaign aide Carter Page in 2016 and 2017. Investigators were concerned about Page\u2019s ties to Russia, but never charged him with any wrongdoing. The inspector general, Michael Horowitz, has said the FBI failed to follow its own standards for accuracy and completeness in wiretap applications provided to the secretive foreign intelligence surveillance court. The report detailed 17 errors and omissions in the application process, including failing to tell the court when questions were raised about the reliability of some of the information it had presented to receive the warrants. Those mistakes prompted internal changes within the FBI and spurred a congressional debate over whether the bureau\u2019s surveillance tools should be reined in. But Barr said he believes they were more than just mistakes, offering a personal view of the investigation, a highly unusual move for a prosecutor during an ongoing investigation. \u201cMy own view is that the evidence shows that we\u2019re not dealing with just mistakes or sloppiness,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is something far more troubling here, and we\u2019re going to get to the bottom of it. The FBI began investigating on 31 July 2016 whether the Trump campaign was conspiring with Russia to sway the outcome of the presidential election. By that point, Russian hackers had broken into the Clinton campaign and other Democratic email accounts and George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser, had boasted to a diplomat that he was aware that Russia had derogatory information on Clinton. Though Trump and Barr have seized on errors made during the surveillance of Page, the investigation had already been under way for months by the time the first application was filed.
