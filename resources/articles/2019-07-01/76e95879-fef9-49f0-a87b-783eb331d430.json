Your first thought is surely to turn the heater on. But as Australian families tragically learn each year, there are risks to keeping yourself and your home warm. So what do you need to know? We spoke to two experts to answer those questions. It\u2019s cold and I want to switch on my gas heater. How do I use it safely? The first question you should ask yourself, says Energy Safe Victoria\u2019s Paul Fearon, is \u201chave you had it serviced?\u201d You should do that every two years at least, he says. The technician will clean out your heater and identify any faults or damage. Importantly, they will also check the environment that the heater is operating in. \u201cHeaters that are older than 15 years old, you need to be particularly vigilant about because they don\u2019t last forever,\u201d he says. Chris Barnes, a heating expert at Choice, says it\u2019s vital your gas heater is installed properly. \u201cThat\u2019s whether it\u2019s a portable unflued gas heater that just connects to a bayonet fitting in the floor or if it\u2019s a flued heater, like a gas log fire place.\u201d Either way, you should consider getting a carbon monoxide alarm if you have any sort of gas heater \u2013 it is about the same price as a smoke alarm. What are the dangers if I don\u2019t do these things? \u201cCarbon monoxide poisoning can be fatal and has been,\u201d says Fearon. \u201cYou can\u2019t see it, taste it or smell it.\u201d He says the symptoms will be similar to the flu. \u201cIf more than one person is suddenly coming down with the same symptoms, that\u2019s a signal. But the very first thing to do is to ventilate the house, go outside, and if you\u2019re feeling better suddenly, it\u2019s CO poisoning.\u201d If you\u2019re using a gas heater and the room does not have air vents, you should leave a door or window open. If you\u2019re using an open flue heater, also be careful about using the bathroom fan, which can draw carbon monoxide (CO) back into the home. What about fire risk? Aside from always making sure your heater is well serviced and in good condition, NSW Fire and Rescue recommends ensuring that there is nothing within a metre of the heater. You should also get your flues and chimneys regularly cleaned. Should I get a gas or electric heater? Or something else? Barnes recommends a reverse cycle air conditioner if you can afford one and your house can accommodate it. \u201cIt\u2019s the most cost-effective way, although it costs more upfront,\u201d he says. Portable electric heaters are also a good option but they can be expensive in the long run. If you get one, make sure it has a tilt switch \u2013 so it will switch off it falls down \u2013 and a thermal cut, so it will power down when it gets close to overheating. \u201cThey\u2019re good for short-term heating and they have the advantage of that feeling of radiant heat on them,\u201d says Barnes. If you have solar panels, you can keep costs down by running your portable electric heater during the day, he adds. Can I leave my heater on overnight? Fearon emphasises that you should not leave a gas heater on overnight. Some other heaters can be left on overnight, says Barnes, but \u201cit\u2019s a good idea to turn it down\u201d. \u201cA lot of them will have timer options on them so you can run it for a couple of hours while you go to sleep. \u201cI would say don\u2019t leave it running full blast unattended, even if you\u2019re at home asleep.\u201d Any other dos or don\u2019ts? Barnes says do use your ceiling fan in conjunction with a heater to help warm up the room. \u201cA lot of ceiling fans have a reverse mode on them,\u201d he says. \u201cInstead of blowing air down on to you and creating a breeze, which is what you want in summer, instead you reverse it so that it draws air upwards.\u201d What you definitely should not do, both Barnes and Fearon say, is bring an outdoor heater inside. \u201cThey are not made for using indoors, they are not subject to the same design restrictions,\u201d Barnes says. \u201cThey just put out carbon monoxide as a matter of course. Outdoors, it doesn\u2019t matter, it just blows away. Inside it\u2019s a serious issue.\u201d In the same vein, don\u2019t turn on your oven or cooktop to use as a heater."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
