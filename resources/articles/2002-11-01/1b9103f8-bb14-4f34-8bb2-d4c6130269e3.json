But looking at Glenn Roeder and Terry Venables yesterday and their contrasting styles of trying to cope with the enormous pressure was more excruciating that watching David Brent in The Office. We were literally witnessing two men auditioning for their own jobs, one helpful bookmaker having offered 4-1 on the loser being sacked after the game. Roeder was sat hunched forward in his seat even before kick-off, a pen clasped tightly in his hand. Within a minute of the start he was marching out to make a point at the edge of the technical area, looking like someone ever closer to the end of his tether. Roeder journeyed so quickly and regularly between dugout and touchline that he twice had to pick up his Remembrance Day poppy and reattach it. Almost unconsciously, he waved an arm to motion his players this way and that, though it is doubtful if any of them saw his gestures or heard any of his screamed instructions, which, in any case, seemed more a way of releasing his own tension. Venables was also clutching pen and paper high up in the stands next to his chairman Peter Ridsdale, resting one arm over a glass partition in a studied image of insouciance that fooled no one. He could not, in any case, resist the adrenalin rush of the bench for long, skipping downstairs to join his assistant Brian Kidd and the rest of his backroom team when Paolo Di Canio scored West Ham's 21st-minute equaliser. Roeder greeted that goal by walking back to the bench throwing punches at the air. Now it was Venables's turn to test his shoes on the technical area grass, the fourth official Dermot Gallagher at one point ushering him back from the edge of the pitch. When Harry Kewell restored Leeds's lead, Venables walked out to have words with his defender Gary Kelly, as though suspicious of having walked into a trap. And it was only when Kewell scored again to put daylight between the sides that he allowed himself a tiny smile. West Ham supporters are hardly new to situations like the one they find their team in. But the all too well-rehearsed financial ramifications of relegation have stripped the humour from such occasions. So when the referee Steve Dunn booked Tomas Repka, also not an unique occurrence, they could think only to shout \"you fat bastard\" at him. When they booed and shouted \"what a load of rubbish\" at their own team just before West Ham went in at half-time 4-1 down, you wondered how Roeder would even have the courage to walk up the tunnel again. It would surely have been impossible for him today had his team not dramatically improved after the break. Venables's cheeky chappie demeanour, which has not deserted him during Leeds's shambolic form, was restored to full 120-watt strength in victory, warmly greeting press men he sensed might have come to bury him, not praise him. He rushed through the jokes, though thankfully not one of his karaoke acts, and though he admitted his team had been fortunate there was a hint of defiance when he said: \"We did earn that half-time lead. That was us doing that.\" Roeder, also true to form, was in such funereal mood that he would not even accept praise for his team's comeback, preferring to dwell on what he described as their \"non-existing defending\" in the first half. He also denied feeling the pressure. \"I don't live in fear because that's energy sapping and useless,\" he said. I'm in the spotlight but I don't fear tomorrow.\" For he and El Tel, as managers are fond of saying, it was just another day at the office - one just a tad madder than David Brent's."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
