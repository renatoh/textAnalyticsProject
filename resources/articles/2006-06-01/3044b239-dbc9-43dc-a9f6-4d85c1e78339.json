Under new terms unveiled yesterday, Nisa shareholders will be offered 51% of the merged firm, up from 40%. Nisa-Today's is a buying group and a mutual organisation owned by 2,290 wholesalers and retailers. They formed a group to campaign against the deal with the privately owned Costcutter, which would have given 42% of the business to the groups' managers. Under the new terms the management will get 31%."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
