Wilkinson met Boudjellal last weekend and watched Toulon's defeat to Perpignan before returning to Newcastle and watching their victory over Harlequins the following day. \"We welcomed Jonny Wilkinson, he was happy here and now he has gone,\" Boudjellal said. \"The most important thing for us is to stay in the top flight and then we will think about everything else.\" Toulon are 11th in the Top 14 and Wilkinson will not join them if they go down. Toulon last week signed the Leinster and Argentina outside-half, Felipe Contepomi, but Boudjellal has made Wilkinson, who is due to return to action this weekend after six months out with a knee injury, his top target. Wilkinson has another year to run on his contract with the Falcons, who have said they are not resigned to losing the 29-year old, especially as England are actively trying to prevent national squad players from moving to France."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
