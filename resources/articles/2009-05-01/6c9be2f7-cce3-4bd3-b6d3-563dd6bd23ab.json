The facets of his game that are strong mean that he could certainly play anywhere across the back four, and at a push probably do a job sitting in midfield \u2013 Eddie Nolan is simply one the most two-footed players I have ever seen. At one point, as he neatly chipped the ball down the line, I thought he was primarily left-footed and then the next time he received the ball he was bringing possession out of defence, travelling 40 yards using just his right foot. There are certainly some real advantages to being so ambidextrous \u2013 when team-mates were under pressure on the ball they weren't frightened to give it to him without thinking, as he was happy to receive the play on either foot, meaning it didn't matter what sort of ball he received as he was comfortable in dealing with it. Most players favour one side or the other, so when passing to them you have to consider that he must take it on his stronger foot if the ball has to go first time. He also benefited from the fact most people know which foot an opponent favours and will always try to make the player use his weaker foot when closing the forward pass down or showing him on to the side he doesn't want to go, but you couldn't do that with Nolan as he was happy to shift or feint the ball in either direction knowing he could give quality balls forward on both sides. He's decent in the air, although he could be more aggressive in attacking the ball at times. He covers the ground nicely and I like the fact that when he made up his mind to commit to the challenge he rarely failed to get the ball. His distribution was good in the main, aided by the fact that he finds striking the ball easy, whether it is long floated free-kicks from deep or the driven pass that he hit brilliantly into a forward in the second half. He has a good understanding with Ross Wallace, who played in front of him, as to who should close down the danger and who should provide cover, although when Preston NE went ahead I thought at times he let Wallace do too much defending and allowed Sheffield United to press North End back. There were, however, times when he showed a little inexperience with regard to the space between him and his left-sided centre-half \u2013 which is understandable for someone who has so far played only 30 first-team games. In the first 45 minutes, Sheffield United were able to exploit that area three times, nearly scoring on two occasions. Another part of his game that he has to improve is when the ball is crossed in from the other side of the pitch, he has to be aware of people running across him, as Greg Halford did in this match and with Nolan ball-watching the Sheffield United player should have scored with a first-time volley. I want to see him getting forward more, either by overlapping his left winger in support, or simply going into space that has been vacated, as at times I did not see enough movement from him when Preston had the ball. However he was keen to help his fellow defenders when anyone had been caught out of position and was more than willing to fill in for Sean St Ledger each time he marauded forward. He also maintained good levels of communication throughout, which is probably one of the reasons why he is currently captain of his country's under-21 team and received his first full call-up to the Republic of Ireland senior squad for the game against Georgia in February. This is a player who has mainly filled in for team-mates when they have been either injured or unavailable. His next goal must be to get in the Preston North End first team, regardless of others' circumstances.
