Campaigners accused airlines of attempting to \u201cdodge their obligations\u201d, but the industry said it was \u201ca matter of survival\u201d, with most international travel currently frozen in the Covid-19 crisis. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) has called on the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to amend the carbon offsetting and reduction scheme for international aviation (Corsia), or risk airlines pulling out. Under the system, airlines have to pay to offset any growth in carbon emissions above a baseline set by the average emissions of 2019 and 2020. The grounding of aircraft during the pandemic means the baseline will be far lower than envisaged, and the carbon targets much more challenging, if Corsia goes ahead without changes. Iata has told ICAO that the baseline \u201cmust be adjusted to ensure the sustainable development of international aviation and avoid an inappropriate economic burden on the sector\u201d. It said some nations could pull out of the agreement if the costs were too high. Before the Covid-19 crisis, estimates showed that airlines were likely to have to spend between \u00a34bn and \u00a318bn a year globally on carbon credits by 2035 to satisfy the Corsia rules. A report by the Green Alliance, before the coronavirus lockdown, found that this was not enough to meet the goals set out in the Paris agreement. The ICAO council had signed off on the Corsia plans on 13 March, gaining plaudits from green campaigners for sticking with its pledges on the climate crisis instead of shelving them in the face of the pandemic. However, airlines\u2019 commitment now looks distinctly shaky. The US Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), a long-time mover behind the Corsia scheme, argued that the existing Corsia rules allowed enough flexibility for governments to address the \u201csuppressed activity in 2020, without any need to renegotiate the measure in a drawn-out political discussion\u201d. James Elliott, a Green Alliance policy adviser, said: \u201cCalls to reduce burdens on the [aviation] sector as it recovers are understandable. But the climate emergency also presents an urgent challenge which must be addressed. If the sector cannot find ways to rebuild itself sustainably after the Covid-19 crisis, it will face painful disruption again in the future as its part in the climate emergency has to be addressed. \u201cIf Corsia is amended, it must be done in a way which also strengthens its ambition, with targets to limit and reduce actual emissions levels.\u201d Greenpeace UK\u2019s executive director, John Sauven, said: \u201cAt the same time as they\u2019re asking for huge government bailouts, airlines are also lobbying furiously to dodge their obligations towards cutting carbon emissions. \u201cOffsetting schemes have always been big polluters\u2019 favourite excuse to carry on polluting while shifting responsibility for their emissions to someone else. The industry\u2019s current proposal would only make the buck-passing easier.\u201d Iata denied that it was backing away from Corsia. Its director general, Alexandre de Juniac, said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t given up our environmental goals \u2026 After the recovery we will continue to reduce emissions and noise footprints \u2013 that hasn\u2019t changed. \u201cThis crisis is a matter of survival for the industry \u2026 We are asking governments for urgent help. Of course we will comply with our environmental obligations. Before that, we have to survive \u2013 or there will be no issue with the environment, the industry will have disappeared.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
