But after nine weeks at the Bomana immigration centre, a Canberra-funded detention centre in Port Moresby, the Iranian asylum seeker has signed up to go home. Whatever fate awaits Ariobarzan (whom the Guardian has agreed to name using a pseudonym) in Iran, and it almost certainly means years in prison, he figures it can\u2019t be worse than life inside Bomana. There, detainees have no access to legal support or their families, no phones, no connection to the outside world other than limited contact with the Red Cross, not even the distractions of books or writing materials, he says. \u201cThe conditions have been designed to torture people.\u201d They are served such meagre rations that they are perpetually hungry and plead to be given the same food as the Papua New Guinean prisoners in the adjoining Bomana jail, he tells the Guardian. They sleep in stifling cells in the tropical heat \u2013 fans and air conditioning are either broken or rarely used \u2013 within a compound patrolled by vicious dogs. In August Ariobarzan and 51 other asylum seekers \u2013 all deemed non-refugees \u2013 were arrested by PNG authorities and taken to Bomana immigration centre, an Australian-funded facility annexed to a Port Moresby prison. On the first night \u201c10 or 12\u201d of them attempted self-harm, he said. Most received no treatment, some were moved into isolation. For more than two months no information has emerged from Bomana, except that several men had been taken to hospital and returned on various occasions. That changed two weeks ago when Ariobarzan and five other asylum seekers were released after agreeing to return to their homelands. He says there are 46 others still inside. Among them are 12 who are in extremely poor condition, and who have been approved for medevac transfers to Australia, says Behrouz Boochani, an Iranian-Kurdish journalist and refugee who was also detained on Manus. \u201cWhat is happening in Bomana is a crime against humanity, it is a symbol of state terrorism,\u201d says Boochani, who is acting as interpreter for Ariobarzan. \u201cBoth the governments of PNG and Australia are responsible. They have no rights to violate basic human rights such as getting enough food, clean water and communication with their families. \u201cWhat is happening there is breaking the international conventions and PNG and Australian constitutions. These people have already experienced so much violence and trauma and if they continue this torture more people will die.\u201d His statements echo accusations by the general secretary of the Catholic Bishops Conference of PNG, Father Giorgio Licini, to Radio New Zealand last week that Australia was using harsh conditions to coerce asylum seekers into accepting repatriation. Ariobarzan is now awaiting deportation with the others released from Bomana in one of several small, basic but comfortable units in Port Moresby. The others say they won\u2019t speak about their experiences for fear of being returned to Bomana, but he says he will because \u201cI\u2019m doing my best to help my friends\u201d. He says the men awaiting medevac to Australia are in a \u201cvery, very bad situation \u2026 they can move around, but they are suffering\u201d. Of conditions in Bomana, he says the daily food ration is equivalent to a single small meal \u2013 more suitable for a child than a man \u2013 split into three serves. Half a piece of toast, dried peas and a small glass of milk for breakfast. Twice a week, rice with two small pieces of chicken as the main meal. On other days, sandwiches with lettuce and mayonnaise. \u201cEach afternoon, they give a small coffee.\u201d He had use of a shower, but the water was so scalding hot it was impossible to wash. With nothing to occupy his mind or time over the days, two months in, he decided that jail in Iran would be better. \u201cYou can have a phone, you can call \u2026 you have food, you have a good bed, you have visitors. Sometimes you can go out with permission for a few days.\u201d After signing up for repatriation, when he was finally able to contact his family at home, they wept with relief. They had feared he was dead. \u201cIt\u2019s a very important point, because over six years many people were killed by this system,\u201d Boochani says. With no information about their loved ones, many families reach out to him. \u201cThey are really concerned about their sons,\u201d he says. \u201cFamilies have this question \u2013 \u2018What is their crime? Why don\u2019t they let them communicate with us?\u2019 And you know, someone like me, I\u2019m under too much pressure. When the families call me, I don\u2019t know \u2013 what should I say?\u201d Last week Boochani, with others including a representative of Amnesty International, tried to approach the heavily secured Bomana facility. \u201cThey stopped our car. We didn\u2019t want to go in \u2013 just to see. They took our photos \u2026 questioned us. \u2018Who are you, what are you doing?\u2019\u201d Ariobarzan argues that it should not be said that he was refused refugee status. \u201cI didn\u2019t give a case. They didn\u2019t process me at all \u2026 Australian immigration is not even aware about why I leave my country \u2013 they don\u2019t have that information.\u201d He says he refused to provide that background. \u201cIt was not reasonable that PNG process us. I seek asylum in Australia, not PNG. But Australia is so mean, they send me to this country, that is why I couldn\u2019t accept it. \u201cIt was like modern slavery. And it is assaulting human dignity. That is why I refused. \u201cIt is a big crime happening there at Bomana. The [Australian] government wants to show that it [has] a successful policy, and that is why they put people in jail, in Bomana, as a symbol for this policy. \u201cThey spend a billion dollars on this policy, but they couldn\u2019t defeat us, couldn\u2019t beat us, couldn\u2019t break us. That\u2019s why they jailed these 50 people as a symbol. It is not reasonable and acceptable that among 1,100 people, they reject 50. These people who rejected, their cases are similar to others. We left from the same countries and same systems. \u201cPart of this policy\u2019s culture is that it\u2019s like a rule that always someone should be beaten. It is the conclusion.\u201d The Bomana facility was contacted for comment. \u2022 International helplines can be found at www.befrienders.org.
