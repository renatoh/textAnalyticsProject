The visitors had drawn level courtesy of Kane\u2019s penalty early in the second half, with the Italian officials using the video assistant referees to confirm the award of the spot kick and the dismissal of Rapha\u00ebl Varane, who was deemed not to have made an attempt to play the ball. That system is expected to be trialled in the FA Cup and League Cup next season, and could be implemented in the Premier League after the 2018 World Cup. Yet, while neither manager complained at the video officials\u2019 intervention, England\u2019s inability to make inroads against depleted opponents, and tendency to present France with opportunities, left them infuriated. \u201cScoring twice in France should be enough,\u201d said Kane, who captained the side. \u201cWe have got to find a way to win that. We just weren\u2019t good enough. They were getting too much space in vital areas, even with 10 men. We want to be brave and play from the back and mistakes will happen. It\u2019s disappointing. We were in the driver\u2019s seat but we didn\u2019t step it up another gear. Not good enough.\u201d While England remain comfortable leaders of their World Cup qualifying group, they have lost in Germany and France, and conceded two late goals to draw 2-2 with Spain in their high-profile friendlies under Southgate. The manager is using those fixtures as an education for a relatively inexperienced side. \u201cWe\u2019ve been competitive in all three games for long periods of time,\u201d he said after seeing England concede three for the first time since late 2012. \u201cBut I think we\u2019ve had to play at our absolute limit to stay in all three of the matches, which has shown in the latter stages of those games. The three games have provided a different test. \u201cWith Spain it was their ability to keep the ball better than us, and we were chasing, chasing, chasing. Today we kept the ball better than France at times but, physically, the demands their players impose on you meant we had problems and that led to tiredness, which is one of the reasons for the mistake for the third goal. Those teams are the best. In the last few years we\u2019ve not got anywhere near those teams when it\u2019s come to tournaments and finals, so that\u2019s why we need to play them. We need to see the reality of where we are, to test yourself against the best, so you don\u2019t mask where you are in terms of a team. \u201cWe should have got a result. In the space of 90 minutes we saw the things we\u2019re very good at. With the ball we caused a lot of problems, looked a threat, created good openings, took our first goal very well. And equally saw the things we have to get better at. Defending as a team, and managing the game once France went down to 10. You have to control possession and stay calm, but we looked more anxious while they stepped up. We didn\u2019t manage that period of the game as well as we need to. Part of that was because we tired. We put a huge amount into the game to try and press and deal with the physical capabilities France had, and it was a problem for us all night, their pace and athleticism.\u201d On the use of the video assistant referees, Southgate added: \u201cI\u2019ve not seen it again but, from my initial view, I thought it was the right call. It looked a clear penalty and therefore a sending off. I assume the referee wanted to make sure. If he\u2019s got that technology to do that, then a sensible decision. Clearly, even with video, not every decision will be 100%. You won\u2019t get every decision right. There\u2019ll still be an element of one person\u2019s judgment in that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
