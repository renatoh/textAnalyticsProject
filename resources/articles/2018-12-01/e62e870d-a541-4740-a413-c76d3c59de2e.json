[The semi-final] will be very tough. But we are excited because today we won here. I am very pleased to qualify for the semi-final. I think we deserved it. Of course it was tough and very competitive, but to keep a clean sheet here [is really spiffing].\u201d The first legs will be played in the week beginning January 7, the second in the week beginning Janauary 21. Manchester City v Burton Albion Tottenham Hotspur v Chelsea The draw will be conduced by ex-Spurs striker Peter Crouch and an Arsenal fan. The draw - we are assured - is coming up any minute now. The four teams in the slot machine will be: Spurs, Chelsea, Manchester City and Burton Albion, who\u2019ve got to fancy their chances of being paired with a big team. Speaking to Sky Sports, Alli says: \u201cWhen we came here last time we didn\u2019t get the result we wanted so we knew how important this was ... It was a big test for us and I think it was a strong performance.\u201d About being hit on the head with a bottle thrown from the stands, he says: \u201cIt makes the goal a little bit sweeter.\u201d If I didn\u2019t mis-hear, he was then asked whether he\u2019ll be taking any selfies later. I really hope I mis-heard. It has to be said, Arsenal could certainly have done with an on-song Mesut Ozil, at least to come off the bench. Emery\u2019s decision to omit him is understandable, but the performances of Ramsey, Mkhitaryan and Guendouzi didn\u2019t help the manager\u2019s argument. Iwobi was Arsenal\u2019s best attacking midfield and he was substituted early in the second half, which was odd. Spurs progress to the semi-final with an accomplished, highly satisfying victory at the home of their spirited but ragged rivals. Their goals came from two beautifully crafted and executed counter-attacks, Alli creating the first for Son before scoring the second himself. He was also hit on the head by a bottle thrown from the crowd in the second half but kept his cool and is all smiles as he offers his jersey to a fan in the away end, while Arsenal\u2019s players trudge off the pitch. The semi-final draw will be coming up right here shortly. 90+2 min: Kane spreads the play to Sissoko on the right. His cross goes beyond Winks before being cleared by Nketiah. 90 min: Spurs seeing this game out nicely. \u201cThis is probably the last time we\u2019re going to win at the Emirates,\u201d sobs K Dot. \u201cThanks for the memories, Poch!\u201d Every silver lining, eh. 88 min: Arsenal keep trying but are still too frantic. Spurs have been the stronger, more mature and more precise side. 86 min: Alli booked for time-wasting, kicking the ball into the net after the whistle had gone for offside. Xhaka goes over to lecture him on sportsmanship while gesturing at the referee to show the yellow. 85 min: Rose does well to nick the ball off Nketiah after the young forwad took down another cross-field pass from Xhaka 83 min: Eriksen has a blast from 25 yards. It\u2019s another swervy one that Cech doesn\u2019t feel comfortable trying to catch. He bundles it behind for a corner. 82 min: If you don\u2019t want to know that Eden Hazard has come off the bench to make it 1-0 to Chelsea in the other quarter-final, look away now. 81 min: Maitland-NIles is down calling for treatment. He appears to have a bit of cramp. Emery will be hoping it\u2019s not serious because he\u2019s already made all his substitutions. 78 min: \u201cI will take today\u2019s result of part of Emery\u2019s larger plan to add two (or) more fixtures to Spurs in the chase for fourth place,\u201d quips Pete Mumola, who has abandoned all hope of an Arsenal comeback. He\u2019s probably right: Spurs are looking quite authoritative. Spurs substitution: Lamela on, Son off. Slightly surprised by that. Thought Pochettino might withdraw Alli to protect him from any more bottle tossers. 76 min: Xhaka booked for handball, or maybe for berating the linesman who flagged it up. 75 min: Aubameyang\u2019s slightly mis-hits a cross from the left ... but nearly gets lucky, as he floats against the crossbar. And then out. 72 min: Alli embarks on a nice run down the left but can\u2019t keep the ball from going out of play. Then he\u2019s hit on the head by a bottle thrown by some moron in the crowd. Alli is angry, understandably. He turns in the direction of his assailant and uses his fingers to report the scoreline. Quite a restrained response under the circumstances. The ref trots over to advise him to leave it at that. We\u2019ll be hearing more about that incident, for sure. Arsenal may already be trying to identify the bottle-thrower. 70 min: Maitand-Niles is making lots of grounds down the right for Arsenal but his crossing has been inadequate so far. 69 min: Arsenal exerting serious pressure, causing lots of discomfort in the Spurs box. Then Monreal goes too far and barges into Alderweireld, conceding a freekick. 68 min: Monreal drives into the box and tries to pull the ball back from the byline, but he pulls it back too far, behind Lacazette. Arsenal substitution: Nketiah on, Guendouzi off. Arsenal switch to the Kitchen Sink formation. 66 min: This is properly exciting end-to-end fare now. Spurs aren\u2019t in the just clear yet ... 64 min: Xhaka does well to shoulder Eriksen off the ball as Spurs threatened another counter-attack. 62 min: Aubameyang cuts in from the left after sharp work in the Spurs box by Monreal. The striker plays a cute pass to Lacazette, who, under pressure, tries to sidefoot it into the net from six yards. But it hits the outside of the post and goes wide! What a superb finish! Alli clipped a nonchalant dink with the outside of his boot over Cech after running straight through the huge gap in Arsenal\u2019s defence to collect a pass from Kane. Arsenal substitution: Lacazette on, Iwobi off. Emery means business too, then. Spurs substitution: Kane on, Moura off. It\u2019s Kane\u2019s first appearance in this competition for three years, a sign both that Pochettino means business and is worried by Arsenal\u2019s increasing momentum. 60 min: Xhaka wellies the freekick into the stands. 59 min: Sissoko treads on Aubameyang\u2019s heel as the striker sized up a shot from 20 yards. Freekick in a menacing position ... 57 min: Eriksen dinks a pass over the Arsenal defence. Son scampers after it and tries to pull it back from the left byline into the middle. Cech intervenes. 55 min: Eriksen send a wobbly freekick over the bar. It\u2019s headed wide but Cech pushes it out for a corner. 55 min: Aubameyang tracks back to help curtail a Spurs\u2019 counter. But he commits a clumsy foul, giving Eriksen a freekick a few yards outside the left-hand corner of the Arsenal box... 54 min: Nice work by Maitland-Niles down the right, elegantly beating two men before digging out a decent cross. It\u2019s headed away at the near post. 52 min: Iwobi, constantly dangerous, wriggles into the box from the left, then sends a low pass to Maitland-Niles, coming on to it from at the far side of the area. He takes a touch and sends a cross/shot into the six-yard box but not with much conviction. Spurs clear. 50 min: Monreal floats over a hopeful cross from the left. Gazzaniga doesn\u2019t drop it. 48 min: Arsenal have made a bright start to the second half, continuing the vibe they finished with in the first. Arsenal substitution: Koscielny on, Mkhitaryan off. If you don\u2019t want to know the half-time score in today\u2019s other quarter-final, look away now. Too late: it\u2019s Chelsea 0-0 Bournemouth. Fancy some exclusive speculation from Hugh Molloy? \u201cI\u2019ve just realised that Ozil is going to join Juve in January,\u201d says Hugh as he gazes at his tea-leaves. \u201cRonaldo loves playing with him and he\u2019s an Adidas guy so they\u2019ll probably chip in, the more tactical pace will suit, and he might fancy a guaranteed set of trophies and a bit of sunshine rather than the Arsenal bench.\u201d It\u2019s been an entertaining game so far, muscular and attack-oriented. Spurs deserve their lead - which came courtesy of a lovely pass by Alli and a fine finish by Son - but Arsenal have looked dangerous, if a little frantic, and created some good chances. This tie is far from over, especially with Lacazette liable to come on in the second half. 45 min: Guendouzi practically demands a yellow card by chopping down Moura in midfield. \u201cThis is going well,\u201d chimes in Guy Hornsby. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll try and Spurs it up at some point. Books-wise, I can\u2019t recommend Danish Dynamite by Lars Eriksen, Mike Gibbons, and Rob Smyth highly enough. As a man of a certain age, it\u2019s football gold, a tale of football romanticism.\u201d I agree entirely. 44 min: Xhaka takes a corner short to Torreira. The Uruguayan curls over an inviting cross, to which Sokratis responds with a fine leap ... and a wonky header, sending the ball wide from five yards. 43 min: Ramsey meets a cross from the left with a sumptuously controlled volley from 10 yards. Gazzaniga dives sharply across his goal to make a brilliant one-handed save! 42 min: A preposoterus mix-up in the Spurs box, as both Gazzaniga and Davies botched attempted clearances. Arsenal fans yelped in excitement ... but Mkhitaryan ruins the chance with a ludicrous backheel in the box to no one in particular. Five seconds of entertaining nonsense there from the North London derby. 40 min: Xhaks sends in another decent corner. It\u2019s headed out to the edge of the area. Maitland-Niles meets in on the volley ... and the ensuing jeers from the Spurs fans confirm that it landed closer to a pie vendor than the goal. 37 min: The referee takes advantage of a break in play to chide Sokratis, who has presumably been in his ear about something, possibly Spurs\u2019 robust (but fair) tackling. 34 min: This isa good spell from Arsenal. They\u2019re not as accomplished as Spurs but they\u2019re spirited and dangerous. This game has a long way to go. 31 min: Maitland-Niles slaloms between two Spurs players as he makes his way forward impressively. He then feeds Ramsey, who aims a diagonal cross from the right towards Iwobi, who gets outjumped easily by Trippier. 28 min: Mkhitaryan\u2019s cross from the right is put behind for a corner by Davies. Xhaka delivers another good one. But Spurs manage to scramble away and launch a dangerous counter after Lucas beats Mkhitaryan to the ball at the edge of the area with a risky tackle. Eriksen invites Sissoko to apply the perfect coup de grace from the edge of the area... but the Frenchman tonks it way over the bar! 26 min: Guendouzi - with a first-time pass this time - pigs the ball to Aubameyang at the left-hand corner of the Spurs box. The Gabonese gets off a shot with similar speed but it\u2019s wide. \u201cIt was only Xhaka who appealed for offside in vain (because he was the only one playing offside as the ball came right down his left centre-back channel),\u201d notes Hugh Molly. \u201cAlmost as though he\u2019s playing out of position!\u201d 24 min: Tripper forcefully dispossesses Ramsey, who bites back and concedes a freekick. No bookings issued yet though by Jon Moss, the ref who showed more than any other during the Premier League last season. 22 min: Guendouzi is caught in possession in midfield, and not for the first time: he needs to use the ball more quickly against opponents as sharp as Spurs are right now. Alli clips a lovely pass through the Arsenal defence and Son races on to it to curl past Cech! Arsenal appealed for offside in vain. 18 min: Rose takes a scorner short to Eriksen, who lashes it into the area. Davies fails to get a decisive touch at the near post. But he was close. \u201cScott Murray\u2019s book is a terrific read,\u201d says Noel Reilly. \u201cI also recommend Dynamo: Defending the Honour of Kiev by Andy Dougan.\u201d 16 min: After more purposeful, progressive play from the visitors, Eriksen tries his luck from 25 yards. He swerving shot whizzes a couple of yards over the bar. 15 min: This is a open and fast-moving. Spurs are more commanding in possession but Arsenal are sharp and quick on the counter. 12 min: Iwobi makes mroe ground down the left and then feeds Mkhitaryan in-field. Mkhitaryan and Ramsey then cut through the Spurs defence with a daintily deadly one-two ... but Mkhitaryan fails to finish, letting fly with a shot that Gazzaniga manages to save. The keeper should have been given no chance. 10 min: Spurs are finding their stride and enjoying more possession. They work the ball forward down the right. Sissoko picks out Lucas Moura outside the D. He sweeps it left to Eriksen, who bounds into the area and unloads a shot with his left foot. But Maitland-Niles put him under pressure and he failed to find the target. \u201cFootie book ideas include Futebol: The Brazilian Way of Life by Alex Bellos and David Winner\u2019s \u2018Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football,\u201d writes Shay Ore. \u201cBoth are years old but timeless.\u201d 8 min: Iwobi and Ramsey combine niftily down the left before the Welshman darts into the box and pokes a low shot a yard wide of the far post from 16 yards. 5 min: Spurs build from the back before Eriksen pings a low pass to Alli, who lopes towards the box. Torreira and Maitland-Niles join forces to dispossess him at the edge of the area. 4 min: Arsenal have started on the front foot and the game is being played mostly in Tottenham territory. 2 min: Xhaka curls a lovely corner towards the near post. Mkhitaryan easily eludes Eriksen to flick on a header. It sails just beyond the far post. Monreal dived to try to touch it in but just couldn\u2019t get there. 1 min: Arsenal kick-off ... and tap it straight to a Spurs player. That was the worst kickoff of 2018, no doubt. \u201cFor soccer books I\u2019d like to recommend an oldie: John Nicholson\u2019s Footy Rocks,\u201d tweet A McCzyk. The teams enter the arena, which looks about 90% full and sounds relatively loud and festive. \u201cDo you think only hiring a caretaker till the end of the season, and all these rumors about Poch are part of a plan by Man Utd to unsettle one of their biggest rivals to top 4?\u201d asks Peter Crosby. \u201cIf the players assume (as everyone else seems to) that their manager will be leaving in the summer for a rival, that would surely impact their efforts somewhat?\u201d If Poch let his team unravel so easily, then surely he wouldn\u2019t have the right stuff to manage United? Ah, so what you\u2019re suggesting is that this is a test from which United could benefit no matter the outcome? Not sure United\u2019s regime are canny enough to have thought of that, mind. Asked about how he wants his defence to line up today, Arsenal\u2019s manager says he\u2019s looking for intelligent fluidity from his team: \u201cDuring the game we can play as a back four or a back three.\u201d And with regard to Ozil\u2019s absence he says: \u201cIt\u2019s only tactical.\u201d When Sky Sports\u2019 inquirer asks whether than means the German isn\u2019t good enough to get in Arsenal\u2019s best 18, Emery eschew the chances to leap to the player\u2019s defence and instead replies: \u201conly tactical.\u201d Message received. Meanwhile, Ozil seems to be keeping his spirits up: he\u2019s in the ground smiling and mingling with fans. \u201cI\u2019m going to follow your MBM while shopping for Christmas presents,\u201d says Tom Donaldson. \u201cCan you recommend any good football books for my brother?\u201d Scott Murray\u2019s The Title is a belter, Tom, as is Barney Ronay\u2019s How Football (Nearly) Came Home. \u201cIs there a general bias against the Arsenal, I wonder?\u201d asks William Hargreaves. \u201c I don\u2019t mind if there is - plucky underdogs and all that - but how else could we explain how Aubameyang can move to the Gunners and drop 34 places in the \u201c100 best male footballers in the world\u2019 rankings, despite his 10 goals and four assists in 13 matches 2017-18 PL season and 10 goals, three assists in 17 matches 18-19 PL season?\u201d That\u2019s a reference to this carefully assembled survey by the Guardian, which features the opinions of some of my most prominent colleagues, including Zico and Mart Poom. Reckon Aubameyang\u2019s non-participation in the World Cup or Champions League counted against him. Apparently Mesut Ozil is fit. Which suggests the only reason he is not in Arsenal\u2019s squad today is that Emery can\u2019t justify including him ahead of others. As for Arsenal\u2019s defence, it looks like Xhaka will be in the middle of it again. That back four certainly look vulnerable to Spurs\u2019 attack, even without Kane. Son has been in better form than him recently anyway. Excellent! Both teams have gone close to full-strength. Kane is on Spurs\u2019 bench because of illness. Arsenal: Cech; Maitland-NIles, Sokratis, Xhaka, Monreal; Guendouzi, Torreira; Mkhitaryan, Ramsey, Iwobi; Aubameyang Subs: Martinez, Koscielny. Lichtsteiner, Elneny, Willock, Lacazette, Nketiah Spurs: Gazzaniga; Trippier, Alderweireld, Davies, Rose; Winks, Sissoko; Eriksen, Alli, Lucas; Son. Subs: Vorm, Foyth, Walker-Peters, Skipp, Lamela, Llorente, Kane Referee: J Moss Hello. What better way than a North London derby to kick off the season of goodwill? And not just any old North London derby, but a quarter-final of the Carabao Cup! After which the victors could get a semi-final with Burton Albion! OK, OK, don\u2019t scoff, this is a tie well worth winning. This competition may not be top priority for Spurs or Arsenal but neither should sniff at it, especially now that they\u2019ve been pitted against each other. Both managers - and both sets of fans - are likely to stress that to their players even if they do deploy less-than-optimal lineups. Because winning things is fun. And for Unai Emery, who won the French equivalent of this tournament in each of the last two seasons, beating Spurs en route to lifting a trophy would be a dandy way to garnish a first season at Arsenal that has been promising so far, never more so than when his side came from behind to whack Spurs in the Premier League two weeks ago. For Pochettino, meanwhile, landing a trophy would at last give him something tangible to put in the honours column of his cv along with \u2018lovely manner\u2019. The down side of that for Spurs fans, of course, is that it would only increase the chances of the man from Murphy being headhunted by Manchester United. But why would he want to leave Spurs just after pushing them to the cusp of something glorious, right? Right? Well that\u2019s an argument for another day - or maybe later on today - right now is all about The Match. Let\u2019s be having you!"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
