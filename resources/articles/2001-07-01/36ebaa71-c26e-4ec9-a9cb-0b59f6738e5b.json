Executive chairman John Windeler said: \"The board is interested in shareholder value first and foremost, and would seriously consider any offer.\" He declined to comment on whether A&amp;L had entered discussions with any potential bidder. Shares in A&amp;L have nearly doubled in recent months from 455p to a peak of 834p, with National Australia Bank regarded as the likely front runner. Sceptics say the bank is too small to survive independently and believe it has acknowledged this through two failed merger attempts. Yesterday the bank revealed that sluggish revenue growth and hefty spending on upgrading IT systems knocked a \u00a338m hole in first-half profits, which fell 15% to \u00a3208m. Alliance &amp; Leicester has an ambitious target of growing revenue by 6% a year, but early indications are that it will struggle to meet that. Group revenues grew by 1.8%, held back by an 11% fall in personal loan lending, while costs rose from \u00a3316m to \u00a3328m. Bad- debt provisions were up 63%, from \u00a319m to \u00a331m. Group managing director Peter McNamara was upbeat about the prospects for revenue growth and cost control. He said margins improved in the second quarter, helped by a repricing of personal loans and a sharp increase in mortgage lending, while the IT spend would keep it on track to reduce costs by \u00a320m a year. \"In the past few months we have seen evidence that personal loan business is now turning the corner.\" Gross mortgage lending was up 64% to \u00a32.3bn, giving it an estimated 3.4% market share. Outflows from remortgaging and capital repayments cut net mortgage lending to \u00a3700m. The spread between interest earned on mortgages and that paid to savers rose slightly to 1.74 points from 1.71, but Mr McNamara said he expected the margin to fall in coming years amid ferocious competition in the home loans market. The expected profits hit from the recent loss of a contract to handle cash paid by businesses over post office counters would be negligible. A&amp;L owns the Girobank network, which operates through post offices, and said that its crucial contracts to handle cash paid in by personal customers remained unaffected."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
