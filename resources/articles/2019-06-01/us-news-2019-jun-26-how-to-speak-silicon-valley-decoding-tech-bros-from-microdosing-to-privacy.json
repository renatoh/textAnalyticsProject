For Californians of a certain tenure, Silicon Valley is a location \u2013 an actual, geological valley nestled between two mountain ranges and the marshy southern dregs of the San Francisco bay. The titans of technology \u2013 Adobe, Alphabet, Apple, eBay, Facebook, HP, Intel and Oracle \u2013 are all headquartered in the valley itself. But as the tech industry\u2019s dominance has expanded, so, too, have Silicon Valley\u2019s boundaries. The phrase has come to represent something that is both more and less than the tech industry as a whole. If the name represents anything at all, it is a way of thinking and talking, a mindset expressed through a shared vocabulary: the vocabulary of bullshit. Where Wall Street is capitalism unvarnished, Silicon Valley is capitalism euphemized. Here is a lexicon of Silicon Valley: a map for travelers to find their way through the wilds of billion-dollar lies. Airbnb (n) \u2013 A hotel company that figured out how to avoid the expense of owning hotels or employing hotel workers. See unicorn. (v) \u2013 To illegally convert an apartment into a vacation rental in a city with an affordable housing crisis. Amazon (n) \u2013 A website that went from selling books to selling virtually all items on Earth; it\u2019s also a movie studio, book publisher, major grocery chain owner, hardware manufacturer, and host for most of the internet, to name just a few endeavors. Competitors in nearly every industry fear its might. Formerly known as \u201cthe everything store\u201d; soon to be known as \u201cthe only store\u201d. angel investor (phrase) \u2013 A wealthy individual who invests a small amount of startup capital at the earliest stages of a company or idea. Often, the angel is part of the entrepreneur\u2019s extended network, whether because they went to the same college, worked together at a previous company, or are family friends. Frequently a vocal opponent of affirmative action. See also meritocracy. apology (n) \u2013 A public relations exercise designed to change headlines. In practice, a promise to keep doing the same thing but conceal it better. \u201cPeople need to be able to explicitly choose what they share,\u201d said Mark Zuckerberg in a 2007 apology, before promising better privacy controls in a 2010 mea culpa, vowing more transparency in 2011, and acknowledging \u201cmistakes\u201d in the Cambridge Analytica scandal. See Facebook, privacy. Apple (n) \u2013 America\u2019s first trillion-dollar company, which achieved inordinate success through groundbreaking products such as the Macintosh, iPod and iPhone. After it ran out of ideas for new products, Apple maintained its dominance by coming up with new ways to force its customers to purchase expensive accessories. See dongle. artificial intelligence (ph) \u2013 Computers so smart that their behavior is indistinguishable from that of humans. Often achieved by secretly paying real humans to pretend they\u2019re robots. Autopilot (n) \u2013 The name Tesla gives to its advanced driver assistance system, ie souped-up cruise control. Named after the advanced technology that allows pilots to take their hands off the controls of a plane, but very much not an invitation for Tesla drivers to take their hands off the wheel, right, Elon? bad actors (ph) \u2013 People who use a social media platform in a way that results in bad press. Bad actors usually take advantage of features of the platform that were clearly vulnerable for abuse but necessary to achieve scale. \u201cThe Russian intelligence operatives who used Facebook\u2019s self-serve advertising system to target US voters with divisive and false messages were \u2018bad actors\u2019.\u201d biohacking (n) \u2013 Applying the DIY hacker ethos to one\u2019s own body to achieve higher performance. Often involves bizarre eating habits, fasting, inserting microchips into one\u2019s body, and taking nootropics (AKA expensive nutritional supplements). When done by women, dieting. In extreme forms, an eating disorder. bootstrap (v) \u2013 To start a company without venture capital. The only option for the vast majority of people who start companies, but a point of pride for the tiny subset of entrepreneurs who have access to venture capital and eschew it. \u201cMy dad is friends with Tim Draper but I wanted to do something on my own so I\u2019m bootstrapping\u201d \u2013 a tech bro. cloud, the (n) \u2013 Servers. A way to keep more of your data off your computer and in the hands of big tech, where it can be monetized in ways you don\u2019t understand but may have agreed to when you clicked on the Terms of Service. Usually located in a city or town whose elected officials exchanged tens of millions of dollars in tax breaks for seven full-time security guard jobs. data (n) \u2013 A record of everything you do involving the internet \u2013 which is increasingly synonymous with everything you do, period. Corporations use the digital trails you and millions of others leave to sell you things \u2013 in other words, your actions, relationships, and desires have become currency. See privacy. deprecated (adj) \u2013 A description for a software feature that is no longer being updated and will probably be phased out soon. disrupt (v) \u2013 To create a new market, either by inventing something completely new (ie the personal computer, the smartphone) or by ignoring the rules of an old market. If the latter, often illegal, but rarely prosecuted. Uber disrupted the taxi industry by flooding the market with illegal cabs, while Airbnb disrupted the hotel market by flooding the market with illegal sublets. See sharing economy. diversity and inclusion (ph) \u2013 Initiatives designed to sugarcoat Silicon Valley\u2019s systematic failure to hire, promote and retain African American and Latinx employees. The phrase is usually invoked when a company is expounding on its \u201cvalues\u201d in response to incontrovertible evidence of widespread racial or gender discrimination. dongle (n) A small, expensive and easily misplaced piece of computer gear. Usually required when a company revolutionizes its products by getting rid of all the ports that are compatible with the accessories you already own. See Apple. Don\u2019t Be Evil (ph) Google\u2019s original corporate motto. Deprecated. employee (n) People who work for a tech company and are eligible for health insurance and retirement benefits. Importantly, this does not necessarily include the vast majority of people who perform work for the company and create its value, such as the people who drive for transportation companies, the people who deliver for delivery companies, and the cooks, cleaners, security guards and parking attendants on tech campuses. Less than 50% of Google\u2019s global workforce. See Uber, sharing economy, disruption, scale. evangelist (n) A job title for salespeople who are slightly creepy in their cultish devotion to the product they are selling. \u201cI used to work in sales but now I evangelize Microsoft\u2019s products.\u201d FAANG (ph) An acronym for Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix and Google. Originally coined to refer to the company\u2019s high-performing tech stocks, but also used to denote a certain amount of status. \u201cHis boyfriend is a software engineer, but not at a FAANG so he\u2019s not really marriage material.\u201d Facebook (n) Your mom\u2019s favorite social media platform. 5G (n) \u2013 The next generation of mobile internet, which promises to enable digital surveillance at blindingly fast speeds. free speech (ph) A constitutionally protected right in the US that is primarily invoked by tech bros and internet trolls when they are asked to stop being assholes. Syn: hate speech. See ideological diversity. GDPR (ph) A comprehensive data protection law that applies to companies operating in Europe, including American ones. Though the safeguards don\u2019t apply directly to people outside Europe, the measure may push companies to step up their privacy efforts everywhere \u2013 handy for Americans, whose own government has done a pretty poor job of protecting them. gentrifier (n) \u2013 A relatively affluent newcomer to a historically poor or working-class neighborhood whose arrival portends increased policing, pricier restaurants and the eviction or displacement of longtime residents. Often used by gentrifiers as a general epithet for anyone who arrived in their neighborhood after they did. Google (n) \u2013 The privacy-devouring tech company that does everything that Facebook does, but manages to get away with it, largely because its products are useful instead of just depressing. (v) \u2013 To make the bare minimum effort to inform oneself about something. What a tech bro did before he insisted on explaining your area of expertise to you. ideological diversity (ph) \u2013 The rallying cry for opponents of diversity and inclusion programs. Advocates for ideological diversity argue that corporate efforts to increase the representation of historically marginalized groups \u2013 women, African Americans and Latinos, among others \u2013 should also be required to increase the representation of people who believe that women, African Americans and Latinos are inherently unsuited to work in tech. incubator (n) A parent company that takes baby companies under its wing until they can fly on their own; a playgroup for tech bros. See meritocracy. IPO (n) Initial public offering \u2013 when a company begins allowing regular people to buy shares. A way for everyone, not just venture capital firms, to lose money, as in Uber\u2019s recent disappointing IPO. meritocracy (n) A system that rewards those who most deserve it, as long as they went to the right school. The tech industry is a meritocracy in much the same way that America is a meritocracy. See diversity and inclusion. microdosing (n) \u2013 Taking small amounts of illegal drugs while white. It may be possible to microdose without writing a book or personal essay about it, but the evidence suggests otherwise. mission (n) \u2013 What separates a tech bro and a finance bro: the tech bro works for a company that has a \u201cmission\u201d. Usually something grandiose, utopian, and entirely inconsistent with the company\u2019s business model. Facebook\u2019s mission is to make the world more open and connected; Facebook\u2019s business model is to sell ads by dividing people into incredibly narrow marketing profiles. monetize (v) \u2013 To charge money for a product, or, to figure out how to extract money from people without their understanding or explicit consent. Though having a plan to monetize is usually the first step for a small business or startup (\u201cYou mean I shouldn\u2019t just give the lemonade away for free?\u201d), angel investors and venture capitalists have created an environment in which companies can attempt to scale first and monetize later. \u201cMy app is free because I\u2019m monetizing my users\u2019 data.\u201d Move fast and break things (ph) \u2013 Facebook\u2019s original corporate motto. In hindsight, a red flag. Deprecated, allegedly. off-site (n) \u2013 A work event at a non-work location. Often includes alcohol and socializing. Primarily used when describing a sexual harassment complaint. pivot (v) \u2013 What tech startups do when they realize scaling is not a business model without a monetization strategy. platform (n) \u2013 A website that hosts user-generated content. Platforms are distinct from publishers, which more directly commission and control the content they publish. In the US, platforms enjoy special legal status protecting them from liability for the content they host and allowing them to exercise broad discretion over which content they want to ban or delete. Facebook, YouTube, Reddit and Craigslist are examples of platforms. The reason Facebook says it does not \u201chave a policy that stipulates that the information you post on Facebook must be true\u201d. privacy (n) \u2013 Archaic. The concept of maintaining control over one\u2019s personal information. revolutionize (v) \u2013 To change something that does not need to be changed in order to charge money for its replacement. \u201cApple revolutionized the experience of using headphones when it killed the headphone jack on iPhones.\u201d runway (n) \u2013 The amount of venture capital a startup has left before it has to either monetize its product, pivot or start selling the office furniture. \u201cI can\u2019t believe Topher spent half our runway on a Tesla Roadster.\u201d scale (v) \u2013 The holy grail. To create a business that can accommodate exponential increases in users with minimal increases in costs. Also applicable if the costs can be externalized to taxpayers or countries in the global south. In the negative, a surprisingly effective excuse not to do something that any non-tech company would do. \u201cWe would prefer not to foment genocide in Myanmar, but content moderation simply does not scale.\u201d shadowban (v) \u2013 The conspiracy theory that no one is responding to a social media post because the platform is secretly preventing the user\u2019s content from being seen and/or going viral. \u201cBrandon was convinced that Twitter had shadowbanned him when no one responded to his demand that an SJW feminazi debate him.\u201d sharing economy (ph) A system in which working does not mean being employed. See employees. smart (adj) \u2013 A product that is capable of being hooked up to the internet \u2013 thus rendering it capable of being hacked or abusing your data. Snapchat (n) \u2013 Facebook\u2019s research and development department. tech bro (n) \u2013 A US-born, college-educated, Patagonia-clad male whose entry level salary at one of the FAANG companies was at least $125,000 and who frequently insists that his female co-workers give him high-fives. Typically works in product management or marketing. Had he been born 10 years earlier, he would have been a finance bro instead. the FTC (n) The US Federal Trade Commission. Capable of levying enormous fines against companies like Facebook, potentially whittling down its revenues to just a handful of billions of dollars. Not really in that much of a hurry to do anything, however. thought leader (n) \u2013 An unemployed rich person. Twitter (n) \u2013 A mid-sized business with outsized importance due to its three primary users: Donald Trump, Elon Musk and journalists. A useful tool for journalists to gauge public opinion by talking to other journalists, and for Elon Musk to provoke lawsuits and federal investigations into security fraud. Uber (n) \u2013 A unicorn startup that disrupted the taxi industry by revolutionizing the sharing economy at incredible scale thanks to unprecedented amounts of venture capital. In the first earnings report after a lackluster IPO, revealed that it lost $1bn in three months. unicorn (n) \u2013 A startup valued at at least $1bn. At one point, rare. Increasingly, not even that exciting. UX designer (n) The person responsible for a website or app user\u2019s experience (UX). They make the buttons they want you to click on \u2013 Share! Buy! Sign Up! \u2013 large and noticeable, and the buttons that turn off location tracking very small. venture capital (ph) A system by which wealthy individuals can invest in startups before they go public. A legal and surprisingly respectable form of gambling. An alternate retirement plan for fortysomething multimillionaires who never developed hobbies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
