You\u2019ll have been reading Murakami, for example, and they\u2019ll say: \u201cHaruki or Ray?\u201d Or you\u2019ll just have discovered Soviet sci-fi or weird folk and they\u2019ll have long since moved on to space-jazz and Chinese noir. Just like in the song, you saw the crescent, but they saw the whole of the moon. Tim Etchells is a whole of the moon sort of a person. Etchells is a writer and artist and the artistic director of performance art group Forced Entertainment. The stories in Endland are gathered from an earlier publication, Endland Stories: Or Bad Lives, published in 1999, with additional pieces and an introduction by Jarvis Cocker. I am so utterly unhip that I wasn\u2019t familiar with the original, but I am now a diehard fan: late to the party, I\u2019m glad to have made it at all. \u201cWhether or not these stories bear any relation to life as it is actual lived in Endland (sic),\u201d he writes in a sort of introductory note to the book, \u201cis not my problem and good riddance to all those what prefer to read abt truly good, lucky and nice people \u2013 you won\u2019t like this crap at all.\u201d It\u2019s a fair warning. There are not a lot of good, lucky and nice people in the book. There is a barman called Meniscus (\u201con account of how full he liked to fill the glasses with shandy and ale\u201d), and a woman called Donkey (\u201con account of how many people had ridden her on the beach one night\u201d). There is an entire story devoted to \u201cCrash Family Robinson\u201d. There\u2019s a little girl called Mary \u201cwhose fave toy was a thing called MY LITTLE VOID. All night she\u2019d stare at it, and all day if you let her.\u201d There\u2019s a woman called Naomi, addicted to \u201cheroine\u201d \u2013 many words in the stories are deliberately misspelt and mispunctuated \u2013 \u201csat in her kitchen, drinking instant coffee that she made with hot water out of the tap and trying to complete a 500,000 piece jigsaw depicting a field of blood, mud and barbed wire at the battle of the Somme and in which every piece of the jigsaw was shaped like the body of a dead man.\u201d The stories deliberately blend into one another \u2013 themes, characters and motifs recur, and are set in a place called Endland, which both is and is not England, a post-apocalyptic England, ruined, war-damaged, pathetic, sad and self-destructed, a \u201cdump of olden times where people died of cholera, raisins, mumps, vertigo and Russian Mattress\u201d. In Endland, at evening classes you can choose from \u201cVOODOO ECONOMICS\u201d, \u201cSLEEPWALKING (Intermediate)\u201d, \u201cORGANISED CRIME\u201d and \u201cNIGHTMARES OF SUBTERFUGE\u201d. A typical snack is \u201cCadbury\u2019s Chocolate Nooses\u201d. On TV there\u2019s a gameshow called Quizoola! featuring team captains Fred and Rosemary West. There\u2019s a Cash &amp; Carry porn shop, and sex-trafficking and sexual exploitation are commonplace. And while people get murdered, and generally ruin their own and others\u2019 lives, the gods, \u201csuch as they are\u201d \u2013 including Zeus, Tesco, Venus, Mr Stretchy, Herpes, Lucozade, Asimov, Risotto, Horse Radish, Hand-Job and Anastasia \u2013 get angry and make \u201cvarious wagers abt what will happen next\u201d. What happens next is never good: the gods are powerless; there are no happy endings. In one particularly horrible story, identical twins are brought to Endland as sex slaves, while in \u201cJames\u201d a man creates a patch for the computer game Doom using his own passport photo, \u201cscanned in and replicated a thousand times so that in the hours and hours of his playing he killed himself a million times, splattering his own blood to four corners but playing and playing again\u201d. In the story \u201cKelly\u201d, \u201cK falls for thirteen years. She falls and falls. Then finally she falls through a hole in the welfare system safety net and she keeps on falling, going down down and downtown into a dark hole until she lands and breaks her back on some stones.\u201d This could all be incredibly turgid, like subjecting yourself to some dreadful art installation, but it\u2019s not. The stories are nastily funny \u2013 sick jokes \u2013 and Etchells is a latter-day Menippean satirist. The biggest influence on his early stories, he notes in an afterword, was Mark E Smith of the band the Fall, whose lyrics were glorious, ferocious rages. \u201cSome persons have accused that these writings are full of narrational gaps and sudden perplexing changes of topic brought abt by my total failure to appreciate that the reader does not share important vital background information which I possess. However it is my intention to continue regardless.\u201d The book is horrible, brilliant, deliberately provoking. At times I wished it was over; now I wish it had never stopped. \u2022 Endland is published by And Other Stories (RRP \u00a311.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.
