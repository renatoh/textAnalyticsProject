The 32-year-old pace spearhead has accepted defeat in his bid to return from a long-standing knee injury which has already required surgery three times. The Yorkshireman faces three months out of the game and confirmed: \"I'm going to go home and work hard on continually strengthening my knee. \"Obviously this is another setback, and it's going to be a huge disappointment to miss the Ashes and the World Cup. \"But I want to explore all the medical options that are open to me before I make any decisions about my future career.\" The Yorkshire fast bowler has broken down four times in his attempts to recover from the injury sustained during a one-day international against New Zealand in Dunedin last February. The latest blow throws serious doubts over his playing future. Gough is due to see a specialist as soon as he returns to England and will then have the injury re-assessed in 12 weeks before making any further decisions about his future. He will be replaced in the England squad by Surrey's Alex Tudor, who had been acting as cover, having been called up from England's Academy base in Adelaide ever since Gough suffered a setback in Brisbane just over a week ago. Gough, who has not played a Test since facing Australia at the Oval in August 2001, was a gamble in England's original Ashes squad. The selectors took a chance on his fitness, even though the Yorkshireman had been confined to just a handful of NatWest Series one-day games since being struck down by his injury. Early indications were that he might even be fit enough in time for the first Test, currently being played in Brisbane. But he confirmed at the 11th hour he would not be ready for the Ashes opener, and England captain Nasser Hussain recently hinted strongly that Gough was not expected to be available at all for any of the Tests down under. Gough's departure caps a terrible last three days for England when it comes to injuries. Within hours of taking his first Ashes wicket on Thursday, big pace hope Simon Jones suffered a knee ligament injury which has ruled him out of the current match and will prevent him playing cricket again for at least six months. His place on tour is to be taken by Yorkshireman Chris Silverwood."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
