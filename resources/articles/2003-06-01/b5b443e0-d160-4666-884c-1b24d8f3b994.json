That much he knew. But he refused to think any further ahead. He couldn't say whether the draw had opened up for him, as was being widely suggested. \"I haven't actually looked at it,\" he said. Only the faces in the locker room gave him a clue to who was sharing his half of the draw. \"Obviously the guys that are playing on opposite days you know are in the other half. Outside that, I wouldn't know who I'm playing. I take one at a time. It's my commitment not to overlook anybody.\" Two years ago Delgado went down in straight sets to Agassi but managed to save five match points. He was 24 years old then, and ranked 182nd in the world. Ten years earlier he had been the world's best 14-year-old. Now he is down to 458th, a vertiginous descent even by the standards of British tennis players. Of his six appearances at Wimbledon, only one was achieved without the need for a wild-card entry. This year he needed to win a play-off in Raynes Park to get a place in the draw. The last time he played Agassi, they met on No1 Court. This time they were scheduled for Centre Court, and Delgado responded to the invitation by producing a fighting performance that eventually earned him a standing ovation. \"It was unbelievable,\" he said. \"As good as your wildest dreams, I guess.\" Agassi took the first set with two breaks of serve before a back strain started to worry Delgado. \"I had a problem with it last week,\" he said, \"and I think it started going into spasm. I don't know what was going on. At one stage it got quite painful. I just tried to loosen it up and it eased off.\" The second set had disappeared like water down a plughole before the trainer appeared for a brief session of on-court massage. The improvement was immediate, and Delgado began to play with real urgency. When he held a set point against Agassi's serve at 4-5, the former champion rose to the challenge. Two games later, however, Delgado reached a similar position and answered his opponent's whipped forehand to the corner with a running topspin lob that transfixed the American as it arced low and skidded out of reach. \"I was pretty pumped on that,\" Delgado said. Everything about his game became tauter and more authoritative. But, as might have been expected, the rise in standards was more than matched by his opponent. Agassi had seen enough. Surrendering only two points in his five service games on the way to taking the fourth set 6-4, the man with two black go-faster stripes running down the side of his white T-shirt accelerated away to an appointment in the second round. He is 33 now, and the co- ordination of hand and eye cannot possibly be as keen as it was in 1992, when he found a way to play baseline tennis on grass and beat Goran Ivanisevic in the final, or in 1995, when he was playing as if touched by a divine hand before suddenly buckling to Boris Becker in the semi-final, or in 1999, when he lost an Olympian final to Pete Sampras. But there is no doubt in his pride at regaining the No1 position from Hewitt. \"It's a phenomenal accomplishment at this age,\" he said. \"It's over 52 weeks, so you don't have to just play well, you have to play well and a lot, and that's not so easy for me anymore. I have to pick and choose and make sure I'm looking after my body and my mind. And I don't know how much longer. I don't think I'll know before I'm there.\" He bowed and waved to all four corners before leaving the court yesterday, but he did not look as though goodbyes were on his mind."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
