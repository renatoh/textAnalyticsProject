A dispute over plans for a vast tunnel running 33 miles through the Alps has twice this week spilled over into violence. On Thursday, police in anti-riot gear fired tear gas at demonstrators after tens of thousands of people took advantage of a public holiday to protest against the scheme in the Susa valley, which is close to several of the main Olympic venues. The clashes took place as some opponents of the project tried to reach a construction site that had earlier been occupied by protesters and then violently cleared by police. Some 20 people, including five police, were taken away in ambulances following that incident and the tensions it generated have yet to subside. Indeed, they were further inflamed by the infrastructure minister in Silvio Berlusconi's government, Pietro Lunardi, a tunnel engineer and an ardent supporter of the project, who declared on Wednesday that the dispute had ceased to be the responsibility of his ministry and become a \"public order issue\". Mr Berlusconi, for his part, has insisted the project must go ahead and that \"from an environmental point of view, it has all the [necessary] guarantees\". That is certainly not what most local people or the majority of Italian environmentalists believe. They argue the railway line, which will link Turin to Lyon, will spoil the beauty of the valley. They also say the mountain contains deposits of both uranium and asbestos. They fear the drilling of the tunnel will lead to the creation of spoil tips in the valley from which harmful deposits will be released into the air. But is not just a straightforward clash between the champions of progress and development on the one hand and those of the environment on the other. Earlier this week, the cause of the tunnel's opponents took a damaging blow from an unexpected quarter. G\u00e9rard Leras, leader of the Greens in the Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes region of south-eastern France, gave an interview to the Italian daily Corriere della Sera in which he accused his Italian counterparts of wrong-headedly opposing a project that would cut lorry pollution in the Alps. He told the newspaper: \"It is one thing to be ecologists and another to be localists. You can't always say 'no'.\" Mr Leras said the Maurienne area on the French side of the frontier could \"no longer put up with 5-6,000 lorries a day - the very same lorries that cross and pollute the Susa valley\". But will the high-speed rail project take them off the roads? Italian protesters insist they will not. Earlier this month their case won support from a leading transport expert, Marco Ponti, who lectures at Milan's Politecnico University. He told the magazine L'Espresso that he could find \"no rational motivation\" for building the Turin to Lyon link. Mr Ponti said: \"The capacity of the existing [rail] network is already excessive with respect to the demand and goods that travel by rail have no need to move at 300km an hour.\" As for passengers, he said, they already had a high-speed link. It was called low-cost flights. The head of the organising committee of the games said this week he was hoping for a truce to prevent protests over the tunnel spilling over into the Olympics. But with tensions running as high as they are now, that is by no means guaranteed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
