Manuel Pellegrini is determined to strengthen his midfield and last weekend it emerged that West Ham were exploring the possibility of signing Lobotka from Vigo. West Ham had held discussions with Vigo about a double deal for Lobotka and Maxi G\u00f3mez, the highly rated Uruguay forward. They had indicated a willingness to pay in the region of \u00a350m to secure both players. Yet while West Ham will continue to monitor G\u00f3mez, it is understood Lobotka is more likely to move elsewhere. The Slovakian, who has been compared with Luka Modric, is attracting interest in Italy and Spain. However the West Ham director of football, Mario Husillos, has moved quickly to contact Villarreal about Fornals. Husillos knows the 23-year-old from his time at M\u00e1laga and West Ham are thought to be preparing a \u00a324m offer for the Spain international, who plays in a more attacking role than Lobotka. Marseille\u2019s Morgan Sanson also features on West Ham\u2019s shortlist. It is thought the French club would be open to selling the 24-year-old midfielder after failing to qualify for the Champions League. West Ham have also shown an interest in signing Ozan Kabak from Stuttgart but face competition from several German sides for the 19-year-old defender. Bayern Munich are reported to be leading the race for Kabak, who moved to Stuttgart last summer for \u20ac11.5m and is available for his release clause of \u20ac15m having been voted the Bundesliga\u2019s rookie of the season last week. The Plymouth midfielder Graham Carey has joined CSKA Sofia on a two-year deal after rejecting a contract offer to stay. The 30-year-old scored 49 goals in 197 appearances after joining from Ross County in 2015. Ruben Lameiras is also expected to leave Home Park this summer with Charlton and Swansea both in talks with the Portuguese midfielder after a move to Bordeaux failed to materialise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
