Described by chair of judges Kate Williams as a book that \u201cshines a light on today\u2019s America\u201d, Jones\u2019s fourth novel An American Marriage won the \u00a330,000 award on Wednesday night. With fans including Oprah Winfrey and Barack Obama, the novel follows ambitious newlyweds Celestial and Roy. \u201cWe\u2019re not your garden-variety bourgeois Atlanta Negroes where the husband goes to bed with his laptop under his pillow and the wife dreams about her blue-box jewelry. I was young, hungry and on the come-up. Celestial was an artist, intense and gorgeous,\u201d it begins. Their lives together are just beginning when Roy is sentenced to 12 years in jail for a rape he hasn\u2019t committed. Celestial believes in his innocence, but finds herself taking comfort in her childhood friend Andre until five years later, Roy\u2019s conviction is overturned and he returns home. The novel won from a six-book shortlist that included last year\u2019s Booker winner, Anna Burns\u2019s Milkman, and former Booker winner Pat Barker\u2019s new novel, The Silence of the Girls. Williams said judges deliberated for four hours to make the tough decision. \u201cIt\u2019s an incredible examination of America and American life, focusing on the intimacy of a marriage but on a huge political canvas,\u201d she said. \u201cThe prose is luminous, striking and utterly moving. How hard it is even when you\u2019re on the outside and are free, how you\u2019re not really free when you have someone in prison.\u201d Jones said: \u201cI am thrilled and honoured. I wasn\u2019t expecting to win. The shortlist was so strong and I was honoured to be among them but I had no idea whether I would win. I didn\u2019t write a speech!\u201d Incarceration is the \u201cboogeyman of black America,\u201d she added. \u201cI decided to look under the bed and tackle it head on.\u201d With her win coinciding with Donald Trump\u2019s trip to the UK, Jones said she had no desire for the president to read her novel. \u201cI\u2019m delighted that Obama read my book and I\u2019m delighted that I had a president in my time that read books and recommended them, who cared about the past and history, who used it to guide us to the future. I have no real hope or desire that the current occupant of the White House will read my book.\u201d The whole shortlist was timely, added Williams, from Barker\u2019s retelling of the Iliad from the perspective of a princess who is made a slave to Achilles, to Madeleine Miller\u2019s twist on Homer\u2019s witch, Circe. An American Marriage also has links to Greek myth; Jones told the Guardian that every novel she has written \u201charks back to the Greeks\u201d, with Celestial being a twist on Penelope, the faithful wife who waits for years for Odysseus \u2013 \u201conly modern, independent and famous for her art\u201d. Williams said: \u201cAll the shortlisted novels speak clearly about the lives of women in different ways, about oppression and identity and trying to be free in a regime that doesn\u2019t want you to be.\u201d Jones, a novelist and a creative writing professor who lives in Brooklyn, has spoken of finding inspiration in an argument she overheard while she was doing research at Harvard into mass incarceration. \u201cThe woman, who was splendidly dressed, and the man \u2013 he looked OK. But she looked great! And she said to him, \u2018You know you wouldn\u2019t have waited on me for seven years.\u2019 And he shot back, \u2018This shit wouldn\u2019t have happened to you in the first place\u2019,\u201d Jones told the Paris Review last year. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018You know, I don\u2019t know him, but I know she\u2019s probably right. I doubt very seriously that he would wait on her for seven years, and he is probably right that this wouldn\u2019t have happened to her \u2026 I was intrigued by them, and so I integrated this very personal conflict with the research I had done.\u201d Williams expressed the hope that \u2013 with Obama\u2019s successor currently in the UK \u2013 that An American Marriage might find another presidential reader. \u201cIt\u2019s very timely given we have the president of America in this country at present. Let\u2019s hope he and the first lady read the book,\u201d she said. The Women\u2019s prize is the UK\u2019s only book award for fiction by women. Running for 24 years, it has been won by writers including Zadie Smith and Lionel Shriver."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
