He is understood to be willing to dig in his heels, despite the discomfort it will cause the FA's chief executive Brian Barwick, in order to highlight his concerns at the increasing power of the Premiership and Football League at Soho Square. The Football League chairman Lord Mawhinney denounced Brooking on Monday, calling on Barwick to discipline him after criticisms of the leagues. Mawhinney's views are privately echoed within the Premiership, where Brooking is suspected of empire-building. Mawhinney's attack was the latest round in a long-running conflict over the FA's \u00a34.2m contribution to the FL youth development fund. Brooking wants to attach conditions to the money and effectively oversee the coaching; Mawhinney objects and has twice written to Barwick and the FA chairman Geoff Thompson asking them to rein in the former England midfielder. Barwick has already declined to back Brooking once, prompting a heated row between the pair, and the official line is that Brooking's views are those of a private individual rather than of the FA. But the chief executive is in an unenviable position: back Brooking and he makes an enemy of the FA's newest board member and further antagonises the professional game; back the clubs and he gives Brooking an excuse to walk away and further expose the power struggle raging over the Burns report. Brooking is well aware of the leverage his position and public popularity give him and he seems determined not to waste it. First for second city The BBC Sports Personality of the Year show seems certain to leave London for the first time in its 52-year history. A source close to the NEC says a deal was done two weeks ago for the awards to be presented at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham. The BBC did not deny the move yesterday, saying only that \"we are in the planning stage for this year's event\". Seats of utter confusion The latest dire prediction about Wembley from the hapless contractor Multiplex will further confuse members of Club Wembley, still awaiting a glimpse of the new stadium months after they shelled out four-figure sums for seats. On Monday they received an email from Wembley National Stadium Ltd saying the stadium would not be ready until the end of the year and thanking them for \"your continued support\". Yesterday Multiplex raised the stakes further, predicting that it would be nearly a year before the stadium was ready, a claim rejected by WNSL. While the parties responsible for the shambles blame each other, the paying punters are wondering just what they will get for their money. Madejski retunes to BBC Reading's chairman John Madejski has climbed down in his stand-off with BBC Radio Berkshire, agreeing to grant live Premiership commentary rights two weeks after announcing an exclusive deal with Reading 107, a station with a far smaller reach owned by one of his companies, Madejski Communications. Madejski wanted more than \u00a380,000, a 150% increase on the \u00a333,000 that the BBC had been paying for Championship games, but after protests by the supporters' trust and an increased offer from Radio Berkshire he relented. Scents and dollars The late Fred Trueman has probably not stopped spinning since he was laid to rest last month, and the latest sponsorship deal signed by his England successors should keep him revolving for a while longer, with Boss signing up the squad to promote four fragrances and some skincare products. The campaign, launched yesterday in Cowes, will feature all three captains - Andrew Flintoff, Andrew Strauss and Michael Vaughan. Fred may have been a curmudgeon but one thing is for sure: he didn't moisturise. paul.kelso@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
