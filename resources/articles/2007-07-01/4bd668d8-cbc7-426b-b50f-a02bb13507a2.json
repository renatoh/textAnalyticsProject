Shortly after what passed for dawn the world's greatest golfers peeled back the curtains to find the town grey overhead, wet underfoot and with rain driving off the North Sea. After the wettest Wimbledon since the Titanic sank and a Henley Regatta during which the crews could practically row into the enclosures, it was no surprise. The Irishman David Higgins was tempted to follow the instinct of weekend hackers and blank his 6.41am tee-time in favour of another hour or two of the dreamless. Only the fact that his appointment was with the Open rather than the Saturday medal persuaded him to brave the elements. \"If I had been at home I would never have played golf today. I would have stayed in bed,\" he said. Perhaps he should have - he carded a 79. The only explanation for the early arrival of thousands of spectators is the fervour for golf in these parts. When the game's greatest prize comes to town only every eight years, a little rain is not going to put you off. The locals are used to it and they turned the place into a sea of Gore-Tex as they rustled around the links. Those arriving to see Nick Faldo begin his round found him wearing mittens and his playing partners, Trevor Immelman and Carl Pettersson, sporting woolly hats. Tiger Woods had no such worries, though. By the time he reached the 1st tee at 9am the tempest was abating - \"He even makes the rain stop,\" said a passing caddie."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
