The 40-year-old chief executive of CNBC was in London for just a day - welcoming her new European chief, Mick Buckley - before heading off to inspect another part of her global business TV empire. She showed no sign of jetlag or airport fatigue. But then I remembered reading that she was one of those infuriating people, like Napoleon and Baroness Thatcher, who could exist, indeed thrive, on just a few hours sleep a night. That ability must be one of the reasons for the achievements she has chalked up in her remarkable professional career. She is one of the few black women at the helm of a US corporation, as she was the first to break into the almost exclusively male preserve of partnership at the waspish management consultant, McKinsey. She is about to start work on her latest novel, the fourth in a series of mystery tales involving a black female economics professor at an Ivy League college (Thomas-Graham went to Harvard); and she is the mother of three children, including twins just approaching their second birthday. It makes me tired just thinking about it, but she takes it all in her stride. Her day begins at 4am, with a couple of hours' writing before the children wake up. 'I always read lots when I was a child, and when I went to Harvard Law School I wanted to exercise the creative side of my mind. Mysteries are such a fun genre,' she explains. She has some 'quality time' with the children before heading to her office, and is sometimes home to put them to bed. Other responsibilities - she is on the board of the New York Opera and the American Red Cross - can make it a very long day. The heroine of the novels, Nikki Chase, is 'smart and sassy and sexy', according to the blurb of the latest, Orange Crushed . She too puts in the hours, ruffles feathers and upsets reputations in her quest for the truth about a murdered Princeton academic. It is no surprise to find that Thomas-Graham admits to a touch of autobiographical inspiration for her character. 'Sure, she deals with lots of the challenges I've also faced. In the USA in the 1990s, you didn't find women or coloured people in senior management roles. They faced a set of issues which were quite unique, in that most people in business simply did not know women of colour. As you began to advance in your career, it made you very visible, and got you noticed at work. That was good if you were getting noticed for positive things, but if you made mistakes they got extrapolated onto the rest of the minority.' From respectable middle-class origins in Detroit, she was made chief executive of CNBC in the summer of 2001, just a few weeks before the 11 September terrorist attacks that changed everything for America. 'The first six months were like The Perfect Storm ', she remembers. 'The financial markets were in recession after the internet bubble, then came the corporate scandals like Enron and WorldCom. And 9/11 on top of all that. Overnight, we went from being a peacetime to a wartime economy.' This presented unique problems for CNBC. The channel, with its running ticker-tape of Wall Street share prices, market updates and talking heads assuming 'buy' or 'sell' positions, was a score board for the financial community. Its interviews with business leaders had the air of a papal audience, where the anchor and the audience were content just to listen to the great man's words. That changed. 'Suddenly, the business leaders became con artists in many people's eyes,' says Graham. 'What do you do then?' The answer was to go 'broader and deeper', she says. 'From being a stock-market channel we became a business news channel, and that was a big difference. We had to become multi-dimensional, with a greater focus on the economy, on Washington, on security and foreign affairs. We realised that how safe people feel at home was probably the most important factor in how they invest. And we had to become more sceptical and probing.' The channel had to expand its global coverage. This was partly a response to the greater importance of international events and how they impacted on US business, but it was also a sound commercial strategy. 'We have access to 200 million households around the world, and we'd never fully leveraged that.' It was a business opportunity just waiting to be exploited. According to the market surveys, CNBC viewers are 'high net worth individuals', with average assets of $1m each. Some 90 per cent have degrees, and they are intelligent, sophisticated and discriminating. 'Our audience will hang on in there and won't feel the need to have things dumbed down for them,' she says. She calls the channel the business network of record, and compares it to the Wall Street Journal in reliability and depth of its coverage. The link to the Journal goes further than that - Dow Jones is a CNBC partner, via the ultimate holding company, the giant General Electric Corporation. Other media organisations have learnt that foreign news networks are expensive and management intensive, but CNBC's business model is different, says Graham. Broadcasts from outside the US are centred on the great financial capitals of the world - London, Frankfurt, Dubai, Hong Kong and Tokyo - where business news can be presented in a direct way. This allows CNBC to fund more 'in-depth' analysis of national and regional economies, and industrial and financial sectors, in special reports and set-pieces from, for example, the Davos summit or Paris airshow. The channel's financial performance is not stripped out from its parent NBC Universal, but, with premium advertising rates for its top-notch audience, she says it is 'highly profitable. GE is a very demanding parent.' After her whistlestop tour of CNBC's global network, she is back in the States (homes in Manhattan and Westchester) to supervise coverage of the presidential election. 'There are two issues: Iraq and the economy. Obviously we will focus on the economy, and we have to answer the question of how the CEOs vote.' If this is a sign that she's going to tell me whether she is for George Bush or John Kerry, she never follows through, and we become diverted to another subject before I get the chance to ask. So I don't know how Pamela Thomas-Graham is going to vote in this election. Her background and east coast lifestyle say Democrat, her position as a self-made business leader says Republican. Take your pick. But for what it's worth, I reckon Nikki Chase would definitely be for Kerry. Thoughts of Nikki Chase: ON RACE 'Now we were both successful black women at Harvard. We should have been close friends and allies - but apparently Janice felt the place was too small for the two of us. And she would be thrilled to see me gone. It was sad, but true: the old school HNIC phenomenon (that would be Head Nigger In Charge) was very much alive and well in our generation.' ON MEN 'One of the well-established perks of an academic conference is the opportunity to flirt shamelessly. But after the autumn I'd just had, flirting with handsome dark-eyed men fell into the high-risk category' ON CAREERS 'In another life, Gwen might have been one of those smart, wise-cracking secretaries in a 1930s screwball comedy. Now it was a different century, and she was going to night school to get a degree in education'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
