You gotta have friends who've got friends", "bodyText": "\u2022 More worries for welfare-to-work firm A4e, its year blighted by press controversies and a police inquiry into alleged fraud. It needs friends with friends in high places. And lummy, it has just lost one. A4e hired Jonty Olliff-Cooper in September 2010, after Big Dave ascended to No 10. Olliff-Cooper was an assistant to eccentric strategy guru Steve Hilton. But it has been a tricky time for A4e's erstwhile director of policy and strategy. After months of complaints, the first official figures on the work programme last November revealed that it failed to meet its \"minimum performance levels\", helping fewer people into work than the DWP had estimated would get a job without its help. New work programme figures are due for release at the end of this month. Who knows, they may be even worse. A4e has lost its best link to the government, although there's always Quiller, the lobbyists whose consultants include George Bridges, a pal of chancellor George. Last year, having turned to Quiller, Olliff-Cooper tweeted: \"Quiller was a one-off thing on crisis management during Feb/March [2012]\" Jonty has gone, Quiller is still there. Funny how things pan out. \u2022 A sorry impasse in Doncaster, where activists have been trying to find out more about a dodgy letter sent to minority groups about funding cuts. You may recall it bore an electronic signature identifying the author as the authority's most senior minority officer when in fact it was not his signature and he had explicitly distanced himself from the decision. The borough has since apologised and paid him damages. But will anyone be held to account? Apparently not. The signature wasn't faked, writes chief executive Jo Miller. It was just \"the insertion of the officer's name, ie, an electronic signature with express prior consent\". As for the guilty party \u2013 long departed. \"Had the employee remained in service I would have taken appropriate action.\" Wonder if they wrote themselves an electronic reference. \u2022 The life and times of Henry Vlll were marked by regular spasms of brutality, and we can report academic fisticuffs prompted by the Last of Days, the historical novel by teacher and historian Paul Doherty. Doherty suggests Henry may have been suffocated or just been left to die and then stuffed into the casket and coffin. Oh, please, says Diarmaid MacCulloch, professor of the history of the church at Oxford University. \"This idea may be OK as an entertaining plot for a novel or for that very unhistorical BBC TV series The Tudors, but as history, it is idiotic. We have a perfectly adequate and circumstantial account of Henry's last hours from John Foxe, of Book of Martyrs fame.\" Yes, we have an account, says Doherty. But it is just one account. There are different perspectives. I didn't make this stuff up. There is evidence.\" Harsh words, intrigue, division. Like Henry's life with all those wives. \u2022 The Euro struggle between Tories and Ukipians who want to claim the name of Margaret Thatcher for their own separate meeting rooms threatens to become a soap opera. The tug of war was to have been decided at the next bureau meeting of wise heads from the European parliament. But the complexity of the issues is such that it has been put back for a month. Martin Schulz, the president of the European parliament, has to consult with the group leaders: Martin Callanan, who the leads the Tories and the European Conservatives and Reformists; and Nigel Farage, talisman for Ukip and the co-chair of the Europe of Freedom and Democracy faction. \"It could be interesting,\" a source tells us. \"Particularly as Farage has been before Schulz several times to be fined for unparliamentary behaviour, for example when he called Herman Van Rompuy a damp rag!\" Memories are long, and what goes around comes around. Still, it seemed a good idea at the time. \u2022 And who says our everyman leader won't fly, asks Ukip, following our item yesterday suggesting reluctance. Actually, it was one of the most senior figures in your party. You can't believe them, we're told. In recent months Nigel has been to the US, Canada and Chile, and he didn't swim to any of them, a spokesman assures us. Swimming was never an option. He would have spilled his pint.
