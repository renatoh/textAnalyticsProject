If I tell you that one of the clues is \u2026 4ac \u2026 body part possibly dripping, I hear \u2013 not a problem (2,5) [ wordplay: soundalike (\u2018I hear\u2019) of a body part and an adjective indicated by \u2018possibly dripping\u2019 ] [ soundalike of NOSE WET ] [ definition: not a problem ] \u2026 for NO SWEAT, I\u2019m sure you can deduce its subject. We have not yet been swamped with election references, though also timely is this Telegraph clue \u2026 16ac Prime Minister must accept rubbish start to election for now (3,3) [ wordplay: abbrev. for \u2018prime minister\u2019 containing (\u2018must accept\u2019) synonym for \u2018rubbish\u2019 &amp; initial letter of (\u2018start to\u2019) ELECTION ] [ PM containing ROT &amp; E ] [ definition: for now ] \u2026 for PRO TEM. Even that ambiguously surnamed foreign leader we keep encountering has taken a back seat, though Wanderer has a clue \u2026 20d Charge one politician, with every one considered separately (7) [ wordplay: I (\u2018one\u2019) + abbrev. for a politician + synonym for \u2018(with) every one considered separately\u2019 ] [ I + MP + EACH ] [ definition: charge ] \u2026 for IMPEACH as \u201cperfect\u201d as any treasonous phone call. Words in the world You surely remember the cluedoku? The probably one-off hybrid puzzle presented here by the great Chameleon? Chameleon\u2019s newest initiative is a crossword advent calendar, which you can find here. If you, like Chameleon, have something to share, let me know! And if the general area of advent-calendar puzzles intrigues you, Peake\u2019s Puzzles appears to be collecting them. Latter patter Here\u2019s a grim surface reading from Tramp \u2026 25ac Harmful stuff when former footballer so drunk (8) [ wordplay: synonym for \u2018when\u2019 + name of former footballer + anagram (\u2018drunk\u2019) of SO ] [ AS + (George) BEST + OS ] [ definition: harmful stuff ] Beginners should note that while two-letter anagrams are pretty rare beasts, this one obligingly helps the solver to identify the former footballer in question. The answer is grim, too; ASBESTOS has never been a lovely word. Six hundred-odd years ago, it was used as the name for a special kind of stone. It was special because once you heated it, it stayed hot, and even more special because it doesn\u2019t and could not possibly exist. Even further back, Pliny the Elder used the word to describe a fibrous substance that we might today name by the same term: he took it to be vegetable matter; it wasn\u2019t, and the word was already being used as a name for quicksand, so we live with the legacy of a doubly confusing error. And more recently, the grimmest error of all, regarding this poison as a magic mineral and cramming it into ships and public buildings before its effects became known. All these senses of ASBESTOS reflect, in some way or other, the Greek meaning: unquenchable. And since we haven\u2019t had a Q since SQUIFFY: reader, how would you clue QUENCH?
