Last night friends and colleagues paid tribute to the woman whose distinctive south London twang was heard on everything from the News Quiz, to Just a Minute, to I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue. She also appeared frequently on TV including Have I Got News for You, QI, Call My Bluff and Countdown. Radio 4's controller, Mark Damazer, called her \"a Radio 4 giant\". He said: \"She was incredibly funny. She generated an energy and warmth in every programme she ever did that made her fellow comedians and millions of listeners love her. It's a terrible loss.\" Andy Hamilton, a fellow panelist on the News Quiz, said: \"She was probably the funniest person I've ever worked with both off and on stage. She had the most original comic mind and she was fantastic company. She was like Roger Federer, she could play any game. On the News Quiz she was the quickest of all of us.\" In 2002 Radio 4 listeners voted her wittiest person alive, ahead of Stephen Fry. Yesterday Fry said: \"She was one of the smartest, funniest and most sweetnatured people I ever encountered in the comedy world. Her voice lit up Radio 4's News Quiz, she was brilliant on QI and she tirelessly travelled the UK as one of the most respected and loved comics on the circuit. Sad and miserable news.\" Smith was diagnosed with ovarian cancer three and a half years ago but chose not to make it public. Her close friend the comedian Jeremy Hardy said she was annoyed by it. \"She didn't want to dignify it with publicity. She was just fantastic. She had a brilliant mind and an incredible memory - she could remember chunks of Shakespeare, chunks of Scorcese, bits of the Bible. She loved beautiful things ... she had a real passion for things.\" Smith also appeared on I'm Sorry I Haven't a Clue. Fellow panelist Barry Cryer said the news was a shock but not a surprise given her illness. \"She was gorgeous and very, very funny - not just joke funny. She was a genuine eccentric.\" Smith's roots were in standup and she became a circuit regular after winning the Hackney Empire new act of the year in 1987. She had strong views on religion and the British Humanist Association asked her to become its president in 2004. Yesterday Hanne Stinson, executive director of the BHA, said: \"I was struck by how everything she said about her beliefs was completely in tune with the BHA.\" \u00b7 Obituary"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
