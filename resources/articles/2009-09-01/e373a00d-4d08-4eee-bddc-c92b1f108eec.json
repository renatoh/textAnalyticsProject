He took part in an occupation of the University of Kent to protest against the catering provision. He never really left university, or stopped trying to change life on campus. After studying, he went into university administration at Warwick, then became academic registrar, then acting registrar at Hull University. In 1995, he moved to Ucas (the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service), and, in 2003, became chief executive. In 2003, friends warned him against the job at Ucas. There was no future in central admissions, they said; the system wouldn't last. But instead, it's been boom-time for university applications, with soaring numbers, a move to online applications, and then this summer the biggest cohort of students chasing a finite number of places. For those few days after the A-level results, McClaran and his call centre in Cheltenham were on every TV news channel. But if he thought university admissions were controversial, his new job as head of the university watchdog, the Quality and Assurance Agency, is on a whole other level. This year, there has been an intensely critical select committee report damning the state of universities and recommending a massive overhaul of how they are monitored. The sector is embarking on a period of soul-searching as a result, reviewing the way universities teach, mark and award degrees. The QAA is at a turning point: under pressure from the universities select committee and Conservative pronouncements on slashing the number of quangos, while coming to the end of its cycle of reviewing universities, which automatically triggers an internal review of its work. All eyes are on McClaran to see whether the radical 1970s student re-emerges and takes universities to task. We meet at the palatial Ucas home, opposite the Cheltenham racecourse, a week after McClaran read a debate on the future of university quangos on these pages. \"There's a description of the QAA in the Guardian today about its 'quiet competence'. That's been a key factor over the last five years: building up trust in what the agency does. The work the QAA does is directed towards the sector itself. \"But at the heart of the QAA mission is the phrase 'public interest'. Over the next few years, one of my immediate tasks is ... how can the agency engage very effectively in making sure other people \u2013 stakeholders who constitute the public interest in a way \u2013 are also hearing what we are doing?\" There are potentially radical changes ahead. This week, a report on quality, commissioned by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (Hefce), by Essex vice-chancellor Colin Riordan, will be published. It is described by Hefce insiders as an \"honest and open\" account of quality and standards across the sector, taking in the role of the QAA, the examining systems, grade inflation and marking. The vice-chancellors' group Universities UK has already launched a review of the external examining system. McClaran reveals that in December, UUK, GuildHE and Hefce will publish a joint consultation on reforming universities to improve quality and the regulation of universities. The QAA has been feeding into the plans. It's part of a concerted move by the sector to address the concerns about quality ahead of the debate about university funding. McClaran says there is now a consensus on the problems in higher education. \"I don't accept there are widespread problems with quality across the board ... But where there are problems they were well described in the QAA's report earlier this year: they looked at the question of contact hours, expectations about contact hours, language requirements, recruitment of overseas students, [the] external examining system.\" But the select committee report concluded that universities were infected by grade inflation, students were under-worked, and it accused vice-chancellors of \"defensive complacency\" and relying on the past for their reputation. It said the QAA needed more teeth, shouldn't rely on universities for funding and should be able to strip them of their degree-awarding powers. Did McClaran agree? \"No,\" McClaran says in a flash. \"Like Peter Mandelson said: it wasn't describing a sector I could recognise. It seemed to be placing a great weight on a narrow evidence base. \"I don't believe the answer to quality assurance in higher education is the setting of standards from the middle. Although I think the select committee report held back directly from describing that system, some of the ways it was suggesting the QAA would act in the future had a much more standardised version of higher education than I think would be healthy.\" Another of the charges levelled at the QAA is that it only looks at the quality of the processes of higher education, not the standards of the degrees awarded. He answers that charge: \"What's overlooked \u2013 and perhaps this is a communications lesson for the QAA and the sector \u2013 is that review is only one part of what the QAA does. A significant amount of what the QAA does is its work in the academic infrastructure, which is exactly about subject benchmarks, programme specifications, qualification framework. What it doesn't do, and where I wouldn't want it to go, is try to impose working in a model of a national curriculum for higher education. That would strike at the heart of what's one of the great strengths of the system, which is that institutions are independent, they are autonomous and they have that fundamental responsibility for what they teach. But they don't do that in a vacuum.\" He doesn't believe that the QAA needs drastic reform, but says any good organisation is in a state of constant self-evaluation and renewal. There are two key areas where he candidly reveals plans for reforms, anticipating even the outcome of the sector-led review. First, students will be much more involved. In the next round of university reviews, students will be invited to sit on the panels that rate the work of their institution. The other is about improving the communication of the QAA's work \u2013 including ensuring that it is \"usable\" by students considering which university to go to. He wants to improve the profile of the QAA and to encourage whistle-blowing from people within universities about dodgy practices, but also to advise them of the appropriate paths to go down with complaints. \"I think the dialogue with the public is an absolutely key part of what will be happening over the next few years. The QAA already publishes a huge amount on its website, but how we can communicate effectively with the public, both to show the good stuff that is there but also to address areas of concern, is going to be one of the really important tasks.\" It will also be important to make the QAA's case closer to a general election in which all the parties are looking to cut costs and some explicitly to cut quangos. Is he nervous that a Conservative government would come in and scrap the QAA? He gives the standard answer: \"I'm not nervous. But I'm not complacent.\" McClaran spent last weekend moving his second daughter to university in London. He had the strange experience of helping her to fill in her Ucas forms \u2013 she in turn received official Ucas letters from her own dad. You can tell he's relishing his children's university education. His own decision to go into administration rather than academia was a wrench, but his heart is clearly in universities. \"It would take a great deal to tempt me away from higher education. I do find it an incredibly satisfying place in which to work and it's been an area which has just expanded so much even in the time I've been working in it.\" Colleagues talk of McClaran being thorough, efficient, driven by detail and absolutely committed to the community he serves. \"A real gentleman,\" says one. He is a university man, but that brings up the fundamental conflict of the QAA: is it a friend of universities, or their watchdog? McClaran insists it can be both and that he will stand up to universities. \"The independence of the QAA is absolutely critical. It's in universities' interest. The reputation of British higher education is best served by there being seen to be an independent agency for quality.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
