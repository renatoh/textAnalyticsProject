In the course of his job he watches avidly, using the professional judgment that he gained in the course of a first-class and international career. But he also talks: to players, coaches, umpires, former players, the media and anyone who can add value to his brief to identify those who are best qualified to succeed for England. A conversation with him is rarely one sided, but, when pushed on specific issues, he is a picker of brains rather than an imparter of information. The England management once leaked like a sieve but it is pretty much watertight now. In the course of a chat with him during the Lions game against Australia at Worcester earlier in the month, I got round to the subject of Ian Bell, who was leading the Lions rather than playing for England against Warwickshire or indeed Warwickshire against England. It did not require too great an intellect to surmise this selection nor the reason why they wished to put him under the particular scrutiny of batting against his nemesis Australians rather than the cosiness of his England chums. Equally obvious that, albeit reluctantly at that stage, he was regarded as the next batsman in line, something borne out by his position in the squad for the first Test. So Miller and I talked around other prospects such as Stephen Moore or Joe Denly, who had both scored good runs at the start of that match. \"OK Dusty, suppose you want to play six batsmen, and someone has bust a finger. Who is next?\" \"I'm not telling you that, am I?\" There are two implications to be drawn from this. First, he hasn't got the faintest idea. Second, he knows absolutely who it is and has done for some time. I know which is the likeliest for this management has succession planning in the forefront and does not try to wing things. And tomorrow morning, when the squad for the third Test is announced, with, for the first time in 55 matches no Kevin Pietersen, that person may be unmasked. Do not be looking in the direction of left field, although this was not always the case and by no means to England's disadvantage. In 1975, when England were looking for someone to stand up to Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson, Tony Greig spent considerable time canvassing views. By chance, on a day off, I happened to have turned up at Northampton and spent the afternoon sitting in the Sussex dressing room. Who, Greig asked me, would you have? I pointed to the grey-haired fellow on the field \u2013 David Steele. \"That,\" said Greig, \"is what everyone is saying.\" We know what happened when, a week later, the bank clerk went to war. It is an unfortunate aspect of the job I do that the amount of international cricket, and the peripheral stuff that goes with it, precludes watching county cricket beyond the smallest extent. So it is hard to make value judgments on players beyond their statistics. I had watched Denly and Moore bat in that match and thought, despite Moore's century, it was Denly who looked the more accomplished prospect (Moore by the way ought to have been given lbw first ball to Brett Lee, as indeed Bell unfortunately was, which tells a great deal about good fortune playing some part in the game). But I have seen enough of Bell to know his progress has been blighted not by technical failings but by lapses in concentration. Find a way round that and there is a wonderful player: hypnosis? I know, too, that Owais Shah has masses of ability but, not chosen when he should have been in Sri Lanka, he was a bag of nerves when, finally, he was given a brief run, strangling his bat handle and his hands and forearms into cramped submission. I've seen Rob Key play really well for England, including a couple of times in Australia (although having done the hard work he dipped out in Perth to the nondescript bowling of Damien Martyn), but always with a hint of the bat coming across his body. Ask any county player and they would be hard pushed to say that Mark Ramprakash was not, by a distance, the most technically accomplished county batsman of the past two decades (who averages 42.4 against Australia, a figure that would have been significantly higher if there had been a lower order that could bat more than their eyelids). I know little of Jonathan Trott's technique or temperament or that of Michael Carberry. Come on Dusty, who is the next cab off the rank after Belly? \"Not telling.\" So it's guesswork. I don't think a crucial Ashes Test is the place for blooding a debutant. It is possible England will want to go to Edgbaston with an extra batsman, although highly unlikely given the state of Andrew Flintoff's knee. So an extra batsman will be there strictly as cover. Key, I'm told, had a bit of a blue with the management during the World Twenty20, which did not endear him. Ramps? No chance. I think it might be Shah.
