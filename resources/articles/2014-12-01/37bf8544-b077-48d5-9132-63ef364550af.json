Summer Robertson, 21, from Shrewsbury and Alice Barnett, 19, from Tring in Hertfordshire, died on Thursday after being overpowered by strong currents during an evening swim with three other British volunteers. They had spent the previous 10 weeks volunteering for a charity at a remote camping resort in the Woody Cape area of Port Elizabeth. Alice\u2019s father Pete Gallagher paid tribute to his daughter on Twitter, saying there were \u201cno words to say how devastated we are to have lost our beautiful angel Alice.\u201d Stephen Box, the headmaster of the Sir Henry Floyd Grammar School in Aylesbury, Buckinghamshire, where Alice was a pupil, said she was a generous and selfless young woman. \u201cOur whole school community has been hurting since we heard the devastating news that Alice lost her life whilst serving others overseas,\u201d he said. \u201cShe had just finished working on a project in a township in South Africa - teaching special needs children and helping to educate young people about drugs, alcohol and Aids. This followed a spell working in a school in Cambodia. Some teachers have said that if they were allowed to have a favourite student then their choice would have been Alice. Her family are in the thoughts and prayers of all of us.\u201d She had written of her excitement about the trip, which was part of the International Citizen Service development programme, on a charity fundraising page before she set off. \u201cI have learned so much about global development and international issues and cannot wait to contribute in any way I can\u201d, she said. Friends of the pair also paid tributes. Beth Hemmings wrote on Twitter: \u201cMy heart goes out to Summer Robertson\u2019s family. Really hits home how valuable life is when something so tragic happens to someone you knew.\u201d It is thought Summer had been working for Jaguar Landrover before travelling to South Africa, and had previously been a sales assistant for retailer Dunelm. South African authorities said that search and rescue volunteers were alerted to cries for help coming from the beach at around 8pm last Thursday. They were able to save three Britons, but Summer Robertson\u2019s body was pulled from the water and Barnett\u2019s washed up on the shore a day later. The Foreign Office has confirmed the death of two British nationals and that they are providing consular assistance to their families."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
