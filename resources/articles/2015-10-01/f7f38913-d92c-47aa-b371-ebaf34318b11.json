Sky is thought to have paid significantly more than the current multimillion pound deal with Sanzar, the umbrella body representing New Zealand, Australia and South African rugby, to block rival BT Sport from breaking into international rugby. The deal, which runs until 2020, includes southern hemisphere tours by Ireland, Scotland and Wales. England will have a three-test series next year with Australia, whose defeat made them the first hosts to go out of the World Cup in the group stages, as well as South Africa in 2018 and a probable tour to New Zealand in 2020. The 150-fixture-a-year deal including the Rugby Championship, the annual tournament between New Zealand, Australia, South Africa and Argentina, as well as the domestic rugby competitions including Super Rugby, ITM Cup, the Currie Cup and the National Rugby Championship. \u201cThis deal offers our viewers more mouthwatering fixtures from the world\u2019s best teams that have been entertaining fans throughout the Rugby World Cup,\u201d said Barney Francis, managing director of Sky Sports. \u201cAs well as the Rugby Championship, we also have the next two England summer tours, fascinating home nations fixtures and of course, more of the All Blacks, Wallabies, Springboks and Argentina than anywhere else.\u201d Sky\u2019s move blocks any further incursion into rugby by BT Sport, which outbid Sky for the TV rights to England Premiership Rugby. BT also has the rights to the best matches from the new European Champions Cup, formerly known as the Heineken Cup. \u201cSanzar is delighted to be renewing its broadcasting deal with Sky Sports that has been our valued partner for the past 20 years since the inception of professional rugby in 1996,\u201d said Mark Alexander, chairman of Sanzar. \u201cWe have a very strong fan base in the United Kingdom and Ireland and it is important for us that they can see as much Sanzar content as possible. Sky Sports delivers this for us.\u201d Sky still holds onto the rights for England\u2019s autumn internationals, the probable next major rugby rights battleground. In July, the BBC and ITV joined forces to stop Sky winning the broadcast rights to the Six Nations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
