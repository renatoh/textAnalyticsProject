Just one person has written to tell us about such a holiday. These companies are rare. Mary Kewney, from north London, says she has experienced the school holiday rip-off factor both as a parent and as a teacher locked into high-rate dates. But now she has grown-up children and owns property in Andalucia, she is looking at this from the other side. To make prices fairer, she has narrowed the gap between the old high-season and mid-season rates. 'This means our old high-season rents have been reduced, but to earn the amount we need, the mid-season rents have had to go up slightly.' Kewney says she can do nothing about the cost of flights. But as many people know, the earlier you book with the low-cost airlines such as EasyJet, with its service to Malaga, the cheaper the flight. So you could still get an August holiday at her apartments at a reasonable cost. Las dos Hermanas is an old farmhouse in the village of Tijola, split into two apartments that share a plunge pool and garden, about 10 minutes by car from Orgiva. One flat, sleeping six, goes for between \u00a3260 and \u00a3340 a week, and the other from between \u00a3210 and \u00a3290 a week. Contact: Alpujarra Holidays (020 8809 0492). \u00b7 Many thanks to Mr and Mrs De Prose, who sign their letter, 'one dissatisfied retired couple'. They complain of companies not only severely hiking rates in the school holidays but in the weeks on either side of them. 'With all the holidays children get, it takes a lot of sorting out to fit weeks in at a reasonable price,' write the couple. Haven of the stars who don't need to shine If you thought celebs who want real privacy go to the Indian Ocean rather than the more obvious Caribbean these days, think again. While stars whose careers need boosting (think Delia and Cilla) still spend Christmas in Barbados - Paparazzi Central - those really wanting to keep out of the limelight head for the lesser-known Caribbean island of Anguilla. Madonna, John Malkovich, Janet Jackson, Charlie Sheen and Denise Richards, Meg Ryan, Drew Barry more, Sharon Stone, Naomi Campbell, Michael J. Fox, J-Lo, Mariah Carey and P. Diddy have all been spotted on the island. It's got two fantastic hotels, Cap Juluca and Malliouhana, as well as luxurious villas which fetch up to \u00a360,000 a week. No wonder Kate Winslet and Sam Mendes chose it for their secret wedding last year. British travel journalists visiting Malliouhana recently were disappointed to miss Rod Stewart and Penny Lancaster at the hotel. The night he ate in its restaurant, the management suggested the hacks went out for supper. It wasn't until they returned that they found out that the suggestion had been made to preserve Stewart's privacy. Compare that with Michael Winner's behaviour in Barbados. When I visited the Lone Star Hotel's restaurant there, the manager told me Winner always asked to be seated facing the stairs. This meant he could see everyone coming in and they could see him."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
