In Barrowland Ballet's A Conversation With Carmel (St George's West, 19-28 Aug), Natasha Gilmore sets her study of fraught family dynamics within the drama of the birthday party of 80-year-old Carmel. Among this work's multi-generational cast are the wonderful Diana Payne-Myers as Carmel, Matthew Hawkins as her awkward son and Natasha Gilmore's own baby playing the youngest grandson. State Of Flux addresses not the unlocking of the past but the losing of it in Forgetting Natasha (Zoo Southside, Sat to 27 Aug), a work using dance, poetry and digital images to create a portrait of an elderly woman already forgetting who she is and what she's been. Divided between three solo performers, words and movement embody Natasha at different phases of her life. Visit www.edfringe.com Guangdong: Swan Lake, London Resistance is pretty much futile as the Guangdong Acrobatic Troupe Of China brings its preposterously entertaining version of Swan Lake back to the UK. Little of Petipa and Ivanov's vision might remain in this production, but you still can't take your eyes off the stage. As Siegfried follows his quest for Odette he encounters jugglers, stilt-walkers, contortionists and lovers who dance on unicycles. Circus tricks performed in exact time to Tchaikovsky's music are treat enough, but more mind-boggling still are the acrobatic extremes to which the ballet vocabulary is pushed, including the section (now immortalised on YouTube) in which Odette dances en pointe, while balanced on Siegfried's head. London Coliseum, WC2, Tue to 14 Aug Mariinsky Ballet: Anna Karenina/La Bayad\u00e8re, London Two epic love stories and two tragic heroines dominate the final week of the Mariinsky's London season. Anna Karenina (Tue &amp; Wed) has inspired ballets by several choreographers, most recently Alexei Ratmansky who created this version for Royal Danish Ballet. Using Rodion Shchedrin's dramatic, dissonant score, Ratmansky distils into two acts the essence of Tolstoy's novel, as Anna is torn between her child and loveless marriage, and her passion for Count Vronsky. Diana Vishneva and Uliana Lopatkina alternate in the title role. Nikiya, the temple dancer heroine of Petipa's La Bayad\u00e8re (Thu to 13 Aug), pits her passion for the warrior Solor against the implacable powers of religion and royalty. The story is 19th-century Russian ballet at its most spectacularly kitsch but the classicism of Petipa's choreography remains its unsullied, exquisite heart. Victoria Tereshkina and Alina Somova join Vishneva and Lopatkina in the casting of Nikiya. Also watch out for Vladimir Shklyarov as Solor.
