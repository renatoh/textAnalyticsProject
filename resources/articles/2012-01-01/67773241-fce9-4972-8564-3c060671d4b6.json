Rooney, along with Jonny Evans and Darron Gibson, were brought in to do an extra day's training then left out of the United squad to face Blackburn after reportedly going out for a meal together with their respective partners in Manchester on Boxing Day, the evening of their 5-0 win against Wigan. There is no suggestion that any of the players misbehaved, stayed out too late or consumed too much alcohol, but Ferguson is understood to have found them in breach of club rules and disciplined them accordingly with Rooney being fined a weeks wages of around \u00a3200,000. The forward was at the Blackburn game and watched from the stands in a club tracksuit, seemingly confirming that while unhappy about his treatment he is not yet at loggerheads with the management. He has not expressed any views on the subject via Twitter and friends suggest he is willing to accept Ferguson's punishment and move on rather than provoke another stand-off similar to the one that saw him threatening to leave the club at the start of last season. His value to the club was amply demonstrated by United's limp performance when going down 3-2 at home to a team who were bottom of the table at the start of the match and Ferguson's judgment was also called into the question on the day the manager not only turned 70 but also said he would like to stay on for at least another three years. After the Blackburn defeat Ferguson cited a shortage of centre-backs and a lack of experience in midfield as contributing factors without acknowledging that it was his own decision to make some players unavailable. It may be the case that Ferguson wants another three years on his own terms and wished to send out a strong signal that he is still in charge, though he may now be accused of either underestimating Blackburn or overreacting to a fairly innocent night out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
