It might be something to do with the heat of the departure lounge, but one piece of baggage can suddenly metamorphose into one large handbag, a washbag, a child's stuffed toy, a plastic bag full of duty-free and your official piece of hand luggage containing your books and forgotten shoes. Those days are gone, and with good reason, since 11 September. It's one piece of hand luggage for everyone from now on, so it's time to kit yourself out with something smart and roomy. The Samsonite Boardcase from its Spark range is made of tough polyester so it should face the challenge of your duty-free while its zip pockets will keep your bits and pieces organised. There's a sturdy handle so you can sashay through the departure lounge swinging it from your hand as well as a shoulder strap in case it gets heavy. Like all Samsonite luggage, it comes with its own lock. You might not get away with quite as much rubbish as previously, but you'll certainly look better. \u00b7 Available in four colours, priced \u00a357.
