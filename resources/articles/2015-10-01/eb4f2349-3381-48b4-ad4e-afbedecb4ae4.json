Lancaster, who was last year handed a contract through to 2020 along with the rest of the coaching team by the Rugby Football Union, said it was hard to think of many clashes in any sport with higher stakes. After confirming Jonathan Joseph had recovered from a chest injury to replace Sam Burgess at centre and Owen Farrell would continue at fly-half, Lancaster admitted that failing to emerge from the \u201cpool of death\u201d had preyed on his mind since the draw was made. \u201cI understand the consequences, I understand where the accountability and responsibility lies and it is with me,\u201d said Lancaster, who called for the country to get behind England following their debilitating defeat by Wales. But he said he had not held discussions with the RFU\u2019s chief executive, Ian Ritchie, about what may happen if England were to exit at the pool stage. \u201cWe\u2019re obviously aware what is at stake \u2013 you don\u2019t have to be a rocket scientist to work it out. There\u2019s not been any further conversation about the ramifications of defeat or victory. He knows and I know that all we\u2019ve got to do is focus on Saturday,\u201d said Lancaster, who praised the \u201cfantastic support\u201d he had received from the RFU boardroom. \u201cIf the head coach starts thinking too much about what might happen in the future \u2013 or the past \u2013 then I can\u2019t get the players in the right place and that\u2019s the only thing that\u2019s important to me.\u201d Lancaster said he planned to invoke the spirit of December 2012, when his England side lost to South Africa but bounced back to stun New Zealand 38-21 at Twickenham. \u201cThis is the biggest game of my career. If we don\u2019t win, we don\u2019t qualify for the next stage. But I have to make sure the players are not focusing on the size of the game,\u201d he said. \u201cThe overriding message at the start of the week was to get up and get on with it after a hugely disappointing defeat. We can\u2019t wallow in it feeling sorry for ourselves.\u201d Both the England coach and his captain, Chris Robshaw, vowed to use criticism from outside the camp from former players and coaches as fuel to overcome Australia. \u201cAs an international captain I\u2019ve learned in the past you take the rough with the smooth. There\u2019s good times, there\u2019s bad times and you need to learn how to deal with it,\u201d said Robshaw. \u201cYou need to know what\u2019s happening, absorb it and use it, I think. That\u2019s the best way. You want to go out and prove a couple of people wrong.\u201d Asked about the avalanche of criticism directed at Robshaw for opting against kicking for goal in the dying seconds against Wales, Lancaster insisted it would provide extra motivation. \u201cIn the camp he has been supported by everyone. We can\u2019t control what people say outside the camp and everyone is 100% entitled to their opinion but what we can control is the way we behave, the way we react, deal with the situation and use it as a motivator to prove people wrong,\u201d said the coach. As the rhetoric ramped up before Saturday\u2019s match, England were also keen to emphasise why they believed the loosehead prop Joe Marler was not guilty of the scrum infringements that have been inferred by the Australian camp. Despite the RFU holding a briefing to illustrate its point, Lancaster said he had faith in the French referee Romain Poite to not be swayed by pre-match positioning. \u201cI have to trust, and I do trust, Romain Poite 100%. He\u2019s refereed us in big games before, he\u2019s an outstanding referee and he will not be fazed one bit by the debate going on,\u201d said Lancaster. Joseph, who will return at centre, said he had been desperate to regain fitness and insisted he was fully ready to face Australia. \u201cI want to play this game \u2013 it\u2019s do or die; it\u2019s massive \u2013 so I was really keen to get back for it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
