That\u2019s always meant champagne, but does it have to? Everyone has their own family traditions, so absolutely not, but a bottle of champers undoubtedly marks the celebratory nature of the day, and the truth is that, when it\u2019s on special offer (and I can\u2019t emphasise that strongly enough), it\u2019s better value than a lot of comparable sparkling wines. You do need to be vigilant on price, however, particularly with big household names. At time of writing, a bottle of Bollinger Special Cuv\u00e9e, for example, costs between \u00a333.50 and \u00a355, and chances are that if a shop has one big brand on special offer, another will be fully (read: over-) priced. You\u2019d be mad, say, to buy one bottle from Majestic and miss out on its mix-six deal (which doesn\u2019t, of course, have to be all champagne). And if you buy Olivier Baudin Brut (12%), it\u2019s only \u00a314.99 right now, instead of the usual \u00a329.99, so you\u2019ll be doing yourself a disservice if you walk out with a single bottle. Aldi goes one better, offering its very decent Veuve Monsigny Champagne Brut for just \u00a312.49, and you don\u2019t have to buy a case to get it at that price. Yet there is sometimes something to be said for buying a household name, especially if it\u2019s as a gift. It may be spendy, but I find it hard to resist the idea of the Veuve Clicquot Personalised City Arrow edition (\u00a359, London, Birmingham and Manchester branches of Selfridges and selfridges.com), which shows exactly how far the recipient is from Reims in France. And what about vintage v non-vintage champagne? As you probably know, non-vintage refers to a champagne that has been blended from wines from different harvests, though that is not of itself an indicator of quality. Vintage champagne comes from a single, better (the Champenois would say exceptional) harvest. Is it better for you, though? Depends what you want it for. If you\u2019re drinking it as an aperitif and want a lighter style, I\u2019d say probably not, but if it\u2019s to go with something rich such as a fish pie or even the turkey, it may well be. Tesco has two award-winning bottles in its own-label range: \u00a320 for Finest Premier Cru Champagne (12.5%) and \u00a326 for Finest Vintage Grand Cru Champagne Blanc de Blancs 2012 (12.5%), though if you want a really lush blanc de blancs \u2013 that is, a champagne made only from white grapes, usually chardonnay \u2013 Berry Bros &amp; Rudd\u2019s Blanc de Blancs champagne by Le Mesnil Grand Cru (\u00a333) takes it to another level entirely. So what\u2019s the best alternative to champagne? For most of us these days, it\u2019s English sparkling wine, which is generally made out of the same grape varieties and in a similar style to champagne \u2013 and, it has to be said, very much at the same price point. One that bucks the trend is the impressive new Ellercombe English Sparkling (\u00a324, Sainsbury\u2019s, 12%), which is \u00a318 on the current 25%-off-six-bottles deal. I also like the toasted brioche flavours of the smart-looking Hattingley Valley Reserve (\u00a329 Tesco, and at \u00a330 from Great Western Wine in Bath, 12%). And if you want to splash out, the elegant Rathfinny Wine Estate Ros\u00e9 (\u00a333.95, Lea &amp; Sandeman) would be delicious with the smoked salmon. And what about the new world \u2013 what does it have to offer? In general, riper fruit and more tropical fruit flavours, which may appeal if champagne\u2019s too austere for you. (Yes, I know there\u2019s always prosecco \u2013 you\u2019ll find a couple among my wine matches to all this week\u2019s recipes \u2013 but it doesn\u2019t have quite the special-occasion vibe of champagne.) Australia, New Zealand and California all have really good home-grown examples, but I especially like Aristea M\u00e9thode Cap Classique Blanc 2015, from South Africa (\u00a324, privatecellar.co.uk, 12%), which you can also buy in magnum (for \u00a355.40). Finally, if you want something nice for non-drinkers, try Wild Life Botanicals Nude (\u00a387 for a six-bottle case from wildlifebotanicals.co.uk. Champagne it ain\u2019t, but it\u2019s deliciously fruity and handsomely bottled. You may even find yourself sneaking a glass."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
