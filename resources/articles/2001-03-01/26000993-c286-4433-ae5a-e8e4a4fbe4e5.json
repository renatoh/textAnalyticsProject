The Mirror's Paul Routledge is a typical sneerer when ranting in this week's issue of the House, the Commons magazine. He scorns \"Miss Jobsworth (Southeast)\" who asks the prime minister patsy questions from the floor: \"If the Blair Babe manages to stagger to the end of the sentence which the whips have thrust in her hands it's a minor miracle.\" Infuriated by this constant slur, Fiona Mactaggart MP, did a survey and found no evidence that women ask more patsy questions than men. But in that beligerent chamber on Wednesday afternoons the sketch writers snooze through the plentiful men's sycophantic and inept questions, waking to sharpen their pens only for the bright jackets of the women. Women are funny. At the end of four years, have the women occupying 25% of the Labour benches made a difference? Two new academic studies tell the story. One says: \"In contrast to the view that new Labour women MPs have failed women, women MPs have made a considerable difference, acting for women within and beyond parliament.\" The other analyses their voting record, and its findings will please the mocking press gallery. First the bald facts. Paul Cowley of Hull University studying the figures finds that women MPs of the '97 intake were indeed obedient. At first they were seven times less likely to rebel than male MPs of the same intake. As time went on they got a bit braver, but were still twice as unlikely to rebel as the men. Does that make them craven lobby-fodder and a general waste of bench-space? That depends on what you think MPs are for. Is rebellion against your own party the emblem of backbench effectiveness? \"Voting against your own party is one way to claim political virility and independence, but it doesn't get results,\" Fiona Mactaggart wrote in her Fabian pamphlet. (Rebellion is always rare: most MPs would fail if rebellion was the test). All the same, the women MPs behave differently. Why? At 18%, they never formed a critical mass in the House of Commons, oddities still not the norm. Most complain bitterly of the thundering maleness of the place and its traditions. The chamber is the part of the job most of them like least - the grand-standing, strutting, bellowing. They are less likely to judge their own effectiveness in terms of their theatrical performance. Confrontation seems to them an unproductive avenue to changing policy. Women in parliaments around the world tend to follow the same pattern of voting loyalty. They do politics differently - and perhaps better. Dr Sarah Childs, of Middlesex University in an academic study out shortly in Parliamentary Affairs, probes beyond the bare voting statistics. She interviewed new women MPs shortly after their arrival in Westminster in 1997 and again four years later, and assesses what effect their arrival has had on politics. Did they make a difference? She thinks they did. Only look at the budget to find their handiwork. Maternity pay, child care, part-time workers' rights, lone parents' new deal and a score of other recent measures did far more for women than for men. Ask women MPs and most will say: \"We did that.\" Do you imagine, they ask, that Gordon Brown had babies on his mind when he came to power? Poverty, yes, in the abstract, but without understanding that means women. Where are the manifesto commitments to most of the things that he has spent his money on? It was ex- single mother paymaster general Dawn Primarolo - in a key but silent, back-room post - who required the Treasury to calculate the gender effect of all its actions. (The last budget delivered an average \u00a3440 for women and \u00a3225 for men compared to 1997.) Women were not a central pitch back in 1997, but an afterthought and a disastrous afternoon's photo shoot with the prime minister. Remember how Tony Blair forgot to appoint a women's minister at all, calling Harriet Harman back in a hurry to add it to her brief? Dr Childs notes the changed self-confidence in the MPs since she first interviewed them. Most talk bitterly of their first blooding over the lone parent cuts Brown pushed through. Some say it was their angry loyalty that gained cast-iron assurances that poor women and children would get the money back many-fold as recompense. They list how they exerted power behind the scenes, lobbying, arguing, writing reports, bending ministers' ears. The higher proportion of women ministers made a difference. (Women hold a third of ministerial posts.) The chancellor never meant to include lone parents in the new deal and it took long argument from Harriet Harman to persuade him child care was critical to poor mothers. Campaigning behind the scenes for maternity and parental rights was all done by women. Dr Childs's report suggests that in constituencies, both women and men with problems find a woman MP more approachable. Their presence has significantly shifted agendas of the select committees. The women claim they often work harder to get policy right in the first place: rebels often scarcely notice an offending policy until it reaches the Commons. So did performers of the Bob Marshall Andrews or Dennis Skin ner variety of MP get more done? They may add to the gaiety of the nation, but where is the beef? Women MPs are, of course, not a homogeneous group. These 101 women, only a half of whom call themselves feminists, include regular rebels such as Anne Cryer, and two cabinet ministers who have done everything to prevent changing the archaic and outrageous House of Commons hours and customs - Margaret Beckett and Ann Taylor. Betty Boothroyd was no sister, nor are many of the others who spit at being lumped together. And yet overall, there remains a generality of women who have a mission to press women's issues in a male legislature. Downing Street (mostly men) has not fully understood the message of the women's political success. Nearly 2m more women than men will vote at the election and yet they are the ones who are most disaffected with Labour. Fawcett Society/Mori research shows women like women MPs better, and remember them more. In elections parties remember this, then they forget again. If Labour has made too little impact with its remarkable tranche of women's policies, that is because they have been presented mainly by the men in the top jobs. It is shocking that only three out 30 Labour held seats have selected women candidates this time - as if the Blair Babes jibe had a lethal effect on local parties. Will the remaining seats all go to women or ethnic candidates in any last-minute selections? Dr Childs's research reveals women MPs who are not obedient, but effective - unless you think noise and notoriety is what counts most. polly.toynbee@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
