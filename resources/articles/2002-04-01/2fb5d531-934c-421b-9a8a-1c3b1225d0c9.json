And Edward Hall's elegant revival of Maugham's acidulous 1926 comedy reminds us that just because plays are set in expensive drawing rooms does not mean they are devoid of content. Two particular ideas animate the action: that you cannot have sexual liberty without economic freedom and that society operates double standards over male and female infidelity. To that end Maugham shows the resourceful Constance Middleton publicly acknowledging what she has long privately known: that her surgeon-husband has been having an affair with her best friend, Marie-Louise. But her revenge is twofold: by taking a job as an interior decorator she is able to gain her economic independence and by going off to Italy with a devoted admirer she exposes the hypocrisy that adultery is a male prerogative. You could argue that no one today would challenge Maugham's arguments. But what he still manages to convey is the shock value of Constance's independence in its social context. Her husband is a pompous prig, her mother an apologist for male deception and her sister a vindictive voyeur. Thus when Constance calmly defines a modern wife as \"a prostitute who doesn't deliver the goods\" it comes as a resounding slap in the face. And, when her husband beseechingly asks if he cannot also be her lover, her announcement that \"no one can make yesterday's cold mutton into tomorrow's lamb cutlets\" packs an emotional punch. Maugham is always dubbed a cynic. He strikes me instead as a realist who understands that society is a house of cards sustained by hypocrisy and capable of being toppled by sincerity and logic. But Maugham was also a skilled craftsman who knew how to play with the conventions of drawing room drama. Hall's production also has a sufficently secure sense of period to incorporate dated slang like \"you're a brick\" without condescension. And, on the whole, it is very well performed. Jenny Seagrove is a model of cool precision as the heroine who announces, \"I may be unfaithful but I am constant.\" And there is exemplary support from Serena Evans as her dessicated and secretly envious sister, Steven Pacey as her blustering husband who is angry in pinstripes and from Simon Williams as her admirer torn between passion and the gentleman code. Only the wearisome affectations of Sara Crowe as Marie-Louise strike a false note. But the play as a whole is a testament to Maugham's enduring skill as a subversive boulevard entertainer. \u00b7 Until June 29.
