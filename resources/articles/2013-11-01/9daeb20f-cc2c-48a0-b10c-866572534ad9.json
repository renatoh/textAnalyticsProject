At a press conference shortly after he told reporters he had smoked crack as recently as a year ago, Ford apologised to the people of Toronto for embarrassing them. \"With today's announcement, I know I have embarrassed everyone in this city, and I will be forever sorry,\" Ford said at a press conference. \"There's only one person to blame for this and that is myself.\" Allegations over his drug use have swirled around Ford for months amid reports of a video that allegedly showed him smoking crack. He had previously denied such a video existed, but last week, Toronto police said they had recovered a recording which appeared to show him puffing on a crack pipe. Appearing in front of reporters who had been waiting outside his office for two hours following his earlier admission over his cocaine use, Ford gave a short speech in which he apologised several times. He said admitting what he described as \"my mistake\" was the most difficult and embarrassing thing he has ever done, but that doing it gave him a huge sense of relief. He appealed to the people of Toronto and his colleagues to forgive him, telling them he would never do it again. But there was little recognition for what effect his continuing as mayor may have on the people of Toronto. Neither was there any reference to calls from his colleagues in the council and beyond for him to step aside in order to get help. Ford said: \"I know admitting my mistake was the right thing to do, and I feel like a 1,000lb weight have been lifted from my shoulders. I can't explain how difficult this was to do. I hope that nobody but nobody would have to go through what I have gone through. I know what I did was wrong, and admitting it was the most difficult and embarrassing thing I've ever had to do. \"Folks, I've nothing left to hide.\" Ford was bullish in the face of calls for his resignation, appealing directly to the voters. \"I know I have to regain your trust and your confidence. I love my job and I love saving taxpayers money \u2013 and I love being your mayor.\" He told them: \"I was elected to do a job, and that's exactly what I'm going to continue doing.\" He said that in October 2014, the city's next election date, \"I want the people of Toronto to decide whether they want Rob Ford to be their mayor.' Leading figures, including Canada's federal justice minister, Peter McKay, have called on Ford to get help following his admission over his drug use, and councillors have asked he take leave of absence. But councillors are powerless to fire a sitting mayor. In the hours before the press conference, they explored ways for the council to assert control. At least two motions were put forward on Tuesday, including one that would remove his powers to hire and fire members of the council. Such a motion would give councillors in positions of power the freedom to oppose Ford. Councillor John Filion of Willowdale and Councillor Paul Ainslie of Scarborough have proposed a motion to amend procedural bylaws in order to remove Ford's powers to hire and fire members of his executive committee. Filion told reporters he was proposing a motion that he hoped would \"isolate the chaos\". Changing the procedural bylaw requires the support of two-thirds of the city council. Councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong, who has been one of Ford's most loyal allies and a member of his executive committee, said he should apologise to the people of Toronto. Moments after Ford made the bombshell admission, Minnan-Wong said: \"I think he's lost the moral authority to lead. We're in uncharted territory.\" Minnan-Wong said he will bring a motion to the next city council meeting asking Ford to take a leave of absence. \"It is very disappointing to have the mayor of the City of Toronto admit to smoking crack cocaine,\" he told reporters. \"I was disappointed at two levels: firstly that he did it, but secondly that it took him so long to admit it.\" The motion reads: \"The evidence presented to date suggests the mayor has a substance abuse problem. The mayor consorts with known criminals and/or individuals involved in the sale and distribution of drugs. The mayor misled the residents of Toronto.\" Ford told reporters: \"I kept this from my family \u2013 especially from my brother, Doug \u2013 [from] my staff, my council colleagues \u2026 because I was embarrassed and ashamed. To the residents of Toronto, I know I've let you down, and I cannot do anything else but apologise.\" His initial admission on Tuesday came during a scrum with reporters. The mayor asked them to repeat questions asked of him in May after Gawker first reported on the existence of the \"crack video\". One said: \"Have you smoked crack cocaine?\" \"Exactly. Yes, I have smoked crack cocaine\" Ford replied. \"But, no, do I? Am I an addict? No. Have I tried it? Um, probably in one of my drunken stupors, probably approximately about a year ago.\" Ford, who has been mayor since 2010, said he did not lie when reporters asked him about a video which allegedly shows him smoking the drug. \"You didn't ask the correct questions,\" Ford said to the reporters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
