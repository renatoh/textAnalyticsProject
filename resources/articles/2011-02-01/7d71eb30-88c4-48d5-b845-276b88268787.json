The news follows the conviction of Rajib Karim, a former British Airways computer specialist, for terrorism offences after being inspired by Awalki to explore ways of staging al-Qaida style attacks. YouTube has been under pressure to remove sermons from Awlaki, who the US say is the \"spiritual leader\" of al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula and is currently holed up in Yemen. His sermons have inspired people in Britain and the US to carry out terrorist attacks, with the internet being Awlaki's main way of spreading his message that violence against the west is justified. Among scores of his videos on YouTube are a 22-part series called \"The constraints [of] Jihad\", a five-part interview with the al-Qaida cleric, one called \"It's a war against Islam\" and even a defence of Awlaki by a commander from al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula. The home office said it was looking into the issue, which was highlighted last year by the security minister, Lady Neville-Jones, who called on the White House to \"take down this hateful material\" when it was hosted on servers within US control. Conservative MP Patrick Mercer, former chair of the counter-terrorism sub-committee, said: \"This is criminally irresponsible, this material continues to inspire jihadists. I'm amazed it is in the public domain so easily. The government must put pressure on YouTube to get this stuff down immediately.\" Awlaki has already inspired at least two Britons to commit to violent jihad. They are Rajib Karim, convicted of terrorism offences, and Roshonara Choudhry, a student from London, jailed last year for trying to murder the Labour MP Stephen Timms after watching Awlaki's sermons online. In his message to Karim, Awlaki said his prime target was the United States, and it is the superpower that has borne the brunt of his attentions. Awlaki is linked to multiple attempted plots against the US, by plane and by car bomb. A YouTube spokesperson said: \"YouTube has community guidelines that prohibit dangerous or illegal activities such as bomb-making, hate speech and incitement to commit violent acts, and we have removed a significant number of videos under these policies. These are difficult issues and material that is brought to our attention is reviewed carefully. We will continue to remove all content that incites violence according to our policies. Material of a purely religious nature will remain on the site.\" Washington officials believe the Islamist cleric is the prime suspect behind the \"ink printer\" bombs which were sent as cargo on planes and timed to explode over the eastern United States. He is also linked to one successful atrocity \u2013 the fatal shootings of 13 soldiers at Fort Hood, Texas by an American Muslim fellow soldier in November 2009. Awlaki, 39, was born in New Mexico to Yemeni parents. He is believed to have lived in London for 18 months before moving to Yemen in 2004, and is now thought to be in hiding in Yemen's rugged Shabwa or Mareb regions, an area jihadists have at times found to be a safe haven. The cleric is thought by US authorities to be connected to the attempted car bombing in Times Square, New York and the Christmas Day attempt to explode a bomb concealed in underwear on a flight over the US as well as inspiring the US army psychiatrist who opened fire at Fort Hood. US officials say he is a \"recruiter and motivator\" for al-Qaida and skilled at using social media, including a Facebook page and YouTube, to spread his message of violent jihad. In contrast to most extremist clerics, he communicates clearly, even referencing pop culture, alluding in one online sermon to the singer Michael Jackson to emphasise his point. Awlaki is the only US citizen known to be on the list of targets for assassination by the CIA because of his links to past attacks against the US. After 9/11, Awlaki was seen as a credible voice against extremism and was once invited to speak at the Pentagon."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
