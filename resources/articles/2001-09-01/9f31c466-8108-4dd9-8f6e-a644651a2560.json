When it was GEC, the defence and electronics giant built by Arnold Weinstock was a cash-rich British business bulwark. But since the more buccaneering Lord Simpson took over as chief executive in 1996, with a plan to remake the newly named company as a telecommunications equipment giant, Marconi has squandered its millions in a vain chase for increasingly elusive hi-tech profits. This week, as the company confirmed it is sliding towards a \u00a35bn loss this year, Lord Simpson baled out in disgrace. Lord Simpson had presided over a reckless and disastrous smash and grab in a highly unstable part of the market, though it is important to stress that it was one that was fully and greedily backed by most in the City. As he left this week, though, the Marconi company was worth a mere 3% of what it was a year ago. The company is now a leaking hulk, whose share price sank another 28% yesterday. This year alone, Marconi has put 10,000 of its labour force out of work. Marconi is poised to become the latest and greatest byword for City collapse, joining Burmah Oil, BCCI, Barings and, most recently, Equitable Life, on the market scrapheap. As Paul Foot pointed out here two days ago, it appears to be a modern maxim that in business nothing succeeds like failure. While Marconi showed another 2,000 of its blameless workers the door this week, the man responsible, Lord Simpson, left with a \u00a31m pay-off for services rendered. We hear a lot from the government about the need for workers to accept new disciplines and for failure in the public sector to be punished. But how long does it remain acceptable to reward boardroom failure in the private sector, especially on such a gross scale? When Tony Blair addresses the TUC next week, this is a subject he cannot avoid."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
