I'll get back to Christmas dinner at a later date, but in answer to the gravy question, here is a tasty recipe - it's my mother's, actually, though I've added the olive oil, tarmari and wine. Another flavoursome addition would be some dried porcini, soaked in stock, then chopped and added to the mix. This gravy is wonderful with veggie bangers and mash, bean burgers, nut roast ... Serves four. 2 onions, finely chopped 1 tbsp olive oil 2 tbsp plain flour 200ml vegetable stock 200ml red wine 2 tbsp tamari (or soy sauce) Salt, pepper and sugar Fry the onions in the oil for 10 minutes until they are tender and lightly browned. Add the flour and stir over the heat for three to four minutes, until nut-brown in colour - the mixture will be very dry. Stir in the stock and wine, then let it simmer over a moderate heat until the sauce has thickened. Add the tamari, then season with salt, pepper and, if you think it needs some sweetness, a touch of sugar. You can serve this gravy just as it is, which is what my mother did, or, if you prefer smooth gravy, strain it through a sieve before serving. And if you want a thinner end-product, just add more stock until it's the consistency you want."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
