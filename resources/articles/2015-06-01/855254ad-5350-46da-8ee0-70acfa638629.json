Mary O\u2019Callaghan, 50, an LAPD veteran, faces three years in state prison for assaulting Alesia Thomas in the back of a patrol vehicle in July 2012. Thomas, 35, lost consciousness and soon after died at hospital. O\u2019Callaghan was not charged in connection with the death. The officer was called to South Broadway Avenue to help colleagues detain Thomas, who had been taken into custody on suspicion of abandoning her children. She was in the back of the patrol car wearing handcuffs and leg restraints when the dashboard camera recorded O\u2019Callaghan kick her in the stomach and groin and punch her in the throat. Thomas, breathing heavily, requested an ambulance. She also said \u201cI can\u2019t\u201d. A few minutes later she passed out. A camera from another patrol car captured O\u2019Callaghan outside the car smoking a cigarette and peering in at the suspect. \u201cThat ain\u2019t a good sign,\u201d she said. There was a gap of 30 minutues between Thomas requesting an ambulance and police summoning one. Prosecutors said they lacked evidence to charge O\u2019Callaghan with involuntary manslaughter. The LA county coroner said cocaine intoxication was likely \u201ca major factor\u201d in Thomas\u2019s death. It was impossible to determine if the struggle played a role, he said. O\u2019Callaghan could receive three years in jail when she returns to court on 23 July, the district attorney\u2019s office said in a statement. \u201cI am pleased that the jury agreed with our assessment of the evidence in this case,\u201d said district attorney Jackie Lacey. \u201cThe verdict proves the criminal justice system works.\u201d The officer\u2019s defence lawyer, Robert Rico, told jurors that the video showed an \u201cugly\u201d scene but that his client\u2019s use of force was \u201creasonable, justified and necessary\u201d since Thomas, who was over 6ft tall and weighed 228 pounds, disobeyed officers\u2019 orders."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
