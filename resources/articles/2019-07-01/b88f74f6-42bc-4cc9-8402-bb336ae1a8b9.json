After an evenly-balanced first half Alain Giresse\u2019s men needed a big stroke of luck to to break the deadlock early in the second, after which the islanders did not look like recovering, though they tried valiantly. A couple of quality goals crowned a happy evening for Tunisia. They will go into the semi-final with fresh confidence. Madagascar will go home as heroes. Tunisia kill the game on the counter after a Malagasay corner. Khazri drew the last defender before slipping in Sliti, who dinked it past Adrien and into the net. 89 min: Amada sends over a freekick from the let as Madagascar seek a consolation goal. But Tunisian defenders aren\u2019t the sentimental type and they bang the ball back down the other end of the pitch. 87 min: Nicolas Dupuis continues to bestride the sideline. He and his team will leave this tournament with their heads held high. They\u2019ve brought joy. Next stop for the manager? Back to Fr\u00e9jus in the French second division. 85 min: Anicet booked for a comping into Khenssi in the centre circle. 82 min: Madagascar are drifting towards the exit, but through no lack of effort or rigour. They\u2019ve been undone by a slice of awful luck and the absence of creative sharpness up front. Tunisia substitution: Aouadhi on, Sassi off Madagascar substitution: Njiva on, Ihlamaharitra off. 80 min: Lovely interplay by Tunisia releases Haddadi. but adrien runs out to confront him, making a good save to prevent the left-back from making it 3-0. 78 min: Mombris goes down after copping Khazri\u2019s elbow in the mush. That\u2019s going to make Madagascar\u2019s defeat all the more painful in the morning. \u201cI do not know to what ends, sinister or not, you want to know President Andry Rajoelina\u2019s twitter account, but it is here https://twitter.com/se_rajoelina,\u201d reveals Kari Tulinius. Don\u2019t worry, I have no intention of being an abusive blowhard on twitter, I just wanted to see if he\u2019s anything like that (other president). Sure enough, he\u2019s not. Tunisia substitution: Drager on, Chaaleli off. 72 min: Tunisia are happy to let Madagascar have the ball around mid-way, confident the islanders won\u2019t find the ingenuity required to infiltrate a generally well-drilled defence. Madagascar need inspiration from somewhere... 69 min: Meriah fails to cut out a long ball forward, and that gives Andrea a chance to run on to it and into the box. Meriah charges back in a self-rescue bid and does enough to put off the attacker, who flings himself to the ground in a desperate bid for a penalty. Not in a million years. 66 min: Up in the VIP box, the Malagasy president, so jubilant at previous matches, looks thoroughly peeved. Anyone know if he uses twitter? Tunisia substitution: Sliti on, Msakni on. The captain, who is a yellow card away from suspension, can start resting up for the semi-final against Senegal. Unless Madagascar can spring their biggest shock yet ... Madagascar substitutions: Morel and Voavy on, Razak and Lalaina off. 63 min: There\u2019s renewed urgency to the way Madagascar are passing now but Tunisia have their measure. They keep them at bay cannily an step in to steal the ball at the first opportunity. Tunisia stream through them again. Adrien parries an 18-yard shot from Khazri but Msanki pounces on the rebound, glides last one defender and places the ball in the bottom corner despite falling as he shoots. Nice goal. The dream is dying for Madagascar. 58 min: Another vicious delivery by Khazri. Lalaina heads it clear for a corner on the far side. In fairness to Madagascar, they have dealt with those well so far, unlike in previous games. They back up that point by heading Khazri\u2019s latest attempt clear, too. 55 min: Madagascar are having more of the ball now and looking keenly for openings, but Tunisia are being real stingy. The islanders have 35 minutes to find a way to make them give up their lead. 53 min: Khazri curls a vicious inswinging freekick from the left. Adrien punches it to safety. Terrible misfortune for Madagascar! A tame shot by Sassi from the edge of the area takes a huge deflection off Fontaine\u2019s backside and spins past the nonplussed keeper. 50 min: A fine crossfield ball finds Mombris on the left. He curls in a lovely delivery. Andriatsima stoops to try to get his head on it but misses, and the ball flies across the face of goal and out of play on the far side. 47 min: GOAL? Tunisia are celebrating after Khazri takes down a long pass and stabs the ball past the keeper. The officials seem set to allow it but eventually decide to consult Var, which reveals, as expected, that Khazri was a couple of yards offside. 46 min: We go again. Tunisia resume their patient building. It\u2019s been tidy, tense and not nearly as open as hoped. Senegal are no closer to knowing who they will face in the semi-final. Something has go to give in the sometime, possibly in the second half, which is coming right up... 45+1 min: A feint and a dart from Msakni and then a dinky shot from 23 yards. But straight at the Adrien. 44 min: Amada tries to replicate his stunning goal against DR Congo but doesn\u2019t catch the ball as sweetly this time. Still, his drive bounces just in front of Hassen and demands a save. 43 min: A 25-yards snapshot from Chalaali forces Adrien to plunges to hist left and tip it around the post! The replay shows it was going just wide but the keeper was taking no chances. 41 min: Kechrida races down the right, injecting speed into a patient buildup. Then he pings a low cross to the near post. Khenissi beats the defender to it and tries to flip it into the net, but finds only the sidenetting. 38 min: Tunisia are having most of the play now, and a lot of it in the Madagascan half. But the underdogs are making it very tough for them to pick a way through. 35 min: Msakni dodges his way between two defenders in the box and then goes down theatrically. Thank fig he doesn\u2019t get a penalty for that. 34 min: M\u00e9tanire hasn\u2019t found his crossing range yet. But his latest overhit effort nearly catches out the keeper, who has to backpedal frantically before realising it\u2019s going to drift over his bar. 33 min: Khazri whips the ball over the wall and towards the top corner ... but Adrien gets both hands on it and pushes it out for a corner. Andriatsima clears that at the near post. 32 min: Dangere here. Raak hauls down Msakni to concede a freekick just outside the D. That\u2019s Khazri territory... 30 min: More top defending, this time by Meriah, who eased Andriatsima off the ball in the Tunisian box before carrying it clear. 29 min: Fontaine rushes over to the left to cut out a ball that Khazri looked like collecting. Top covering by the centreback. 27 min: Nifty fee by Khazri at the edge of the Malagasy box. After dancing past two, however, he is crowded out. Madagascar sure do make teams work hard for room in open play. 25 min: Alain Giresse was a wonderful player, but I\u2019m not seeing what he has brought to this Tunisian team... 22 min: Tunisia usually have most of the possession but Madagascar have passed the ball better than them so far: they are more in tune with each other, and slicker. Not by much, however. 19 min: The ref allows play to continue after Mombirs is chopped down. The ball runs through to Andriatsima, who has a go from an improbable angle 18 yards out. He finds the target but his shot never looked likely to beat the keeper. 17 min: Freekick to Madagascar 30 yards out and central. Tunisia put up a three-man wall, and Fontaine rams it into them. 16 min: M\u00e9tanire bombs down the right but then botches his cross. 14 min: Mskani fizzes a low pass from the let to Sassi, who takes it beautifully at the edge of the area, spinning past his marker with one artful touch and then bending a shot just beyond the far post. 12 min: Tunisia are starting to find their patient passing rhythm. Madagascar are chasing them diligently, hunting for a chance to launch one of their buccaneering counter-attacks. 10 min: Bad defending setpieces has been Madagascar\u2019s one glaring weakness in this tournament so far, but they have just dealt admirably with a dangerous corner from Khazri. 8 min: Khenissi tumbles in the box under a strong challenge by Razak. No foul. 7 min: Madagascar work Mombris into a crossing position down the left. He picks out Lalaina beyond the far post, but Lalaina can\u2019t beat two defenders to get off a shot. Still, that was a nice move: there\u2019s real crispness to Madagascar\u2019s play. 5 min: Andriatsima, willing as always, recovers a lofted pass into the channel and then spins and looks for support. It arrives fast but a bit too eagerly - freekick to Tunisia at the edge of their own area. 3 min: It\u2019s been an encouragingly brisk start, with both teams eager to moved forward with tidiness and speed. For a moment Chalali had a shooting opportunity from 20 yards but he hesitated and that was enough for the ever-dynamic Malgasy to close him down. 1 min: And they\u2019re off! Tunisia, clad all in white, get the game going at a promising pace. So let\u2019s have a recap of the lineups. The first thing to note is that Hassen starts in goal for Tunisia, having been forgiven for the strop he threw after being replaced just before the shootout in the last game, against Ghana. Khazri is also brought back into the starting XI after impressing off the bench in that game. As for Madagascar, they make a single change, Ilaimaharitra returning to the mifield following suspension. Madagascar: Adrien; M\u00e9tanire, Razakanantenaina, Fontaine, Mombris; Amada, Anicet, Nomenjanahary; Andriatsima, Carolus, Lalaina. Tunisia: Hassen; Kechrida, Bronn, Meriah, Haddadi; Chaalali, Skhiri, Sassi; Khazri, Msakni, Khenissi Referee: A Alioum (Cameroon) &amp; Var They will play the Super Eagles of Nigeria. Before that, Madagascar and Tunisia are about to get it on in the last of the quarter-finals. stay tuned! MISS! Serey Die hits the exact same spot of the post as Belaili did - and that spells victory for Algeria! MISS! Belaili kisses the ball and then smacks it against the butt of the post! A reprieve for the Elephants! Algeria 4-3 Ivory Coast GOAL! Gradel rams it into the net Algeria 4-3 Ivory Coast GOAL! Ounas rifles into the bottom corner. Algeria 4-2 Ivory Coast SAVE! Bony\u2019s tame shot is beaten away by Rais Algeria 3-2 Ivory Coast GOAL! Delort nets in style though Gbohouo went the right way. Algeria 3-2 Ivory Coast GOAL! Cornet sidefoots it past the keeper, who went the other way. Algeria 2-2 Ivory Coast GOAL! Slimani sends the keeper the wrong way. Algeria 2-1 Ivory Coast GOAL! Kessie does the business coolly Algeria 1-1 Ivory Coast GOAL! Bensebaini\u2019s shot creeps into the bottom corner via the goalkeper\u2019s hands and a post! Algeria 1-0 Ivory Coast Algeria win the toss and choose to take the first penalty ... ET 120+3: Delort does take the freekick ... and he curls it around the wall and just wide! A fine effort. But we\u2019re headed to a shootout ... ET 120+1 min: Before the freekick can be taken Algeria introduce Delort for Feghouli, presumably just in case this does go to penalties. Or maybe he\u2019s going to take the free? ET 120 min: Comora dives late into a tackle on Ounas, the player who was introduced for Mahrez. The defender gets a booking and Algeria get a freekick right at the edge of the area. Can they win it now and spare themselves a shootout? ET 116 min: Gradel swings in a freekick from the left. Comara leaps high but heads higher, sending the ball over from eight yards. ET 113 min: This is a good spell by Algeria. Some tidy interplay down the left culminates with Bennacer hanging up a useful cross for Zeffane, who nods wide under pressure. ET 111 min: Slimani runs on a delicious cross to power a header towards the far corner, but Gbohuou denies him with a super save! ET 108: Ivory Coast have been the better side in extra-time. Mahrez, since you ask, was withdrawn in the 86th minute. ET 106 min: Cornet has been excellent since his introduction and has just skinned Benlamru down the left before flashing the ball across the face of goal. A defender nearly turned it into his own goal but was relieved to see it squirm past the post for a corner. The teams are in for Madagascar-Tunisia. Behold: Madagascar: Adrien; M\u00e9tanire, Razakanantenaina, Fontaine, Mombris; Amada, Anicet, Nomenjanahary; Andriatsima, Carolus, Lalaina. Tunisia: Hassen; Kechrida, Bronn, Meriah, Haddadi; Chaalali, Skhiri, Sassi; Khazri, Msakni, Khenissi. ET 105 min: An Ivorian corner provokes a kinghell stramash in the Algerian box, and Zeffane clears off the line! There was also what looked like a handball by Feghouli but Var is not being consulted. So Algeria make it to half-time in extra-time on level terms. ET 102 min: Bennacer curls a freekick beyond the far post and there\u2019s Slimani, racing on to it at speed. But from a difficult angle he can\u2019t direct his first-time shot on target. ET 100 min: Slimani is putting himself about up front for Algeria but they haven\u2019t been able to provide him with a clear chance yet. ET 7 min: The Ivorian subs almost make the desired impact, as Bony and Cornet combine before Guedioura flings himself in front of the latter\u2019s shot to save Algeria! Var checks to see whether it hit his hand but it didn\u2019t. From the resultant corner, Cornet goes close again, chipping just over from the edge of the area. ET 5 min: Kodjia is off now too, replaced by Bony. After a terrific second half, extra-time hasn\u2019t yet caught fire. Both teams are wary of making a fatal mistake ... ET 2 min: Zaha, who had a decent game despite one bad miss, is withdrawn for Cornet. Meanwhile, Bounedjah was replaced by Slimani shortly after his penalty miss but is still distraught. The camera keeps panning to him in the dugout, where he is shaking his head and seemingly on the verge of tears. You\u2019d almost want Algeria to go on and win here just to save him from further distress. Before we tuck into the main feast (see below), let\u2019s enjoy the conclusion to the first quarter-final, which is turning out to be a corker. Algeria led through a first-half goal by Sofinae Feghouli and had a chance to increase that lead, only for Baghdad Bounedjah to smash a penalty against the crossbar. Then Jonathan Kodjia equalised for Ivory Coast and since then it\u2019s been a thrilling, helter-skelter affair, with highlights including Riyad Mahrez having a shot cleared off the line brilliantly by Mamadou Bagayoko, and Wilfried Zaha shaking a golden chance high and wide for the Elephants. A highly entertaining game is about to reach its climax, as extra-time begins momentarily... Hello. We are gathered here today to see whether Madagascar can spring yet another wonderful surprise. The team who began this tournament ranked 108th in the world have lit up the show with a marvellous spirit, canny defending and vibrant attacking. They\u2019ve been beautiful! Today, Tunisia stand in their way. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who we\u2019re up against, we\u2019re not worried about that!\u201d blared Malgasy midfielder Lalaina \u201cBolida\u201d Nomejanahary by way of preview for this match. \u201cWe approach every game with a winning mentality.\u201d That\u2019s the spirit! Still, let\u2019s remind ourselves of what Tunisia (world ranking: 25) will be bringing to this party. Far more experience than Madagascar, for a start, but also some nimble tricksters and a more open disposition than is suggested by a record of four draws from four matches so far. Youssef Msakni, Wahbi Khazri and Naim Sliti have not been at their best so far in this tournament (and Khazri and Sliti did not start the last game) but if they get it together, they could lead Madagascar on a merry dance. Both these teams are technically slick and fond of open and enterprising games so this could be a belter. Senegal will be paying close attention because they will meet the winner in the semi-final. You, too, should tune in. It\u2019s on! At 8pm BST."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
