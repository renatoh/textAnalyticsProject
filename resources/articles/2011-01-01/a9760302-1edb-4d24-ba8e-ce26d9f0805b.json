Photo by Microsoft Sweden on Flickr. Some rights reserved The next version of Windows, unofficially dubbed Windows 8, will be able to run on ARM chips, not just the Intel ones that have been the backbone of PC sales for the past 25 years - but existing application from third parties will have to be rewritten to work on them, Microsoft said on Wednesday. Rewriting Windows to run on ARM chips potentially means that it could be used on an entirely new generation of devices which will have longer battery lives and use less power than Intel ones. But the effort for Microsoft is substantial because ARM and Intel chips have different \"architectures\" - in effect, speak different languages. It also suggests that Microsoft is concerned that in future Windows could lose ground in laptops and tablets to rival operating systems such as Google's Android and Chrome, and Apple's iOS, used on the iPhone and iPad, if it does not produce a version that can run on ARM chips. However for third party developers and users of older programs it could pose a problem. Applications will have to be recompiled or rewritten for the ARM architecture, and the software drivers used to run printers and other peripherals may have to be rewritten. That could create a hiatus for users worse than that suffered when Microsoft introduced its previous version of Windows, Vista, which required many drivers and applications to be rewritten. In an announcement ahead of the keynote opening speech by Steve Ballmer at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, the head of the Windows and Windows Live division Steve Sinofsky showed off the next version of Windows and a rewritten version of Microsoft Word running on ARM chips from Qualcomm, nVidia and Texas Instruments. Sinofsky declined to give a timescale for when the next release of Windows will be available, but said that \"24-36 months between releases seems about right.\" Windows 7 was released in October 2009, suggesting that the release will come between October 2011 and 2012. But he admitted that the thousands of apps presently written for Windows on Intel's x86 architecture will not run directly on the ARM hardware. That would only be possible using a technology called \"virtualisation\", in which the processor interprets Intel instructions and renders them into their ARM equivalents. That, however, imposes substantial overheads on the processor, effectively slowing it down. \"x86 programs don't run on the ARM architecture, and it's not likely that virtualisation would run on [ARM chips],\" Sinofsky said. He also declined to say what the next version will be called. \"I'm not saying it's called Windows 8,\" he said. Intel has struggled to compete with increasingly powerful ARM processors, notably the Tegra range from nVidia, which offer a powerful combination of computing performance, especially on graphics, with low power demands. Scores of tablet computers are now being built which use ARM designs, including Apple's iPad which uses one of its own design, and many more from other manufacturers running Google's Android operating system. Intel's attempts to compete with ARM designs with its Atom chips have seen few companies adopting it because its power consumption is about four times higher, limiting battery life. The move by Microsoft suggests that it thinks that future notebook and tablet designs will be ruled by ARM rather than Intel, and that if the next release of Windows was not available on ARM then it would lose market share to rivals. Sinofsky implied that Microsoft's mobile phone operating system Windows Phone 7 - which already runs on ARM processors - would not be allowed to run on tablet-sized computers. \"Our whole industry has to think about the boundaries of where you have one operating system or another,\" he said. \"We're clear that for us the small screen is for Windows Phone, and these screens\" - indicating the tablet-sized systems to PCs - \"are [for] Windows 7.\" But since the launch of the iPad last April, followed by scores of Android tablets in the autumn, the market share of Windows in the tablet market has dropped substantially - even though overall sales, which were always tiny at an estimated 1m annually, have not been noticeably affected. Microsoft's problem now is to capture part of the growing market. Observers are not confident that it can, because Windows is not optimised for the touch-screen tablet format, unlike Android and iOS. At a panel earlier in the day before the announcement, a group of experts suggested that Windows will be a distant third place behind Android and iOS in the tablet market for the foreseeable future. \"We've reached a point in technology where everyone really does want everything from their computing experience - the power and breadth of software for today's laptop, the long battery life and always-on promise of a mobile phone, and the possibilities from a new generation of tablets,\" said Sinofsky. \"We are making this announcement now to allow greater collaboration across our expanded partner ecosystem so we can bring to market the widest possible set of PCs and devices, from tablets on up, with the next generation of Windows.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
