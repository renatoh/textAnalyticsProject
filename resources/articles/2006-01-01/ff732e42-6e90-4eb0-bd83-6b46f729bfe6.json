Formally announcing his withdrawal outside the Commons this afternoon, after it was revealed on Guardian Unlimited this morning, Mr Oaten said he had received a lot of support from ordinary party members. \"But what has become very clear in the last few days is that that support is not matched by my colleagues in parliament. \"Apart from the very loyal support I have had from Lembit [Opik, his campaign manager] it became clear to me that I cannot get a level of support amongst members of parliament that I think is necessary if you are going to lead this party.\" He said he would not declare his support today for any of his former rivals who were \"three excellent candidates that bring different qualities to lead this party\". All three enjoyed far greater support among MPs and peers and each stood a \"very good chance\". He had spoken to all three this morning and told them he would do everything possible to make the contest a positive for the party, he added. Mr Oaten said he was \"very upset\" at the leak of the emails and said it had played a part in his decision to step aside. \"I was very upset that private conversations I had been having with Charles ended up in the press. \"Of course that was a factor because I wanted this to be a positive election campaign and frankly when you start getting leaks in newspapers and things like that then that's not the kind of campaign I want to be involved in.\" He said he had ordered a security check in an attempt to establish where the leak came from. Mr Hughes said Mr Oaten was \"a great asset to the party\" who would have \"an important role to play in my frontbench team\". The party's home affairs spokesman apparently decided to throw in the towel after Charles Kennedy's office accused his team of leaking messages which implied the former party leader was backing him, and the revelation that only one of the seven MPs who had signed his nomination had promised to vote for him. Mr Oaten said he was \"very upset\" at the leak of the emails and said it had played a part in his decision to step aside. \"I was very upset that private conversations I had been having with Charles ended up in the press,\" he told reporters. \"Of course that was a factor because I wanted this to be a positive election campaign and frankly when you start getting leaks in newspapers and things like that then that's not the kind of campaign I want to be involved in.\" He said he had ordered a security check by the police and parliamentary authorities in an attempt to establish where the leak came from. The leaked emails, published in yesterday's Independent, suggested that Mr Kennedy had contacted fellow MPs on Mr Oaten's behalf. But the author of one of the leaked emails, Mr Kennedy's head of office, Anna Werrin, told party chiefs that she believed \"some bright spark on Mark's campaign thought it would boost his chances if it looked as though he had Charles's backing\". In an email sent to the party's chief executive, Lord Rennard, and the chief whip, Andrew Stunell, Ms Werrin said that \"Mark sought - and was refused - Charles's endorsement ... it was made emphatically clear to Mark's campaign that Charles would not be endorsing any of the candidates and wished to remain neutral.\" She added that Mr Kennedy had later agreed to help Mr Oaten find seven signatures in the interests of an open contest as he was \"struggling\" to do so. Commenting on Mark Oaten's decision to withdraw from the leadership race, Simon Hughes said: \"Mark is a hugely talented politician and a great asset to the party. \"He has demonstrated great loyalty to Charles, especially in recent difficult weeks for the party, and that is something for which I very much respect him. \"I am confident that he has much to contribute to the Liberal Democrats over the coming years and he will certainly have an important role to play in my frontbench team.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
