Tony O'Reilly's Independent News and Media (INM) is thought to have offered the full asking price of \u00a340 million for the portfolio, minus the News Letter in Belfast. INM wants to avoid potential pitfalls by excluding the News Letter from its bid. The paper has a strong unionist editorial leaning and INM was warned the deal would have little chance of getting past Irish competition authorities because it already owns the unionist Belfast Telegraph. In a separate move, Ulster Unionist MP David Burnside has tabled a bid for the News Letter. But insiders say that Trinity Mirror, which has mounted a cost-cutting exercise, wants to sell all of the newspapers together. The former Financial Times group chief executive David Palmer, backed by venture capitalists HgCapital, has tabled a bid for the entire portfolio, which includes the Derry Journal and the Donegal Democrat. Former Trinity chief executive David Montgomery is advising venture capital firm 3i on a separate bid, believed to include all the titles. Thomas Crosbie Media, owner of the Irish Examiner, has bid for the titles excluding the News Letter. The Scottish-based Dunfermline Press group, and Scottish Radio Holdings have also put in bids. The sale is part of chief executive Sly Bailey's bid to cut costs across the group. Last week Bailey flew to the US in a bid to persuade sceptical investors Tweedy Browne that she could turn the company around without selling off the national titles. US backers last year put pressure on chairman Victor Blank to sell Trinity's loss-making national newspapers: the Daily Mirror; Sunday Mirror; the People; and Scottish title the Daily Record."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
