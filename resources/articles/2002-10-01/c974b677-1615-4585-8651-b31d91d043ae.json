So writes Toby Mundy, publisher of Atlantic Books, a lively new imprint, in a long, learned piece in the latest edition of Prospect. Actually, despite the gloomy, elegiac tone, Mundy's overall contention is that this is a golden age and that 'publishing has never been better'. But what kind of publishing? You would not expect a professional publisher to be cheerful, any more than you would expect a gentleman farmer with a wad of fivers in his back pocket to tell you he was having a bumper harvest. Sure enough, a closer look at the Prospect piece reveals a predictable anxiety. There is 'radical change ahead' and not all of it is looking good. Enter the new media: digital audio and the computer screen. To Mr Mundy, these are the Visigoths of the IT revolution who have already swept through reference publishing, and are now threatening to sack the eternal city of general trade publishing, the companies that produce the books you and I actually read. Dictionaries, encyclopedias and atlases have already been revolutionised by the new media. Mundy's fear, more or less explicitly stated, is that what he calls general non-fiction and fiction will go the way of reference books. Well, it is a point of view, but I am not so sure. No one, of course, knows how or when the IT revolution will achieve an equilibrium after the heady years of change it has been through since the 1990s. But if there is one thing that the history of technological change in the information sector, from Gutenberg on, teaches us it is that innovations do not replace, they complement. The printing press did not annihilate pen and ink. The typewriter did not make the notebook and pencil redundant. The laptop computer is an add-on, not an enemy. The first steps of electronic publishing have been faltering. The e-book has not - yet - been a bestseller, or even a viable commercial proposition. Stephen King and Frederick Forsyth, both megasellers, have published books on the internet and both flopped. One day, however, such ventures will succeed and when electronic publishing becomes the norm, the more desirable (and expensive) the traditional book will correspondingly become. To draw an analogy from the newspaper business: you can read The Observer online, free, at the click of a mouse, yet every Sunday nearly half a million people buy the paper. A bookish version of that preference is likely to survive long after our children are curling up in bed with electronic versions of Harry Potter and Dr Seuss. (There is no sign of that happening yet, but it must be only a matter of time.) The printed book, as this column has occasionally observed, is a world-class survivor. A renaissance artefact first marketed in this country by an energetic literary hustler named William Caxton, the book (and generations of its publishers) have kept pace with virtually every technological change you care to think of, from the internal combustion engine to television. What is more, the printed book stands for a mode of thought - deliberate, ruminative and private - that is a cornerstone of civilisation. The paper, the ink, the cover and the feel of a book are precious in ways we probably cannot quantify. A book offers an independent route into a shared past as well as a secret avenue into a personal future. It is, in a word, inimitable. If the artefact is surprisingly resilient, the creative impulse it embodies is deep-seated. From Edwina Currie to Victoria Beckham, the urge to write a book derives partly from the impulse to communicate, in a direct and personal way, with hundreds, even thousands, of readers in the privacy of their homes and to share something private for whatever motive. Money, of course, comes into the equation, but the composition of a book, good or bad, is a profound and highly significant act of self-expression. Whether, in the future, this occurs in an electronic medium or on the printed page is, in a sense, neither here nor there. Or rather, that is to worry about delivery systems when we should be worrying about the content. This may be a golden age, but those of us on the receiving end of this bonanza cannot overlook the fact that for every newly minted sovereign there are still extraordinary quantities of dross. robert.mccrum@observer.co.uk World of books debate"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
