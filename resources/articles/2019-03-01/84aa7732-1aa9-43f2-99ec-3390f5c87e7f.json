The Labor leader told the audience he would spend more on education, with a promised \u201c100% Gonski funding\u201d. \u201cWhat is the dollar difference?\u201d the Sky News host, David Speers, asked. \u201cI can\u2019t remember the exact figure David, off the top of my head,\u201d Daley said. \u201cBut it\u2019s 100% Gonski funding, at the moment it sits at about 77%.\u201d Daley then also had to recheck his figures on Tafe, mistakenly saying he would invest $3bn. Earlier reports suggested Labor\u2019s plan would cost $65m for the first four years. Speers reacted in surprise. \u201cThree billion?\u201d he asked. \u201cLet me check the figures,\u201d Daley responded. Earlier, Daley and the premier Gladys Berejiklian \u2013 who face off in Saturday\u2019s state election with the polls tied at 50/50 \u2013 clashed on high-profile issues such as stadium spending and climate change. The debate was interrupted at one point when an \u201cundecided\u201d questioner was revealed as the lead candidate for the Australian Conservatives who had \u201csnuck in\u201d to the audience. Speers was forced to apologise after he discovered, live on air, that a man who asked about the right of religious schools to discriminate against gay students was a candidate in Saturday\u2019s election. The debate, hosted by Sky News and the Daily Telegraph, was billed as an audience of 100 undecided voters and neither leader raised an eyebrow when one questioner asked if religious schools should be allowed to discriminate against students on the basis of their sexuality. But a few minutes later Speers revealed the questioner was Greg Walsh, who is the lead candidate for the Australian Conservatives in the upper house, and is prominently featured on their election material. Neither leader appeared to recognise Walsh as they answered his question, and the debate had moved on to youth mental health, before Speers announced Walsh\u2019s identity. \u201cI am told you are an Australian Conservatives candidate in the election,\u201d Speers said, pointing at Walsh. \u201cI am not quite sure how you worked your way into the audience.\u201d The Canberra bureau chief for Sky News tweeted that he was a guest for a later show who had \u201csnuck down\u201d into the audience. During the debate Daley said he would allow the school climate strikes to happen \u201cevery year\u201d. Last week, Daley came out in support of the 15 March strike, but Berejiklian said students should not protest during school hours. On Wednesday night he said he still \u201cbacked them in 100%\u201d. Speers asked: \u201cIf you win the election, will you encourage students to strike again? They did one last year, if they do it once a year, would that be OK?\u201d Daley responded: \u201cThat would be fine.\u201d Berejiklian said she still opposed the strikes. The two leaders also clashed on the issue of Sydney\u2019s stadiums. Berejiklian claimed Daley did not know the cost of his own plan, and said Labor would have to pay a near-identical $700m sum to repair and refurbish the stadium if it won government. But Daley countered that he would make the Sydney Cricket Ground trust pay for any costs, rather than the taxpayer. Berejiklian told the audience that every dollar spent knocking down and rebuilding the Allianz Stadium would create roughly $3 in future revenue. \u201cDepending on the stadium ...it\u2019s about $3 for every $1 you are investing over the course of the next 15 to 20 years,\u201d she said. But Daley said the taxpayer would not need to pay anything under his plan. \u201cI will have the newly constituted SCG trust take out a loan for a refurbishment,\u201d he said. \u201cUnder my model [the taxpayer] doesn\u2019t put any money into it. You still get a refurbished, state-of-the-art stadium, a modern stadium ... but you don\u2019t have to have the taxpayers pay for it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
