Hopefully with more luck than the avid Liverpool fan Mullin had trying to attend United\u2019s visit to Anfield last weekend. Going toe-to-toe with Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s fragile team on Sunday offers ample compensation. \u201cThat and Barcelona last season are the only games in two years I haven\u2019t been able to get a ticket for,\u201d lamented the 25-year-old, who was in the same Liverpool youth team as Raheem Sterling before their careers took very different paths. \u201cI went to the pub with my girlfriend and my mum and dad instead. My brother-in-law has the Croc in town [the Crocodile, a Liverpool saloon with karaoke] and we went there to watch the game and had a few hours in Liverpool. I can score the winner on Sunday now. They\u2019ll all be giving me tickets then.\u201d The Liverpool fan in Mullin requires no extra incentive to increase United\u2019s problems but his priority is to give Rovers supporters another lift in what has been a trying league campaign. \u201cI want to do it for the fans here,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who come to support us every week. The Tranmere fans don\u2019t care about Liverpool. They come no matter how we are doing.\u201d After two consecutive promotions from the National League to League One, and having lost last season\u2019s leading goalscorer, James Norwood, on a free to Ipswich last summer, the acceleration of Micky Mellon\u2019s team has stalled. Tranmere are third from bottom of League One but the FA Cup has provided a release. For Mullin, who scored the late equaliser that completed Tranmere\u2019s comeback from three goals down in the first meeting with Watford, United\u2019s visit is also reward for refusing to give up after the heartache of being released by Liverpool at 16. The forward, who returned to Merseyside via spells with Huddersfield, Morecambe and Swindon, said: \u201cWhen you\u2019re a kid that\u2019s your dream and you think your whole world has fallen apart. But now I\u2019ve been given a career as a footballer and to get the chance to play against Manchester United, one of the biggest teams in the world, is a great feeling. I will try to express myself and score.\u201d Mullin impressed after replacing the tireless Morgan Ferrier against Watford, with both strikers picking up knocks in the replay, and believes the Prenton Park pitch could have an influence against United. \u201cIt\u2019s not in great condition,\u201d he said. \u201cEveryone can see that and knows that. Manchester United are all fantastic players and the best there is but to come here it is 11 v 11 and we will make it as hard as we can for them. Hopefully we can get something. \u201cIt would be massive for the lads and the club to get a replay at Old Trafford, especially money-wise. It would be great to win but to play at Old Trafford, one of the most famous stadiums in the world, would be great for all the fans here who go home and away. And why should replays be scrapped? For the club it would mean a lot and it would be a dream for the lads. There are Manchester United fans in our changing room [Connor Jennings among them] \u2013 why wouldn\u2019t they want to play there? It\u2019s a dream for them.\u201d Mellon\u2019s assistant, Michael Jackson, was at Old Trafford on Wednesday for United\u2019s 2-0 defeat by Burnley and at Anfield on Sunday for Liverpool\u2019s victory by the same scoreline. \u201cNot because we believed we were going to go through against Watford,\u201d the manager explained. \u201cWe were just being professional.\u201d That approach, and possibly the memory of last season\u2019s 7-0 thrashing by Tottenham in round three, led Mellon to dismiss talk of United\u2019s vulnerability. But their appearance at Prenton Park will, he hopes, generate the revenue needed to improve Rovers\u2019 squad in their fight to remain in League One. The Tranmere manager said: \u201cIt should give us the opportunity to strengthen. We know we need to strengthen. We didn\u2019t really have the ability to do that before because we are not lashed with loads of money. So hopefully now it should give us the opportunity to build on something and we can only build on it by bringing in quality players into the group. \u201cI\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be able to do that and that is the right way to go to keep building this club and give them nights like Watford because that is what it is all about. Thursday was a massive night for us for a whole host of reasons.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
