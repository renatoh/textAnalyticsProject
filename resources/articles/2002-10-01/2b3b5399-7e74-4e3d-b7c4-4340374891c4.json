For, rising from the pages of Richard Stott's Dogs and Lampposts - like the gruesome Freddy returning for another Nightmare on Elm Street sequel - is David Montgomery, leading suitor for parts of Scottish Media Group and the man responsible, claims Stott, for almost ruining the Daily Mirror. Stott's savage dismantling of the idea that, as an ex-journalist, Montgomery has a magic touch with ailing newspaper companies - may wipe the smiles from the faces of those at Scottish Media who support selling to the Monty-led consortium, 3i. As for those currently employed on the Heralds, they may run screaming for the Cairngorms when they contemplate former Mirror editor Stott's appraisal of the unsmiling Ulsterman. Montgomery was an unpopular former Mirror sub-editor who edited the News of the World and Today before returning to take over Mirror Group Newspapers after Robert Maxwell's watery demise. MGN journalists, punchdrunk with blows from the grave that had apparently destroyed their pension fund, were horrified, but decided to accept the incoming regime - Montgomery in tandem with Lord (Clive) Hollick. The partnership foundered and Hollick departed - when the new chief executive gave journalists assurances. These included pledges that 'I have definitely got no plans for job cuts in editorial departments' and, 'The editors of all titles remain in their positions'. Within weeks, I had been sacked from the editorship of the People , followed four days later by Stott from the Daily Mirror. It was, as Stott claims, 'one of the worst bloodbaths in Fleet Street history'. Montgomery's dismissal of Stott epitomised his style of management. Less than 48 hours after having assured him that a rumour linking David Banks with the editorship of the Daily Mirror was untrue, Montgomery summoned Stott to Claridge's and told him he thought it was time for 'a new broom' at the paper. 'That's not what you said on Friday,' said Stott. 'I was tap-dancing,' replied Montgomery. Even as Monty was stabbing Stott in the back, casual journalistic staff were being locked out of the Mirror Group's then headquarters in Holborn. During Montgomery's tenure, which began with the boast that he was going to make the Mirror titles great again, the flag ship's circulation dropped by more than 500,000 copies a day. The Sunday Mirror lost more than a quarter of its entire sale and the People just under 20 per cent. The only beneficiaries of a regime that brought the papers to their knees were the banks, smarting under the losses inflicted on them by Maxwell's plunge from ace financial operator to busted flush. 'As Montgomery threw more and more Mirror staff on to the streets,' observes Stott, 'the share price rose... They [the banks] had got their money back with a tidy little earner on the side.' Montgomery did not do badly, either. By 1995 his pay package was \u00a3356,000, boosted by massive share options, and when he was unloaded prior to the acquisition of the group by new owners Trinity, his pay-off was around \u00a31.4 million, plus almost \u00a3750,000 from previously cashed share options. Both Stott and I knew Montgomery of old. As an assistant editor of the Daily Mirror standing in as editor one night, I left acting night editor Montgomery in charge with the instruction: 'Call me if you want to change the splash'. Halfway home, an alarm bell rang in my head. I called in and asked Montgomery if anything was happening. There was a long pause. 'I've changed the splash,' he mumbled. During his days at the Mirror, 'he quickly acquired the reputation of being a newspaper obsessive', recalls Stott. In a fascinating book tracing his career from reporting on a news agency to five national newspaper editorships - the Daily Mirror twice, the People twice and Today - Stott does not reserve all his bile for Montgomery. Former Times editor Charlie Wilson - who rose imperceptibly when working for Maxwell and then backed both sides when a staff buyout was trying to head off predators like Montgomery - comes under withering fire. The man who promised he was in the post-Maxwell proposed buyout 'with both feet, matey' later told a worried board that there were people on the editorial floor who were associated with the buyout and 'wished a destabilisation of the present board, believing that to be in their favour'. I was there and know that to be blatant nonsense. Wilson became part of the Montgomery team and when he eventually left, director Paul Vickers said, he was allowed to keep his considerable share options 'as a gesture to his excellent service with the company'. Remarks Stott: 'As Wilson, in his two jobs as managing director and editorial director, presided over the decline, it is difficult to see where the excellent service came in.' But of the two, it is Montgomery who most earns a place in newspaper history according to this book. Thankfully for the newspaper trade, nobody in it has yet found it advantageous to hire his services again, concludes Stott. Don't bet on it, Richard. Nightmares have been known to recur. \u00b7 Bill Hagerty is editor of the British Journalism Review.
