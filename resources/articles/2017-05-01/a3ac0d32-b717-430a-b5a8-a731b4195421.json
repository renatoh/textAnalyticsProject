Can scored the \u201cbest goal\u201d of his career in first-half stoppage time, connecting sweetly with Lucas Leiva\u2019s diagonal pass, to move the visitors four points clear of fifth-placed Manchester United. Victories over Southampton, West Ham and Middlesbrough will ensure Klopp\u2019s team return to Europe\u2019s elite club competition but the German, while thrilled at his side\u2019s response to their recent home defeat by Crystal Palace, remains cautious. \u201cWe need to stay focused, to stay concentrated,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have pressure until the end of the season but at least it\u2019s a positive pressure. That is better. It means we are fighting for something. \u201cSo we\u2019ll do everything to get the points we need but it won\u2019t be easy. If people think we already have the three points against Southampton, for example, then they\u2019ve not watched them play this season. They\u2019re another really strong side. \u201cBut this was a big win and won by a great goal. Emre is a good player, a good player. He\u2019d had a calf problem [earlier this season] but we simply couldn\u2019t leave him out. We\u2019d spoken a lot about this, as a group, and people were wondering what was wrong with him. But we needed him in those moments. Sometimes he wasn\u2019t as good as he could have been, but now those problems are sorted, he\u2019s physically strong again and we can see he can score goals like this...\u201d Can\u2019s acrobatics ensured Liverpool coped with the loss of Philippe Coutinho to a dead leg, with Adam Lallana featuring for 74 minutes on his return from a thigh problem. The Liverpool manager did have to endure watching Sebastian Prodl batter a shot against the crossbar in the fifth minute of stoppage time as Watford threatened to draw level. \u201cI said to the players after the game, if they want to kill me, that\u2019s a good way to try it,\u201d added Klopp. \u201cI thought I felt something in this area [his chest]. Five hundred million grey hairs ... We\u2019d already defended this situation so often. They tried everything over 97 minutes but one mistake could have led to the goal. That\u2019s how football at this level is. We didn\u2019t play perfectly tonight but conceding in the last second would not have been deserved.\u201d Liverpool will resist selling Can this summer despite the player having failed to agree terms over a new deal as he enters the final 12 months of his contract. \u201cEverything is in our hands,\u201d said the Germany international. \u201cIf we win the three last three games we are in the Champions League. We are confident we can achieve that. If we perform how we can perform, we can do it. But, having seen the results over the weekend [when both Manchester City and United dropped points], this was a big game for us. And that is the best goal I\u2019ve ever scored.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
