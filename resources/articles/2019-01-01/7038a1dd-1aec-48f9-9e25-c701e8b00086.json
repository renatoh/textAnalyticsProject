Rashford marked his landmark appearance with arguably the finest goal of his career in Saturday\u2019s 2-1 win over Brighton &amp; Hove Albion at Old Trafford, a strike deriving from impressive close control and a curled finish from a tight angle. It was his 41st goal for the club, with Ronaldo having registered 25 times and Rooney 45 times after 150 games. Rashford is the youngest of the trio to reach the number of appearances. Asked if Rashford is at the level of Ronaldo and Rooney, Solskj\u00e6r said: \u201cYes. Definitely he can be absolutely top-class. He is only 21 but the maturity he is showing at times is more than 21 and his work rate.\u201d The defeat of Brighton was United\u2019s seventh consecutive win from Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s opening seven games as interim manager with Rashford scoring five times in that sequence. \u201cThe more you score the more you believe you are going to score,\u201d the Norwegian said. \u201cThe more you score the more chance you have of being confident, running into the same positions. The way he works during the week is fantastic because he practises a lot.\u201d Towards the end Rashford drew a booking for a heavy tackle on Mart\u00edn Montoya, having taken a painful challenge from the same player moments before. Solskj\u00e6r pointed to the toughness of the Wythenshawe-born Rashford. \u201cHe is a proper Manc. You can\u2019t kick him and keep him down. He will stand up for a fight and stand up for himself and a teammate. It is a pleasure working with him,\u201d he said. The victory gave Solskjaer six wins from his opening six Premier League matches, drawing him level with Pep Guardiola and Carlo Ancelotti as the best start to a tenure in the competition. Paul Pogba opened the scoring with a penalty but Pascal Gross struck a late Brighton consolation, making it 2-1 with 18 minutes to go, and Ashley Young believes United should be more ruthless. \u201cWe can be even more clinical,\u201d the captain said. \u201cBeing 2-0 up, we\u2019ve got to be more ruthless to go and get the third, to go and get the fourth, to kill the game off, and then we can start keeping the ball more. We didn\u2019t do that. They obviously got the goal and there was 15 minutes of defending.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
