Mindful that this strong-pulling front-running two-year-old would be going over much longer distances next season with the Derby as one big target, Bolger reckoned that it was time to teach New Approach to relax and settle in his races. But then, in consultation with the colt's new part owner, Sheikh Mohammed, 10 days ago it was decided not to let New Approach rest on his laurels. He was unbeaten in four runs, most recently in the National Stakes at The Curragh in which he beat two exciting horses in Rio De La Plata and Myboycharlie, so the quest for a fifth win in the Dewhurst was a bit of a risk after the change had been made to his work at home. The gamble took on new proportions when the field for the Dewhurst was announced. Rio De La Plata, also under the Sheikh's auspices but racing in the blue of Godolphin, was again in the line-up and so was the unbeaten Raven's Pass, whose trainer John Gosden was distinctly worried about the soft ground. Furthermore, Bolger has had to employ another method of getting New Approach to take things in his stride, that of sending him down to the start early accompanied by a stablemate, rather disparagingly referred to as a 'pony.' This pony, one of Bolger's lesser lights called Metamorphosis, helped to do the job for jockey Kevin Manning, the trainer's son-in-law. There were echoes of last year's Dewhurst as Manning had been aboard when Teofilo won it for Bolger in what turned out to be the last run of his career. Teofilo had been widely expected to win all the big races, the Guineas, Derby and Arc, as a three-year-old but injury ended his career and it is remarkable that the trainer has another son of Galileo in New Approach in a similar mould so soon. As the Middle Park winner Dark Angel blasted off in the lead, it seemed that the work in settling New Approach at Bolger's Culcullen stables had gone too well. He looked almost sluggish in the mid-division and Manning seemed hard at work when he asked him to take closer order after halfway. As his trainer said: 'He was asleep most of the way.' Two furlongs out, it seemed as though it was a question of how far Raven's Pass would win as Jimmy Fortune hit the front on him, but that feeling went in the blinking of an eye. In this higher class, and on the softer going, he was found out as Manning finally persuaded the giant New Approach into his full stride. But as the pair ground down Raven's Pass near the rails, a fresh challenge emerged from Fast Company on the outside. Brian Meehan's contender, also unbeaten going into the race, seemed likely to beat the 6-4 favourite on the uphill run to the finish. With Manning flailing away, he received a five-day ban for excessive use of the whip, New Approach showed how good he is and how hard he is to pass. He surged on for a half-length win, shades of Teofilo's narrow defeat of Holy Roman Emperor last year. Bolger does not do ruffled and he claimed that he was not worried through the race. 'We overdid the settling today and that nearly cost us,' he said. But like a chess grandmaster, the trainer has been planning moves a long way ahead and he continued: 'Now we know he can settle we can rev him up for the Guineas and bring him back down for the Derby. He will have no trouble with the trip.' Like his stablemate before him, he is a hot favourite for both Classics. Bolger is not the type to have sleepless nights, but those who have supported him for next year may do a little tossing and turning as they recall what happened to Teofilo. In the aftermath of such a compelling event, the supposed centrepiece of the card, the Champion Stakes, was rather lost. But Literato had his trainer, Jean-Claude Rouget, close to tears as he had the better of an exciting struggle with Eagle Mountain. There was a touch of symmetry with the Dewhurst as Christophe Lemaire, successful with Pride last year, was on board again. Few are cleverer at bringing off a long-term handicap plan than Irish trainer Tony Martin and after greeting his Cesarewitch winner Leg Spinner, he said: 'This has always been the plan.' His victory gave one Scoop6 punter from Stretford, who laid out \u00a33,600, the pot of more than \u00a31.5million."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
