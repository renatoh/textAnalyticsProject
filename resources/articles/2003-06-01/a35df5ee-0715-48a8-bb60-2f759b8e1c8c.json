The 27-year-old from Sussex has been trying since 1994 to celebrate a victory at the All England Club and, sadly, that wait never looked likely to be over as her Russian opponent repeatedly put her on the back foot. \"I try not to think about my record,\" said Pullin afterwards. \"It doesn't do you any good to worry about it. I stopped doing that a long time ago. \"It's never what you want, to lose in the first round of any tournament - it's especially hard here.\" Pullin then went on to reflect on the narrow margin between success and failure. \"Two years ago, against Marlene Weingartner, I had a match point,\" she said. \"Her second serve just hit the edge of the line and my return just clipped the net and fell back on my side.\" In truth, Pullin never got that close to the net yesterday as the powerful Krasnoroutskaya continually hit deep, penetrating ground strokes that pinned Pullin to the baseline. \"I had a game plan,\" she explained, \"but I was never allowed to do it.\" Unfortunately for British tennis, Pullin's tale of woe was shared by seven other wild cards, with Jamie Delgado, Martin Lee, Richard Bloomfield, Mark Hilton, Alex Bogdanovic, Elena Baltacha and Jane O'Donoghue all going out. Lee, once ranked the world junior No1 and a top 100 player only last year, has alarmingly slipped to 319th in the world - a situation which has not been helped by a serious knee injury. He has three times reached the second round and against the Spanish clay-court specialist David Ferrer, who was making his Wimbledon debut, he looked likely to advance once more to that stage. The more experienced Briton, at 25 the older by four years, romped through the first set 6-1. However, Ferrer gradually worked out how to play on grass and Lee, who fell away in dramatic fashion, eventually went down 1-6, 6-3, 6-1, 6-2. But at least he managed to win a set, something which eluded Bloomfield and Hilton. Bloomfield, a 19-year-old ranked 412th in the world, briefly threatened to make an impression in his match against Anthony Dupuis of France before succumbing 6-4, 7-6, 6-3. Meanwhile, Hilton was never in with a realistic chance, losing 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 to the 27th seed Younes El Aynaoui of Morocco. Bogdanovic was similarly outclassed, crashing 6-1, 6-3, 6-2 against the Armenian Sargis Sargsian."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
