But the campaign's investment in the state is not an effort to run up the score with a huge margin of victory here. Advisors and Arkansas political analysts say the campaign sees the state as a battleground in the delegate contest - and is laying the groundwork for a general election fight. Hillary Clinton - then known as Hillary Rodham - moved to Arkansas in the 1970s with Bill Clinton. An accomplished attorney in her own right, Clinton spent years building political relationships here while her husband served as attorney general, then 12 years in the governor's mansion. But rather than rely on her large network of supporters in Arkansas, the Clinton camp has a dozen paid campaign staff in the state, and Clinton, former president Bill Clinton and daughter Chelsea have all visited in recent days. Meanwhile, her chief rival Barack Obama has only one paid staffer, and has not been to the state since 2006, when he campaigned for the current Democratic governor Mike Beebe (who then went on to endorse Clinton). Arkansas has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since Bill Clinton's 1996 re-election bid and the campaign assumes that if she wins the nomination, they'll need to win Arkansas to put Clinton in White House. \"The Clinton campaign sees this as an initial investment in a yearlong campaign in Arkansas,\" said Jay Barth, a political scientist at Hendrix College in Conway, Arkansas. \"They went ahead and ramped up not so much for the primary, but looking ahead to the general election.\" The campaign hopes to win by a large margin - and to defeat Obama in each of the state's four congressional districts - in order to win the nominating delegates needed if the primary race isn't resolved by the convention this summer. \"It's not only important to put Arkansas in the plus column, but it's important to run up votes wherever you can,\" said Arkansas attorney general Dustin McDaniel, Clinton's Arkansas campaign chairman. \"Here, how many votes you get and the percentage of the vote in a district can make the difference.\" The Clinton campaign hopes that the well-to-do whites who have favoured Obama elsewhere will here back Clinton because of their decades-old ties to her and the former president. The heavily black and impoverished counties of the state's Mississippi Delta region are expected either to split between the two or favour Obama, analysts say. In October, the Clinton campaign opened its headquarters in an old dance studio in downtown Little Rock. The office is festooned with decades-old photos of Hillary, Bill and baby Chelsea, evoking memories of the family's years in Arkansas and seeking to press the point that although Clinton left Arkansas 15 years ago, she is still at home in the state. Clinton's television advertisement in the state was produced specifically to court Arkansas voters, and includes a clip of the senator reminiscing. Obama's campaign, by contrast, opened its headquarters only last month, in a shop on the other side across a busy road from the downtown district. His campaign is locked in a fight for delegates, perhaps recognising it cannot feasibly hope to win the popular vote. Obama's energetic Arkansas effort, buoyed by enthusiastic volunteers, has also served to distract Clinton and force her campaign to expend resources here. \"We drew the time of all three Clintons last week,\" supporter Pat O'Brien exulted. O'Brien, clerk of the Pulaski County circuit court in Little Rock, is one of the few Arkansas public officials who has publicly endorsed Obama. The move has raised eyebrows in the state's small but close-knit political class, but O'Brien is backing Obama not out of political calculus but a genuine feeling of inspiration. \"I have a lot of quiet support on my team that people don't know about,\" he said. Obama seems also to have the same energising effect on voters here as elsewhere. At the lunch hour yesterday, a strip of downtown restaurants was crowded with Obama supporters waving signs and asking motorists to honk. O'Brien said that the campaign's door-knocking volunteers frequently meet undecided voters. That's a sign of Obama's strength, he said, because Clinton has \"universal name recognition.\" \"The undecideds are going to go our way,\" he predicted."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
