Delivered to deafening screams, it befits the biggest-selling boyband of all time, who have shifted well upwards of 100m records. There are trap doors, giant V-shaped video screens, a pyramid-type stage of light, impeccable choreography, numerous outfit changes and a whopping 32 songs. After 26 years on the block, the \u201cboys\u201d who svengali Lou Pearlman masterminded in their teens are now in their late 30s to mid-40s, and in their opening leathers and shades look more like minor hoodlums than musicians. Still, they\u2019re in more than decent shape, retain all five original members and the tenors (AJ McLean, Brian Littrell, Nick Carter), falsetto (Howie Dorough) and baritones (Kevin Richardson, also Carter when he wants) can still hit the required notes. There\u2019s no mention, of course, of the rape allegation made against Carter last year regarding an alleged incident in 2003, which was denied and charges dropped, although including this year\u2019s New Love (\u201cWho are you, the sex police? My sex ain\u2019t got no rules\u201d) seems unwise in the circumstances. Still, none of this dampens the fans\u2019 ardour, delivered via ever-increasing Backstreet mania and at least three items of hurled underwear. The band repay their loyalty and undergarments with touches for outstretched hands and surreal nostalgic anecdotes (\u201cRemember when we opened for Ant and Dec?\u201d). There are sincere-sounding speeches about families and babies, and even self-deprecation (\u201cRemember when we had abs? Now we have dad bods\u201d). A racy double entendre \u2013 \u201cDo you still love the Backstreet Boys after all the years? Does that mean you still want it that way?\u201d \u2013 introduces I Want It That Way. As the hits pile up and the clock nudges the two-hour mark, it\u2019s hard to deny the weapons-grade catchiness of Quit Playing Games (With My Heart), As Long As You Love Me, Passionate\u2019s lithe white funk or the industrially melodic Everybody, which accurately declares: \u201cBackstreet\u2019s back, all right!\u201d \u2022 At SSE Hydro, Glasgow, 14 June. Then touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
