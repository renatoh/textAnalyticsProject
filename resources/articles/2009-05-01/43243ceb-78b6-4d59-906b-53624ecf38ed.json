The flashy chestnut was as low as 12\u20131 for Epsom after that, but it seems that his trainer, Jeremy Noseda, does not rate his chances highly enough. Noseda has been tactful enough to say that it is the undulating course, as well as the \"hustle and bustle\" of the race, that worry him, rather than Sans Frontieres' raw ability. But really, if you thought the horse might be good enough, wouldn't you take your chances? In that light, Noseda's reticence is not good news for those that fancy Black Bear Island and Freemantle, the two that finished less than a length in front of his colt at York. If the third horse lacks Derby quality, then so do they. Still, Aidan O'Brien, who trains both, must be pretty satisfied with the hand he will have to play on 6 June. He trains six of the top eight in the Derby betting, an astonishing situation, which will surely give Sheikh Mohammed some food for thought \u2013 the ruler of Dubai has been boycotting the stallions of the Coolmore empire that backs O'Brien. Given the poor results achieved by the sheikh's Godolphin operation in recent years, that policy does not seem to be panning out too well. Their sole Derby runner is likely to be Kite Wood (bred from a Coolmore stallion and subsequently bought by the sheikh), who was only fifth in the Dante. With the contrasting depth of talent at his disposal, O'Brien must be tempted to laugh out loud at his good fortune. The old adage used to be: if you think you have more than one Derby horse, you don't have any. It was a reflection of the fact that a genuine Epsom contender would stand out from all others in an ordinary yard. In O'Brien's case, that hardly applies \u2013 his horses have been mopping up Derby trials on both sides of the Irish Sea. There is no doubting their ability, though there is room for doubt as to which is the best. Fame And Glory heads the market at 5\u20132 after impressive wins in both the Ballysax and the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial. But the quality of that form is unproven, since his main rivals were the same two horses in both races. And there have been several times when O'Brien's main Derby contender has been beaten by one of his other runners. At 25\u20131, O'Brien's Age Of Aquarius has been unjustly overlooked. That is partly down to the fact that he was a narrow winner of the unsexy Lingfield Derby Trial, which has not produced the Epsom winner since 1998. But that was only the third outing of this sturdy type, who must have any amount of scope for progress, and it's worth noting that Alessandro Volta, who won the same race for O'Brien last year, subsequently started the Irish Derby as the trainer's main contender. Age Of Aquarius made all at Lingfield to record a time half a second faster than Midday in the fillies' equivalent on the same day. That form looks even better in light of yesterday's win by Alwaary. He'd been fourth behind Age Of Aquarius, who must have a fine each-way chance in the Classic. For the notebook Miss Eze Newbury 7f Jamie Spencer's mount was practically taken out of the race by interference in the last quarter-mile in Saturday's handicap, for which she had been well backed. She holds an entry at Haydock on Saturday and a clear run would surely allow her to be very competitive. Ron Cox's tip of the day Oh So Saucy 2.50 Goodwood From the in-form yard of Chris Wall, Oh So Saucy has a fine chance in this handicap, for which she was around 6\u20131 last night. A maiden after 10 runs, she reeled off three wins and two seconds from five starts last season, all at this specialist's distance. She has the plum draw against the inside rail and her regular jockey, George Baker, has an excellent record around this course."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
