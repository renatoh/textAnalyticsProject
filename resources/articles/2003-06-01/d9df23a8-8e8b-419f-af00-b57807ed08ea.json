We have a point to make", "bodyText": "The first time Independent editor Simon Kelner swept his front page clean to make way for a list of outsized facts - on 5 April - it was because there was no story strong enough to make the splash. Kelner, editor since 1998, appears to have started something by ditching the traditional splash-hamper-basement broadsheet formula for a tabloidesque, single issue impact: last week, the Times and the Guardian opted for similar devices. 'The one [front page] everyone remembers during the war with all the numbers was like a lot of things in journalism,' he says. 'Expediency was the greatest driving force. We didn't have a particularly strong splash story and at about half past five on the Friday night we put our heads together.' The impact was immediate and measurable. Kelner's email queue was chock full of praise the next day and sales rose by 10,000-15,000. Since then the Indie has repeated the trick four times, the most recent occasion being the poster-sized list of numbers countering anti-asylum seeker scaremongering. 'We put on another 10,000 sales on the asylum front page. I cannot remember a time when I got more emails and letters from readers,' says Kelner, who sounds personally affronted by what he perceives to be a campaign against immigrants by the Government and 'right-wing media'. Other issues that the paper has held the old-style front page format over are suicide bombings 'Another day, another outrage ...' and the end of the war in Iraq: 'The war is over. Now these questions must be answered'. The Guardian pulled a similar stunt a week ago with a display-style page focusing on the secretary of state Charles Clarke and the funding crisis in our schools. Under the banner headline 'No Minister' and featuring a mugshot of Clarke, the page was dominated by first-person testimonies from 'people on the frontline'. There were large, orange quotation marks bookending the comments, bold mega-point quotations running down one column and that was pretty much it, bar a few hard sells for other sections. The Times opted for a poster-style treatment of the Colonel Tim Collins story 10 days ago. The headline - 'The British officer took out his pistol and hit me on the head. There was a lot of blood' - was in itself a departure from the norm. All headlines have to sell the copy beneath them, but this front page was taking no chances. Then there was the bullet-point list of the chain of events 'that could destroy one of Britain's most respected soldiers' from a Times-centric perspective. The Times, like the Indie, has seen its circulation slip over the past year. Selling your contents hard has never been so important and, as commentators such as Roy Greenslade have noted, the tabloids appear to have hit on the right formula, judging by their sales performances. 'It's not a new idea,' admits Kelner. 'The Daily Mirror in its heyday, and again recently, takes a theme, expands it and puts its particular spin on it. We have a sort of broadsheet version of it and because we are bigger we can have even more impact. You cannot do it every day because it would lose impact, but we have developed a way of doing things that has worked circulation-wise and in terms of feedback and critical approval. 'But it is a tabloid trick, and I say that in an admiring way, to take a subject and give it the treatment.' Along with many other daily broadsheets, the Independent' s circulation has been falling and at the last count (April) stood at just shy of 190,000. Kelner freely admits he 'does not care who reads the paper so long as they pay for it'. The one-issue, one-hit splash is as much targeted at floating buyers as designed to play to the political predilections of existing readers. 'The subjects we have chosen are those we know will touch the hearts of the readers. We had a strong anti-war stance [he describes himself proudly as a 'cheese-eating surrender monkey'] and we were strong on fat cats and asylum. We are continually questioning what we do and trying to do it in a more approachable and impactful way.' He adds that it is 'cheering' to see other broadsheets 'aping our approach'. In a tough environment every reader-winning trick is worth a try. Meanwhile, Daily Mirror editor Piers Morgan, has a caustic reaction. 'It does not surprise me in the slightest that, after years of lambasting tabloids for their overtly commercial impactive front pages, the broadsheets are now all piling in and stealing our clothes as usual.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
