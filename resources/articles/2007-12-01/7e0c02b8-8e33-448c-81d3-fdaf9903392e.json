It was part of her elegance of mind. Slender and carrying herself like a dancer, she wore clothes beautifully and chose them with passion and imagination. I remember delectable garments, beautifully cut from silk or cashmere, narrowly waisted or slashed to the hip, and cherry-red ankle-boots with a neat black fur cuff. Her husband Carl Djerassi describes how when he first met her, she was wearing \"a full-length, body-fitting, red silk dress and little else\". Because she was not a puritan, loving clothes was as natural to her as loving Wallace Stevens. If this makes her sound spoiled, she was not. At the end, she gave all her beautiful things away. Jo Gill writes: Diane Middlebrook was hugely supportive of my own work on the poet Anne Sexton and ever willing to share her experience and expertise. She wrote a brilliant chapter on Sylvia Plath and Ted Hughes for a book that I edited, turning in exemplary work on time and to length in spite of her illness. Many owe her a lasting debt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
