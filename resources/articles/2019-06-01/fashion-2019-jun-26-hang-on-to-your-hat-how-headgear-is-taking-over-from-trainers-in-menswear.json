How headgear is taking over from trainers in menswear", "bodyText": "A headpiece made of fresh flowers, a panama worn with flares and aviators, a dinky knitted circular crown. According to fashion week, the new point of interest in menswear for 2020 is all happening up top.. Despite the burst of interest in caps and bucket hats recently, the concept of a more decorative designer hat hasn\u2019t looked this likely to take off in years. But the message from the latest round of menswear shows, which wrapped at the weekend in Paris, is that the hat is likely to become a major style statement. For most luxury fashion houses, the bankable accessory of the past decade has been the cult designer sneaker, exemplified by the bestselling, super-chunky Triple S by Balenciaga, which also led the recent \u201cdad trainer\u201d trend. The new collections still had showy sports shoes in abundance, but the presence of striking headwear naturally shifts the eye skyward. One explanation is that with trousers becoming increasingly long and wide \u2013 from Dunhill to Saint Laurent \u2013 you can\u2019t actually see what\u2019s on your feet anyway. Stephen Jones, one of fashion\u2019s most prolific milliners, who counts Rihanna, Lady Gaga and the Duchess of Sussex as former clients, created the hats for Kim Jones (no relation) at Dior Men\u2019s in Paris. \u201cEverybody wears shoes. Not everybody wears hats,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a signifier of fashion, and as something so visible, there\u2019s nothing like a hat. You can wear a very unusual pair of shoes, but people don\u2019t necessarily see those when you walk into a room, whereas even a simple hat is seen.\u201d This latest Dior Men\u2019s collection was a collaboration with the American artist Daniel Arsham \u2013 himself a hat-wearer. Jones created a small selection of styles for the show, including an \u201cembroidered painter\u2019s canvas visor\u201d featuring quartz, echoing the set that Arsham had created for the show, with giant sculptures spelling out \u201cDior\u201d. Jones adds: \u201cThings go in cycles. But I think designers are now realising the power of a hat and how different and individual it makes their collections look.\u201d The latest advertising campaign from the ever-influential designer Raf Simons is also headgear-orientated, featuring a distinctive scaled-up riding hat. Simons went hard on this type of hat in his autumn/winter 2019 collection; all 50 looks shown in a Parisian ballroom in January were completed with a variation on this theme. At JW Anderson, designer Jonathan Anderson\u2019s woollen doughnut hats mirrored the craft-like knits worn on the body, while adding a certain jolliness. Ditto the oddball, all-shapes-and-sizes hats that Francesco Risso at Marni commissioned artist Shalva Nikvashvili to make from discarded leather and rubbish, ticking the current vogue in fashion for creative ideas around recycling. Meanwhile, the super-luxury labels Fendi and Louis Vuitton channelled gardening \u2013 cue hats galore. In Milan, Fendi closed its show (designed in collaboration with the Oscar-winning film director Luca Guadagnino) with a denim jumpsuit and curvy brimmed number with its FF logo woven into it. Virgil Abloh at Vuitton cited Jamiroquai in his show notes where a monogrammed PVC rain hat and lilac straw technical gardening hat were both featured. Sources of hat inspiration were broad and varied. The up-and-coming Swedish/Kurdish label Namacheko, designed by the brother-and-sister duo Dilan and Lezan Lurr, cited nuns\u2019 veils and Asian rice hats as inspirations for their designs, which featured scalloped fronts and headscarf backs. The new designer at Lanvin, Bruno Sialelli, presented a series of individually hand painted bicorn straw hats that were \u201cinspired by the kind of souvenir hats that you give to kids, with beautiful landscapes of a dream location\u201d, he said backstage. Hat statements were also notable on the front row. The GQ Style editor, Luke Day, has been photographed for the past month in a variety of headwear, including a wide-brim style similar to that shown on the Saint Laurent runway in LA a few weeks ago. \u201cMine is a $15 LA lifeguard hat I got on Venice Beach,\u201d Day says. \u201cI\u2019m really into hats right now. My summer looks are fairly simple, so the addition of a hat just makes it that bit extra.\u201d He travelled with five Mexican western hats in various colours for fashion week. \u201cMy cowboy vibe has gone less hustler and more Dallas, like JR Ewing at the Oil Baron\u2019s Ball,\u201d he quipps. The designer Spencer Phipps was sporting a cowboy hat at a fashion-week party in Paris, while the photographer Darren Gerrish is rarely out of a hat and has been a fan since childhood. He says his favourite style is the beret, and that he has nine in rotation. \u201cFor me, it is everything \u2013 I can wear it with a casual look, a suit or black tie. It defines me. It\u2019s my armour,\u201d he says. His go-to place to buy them is Laulh\u00e8re in Paris, a tip he was given by Stephen Jones. The men\u2019s headwear trend is also bubbling on the high street \u2013 Zara has several straw styles for \u00a36 upwards while Reiss has a baker-boy cap for \u00a335. James Lawrence, the head of menswear design at Asos, says the label has sold 150,000 hats this season to date, with bucket styles leading the charge. He says that headwear has been \u201cup-trending\u201d for a while because men now feel they can wear hats to all occasions and it \u201cdoesn\u2019t feel as contrived as it once did. Hats are now used to complete your look, rather than just being practical.\u201d \u201cPeople are embracing the hat a lot more, especially men, who are gaining confidence in their style,\u201d says Nick Fouquet, a hat designer who set up his label in 2013 and includes Keith Richards as a fan. \u201cA lot of athletes, especially basketball players, are leading the way and inspiring the fashion landscape with their attire and outfits.\u201d Like Jones, he believes that a hat can make far more of a statement than a pair of sneakers. Damien Paul, head of menswear at Matchesfashion.com, says hat sales are up over 150% compared with last year, with fedoras, panamas, bucket hats and summer beanies all performing well. \u201cFor autumn, we have more than 300 styles from designer names and more niche artisanal brands,\u201d he says. For further hat inspiration, look no further than Willem Dafoe as Vincent van Gogh in Julian Schnabel\u2019s excellent At Eternity\u2019s Gate. The actor offers a masterclass in how to wear, among other head attire, the now-trending wide-brimmed straw number. He looks spectacular."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
