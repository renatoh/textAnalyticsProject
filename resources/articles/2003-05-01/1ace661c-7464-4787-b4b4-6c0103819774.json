But like many a tortured adolescent, the Welshman must have thought that 18 would never come. Doherty, 10-2 down at one stage, and trailing 11-5 overnight, levelled the match on five occasions but, crucially, he never led. And Williams, after a last coaching session with Terry Griffiths with the score locked at 14-14, emerged for the final session marginally the more positive and fluent. Not even Doherty's Dublin mates would deny that Williams has been the better player over the 17 days, but their man has been the tournament's undoubted star. He played a record 98 frames to reach the final, even if it ended with a bone-aching failure. This was a classic contest between the greater long-potting ability of Williams and Doherty's indefatigable ability to scrap through broken play. In pugilistic terms it was the straight left jab against the in fighter; Williams, the 2000 champion, won on points. \"I feel numb,\" he said later. \"I'm still shaking. It could have gone either way. I knew Ken could come back because he's been doing it all week. I had a good lead but he just clawed it back.\" Doherty, not as free-scoring as in his title year of 1997, said: \"I should have gone home two weeks ago. And I thought I was dead and buried when I went 10-2 down here. It's always disappointing to lose a close match, particularly in the world final, but I got value for money.\" The Crucible, which is not unfamiliar with revivals, has rarely seen a comeback to match the Irishman's. This particular Embassy appeared to be a fag-end of lost appeal when it resumed in the afternoon with Williams enjoying a six-frame advantage. He was 50-1 on to repeat his success of three years ago yesterday morning, while Doherty was 12-1 against. But the bookmakers were soon required to recalculate their odds when Doherty won six in a row. Doherty had already been to the well so often in these championships that he was in danger of being nicknamed Aquarius, and he was within a frame of being knocked out in the first two rounds, by Shaun Murphy and Graeme Dott. Then, in the semi-finals, he came back from 15-9 down to defeat Paul Hunter 17-16. He went into this final having played 31 hours 22 minutes of snooker against Williams' 17 hours 43 minutes. But the No5 seed, married to a psychiatrist and who is working with a psychologist, is difficult to outscore when it comes to mind games. Williams was frozen off the table for the best part of three hours. And the only man looking utterly relaxed as the tension increased was Ian Doyle; the agent who has both players on his books. The on-site bookmaker Ladbrokes, which has doubled its business since last year, could scarcely believe its good fortune either. \"We've never had a string of five-figure bets like we've had here,\" said the odds compiler Jonathan Smith. \"And the biggest came this morning when we took \u00a315,000 for Doherty, at 15-1 to pay out \u00a3180,000.\" Another success were the TV ratings. Graham Fry, executive producer of TWI, the television arm of IMG which has covered the event for the BBC, said yesterday: \"The figures have been amazing. The final figures have yet to come through but up the middle of last week the viewing figures were 13% up on last year. We've had three million plus virtually every day, both for the late afternoon and the later peak slots.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
