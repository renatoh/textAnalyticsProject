It has been authentic, all right; authentically amateurish. For sure, even if his debut had been sparkling, he would never have got warm reviews from his many enemies at Westminster and in the media. What\u2019s more interesting is that even sympathisers have been taken aback by the absence of preparation for the transition and the shambles that has ensued. \u201cA bit rough,\u201d was the understated description offered by his old friend and contentious choice as shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, when we talked to him for the interview that we publish in today\u2019s Observer. There are quite a few examples to pick from, but a particularly telling one was allowing journalists to eavesdrop on the new Labour leader as he desperately tried to put together a shadow cabinet in the small hours of Monday morning. They were thus able to furnish the world with a blow-by-blow account of the chaos and calculation involved in its formation. What might have been a positive story \u2013 the first shadow cabinet with a female majority \u2013 became yet another negative one. \u201cNaivety,\u201d is how Mr McDonnell explains that. Labour MPs less friendly to the Corbyn experiment have much more pungent descriptions. At one level, what is happening to him is a very human story. In the space of a few months, he has hurtled from eternal and largely unnoticed rebel to the top seat in Britain\u2019s second largest political party. Even such consummate operators as Tony Blair and David Cameron were not entirely steady on their feet in their early days as leader of the opposition and they arrived in the role with professional teams already installed around them. Three decades on the hard shoulder of the backbenches has simply not prepared Mr Corbyn for life in the leadership fast lane. The enthusiasts who elected him in the name of a \u201cnew politics\u201d can\u2019t offer him the sort of help that he requires handling the 360-degree pressure of old Westminster. And his parliamentary colleagues don\u2019t want to help. The fundamental, structural dislocation at the heart of his leadership is his absence of support in parliament. That was made manifest at two of the most important events of his week. The first was his meeting with Labour MPs and peers on Monday night. It is traditional for a new leader to be greeted with a cheer. Labour MPs gave that to Ed Miliband, even though a majority of them had not voted for him. Jeremy Corbyn was received with ill-disguised animosity and some questions that sounded deliberately designed to trip him up, which is not so surprising when more than 90% of his colleagues did not want him as leader. One of those questions, an elephant trap that the most myopic old mammoth could have spotted, was whether he would wear a red poppy at the Remembrance Day ceremony at the Cenotaph. When he wouldn\u2019t say, his prevarication was promptly leaked. By the time his office issued a correction saying that he would be wearing a red poppy in November, the first but by no means only U-turn of the week, damage was done. The second illustration of the enormous gulf between leader and MPs came when he made his debut at PMQs. I grant you that it was different and crowdsourcing his questions from the public seemed popular. But the novelty will soon wear thin as more people realise that this way of doing questions doesn\u2019t put any pressure on the prime minister, who found it such a breeze that he didn\u2019t once consult his folder of briefing notes. Tories gave a lusty roar when their leader made his appearance in the Commons to deliberately create a contrast with the much more muted reception from his side for the Labour leader. All this helps to explain why Mr Corbyn appointed John McDonnell as his shadow chancellor. As Mr McDonnell acknowledges in his conversation with us, both men knew that it would be massively controversial within their party and beyond it. But the Labour leader needed one true ally in a senior position when most of the shadow cabinet are clearly not friends and many will become open enemies if they judge a moment has come to strike. There is a positive gloss to be put on the leader\u2019s minority status within his own top team and Mr McDonnell does so by saying it shows they desire \u201ca big tent\u201d that embraces the full spectrum of opinion within the parliamentary party. But they didn\u2019t really have much choice anyway. If Mr Corbyn had tried to create a parliamentary team only from those who wanted him to be leader, he would not have been able to fill all the positions in the shadow cabinet. A serial rebel in his previous life, he cannot demand loyalty as of right. He is also struggling to impose his will because of the uncertain nature of the mandate he received from the Labour selectorate. It was an insurgency, not a manifesto. His win was big, but it was also a bit ambiguous. As one of his supporters remarks, the Corbyn prospectus was \u201cmore a set of proposals than it was a programme\u201d. The upshot is a form of licensed anarchy in which members of the shadow cabinet feel free to refuse to endorse the leader\u2019s positions or even to openly contradict them. The pattern was set on his first full day. Mr Corbyn made the interesting decision to decline to start introducing himself to the wider public as Labour leader and pulled out of appearing on Sunday-morning television. The vacuum was filled by Tom Watson, his deputy, who used the opportunity to flatly disagree with his leader on some important things, notably the continued possession of a British nuclear deterrent. Then Mr Corbyn did not join in the singing of the national anthem at the Battle of Britain commemoration at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral. Several entirely predictable things followed from that. He was monstered by Tories and the rightwing press. He was defended by those who argued that Britain fought the Nazis to preserve freedoms, including the freedom not to sing God Save the Queen. His speech to the TUC, which contained a sharp line about the Tories being \u201cpoverty deniers\u201d, was drowned in the furore about the national anthem. His people then said that he would sing it on future occasions. So everyone, monarchists and republicans alike, was left unhappy. And members of the shadow cabinet felt at liberty to join the criticism. So he has certainly upended the conventional rules of politics, just not in a way that advantages his authority. We are accustomed to party leaders rebuking juniors who get out of line. In this brave new world, members of the shadow cabinet slap down their leader. In the past seven days they have contradicted him over welfare policy, tax policy, defence and Ireland. The most importance consequence of the Labour leader\u2019s isolation within his own top team has been the way in which they have successfully corralled him over Europe. He had previously refused to rule out campaigning for withdrawal from the EU on the grounds that it has been hijacked by an austerity agenda and the Tories are going to sell out workers\u2019 rights. That position began to crumble 72 hours into his leadership when he had to bow to overwhelming opinion in his parliamentary party by releasing a statement saying that, whatever David Cameron does or does not come back with from his renegotiation, Labour will definitely advocate remaining inside the European Union. This is good news for the pro-EU cause, because a hostile or ambivalent Labour party would have made it much harder to secure an affirmatory vote in the referendum. It is not such good news for Mr Corbyn to have been so substantially reversed so early in his leadership, much the most significant U-turn of the week. So much for not being a creature of compromise and pragmatism. Or maybe I am guilty of old think. In the new politics, perhaps it is not a problem if members of his team are free to countermand their leader. There is no doubt many people are turned off by politics when they sense that its practitioners are automatons robotically reading out lines and pretending to agree when they don\u2019t. I get as irritated by that as anyone else. The trouble is this. Collective responsibility is the pompous official term for speaking with one voice. The convention that a cabinet can\u2019t be openly divided was introduced for a reason. The reason was and remains that a government can\u2019t formulate and execute coherent policy and the public can\u2019t have trust in a government\u2019s intentions if ministers spend every day flatly contradicting one another. That rule extends to the opposition too if it wants the public to take it seriously as a government in waiting. For the moment, the spectacle of a leader and his top team agreeing to disagree on a host of critical issues at least has the merit of being unusual. It is the price Mr Corbyn is being forced to pay to avoid an immediate civil war with his MPs. It can\u2019t be sustainable. There will be a crunch point between leader and parliamentary party. Then things will get really interesting."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
