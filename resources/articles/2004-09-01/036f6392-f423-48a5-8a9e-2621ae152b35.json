There are just a few months left for that optimistic prophecy to be fulfilled, if women are not to remain, in effect, second-class priests. Among dissenters and nonconformists, things have been different. In the United States, the Congregationalists ordained Antoinette Brown as a minister in 1853, while the Universalists ordained Olympia Brown in 1863. In Australia, Martha Turner was appointed minister to the Melbourne Unitarian church in 1873, and, in Scotland, the Glasgow Universalists ordained Caroline Soule in 1880. In England, the acceptance of women ministers came later, and it was not until September 29 1904 that Gertrude von Petzold was inducted into the ministry of Narborough road Free Christian (Unitarian) church, Leicester. The centenary of her achievement is surely worthy of remark and, among Unitarians at least, celebration. Von Petzold trained as a teacher in Germany, but it was at St Andrews and Edinburgh universities that she took her degrees, before going to Manchester College, Oxford, where, in 1901, she became the first woman to train for the ministry in England. Male students at first refused to have her sitting at the refectory table with them. After qualifying in 1904, she received a unanimous invitation from the Leicester church's 150 members, despite being in competition with seven male candidates. At her induction, it was remarked that every Sunday some 100,000 sermons were preached by men, so there should surely be room for the \"delicacy and peculiarity in the ethical note struck by women\". In 1907, Von Petzold spent two years in the US, allying herself with the Iowa Sisterhood, an association of radi cal Unitarian women ministers. By this time, every Unitarian congregation in Iowa but one had been served by a woman minister. In her second English ministry - at Small Heath, Birmingham - she attracted large congregations. But she had allowed her application for naturalisation to lapse, and was repatriated to Germany in 1915. Later, she became minister of the only two free churches in her native East Prussia, before taking a PhD and becoming professor of English at Frankfurt University, the first woman to achieve this status in Germany. By 1927, seven more women had qualified as Unitarian ministers at Manchester College, and, by the late 1930s, the Unitarian College in Manchester, too, was accepting women for ministerial training. There was also a trickle of women ministers coming through from the Baptists and the Congregationalists, though, surprisingly, the Methodists still rejected the ordination of women. A hugely successful conference, The Opening of the Ministry of Religion to Women, was held at All Souls' Unitarian church, Golders Green, north London. Organised by the secretary of the Union of Women Voters, Joyce Daplyn, a Unitarian ordained in 1926, it was attended by all the existing women ministers in Britain, and spawned the Fellowship of Women Ministers. Daplyn argued that there were aspects of ministry for which a woman might be particularly suited, and that marriage and maternity might well deepen her understanding and sympathies. Women in nonconformist churches do not have to suffer the pains of episcopal aspiration, but when it comes to attaining positions of leadership, their progress has hardly been meteoric. For instance, though the Unitarians boasted a woman lay president, Mrs Sydney Martineau, in 1929 - the earliest such appointment of any denomination - it was not until 2002 that a woman minister, the Rev Ann Peart, was appointed principal of a Unitarian training college. \u00b7 The Rev Keith Gilley is a former president of the Unitarian general assembly and author of the entry on Gertrude von Petzold in the New Dictionary Of National Biography"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
