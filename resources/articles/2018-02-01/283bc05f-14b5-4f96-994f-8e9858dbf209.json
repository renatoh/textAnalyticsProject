Winning a cup final would be a great step forward, it would be good to get a trophy under our belts and then go back to trying to make sure we win the league.\u201d Laporte talks as if he has been picking up medals and topping league tables all his life, when in fact his achievements to date have been relatively modest, though if selected this will be his second final after the Copa del Rey defeat by Barcelona in 2015. While Athletic Bilbao subsequently won the Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a over two legs and have made some progress in Europe in recent years they have hardly been at the forefront of La Liga, while in international terms Laporte is still waiting to make the step up from France Under-21s to the senior side. Yet being only the second Frenchman to play for Bilbao (after Bixente Lizarazu) must endow a player with a certain level of confidence, as must being given a La Liga debut at the age of 18 by a coach as revered as Marcelo Bielsa. And while City have not forked out quite as much as Manchester United or Liverpool on individual players this season, the fact remains that buying out Bilbao\u2019s release clause of \u00a357m made Laporte the most expensive of Pep Guardiola\u2019s signings so far. Even before the transfer happened, the knowledge that Guardiola was keen to bring him to England was an affirmation that a player who left France for Spanish football at the tender age of 15 had learned his trade well. \u201cI wanted to join City mainly because of the mister,\u201d Laporte confirms, using the term of respect for coach or manager still common in many Latin countries. \u201cI have already learned a lot from Pep in the short time I\u2019ve been here. He\u2019s such an influential figure in the world of football. Then I looked at the team he has and there are so many young players at a similar age to myself, and that was a major factor in my thinking.\u201d Bielsa is an influential figure in football management, too. Not nearly as successful as Guardiola though quite a bit more colourful, the Argentinian known mostly with affection as El Loco has a reputation similarly based on original thinking and unwillingness to compromise. Not many people have played for both coaches, so Laporte is receiving a first-class education. \u201cThe two of them just know so much about the game,\u201d he says. \u201cThey are different personalities and managers but in terms of learning and training I couldn\u2019t ask for better. The learning process is amazing. Bielsa certainly had his own methods, he brought us all laptops and showed us videos of where to be on the pitch in terms of position. They were strange little things but they were why we learned a lot very quickly. We had a fantastic first season under him but it was a lot harder the second time around. \u201cPep uses a different method. He doesn\u2019t bring laptops out on to the training pitch but his instructions are just as valid.\u201d Laporte is from Agen, a rugby playing town. In fact, his father used to play rugby in the French second division. \u201cI never took it up,\u201d he explains. \u201cI\u2019ve spent my whole life playing football. My father didn\u2019t want me to play rugby because he felt it was very hard on the body, so at school I was encouraged to play football and that\u2019s where everything started. I began as a striker then became a holding midfielder and now I\u2019m a centre-half. I\u2019ve done everything except play in goal.\u201d Scouted early by Bilbao, Laporte had to spend a season parked under agreement at Bayonne, because he was too young at the time to be allowed to leave France. \u201cI was always clear in my mind what I wanted to do,\u201d he says. \u201cBecoming a footballer is a dream that is unattainable for most people. We were told that out of maybe a thousand kids only one would make it as a player, but I worked hard and kept fighting for my dream. There were sacrifices involved, I was very young when I left home and I missed my family and friends, but looking back from where I am now it was worth it. When I was 11 I went to a sports school about an hour from home and stayed there during the week, only going home at weekends. That was hard but it prepared me before I left for Bilbao, it made me stronger.\u201d Guardiola evidently judged Laporte sufficiently well-prepared to go straight into the first team, though neither of them seemed quite ready for the intensity a League One side would bring to the task of eliminating the runaway Premier League leaders from the FA Cup. Laporte\u2019s third game in England was a stark reminder that, unlike the previous two against West Brom and Leicester, not every contest will resemble a procession with City at the head. \u201cPeople have told me that City have a terrible record against Wigan in the Cup, and I can see we have been knocked out three times in the last six seasons,\u201d he says. \u201cThe truth is we had a very bad night. We had been in great form and the objectives were clear as we knew they would play for their lives and give us a difficult match. \u201cEven when we had a man sent off we were still dominating, but just one mistake cost us the game. We now have to get over that. As I said before we are a young team, and if we can use the next game to win a trophy it would definitely help our development. It is clear that winning trophies increases everyone\u2019s confidence, but we must not make the mistake of taking our opponents for granted. Arsenal have some great players and they have just made some excellent signings. They are a dangerous team.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
