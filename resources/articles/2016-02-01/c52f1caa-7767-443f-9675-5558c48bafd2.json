But 114 years after his death, Cecil Rhodes is fast becoming a symbol for the emerging decolonisation movement \u2013 something with a lot of relevance to our country. The past few months have witnessed an increasingly prominent campaign to think about Rhodes more critically, sparked by the Rhodes Must Fall (RMF) campaign at the University of Cape Town. RMF has now come to Oxford, where it recently secured a commitment from Oriel College to remove a plaque attached to a statue of Rhodes. However, the campaign has become a punching bag for the British media, with many commentators deriding it as \u201cpetulant\u201d and \u201cpolitical correctness gone mad\u201d . Now the Australian media is taking up a similar line. In the January 16-17 Weekend Tasmanian, Charles Wooley included a few sensationalist paragraphs about RMF, referring to it as an \u201cacademic Taliban\u201d. Two weeks earlier, the Australian published a critique of the campaign featuring a misleadingly positive spin on Rhodes\u2019 life . Rhodes scholar and former prime minister Tony Abbott has also weighed in, calling the campaign an expression of \u201cmoral vanity\u201d and claiming that Rhodes was just a man of the times. Amid all this, it is important to remember that even by the standards of 19th century colonialism, Rhodes was considered too bloodthirsty and dogmatic in his belief of British supremacy . As premier of the Cape colony, Rhodes masterminded the infamous Jameson raid, an attack on Afrikaners based in the Transvaal that became a military disaster and led to \u201can unbroken sequence of evil\u201d . He established the British South Africa Company\u2019s police, a private army implicated in the deaths of thousands, violently annexed land, and reintroduced the torture of black workers into law. The Guardian\u2019s own obituary for Rhodes, published in 1902, describes him as an unscrupulous \u201cwrecker\u201d of South African development . I learned about Rhodes\u2019 crimes when I decided to apply for the scholarship in 2013. I wondered how I could justify taking his money, if I was lucky enough to get the scholarship. Then I read an article by Rhodes scholar Nanjala Nyabola. She argued that for her, taking Rhodes\u2019 money was a way of defying the \u201cgodfather of apartheid\u201d because he never intended people like her to go to Oxford on the back of his ill-gotten wealth. Unlike Nanjala, in many ways I\u2019m exactly who Rhodes intended the scholarship to go to: white, male, and middle class. However, my goal was to use the scholarship to study international development and be part of the fight against the devastating ongoing effects of colonialism. This fits well with the new direction of the Rhodes scholarships. To use the words of \u201cRedress Rhodes\u201d \u2013 a group of past and current scholars \u2013 the scholarship has been reshaped to be \u201cmore inclusive, representative, and encouraging of advocates of social justice than it was at its inception\u201d. I took the money because I believe in that vision. I\u2019ve never talked about racism, sexism, and other forms of overt and structural discrimination as much as I have in Oxford over the past 18 months. Campaigns like RMF encourage everyone to think about these issues, which might otherwise go unnoticed for people like me. The goal is not to \u201cwhitewash history\u201d, shut down critical debate, tear down a few colonial statues, or make white people feel guilty, as critics of RMF have suggested. For my black and ethnic minority friends, it\u2019s about acknowledgement that their experience of everyday life in Oxford is very different to mine due to the prevalence of \u201ccasual\u201d racism. It\u2019s about the lack of scholars from diverse backgrounds on many Oxford course reading lists. And it\u2019s about the fact that this institution has only relatively recently opened itself to a more diverse range of students. For me \u2013 as a white, middleclass, male \u2013 it\u2019s about trying to understand what my friends are experiencing, instead of just saying \u201cI\u2019m not racist, so what\u2019s the problem?\u201d It\u2019s not about sympathy, but respect for their achievements and a commitment to be more aware of the privilege conferred by my own colour and gender. The whole debate in Oxford has been eye-opening and useful, but it makes me wonder why we aren\u2019t having similar conversations in Australia. The foundations for this are present: there\u2019s been some discussion of decolonisation ; Stan Grant has been eloquently questioning the inclusiveness of Australia Day and the Aussie identity; the Adam Goodes saga brought underlying currents of racism to the surface; and the reconciliation movement has a strong tradition of encouraging discussion of Australia\u2019s colonial history. But we\u2019ve also seen backwards steps, such the call for a greater focus on Australia\u2019s \u201cJudeo-Christian\u201d heritage in the national curriculum. We haven\u2019t reached a mature level of debate that adequately acknowledges past wrongs and the role that privilege plays in our society. Australia needs its own version of RMF. We need to start thinking more critically about Rhodes himself, because even though he operated half a world away, he\u2019s had a big impact on Australia: four of our previous eight prime ministers have studied in Oxford under his name. The defensive, knee-jerk reaction to RMF in the Australian media shows that this conversation has a long way to go. More importantly, we need to encourage a new generation of young Australians to understand the darker elements of our history, such as the colonial era atrocities against Indigenous Australians. We also need to be looking for positive solutions to the structural racism that still exists in Australian society, and encouraging our government to be bold in taking on these challenges. The health gap between Indigenous Australians and the rest of the population, the lack of minority representation in parliaments across the country, and the racist undertones of the recent border force farce are just a few examples. Addressing these issues needs frank, honest, and mature debate. RMF is a tricky campaign to engage with for someone like me. It\u2019s easy to slip into feeling like you\u2019re the target; that anything you say might offend someone; that you don\u2019t have a right to have an opinion on these issues; that I might be accused of whitesplaining. But just because these are difficult issues doesn\u2019t mean we should avoid them. On the contrary, this is a conversation Australia needs to have."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
