Their players trained with surf lifesavers in Sydney \u2013 a couple of the forwards also causing an alarm by taking a swim in an area where sharks had been sighted \u2013 before taking on Russell Crowe's Rabbitohs at the Redfern Oval, and once they'd returned Lee Briers, the club's talisman and record pointscorer, was dropped from last Sunday's opening match at Hull for disciplinary reasons. Briers is back in the squad for their first home game against London Broncos, and the Wolves will hope that after they scrambled a draw at Hull, that signals a return to something closer to the form with which they finished top of the table in 2011. However they are painfully aware that form in February \u2013 or even August \u2013 counts for nothing in the Super League. After finishing 13 points ahead of Leeds in the final league table, their dreams of a first Grand Final appearance at Old Trafford were shattered by a dramatic 26-24 home defeat by the Rhinos in the play-offs last September. That is why Tony Smith, the Warrington coach, could afford to be relatively relaxed about Briers's unspecified indiscretion, and dropping a point at Hull. Returning from the Sydney summer so close to the traditionally icy start of the Super League season was also an acceptable risk, as Smith and the Wolves play the long game. Joel Monaghan will return on the wing against the Broncos, after missing the Hull game through injury, but the experienced full-back Brett Hodgson remains several weeks away from a full recovery from the ankle ligament damage he suffered in that Leeds defeat. \"No team is right on their game at this time of year,\" said Smith. \"In the first few rounds anything can happen.\" Harlequins, as London's Super League club were known this time last year, had proved that when they last came to Warrington by winning four of their first five matches, including notable victories at Leeds and St Helens. However that promising start to the season was brought to the rudest possible halt with an 82-6 humiliation by the Wolves. \"That was my worst day in rugby league,\" Tony Clubb, the Gravesend-born former England centre reflected this week. Clubb will return to the Halliwell Jones Stadium as a prop, having agreed to use his bulk in a more central role this season. Warrington have noted that as one of many changes that should make the Broncos much more competitive this year than Quins were last. But Garreth Carvell, who was at prop for England when Clubb scored four tries on his first and only international appearance, against Papua New Guinea in the 2010 Four Nations series, provided a colourful description of the difficulties involved in switching from the backs to the pack. \"The major change is the defensive bit,\" he said. \"Out in the centres you have to think and make a decision. If you get that wrong there could be a try, whereas in the middle you are basically in the washing machine, getting tumbled over and over.\" For the Broncos, after a promising first performance in a narrow home defeat by St Helens, this will be another stiff test of their ability to cope with one of Super League's most rapid spins. The other three Sunday fixtures are all in Yorkshire, where Castleford, Huddersfield and Wakefield Trinity each have home advantage over Bradford, Widnes and Hull KR respectively as they aim to build on encouraging opening round wins."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
