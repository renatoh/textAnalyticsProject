Nor are we likely to overcome the divides facing our country by accident \u2013 we have to unify it. But when it comes to ensuring that Britain works for all generations, young and old, as a society we too often leave it to chance, something families would never do. The give and take of the generational contract, in which we support young and old, feels like the natural order of things. Contributing when we can and being looked after when in need is what we do every day as 14 million parents bring up their children. And just as that contract underpins our families, it has long underpinned our society and welfare state. But this intergenerational contract is under pressure. We are already failing to provide the social care our older generations deserve, need and expect. And this is before the real pressures, and a \u00a324bn bill, from delivering on our health and care obligations in an ageing society arrive in the next decade. Solution after solution has been panned, binned or pushed into the long grass by government after government. Young people bore the brunt of the financial crisis. Everyone\u2019s earnings have taken a hit in recent years, but young people\u2019s pay packets were hit hardest of all. We have worked hard to avoid the high youth unemployment that characterised previous recessions, but new challenges have emerged, with one in 12 young workers currently on zero-hours contracts. Younger generations know they are paying the price of decades of failure on housing. Increasing numbers are bringing up children while privately renting a home, lacking the security to be sure they will call it their own in the years to come. They are paying more for less, with millennials spending a quarter of their income to live in smaller homes , with longer commutes. Families are responding to these new challenges: 6.5 million of us care for an elderly relative, and the bank of mum and dad is playing a growing role in helping young adults become homeowners. But collectively, as a society and through the state, we have not risen to the challenge of renewing our generational contract. But we must. The need to renew our intergenerational contract is clear and urgent, but doing so is far from easy. It requires new thinking and tough trade-offs \u2013 from how we deal with the fiscal pressures of an ageing society in a way that is generationally fair, to how we deliver the housing young people need while respecting the communities everyone values. And the politics are far from straightforward. Renewal should involve an agenda appealing to all generations, but voters\u2019 party preferences have never been so starkly divided by age. This state of affairs \u2013 with the Conservatives reliant on older people who are most likely to vote, and Labour sitting on a lead amongst younger generations who represent the future of British elections \u2013 is not desirable for the parties themselves or our country as a whole. We need our political leaders to rise to this challenge with an appeal to all generations. It can be done, as the forthcoming final report of the Intergenerational Commission will lay out. We can deliver the health and care older generations deserve, without simply asking younger workers to bear all the costs. We can do more to promote education and skills, especially for those who have not chosen on the university route. We can provide more security for young people, from the jobs they do to the homes they rent. And we can show younger generations that owning a home is a reality not a distant prospect in 21st-century Britain. Such an appeal across generations is the route to building a better Britain \u2013 and a more united one, too.
