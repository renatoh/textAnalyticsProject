Just kidding. It only took a few minutes for Donald Trump\u2019s Oval Office meeting with the top Democrats Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer on Tuesday to descend into the equivalent of a custard pie fight from a Laurel and Hardy comedy. And silently watching the bizarre, acrimonious scene was Vice-President Mike Pence. Seldom has anyone tried so actively \u2013 and successfully \u2013 to appear a passive blank space. With TV cameras rolling, Trump began with a monologue that riffed on the importance of border security and building a wall along the border with Mexico. \u201cI think the American people recognise that we must keep government open, that a shutdown is not worth anything,\u201d said Pelosi, the House minority leader, as Trump nodded. \u201cAnd that we should not have a Trump shutdown.\u201d The president leaned in. \u201cA what? Did you say a Trump \u2013 ?\u201d He turned and muttered to Schumer. The first pie had been thrown and the formality of a photo op had been dropped. Pelosi and Trump began to spar over who has the votes. Perched on a sofa, Pelosi interjected: \u201cI don\u2019t think we should have a debate in front of the press.\u201d She had forgotten that her opponent is running a reality TV presidency that thrives on conflict and drama. As they continued to bicker over whether to put a vote on the wall to the House and Senate, Trump claimed improbably: \u201cWe\u2019re doing this in a very friendly manner.\u201d Pelosi managed to grin and grimace simultaneously. Pence maintained his silence. Increasingly irate, Trump insisted: \u201cNancy, Nancy, we need border security. It\u2019s very simple. We need border security. People are pouring into our country, including terrorists \u2026 Chuck, did you want to say something?\u201d Was Schumer going to calm everyone down? He was not. \u201cThe Washington Post today was going to give you four Pinocchios because they say you constantly misstate how much of the wall is built.\u201d It was a red rag to a bull. Trump muttered, \u201cWashington Post!\u201d and gave a cynical chuckle. As tempers frayed, Schumer pressed on, saying there was a proposal on the table that Republicans and Democrats would support. It was a rude awakening for Trump, who since the presidential debates of 2016 has been surrounded by loyalists and praise singers who seldom challenge him. Waving his hands, the president said: \u201cWe need border security. I think we all agree that we need border security?\u201d Schumer agreed. Trump addressed the cameras: \u201cSee, we get along!\u201d Call for Pinocchio. That might have been the end but then reporters asked questions. Trump claimed: \u201cYou can\u2019t have very good border security without the wall.\u201d Pelosi interrupted: \u201cThat is not true.\u201d Schumer interrupted her to say a wall is wasteful and doesn\u2019t solve the problem. Trump interrupted him to say it does. Pelosi observed: \u201cUnfortunately, this has spiralled downward.\u201d And so it spiralled. Pelosi noted the Republicans lost the House. Trump boasted that they won the Senate. Schumer commented slyly: \u201cWhen the president brags that he won North Dakota and Indiana, he\u2019s in real trouble.\u201d Pelosi came up with a revolutionary idea: \u201can evidence-based conversation\u201d. But just as she appeared to be cooling the temperature, Schumer and Trump traded verbal blows like New Yorkers rowing over a taxi. It pushed Trump to say something he \u2013 or Republicans \u2013 may regret: \u201cI am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don\u2019t want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country. So I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I\u2019m not going to blame you for it.\u201d Finally, it was over. Pence remained motionless. But a strange, beatific smile played on his lips. Until that moment the bust of Winston Churchill, glowering over Trump\u2019s shoulder, had been much more expressive than the vice-president. Pelosi, however, let the world know exactly what she thought. Later she let off steam to Democratic colleagues on Capitol Hill. According to an aide in the room interviewed by the Associated Press, Pelosi said: \u201cIt\u2019s like a manhood thing for him. As if manhood could ever be associated with him. This wall thing.\u201d The likely future speaker added: \u201cIt goes to show you: you get into a tickle contest with a skunk, you get tinkle all over you.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
