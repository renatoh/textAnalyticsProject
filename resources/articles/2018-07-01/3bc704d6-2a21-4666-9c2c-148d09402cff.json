Other women from regional parts of Queensland, where abortion remains a criminal offence under the 1899 criminal code, have taken round trips of up to 2,600km to undergo procedures, health professionals and support workers have told Guardian Australia. The state cabinet will on Monday be handed a report by the Queensland Law Reform Commission, which has been asked to modernise the laws. Guardian Australia understands the reform package that will be considered by the cabinet would remove abortion from the criminal code entirely. It would make abortions legal to 22 weeks, and thereafter legal with the approval of doctors, similar to legislation passed in Victoria in 2008. Safe access zones would restrict protests near abortion clinics. But specialists and pro-choice groups have warned that law reform must be followed by an overhaul of the state\u2019s health system to ensure doctors have proper training and experience, and that women will be able to access procedures without enduring hardship. \u2018Young and terrified\u2019 Caroline de Costa, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at James Cook University, said the public health service in Cairns, Australia\u2019s 14th largest city, would not provide surgical abortions. The story is similar across the state. There is only one regularly operating surgical termination clinic north of the urban south-east of Queensland, in Rockhampton. De Costa said 60 women, \u201csome of them young and terrified\u201d, had been sent away from Cairns, mostly interstate, for procedures. \u201c[Public hospitals] can provide them, they in a sense choose not to and the law is a part of the reason. They cannot provide what is openly abortion on demand but we have a sexual health clinic here ... They have been excellent at providing medical abortion [through medication]. It\u2019s funded by Queensland Health and it takes part in another building so the administration doesn\u2019t have to see what\u2019s going on. \u201cThere are some excellent guidelines written by Queensland Health. But each time they\u2019re couched [as]: \u2018You must be within the law.\u2019 Queensland Health administrations and doctors have been able to use this and say: \u2018Well, this is not legal.\u2019\u201d De Costa said trainee and junior doctors who gained practical experience, or were employed in the public health system, often had not had exposure to women requiring an abortion. \u201cOur registrars, our trainees do not go to the sexual health clinic, that\u2019s not part of their training. They don\u2019t actually meet a woman who is requesting a surgical abortion or a medical abortion. They would have to learn about it theoretically.\u201d The Queensland health minister, Steven Miles, said the government is aware of \u201cissues surrounding access to terminations in the Cairns region\u201d and has held discussions with a private business about establishing a local clinic. \u201cHealth providers, including public hospitals in Queensland, provide women with access to therapeutic termination of pregnancy (in circumstances of medical necessity). If a service is unavailable at a specific hospital \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 but is required by a patient, it will be provided within the Queensland public health system.\u201d \u2018We\u2019re talking about really vulnerable women\u2019 The all-options family counselling, information and referral service, Children by Choice, has functioned in Queensland as a sort of traffic controller, attempting to connect women to services in a range of often difficult circumstances. That sometimes requires funding for women experiencing financial hardship, negotiating dangerous domestic violence situations and arranging long-distance travel. The service\u2019s manager, Daile Kelleher, said the average distance for people in south-east Queensland to travel for a procedure is 41km. Outside of the urban areas, it is five times that. Kelleher said one woman travelled 1,300km each way. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about really vulnerable women,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you\u2019re in a domestically violent relationship, you cannot travel that sort of distance. If you\u2019ve got people in your care you can\u2019t travel that sort of distance. \u201cSometimes the vulnerable women are in a casualised workforce, or in situations where they can\u2019t tell their employer they need time off to get an abortion. If they take time off, they might lose their job. \u201cI think because of the stigma attached to abortion in society, but also because of the legal situation, it also means there\u2019s a lot of secrecy in the industry and in the health sector, in terms of providing information to people. \u201cWomen are getting blocked by doctors who don\u2019t want to touch abortion because the legislation is so murky. So many times we\u2019ve heard that women are getting the runaround because their GP or the local hospital won\u2019t help them. De Costa said the women who do go to great lengths to access services would be \u201cthe top bit of the iceberg\u201d. \u201cThere would be many women who could have gone who haven\u2019t,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are women who should have had a surgical abortion because it\u2019s the safest thing for them, but don\u2019t.\u201d The political flashpoint The law reform debate remains a likely flashpoint in a state that retains many socially conservative pockets, including among rusted-on supporters of the Labor government. Anti-abortion groups have already increased their presence and are employing aggressive tactics outside abortion clinics. In 2016, the independent MP Rob Pyne attempted to introduce a reform bill that was rejected after a parliamentary inquiry. The push caused some internal problems for the Palaszczuk government, whose left wing at one point considered publicly shaming colleagues who opposed law reform. It is understood the government\u2019s bill would be subject to a conscience vote and that some Labor MPs, including those who represent working-class regional areas, will oppose it. Given Labor\u2019s thin majority, the government will likely need support from Liberal National party MPs to pass the bill. There remains some concern that strong laws could discourage support from MPs who might have personal concerns. Some parts of the legislation are likely to be contentious. Conservative MPs who might otherwise support the bill are understood to prefer a 16-week term limit before a woman requires the consent of two doctors. The proposal to the state cabinet is understood to be 22 weeks, which is short of the 24 weeks allowed in Victoria. Rules allowing doctors to object on moral grounds are also likely to be controversial. In 2016 the entire obstetrics and gynaecology department at Logan hospital, south of Brisbane, demanded any laws should allow doctors to refuse to provide procedures. Kelleher said the laws needed to ensure that conscientious objectors were required to refer women to doctors who would perform procedures."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
