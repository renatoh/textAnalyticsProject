Shave the rough off every course in the world. This is an idea that would appeal to most golfers, who rightly judge the game to be more about enjoyment than punishment, but it would induce horror among the gentlemen of the United States Golf Association. They, for reasons perhaps best known to their psychiatrists, have long held the view that golf is as much about inflicting pain as it is about breaking par. This curious predisposition is never more apparent than at the US Open, where the tournament organisers have taken more interest in seeing the best players suffer rather than, to use the phrase beloved by their counterparts on the other side of the Atlantic, the R&amp;A, identifying the champion golfer of the year. While the gentlemen at St Andrews care little if the Open Championship is won with a score of 18 under par, as it was when Tiger Woods won at Royal Liverpool last year, the USGA takes it as an affront if par is breached after 72 holes of a US Open. \"We have no target score for the US Open,\" Jim Hyler, the chairman of the USGA's championship committee, said yesterday amid much eye-rolling from the assembled media. \"In fact, it is never discussed. We are going to set up the course to be hard and fair, and whatever it turns out to be is just what it turns out to be.\" Talk, as the old chestnut almost has it, is cheaper than a third-hand mashie niblick with a rusty shaft. Action is another thing altogether, and the USGA's actions in setting up Oakmont for the next four days suggest it will be business as usual. The course is lathered in rough, so much so that Phil Mickelson injured his wrist hitting balls out of the thick stuff when he came to practise here three weeks ago - an injury he is still carrying and one that has spoiled the chances of the anticipated showdown between the American left-hander and Woods. So much for giving the paying public what they want. Likewise, the fairways are hard and the greens, widely reckoned to be the fastest in America, are trickier than a meeting of the Magic Circle. Paul Casey stepped off the 18th green after his practice round yesterday and said he had won a bet with Sergio Garcia's father, Victor, for matching the par of 70. Four of those between today and Sunday and the Englishman will be leaving Pittsburgh with more than Garcia senior's cash. Casey's effort was to be admired but the difficulty is stringing four such rounds together. The reality is, barring a performance for the ages or the arrival of tropical storms to soften the course, that Sunday's winner will be over par. How much over par depends on the charity of Mr Hyler and his ilk. The irony, as Ogilvy correctly identified, is that Oakmont has no need for the USGA's misplaced machismo. Johnny Miller, who won a US Open here in 1973 by shooting a final round of 63, was stretching it a little on Tuesday when he called the course the greatest in the world, but not by much. It is a magnificent test, demanding precise ball-striking, courageous putting and, above all else, clear thinking. This is not the place for a golfer who steps on to the tee with nothing on his mind other than to smash his ball as hard and far as he can. At 7,230 yards, the course is not long by modern standards and with the fairways running it will play shorter than even that. Physically it bears little resemblance to Royal Liverpool last summer, but it will ask many of the same questions. Most likely it will also produce the same answer. In short, this is Woods' tournament to lose. The weakest element of the world No1's game is his driving but he will be required to use the longest club in the bag on only a handful of occasions, and has proved on countless occasions already that he can out-think and outplay anyone from the middle of the fairway. Good manners and personal pride means Woods would never admit as much in public but Mickelson's injury problems will also have bolstered his hopes. The world No2, buoyed by his recent work with his new coach, Butch Harmon, was beginning to look like a genuine long-term threat to Woods' dominance of the golfing landscape. As for the other challengers, there are a few knowledgeable observers - not to mention countless members of the gallery - who have a fondness for the local man, Jim Furyk, who is accurate enough and brave enough to cope with anything Oakmont throws up. European hopes, meanwhile, rest largely on the likes of Luke Donald and Justin Rose, both of whom have the type of game suited to an US Open-type course."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
