And now I have another: two (the amount of large laundry bags needed to contain every single thing I own). \u201cShouldn\u2019t I have more things?\u201d I wonder, rolling through the reasons why I don\u2019t (budget, space, a preference for experiences over physical items). But the truth is much simpler: I think most objects are ugly. All items tell a story and I want mine to tell me something beautiful \u2013 like that of a craftsperson magnificently expressing their era through design, instead of the usual \u201ccorporate fat cat makes crap you don\u2019t need, at a price possible only through exploitation\u201d. Perhaps, though, I expect too much from my eggcups. \u201cMaybe pontificating over the grand narrative of every item is indulgent,\u201d I mutter to myself, as I empty the carrier bag I\u2019m using as a kitchen bin into the communal rubbish, because I have not yet found a bin to buy that makes me feel something. The beauty of a home is rarely from its beautiful objects; rather it\u2019s from the memories shared within it, and the restful shelter it provides from the bitter and cold winds of life. So I finally accept that a washing-up bowl needn\u2019t be beautiful, that it should move a person to tears only from being too full. After all, a home is not what it looks like, but what you do in it. And perhaps that should no longer involve ferrying plastic bags down to the communal bins."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
