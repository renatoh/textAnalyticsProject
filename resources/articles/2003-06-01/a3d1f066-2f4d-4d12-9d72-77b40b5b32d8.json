Pakistan 1 Imran Nazir, 2 Mohammad Hafeez, 3 Yasir Hamed, 4 Yousuf Youhana, 5 Younis Khan, 6 Shoaib Malik, 7 Rashid Latif (capt, wk), 8 Azhar Mahmood, 9 Abdul Razzaq, 10 Mohammad Sami, 11 Shoaib Akhtar. 10.30am Pakistan have won the toss and will bat. It's a lovely, warm day in south London, and it's not too bad in north London either. There's a conspicuous silence on the email front so far. Where are you? 10.35am Michael Vaughan reckons the ball might swing a bit this morning, so - according to him - it could be a good toss to lose. Hmm. We have an email! \"England have never had a great team that didn't include at least one player with some form of facial hair,\" points out Ben Mimmack. \"I don't think any of the new lot have any whiskers. David Graveney needs to get on top of the situation.\" Good spot, Ben. And I guess you can't count Graveney himself. Even Goochie is sans tache these days... 10.44am Right, we're about to start. I'd say 'come on England', but that would be a little too partial for some people's tastes. Richard Scarth has a problem. \"Can any of your readers suggest suitable and successful methods for ball-tampering,\" he asks. \"I tried a Coke bottle-top at the weekend, and yet three successive leg-stump half-volleys still disappeared through square leg for four.\" Now I don't usually approve of this kind of thing (unless the opposition are 200 for 2), but I'm willing to let it go just this once. Have you ever tried vaseline, Richard? WICKET! Imran Nazir lbw b Anderson 0 (0-1) What a start! Nazir plays round Anderson's first ball and umpire Mallender has no hesitation upholding Anderson's appeal. That was pretty plumb, although Nazir looks aggrieved. First blood to England! \"In response to Ben's point,\" writes Fraser Smith, \"doesn't young Jimmy Anderson have a wispy top lip, partly covered chin combo these days? If I remember rightly, it was unacceptable at school but in the light of a certain Mr Beckham's facial foliage, these sins seem to be being forgiven.\" Good spot, Fraser. 1st over: Pakistan 4-1 (Mohammad Hafeez 0, Yasir Hamed 4) A potential wicket maiden is ruined by a lovely square drive by Hamed, who leans on Anderson's final delivery to send it racing behind point for four. A frenetic start, and the ground's still filling up. \"It will be 2-0 to Pakistan come 4.45pm this afternoon,\" writes Ayub Khan, presumably before Anderson struck with the first delivery of the match. \"Just hope the yobs stay off the pitch today.\" That's no way to talk about Vaughan and Giles, Ayub. 2nd over: Pakistan 7-1 (Mohammad Hafeez 3, Yasir Hamed 4) On comes Darren Gough at the Pavilion End - he takes second over these days. His first ball is worked through midwicket for two by Hafeez, who then nibbles him to third man for a single. But that was a good first over from the old man. \"I was just wondering if you or any of the readers could help me,\" writes a frankly distressed Graham Brown. \"We are looking for somewhere in the Clerkenwell area to go for a drink at lunchtime - but it must have a beer garden and do food. So far we have only come up with 'that sort of swanky place on the corner on St Johns Road'. Any suggestions?\" Well? 3rd over: Pakistan 8-1 (Mohammad Hafeez 3, Yasir Hamed 4) Anderson has started much better than he did at Old Trafford, where his first three overs cost 26. He beats Hamed with a beauty that swings late and fizzes past the outside edge and concedes just a leg-bye in that over. One or two balls are verging on off-side wides, but umpire Mallender doesn't look too bothered. \"For ball-tampering I would suggest using the teeth of a passing ferret,\" says Tom Banks. \"Always does the trick for me.\" Prefer stoats myself, Tom. 4th over: Pakistan 16-1 (Mohammad Hafeez 4, Yasir Hamed 10) That was a dreamy shot from Hamed, who is all left elbow as he pushes Gough straight down the grounrd for four. It was a no-ball too. Vaughan began the over with a 7-2 off-side field, but a couple through the vacant square-leg region persuaded him to plug the gap. This ball-tampering debate seems to have inspired strong feelings. Here's Andrew Goldsby. \"Well, we can rule out keeping a pocket full of dirt and rubbing that in occasionally,\" he scoffs. \"As a former England captain pointed out that does absolutely nothing at all. Especially when you're caught doing it.\" Bit early for cynicism, isn't it, Andrew? 5th over: Pakistan 17-1 (Mohammad Hafeez 5, Yasir Hamed 10) Vaughan keeps his 7-2 field for Anderson, which says a lot about the faith he has in him. Anderson responds well, sticking to off stump and outside and giving away just a single there. His figures now read 3-1-5-1. Here's Greg Hensman. \"If you can manage to surreptitiously cover half the ball in electrical tape while in the field (ensuring its removal before the opposition bowl, preferably), I've heard the swing will be comparable to Warnie's ball's movement to Fat Gatt all those years ago.\" Ok, Greg, but I'm going to have to be picky for a moment and say that Warne spins it, not swings it. But the point is a valid one. Tape is very handy indeed. 6th over: Pakistan 22-1 (Mohammad Hafeez 9, Yasir Hamed 10) Gough oversteps for the second time this morning, and an otherwise immaculate over is spoiled by a glorious extra-cover drive for four by Hafeez off the final ball as Gough overpitches. The rumour mill is in overdrive. \"Last weekend I was talking to a girl (woman) named Melissa who used to go to school with Dermot Reeve and his brother in Hong Kong,\" says Gareth Radford. \"Apparently his nickname was 'Dirty Dermot', I do have more dirt but I think it's quite libellous!\" We'll say no more about it then, Gareth. But feel free to email me in private and we can discuss the legality or otherwise of Melissa's allegations. 7th over: Pakistan 30-1 (Mohammad Hafeez 9, Yasir Hamed 18) Anderson bowls four dot balls to Hamed, then drops short and is pulled with power through midwicket for four. Great shot. The next ball is overpitched and Hamed punches Anderson through extra cover for another boundary. England are just releasing the pressure valve a little too often here. \"I was wondering what the readers think of Ireland as a cricket team following their win against Zimbabwe,\" asks Mark Mclaughlin. \"Are Ireland getting better or Zimbabwe the current cricket equivalent of Emile Heskey's goal-scoring record? Also, what is the process of getting Test status?\" You have to do more than beat Zimbabwe, Mark. And a few friends in high places also helps. 8th over: Pakistan 35-1 (Mohammad Hafeez 13, Yasir Hamed 18) On comes Flintoff for the slightly expensive Gough (3-0-16-0), but his first ball is tucked neatly through midwicket for four by Hafeez. His second ball is too wide of off stump for umpire Hair's liking, but the rest of the over is right on the spot. Height, bounce, back-of-a-length, angling in: it's not pretty, but Freddie does it very well. \"On the way home from an evening's drinking in Leicester Square on Wednesday,\" writes the inevitable Andrea Lowe, \"I bumped into, or rather, drunkenly accosted Jimmy Anderson, Rikki Clarke and Chris Read. I can therefore confirm that Anderson does indeed have wispy facial hair, although the other two didn't look old enough to be shaving yet. Still, having seen Steve Harmison's abortive attempt at a beard, I'm not sure facial hirsuteness is something to be encouraged in the current England team.\" 9th over: Pakistan 37-1 (Mohammad Hafeez 14, Yasir Hamed 19) Hafeez gets a life, as he did at Old Trafford. He tries to withdraw the bat from an Anderson delivery that bounces a bit, but gets an outside egde which flies in Flintoff's direction at second slip. He gets one hand to it to his right, but can't hold on. You'd expect Freddie to hold that nine times out of ten. Another very good over. \"Try the Crown on Clerkenwell Green,\" suggests Alex Fleetwood. \"It's more of a beer patio than a beer garden, and you'll have to fight your way through a scrum of media trendies to get to the bar on a Friday lunchtime, but the grub's not bad.\" Media trendies, Alex, near the Guardian? Surely not. WICKET! Mohammad Hafeez lbw b Flintoff 14 (37-2) Flintoff atones immediately for his drop, nipping one back into Hafeez's pads and pinning him smack in front. England are back on top. Just. \"May I suggest Graham Brown utilises www.fancyapint.com,\" writes Phil Staite. \"An invaluable tool for the London lush.\" 10th over: Pakistan 38-2 (Yasir Hamed 19, Yousuf Youhana 1) Youhana gets off the mark second ball with a singlke through square leg. But Freddie has settled into a nice groove after being hit for four first ball. Here's Dan Benson. \"New flatmate next door snores like a particularly sweaty Vietnamese pot-bellied hog after a rough night out in the sty. He has kept me awake for the last 10 days. I'm losing my mind, getting ill, bunking off work to catch up on sleep, and feel like a prisoner to my insomnia. Even these over-by-over reports don't raise the glowing smile that they used to. So what do I do? Confront your man (who's bit of a loner) with his incessant grunting and snorting problem or just continue my (unsuccessful, but quite enjoyable) Shock &amp; Awake tactics of chucking the cricket ball at his bedroom wall and (utterly unacceptable, I know...) ringing the phone in the hallway to wake the b*gger up... Help me.\" 11th over: Pakistan 38-2 (Yasir Hamed 19, Yousuf Youhana 1) Another very good over from Anderson, who bowls a maiden to Youhana, the man he yorked so memorably in that World Cup game at Cape Town. 12th over: Pakistan 38-2 (Yasir Hamed 19, Yousuf Youhana 1) It's Lancashire v Pakistan at the moment, and Lancashire are having the better of it. Flintoff beats Hamed outside off with an absolute brute that moves away and bounces - unplayable. Successive maidens from England. \"Wayne Larkins had the best facial hair ever sported by an England player,\" argues Richard Gardham, \"followed closely by Eddie Hemmings. Had Tim Curtis grown a tache he'd have scored around 2,000 more Test runs.\" This is getting out of hand. 13th over: Pakistan 40-2 (Yasir Hamed 19, Yousuf Youhana 3) This really is great stuff from Anderson, whose economy rate going into this game was a worrying 5.04. Just two off that over as Youhana works him into the gap at square leg. It looks like umpire Mallender isn't happy with Anderson's follow-through, though - he gets very close to the stumps. \"I've been informed you might be at a party I'm going to tonight in Tufnell Park,\" writes Mark Barrett. \"Am I your first stalker?\" Er, it depends how you define stalker, Mark. Actually, I won't be able to make it tonight. My colleague Dan Rookwood got in their first with an invtie to his bash at a trendy London venue whose name escapes me. But give Rob my regards. 14th over: Pakistan 46-2 (Yasir Hamed 24, Yousuf Youhana 4) Hamed flicks Flintoff's first ball behind square-leg for four - glorious shot. He times the next ball in the direction of mid-on, but an athletic tumbling stop from Ashley Giles (sic) prevents another boundary. Six off the over - the most expensive for a while. \"I work in the Clerkenwell area\" says Alex Booth, \"and can definitely recommend the Gunmakers which has a mock beer garden, and also the Clerkenwell House which, although lacking in a beer garden, does excellent food in a nice relaxed atmosphere.\" 15th over: Pakistan 50-2 (Yasir Hamed 25, Yousuf Youhana 6) Back comes Gough at the Vauxhall End, but he doesn't look entirely happy with life. His second ball is a leg-side wide, and the smile is missing - for the moment at least. Still, it's been a great effort by England to restrict Pakistan to 50 runs off the first 15 overs on a wicket like this. Mark Oliver writes with the latest news of an old friend of his. \"Steve Hayes (he of \"no bottle\" and the foul mouth) has decided that he'd rather work today than use his ticket to watch the cricket. He's also staying in tonight to prepare for a game tomorrow starting at 2pm. I'm betting he scores under 10.\" What's wrong with the boy? 16th over: Pakistan 53-2 (Yasir Hamed 26, Yousuf Youhana 8) More miserliness from Freddie, who concedes just three singles in that over. He really is hard to get away. \"I can support Melissa here as I've heard some interesting stories about Dermot misbehaving whilst in Portsmouth,\" says Tom Newman with a nudge and a wink. \"Although I don't know exactly how dirty he is, I can confirm that he is a very naughty boy.\" Blimey. Let that be the final word on the matter. 17th over: Pakistan 55-2 (Yasir Hamed 27, Yousuf Youhana 9) England keep up the pressure thanks to Gough, who is a whisker away from having Hamed caught behind on the drive. Just two off the over. A couple of quick wickets and England will be right on top. I thought I'd move swiftly on from the ball-tampering debate, until I received this little gem from Julie Smith. \"My Grandad Horace was well-equipped for a spot of ball-tampering,\" she writes. \"He'd had an industrial accident which crushed his thumb and caused his thumbnail to regrow with the same strength and texture as horse hoof, and all curved over at the end. It used to take 30 minutes soaking to soften it enough to be able to trim it with the nail scissors.\" I'm repulsed and fascinated at the same time. 18th over: Pakistan 61-2 (Yasir Hamed 28, Yousuf Youhana 12) Ok, first crash of the morning, but I can report that Anthony McGrath just bowled his first over in England blue and went for six. He was actually quite tidy, if a little slow. I'll give you the batsmen's scores as soon as I have them. WICKET! Yasir Hamed b Gough 28 (61-3) That's great bowling from Gough. He ties Hamed down by varying his pace, then gives him a slightly wider one outside off. Hamed goes back to chop it through the covers, but gets an inside edge onto off stump. Gough likes that. Very much. WICKET! Younis Khan c Read b Gough 0 (61-4) Wow! At Old Trafford, Khan lasted two balls. Well, he hasn't even managed that here. Gough gets one in the channel, Khan nibbles and Read does the rest. A double-wicket maiden for Gough, and England are on top after 19 overs. Gough will begin his next over on a hat-trick. 20th over: Pakistan 65-4 (Yousuf Youhana 15, Shoaib Malik 1) McGrath gets through another tidy, if unthreatening over. The crowd are a little quiet at the moment. Strangely. \"I cannot help but notice all the free plugs that went out during the last one-dayer,\" writes Chris Lipscomb. \"So, to save me the bother of sitting around all day dreaming up some new ways to promote Golfbreaks.com how about one quick mention so I can then go for a haircut, a swim and some cricket watching.\" You must have seen me coming, Chris. 21st over: Pakistan 71-4 (Yousuf Youhana 19, Shoaib Malik 2) Shoaib gets right behind Gough's hat-trick ball as three slips lie in wait. The next ball - a no-ball - is a screamer that is unlucky not to take the outside edge. Gough really is on fire. But Shoaib takes a single and Youhana responds with a flashing drive to the cover fence for four. \"The real facial-hair question is this: Hughes or Boon?\" writes Grace Pickering. \"Proof that yet again the Australians are better than us at everything.\" If looking like an overblown walrus is a virtue, Grace, then the Aussies are free to have it. 22nd over: Pakistan 71-4 (Yousuf Youhana 19, Shoaib Malik 2) McGrath continues with his apologetic little dobbers, but they're proving quite effective, which suggests this pitch isn't as quick as we thought it would be. That's a maiden to Shoaib. \"I sympathise with Dan Benson,\" writes Michael Rogers. \"My room overlooks flats containing some stunningly noisy Brazilians, whose conversation involves them all shouting at each other at high volume with screechy input from strident girlfriends, a gang of French social butterflies, and some inconsiderate get who keeps going away and leaving their alarm on, which, once it has gone off, continues to go off until they return. It's time he accepted that insomnia will soon be as much a part of his life as breathing and eating, but obviously not sleeping.\" WICKET! Shoaib Malik run out (Troughton) 2 (73-5) Well, Pakistan are making a bit of a mess of this. Youhana tries to sweep Giles, but the ball dribbles off his thigh to short fine leg. Shoaib calls him through, but Troughton is quick and fires in a return to the keeper. Read, though, isn't required as the ball cannons into the top of the stumps. The third umpire confirms that it was the ball - and not Read's gloves - that broke the stumps. Shoaib is two feet out, and England are on a roll. 23rd over: Pakistan 74-5 (Yousuf Youhana 21, Rashid Latif 1) Pakistan need to consolidate now, rather as England had to at Old Trafford. Will they nudge? Or will they bash? I can hardly stand the suspense. 24th over: Pakistan 77-5 (Yousuf Youhana 23, Rashid Latif 2) McGrath is proving strangely effective - just three off that over. \"How many bags of ice do you need to fill an average bath so you can cool your beers in it?\" wonders Tom Aldred, who will be at the housewarming party in Tufnell Park which I can't make. 25th over: Pakistan 79-5 (Yousuf Youhana 24, Rashid Latif 3) Giles is going over the wicket to the right-handers, as he did at Old Trafford. It's dull but effective: two off the over. WICKET! Rashid Latif c Solanki b McGrath 3 (80-6) Oh dear. Latif flashes McGrath towards gully where Solanki parries it into the air. But he catches the rebound superbly as he falls to the floor, and Pakistan are in a real mess. This game could be over more quickly than we thought. Here's Eimear Costigan. \"I know for a fact that Dan Benson does not throw a cricket ball at his bedroom wall - it's a sliotar (not dissimiliar ball used for the Irish sport hurling). I know this because I'm his (Irish) girlfriend, not the porcine new housemate. But I'll forgive him for lying if this leads to a non-violent solution to the snoring problem.\" And that's a world exclusive! 27th over: Pakistan 86-6 (Youhana 29, Mahmood 1) Pakistan must be thankful they still have Azhar Mahmood and Abdul Razzaq to come. Youhana plays Giles nicely in that over, using his soft wrists to work him twice behind point for a couple. \"I am the fixtures secretary for the Southampton Accademics cricket club\" announces Neil Broderick, \"and I need a fixture for Sunday week (the 29th). Can you ask if anyone of your readers would fancy a friendly game next weekend?\" 28th over: Pakistan 91-6 (Youhana 33, Mahmood 3) Pakistan are going to have to push the singles for several overs now, which is just as well, because McGrath isn't giving them much else. \"I think that I saw Theresa May at the gym this morning,\" writes a star-struck Anton Lawrence. \"She was wearing red and blue shoes with what I think are kitten heels. As my dad asked - 'isn't that a bit cruel to cats?\" Groan. 29th over: Pakistan 98-6 (Youhana 38, Mahmood 5) At last - a shot in anger from Pakistan, and what a lovely shot it was. Youhana goes inside out to hit Giles over the top of extra cover for four. It's the first boundary for 50 balls. \"Julie Smith's grandad isn't the only one,\" confesses Michael Frazer. \"I got stamped on playing football a dozen years ago, and the second toe-nail on my left foot now grows in the same grotesque fashion as Horace's. Clipping is a nasty operation, definitely to be carried out behind closed doors to protect the innocent.\" I'm not feeling very hungry any more. 30th over: Pakistan 103-6 (Youhana 40, Mahmood 8) The 100 comes up to the sound of a few weak blows of those annoying trumpets. But this innings has been a real let-down so far. McGrath has been allowed to get through seven overs for 24. \"As if someone called Grace is in any position to talk about facial hair,\" laughs Paul Roberts. \"Her namesake, the great Doctor WG, pretty much wrote the book on the subject.\" 31st over: Pakistan 106-6 (Youhana 41, Mahmood 10) Back comes Flintoff, whose first five overs went for just 15. It's a good time to bowl: Pakistan need to survive rather than hit out, and Flintoff sticks to a widish line outside off. Just three singles off the over. Vaughan has juggled his bowlers very intelligently today. He isn't conspicuous, like Hussain - more quietly efficient. Simon Ward has an interesting take on the facial-hair discussion. \"When we consistently beat the Aussies in the late 70s and early 80s, the England team was chock-full of lazy shavers,\" he points out. \"Aside from old sages (Boycott and Brearley) and fresh-faced dandies (Gower and Dilley), that entire Headingley 81 side had some form facial roughage. Is that why Gilette stopped their sponsorship of one-day cricket?\" I like it. 32nd over: Pakistan 110-6 (Youhana 42, Mahmood 13) Vaughan presists with McGrath, then lets him down by diving over a drive from Mahmood which costs two runs. He does have this weird habit of messing up in the field. Still, just four off the over. Tom Oxley has been racking his brains. \"Bath-size multiplied by .75 (allowing for 1/4 cold water) minus beer volume (inc packaging) = space for ice. Divide by ice bag size. Probably five medium size ones. Maths not a strong point.\" I beg to differ, Tom. 33rd over: Pakistan 124-6 (Youhana 47, Mahmood 22) Good over for Pakistan as Flintoff drops short. Mahmood top-edges a hook over the keeper's head for four, then pulls him authentically next ball for another boundary. Youhana chips in by cutting a long hop to thew point boundary. Fourteen off it - by far the most expensive of the innings. England can't afford to relax here. Why not bring back Gough or Anderson to take some wickets? \"Let's not forget too soon Saeed Anwar's magnificent efforts,\" says Tom Newman. \"His beard was a breath of fresh air in an otherwise unremarkable World Cup. If Wisden had a 'beards of the year' section, Saeed would have it.\" 34th over: Pakistan 124-6 (Youhana 48, Mahmood 25) Still McGrath - just four off it. If Pakistan can creep up to 200, they're still in with a shout against England's inexperienced batting line-up. \"Following your updates on the net from Jamaica, writes Janice Casserl. \"Tell me, as a politically incorrect Brit, are the Pakistani flags just a touch droopy at the moment? What's the betting you don't print this one? Odds on, no doubt.\" Caught you by surprise, haven't I, Janice? 35th over: Pakistan 131-6 (Youhana 50, Mahmood 26) On comes Rikki Clarke on his home ground. His first two balls are full-tosses, but Pakistan can only take two singles off them. Youhana reaches his fifty off 77 balls with a single, and Pakistan take seven off the over. This ranks as a mini-fightback. More MP spotting, this time from Dan Shears. \"Anton Lawrence thinks he saw Theresa May this morning? Well, I definitely saw Eric Forth walking down Victoria Street yesterday afternoon. And he was carrying a brown envelope. Beat that!\" The gauntlet has been thrown down. 36th over: Pakistan 139-6 (Youhana 53, Mahmood 28) McGrath completes his ten overs, which he's bowled off the reel. He's gone for 40 runs and has the wicket of Rashid Latif to tell his grandchildren about. Great effort. But Pakistan continue their recovery. \"I was just wondering,\" wonders Matthew Amer, cheekily. \"Does Dan Benson have lots of (different nationality) girlfriends and is it only the Irish one that read the over-by-over coverage.\" 37th over: Pakistan 146-6 (Youhana 59, Mahmood 29) Why oh why is Clarke bowling? He simply isn't accurate enough, so Pakistan are just milking him for easy runs. Youhana tucks a wayward delivery off his hip for four. Groan. \"I'm co-skipper with Wine Vaults CC, a Pompey-based club,\" says our new regular Tom Newman. \"I might be able to offer Neil Broderick a friendly, if he can assure me that his supporters won't come looking for trouble in this kind of derby match. I'd like to get in an early sledge about his miss-spelling of the word 'academics', but I think that sort of thing should be saved for the field of play.\" 38th over: Pakistan 150-6 (Youhana 61, Mahmood 30) Giles is still going over the wicket here, which seems a little negative when Pakistan are six wickets down. One ball starts wide of leg, doesn't turn and is called by umpire Hair. Up comes the 150 - that last 50 came off just 51 balls, which shows how these two have been allowed to work England around. \"As a colleague of Paul Roberts,\" says James Kirkaldy, \"can I point out that he himself is probably on suspect ground when it comes to mocking the more hirsuit members of our society?\" WICKET! Azhar Mahmood c Solanki b Clarke 30 (152-7) My plan of slagging off Clarke has worked brilliantly. He gets one to swing away outside off, Mahmood pushes at it and it flew at head height to Solanki at backward point. He doesn't drop those. England needed that. And now they need to get rid of either Youhana or Abdul Razzaq quickly too. \"In her drunken haranguing of England's finest young men, did Ms Lowe manage to fit in a quick word to the boy Anderson about his haircut?\" asks Louise Wright. \"The blonde bits are beginning to give me nightmares, let alone the fear that the overall mullety effect induces.\" I dare say Andrea had a word, Louise. 39th over: Pakistan 153-7 (Youhana 62, Razzaq 1) Fair play to Clarke - just three off that over, although a mammoth wide down the leg side does little to convince me that he's the fifth bowler England need. 40th over: Pakistan 157-7 (Youhana 64, Razzaq 3) Flintoff returns and is back in the groove. Just ten overs to go now. It's a question of wickets here, but if Pakistan can bat out their overs, they will have passed 200. The MP-spotting has moved swiftly onto celebrity-spotting. \"I saw a pregnant Helena Bonham-Carter last week on Marylebone High Street,\" says Abu Berat, \"and yesterday I saw Noel Gallagher on virtually the same spot. I didn't notice their footwear.\" Thanks, Abu. 41st over: Pakistan 162-7 (Youhana 65, Razzaq 6) A better over from Clarke, who goes for just five. Call me cowardly, but I'm going to have to paraphrase some of the many Dermot Reeve-related anecdotes that have been winging their way into my inbox. On legal grounds, of course, you understand. Most of them involve Reeve doing an after-dinner speech at a university sports club, then getting a little too friendly with the students. But we'll say no more. 42nd over: Pakistan 170-7 (Youhana 67, Razzaq 12) Anderson kicks off a new spell with a good one that moves away and beats Youhana's flail. Umpire Hair decides the next one is too wide of off stump for his liking. Razzaq steers the final ball just out of Read's reach and away for four. These two are carrying on the good work for Pakistan. \"It's not recent,\" apologises Jonathan Betts, \"but I once saw Boris Johnson riding a bike through Barnsbury - he seemed to be wearing a very crumpled linen suit (and no helmet).\" 43rd over: Pakistan 182-7 (Youhana 73, Razzaq 17) Vaughan keeps faith with Clarke, but his first ball is a half-volley outside off stump and Youhana punishes him through extra cover for four. Clarke later slips in his obligatory leg-side wide, and I can feel myself developing a quite irrational dislike of this lad's bowling. Ho hum. There's a referral to the third umpire for a run-out, but Troughton's direct hit from close to the stumps comes a fraction too late. Razzaq finishes the over by carving a rank long-hop over third man for four. Pakistan are very much in this game. Vaqas Ahmed might not have understood the rules of the game. \"A few months ago I saw Gordon Brown with a suitcase that he said contained millions of pounds which belong to the government,\" he reveals. \"But I think this was the budget.\" WICKET! Abdul Razzaq c Trescothick b Anderson 17 (185-8) England needed that. Razzaq leans back and smashes a good-length ball straight into Trescothick's ample gut at mid-off. Just two tail-enders to come. \"All this talk of overgrown toenails has got that age-old pork-scratchings debate raging here in Cambridge,\" reports Ali McCluskey. \"Namely, is the pork scratching the West Midlands' one and only significant contribution to world cuisine? And does anyone know of any innovative recipes containing pork scratchings? A mate of mine swears by his Scratchings Carbonara.\" The mind boggles. WICKET! Shoaib Akhtar c Read b Anderson 0 (185-9) Shoaib Akhtar nibbles at his first ball, which swings a bit, and is caught behind. Anderson on a hat-trick! WICKET! Mohammad Sami b Anderson 0 (185 all out) He's done it! Anderson has taken the first one-day hat-trick by an England bowler! Sensational. His third wicket comes with a yorker that borders on a full-toss but is far too good for Sami. Anderson has 4 for 27 and England will need 186 to win. Join me in about 45 minutes for their reply."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
