The Tigers have been the dominant force in the professional era in European club rugby with four league titles and two Heineken Cup successes, but their aura of invincibility has been replaced by a fear of relegation and they are 28 points behind the leaders Bath. Defeat against Leeds on Saturday would leave them contemplating the Parker Pen Challenge Cup. \"Our first priority is to ensure that we do not finish at the bottom of the Premiership and go down,\" said Wheeler, an admission that would have been unthinkable even a year ago. \"We are not safe yet by any means. Once we have achieved that we have to look to qualify for next season's Heineken Cup because to fail to do so would be a massive setback for us.\" Wheeler admitted that Richards's future hinged on the club getting into the Heineken Cup. \"There is pressure on everyone at the club,\" he said. \"The players, the coaching staff and the administra tors are in this together. If we fail to qualify for the Heineken Cup, we will need to undertake a widespread review of where we went wrong. \"In fairness to the coaches, we were hit by the loss of several players for the World Cup and, as we found out four years ago, it is not easy for them to slip straight back into the side. Everyone at the club has to pull together in the coming months.\" Richards may be comforted by the fact that John Mitchell can no longer be considered a candidate to replace him. Mitchell, who lost his position as the All Blacks coach last week and has excited interest from clubs in this country, was last night appointed coach of the Waikato Chiefs. Mitchell had said that he would take up the offer from a Premiership club to fly to England on Saturday to talk about a coaching role should talks to become coach of the Chiefs not bear fruit. Wheeler denied that Leicester were the club involved, adding that it was not their policy to publicly discuss such issues. The 39-year-old Mitchell, who signed a three-year deal with the National Provincial Championship team, was also cleared by the New Zealand Rugby Union of misbehaviour during the All Blacks' World Cup campaign. The union publicly rejected rumours that he had an affair with his personal assistant Bridget Hickman at the World Cup. Hickman was sent home midway through the tournament. \"The NZRU regrets that John has been subjected to unsubstantiated and hurtful gossip and innuendo,\" the union's chief executive Chris Moller said in a statement. Saracens, one place below Leicester, were the other club linked with Mitchell but have more pressing problems now that their England flanker Richard Hill has been ruled out of this weekend's match against Bath at Vicarage Road with a broken nose, suffered playing against the New Zealand Barbarians last Saturday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
