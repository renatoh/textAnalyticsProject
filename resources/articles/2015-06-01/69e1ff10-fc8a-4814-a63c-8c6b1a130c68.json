There needs to be a dramatic improvement in the population\u2019s grasp of basic numeracy and statistics if the UK is to keep up with its neighbours and make the most of the potential offered by \u201cbig data\u201d, says a report by the British Academy published on Thursday. It calls for a transformation in the UK\u2019s approach to building numeracy, statistics and data analysis skills to ensure that students, consumers and workers are as fluent with numbers as they are with words. The report, entitled Count Us In, focuses on the need for current workers and future generations to develop quantitative skills in order to understand and interpret the vast quantities of data being generated. It says the UK has the potential to become a world leader in big data, which would in turn lead to enormous economic benefits. The Centre for Economics and Business Research has estimated that 58,000 new jobs a year could be created in the UK between 2012 and 2017, with the UK economy benefiting by \u00a374bn over those five years. But not only does the numeracy crisis mean the country is in danger of falling behind in the big data race, on a more immediate level, employers are complaining that workers lack numeracy skills, while consumers are unable to make informed choices. \u201cThe ubiquity of statistics makes it vital that citizens, scientists and policy makers are fluent with numbers,\u201d the report says. \u201cThere have been some important and encouraging developments to address the UK\u2019s weaknesses in quantitative skills. \u201cBut the urgency of this challenge demands that much more should be done. What is needed now is a concerted, continuous national effort \u2013 with leadership from government.\u201d Among its recommendations, the report calls on the government to improve the quality of quantitative skills teaching in schools and colleges, with particular focus on teacher recruitment and the quality of teaching skills. Currently the UK\u2019s performance in maths in Pisa international tests places it in the middle ranks among developed nations. UK students are much less likely to be studying maths beyond 16 than in other countries, and one in six maths lessons in state schools is not taught by a specialist maths teacher. \u201cSuccessive governments have overhauled school curricula across the UK in recent years,\u201d the report says. \u201cWe recognise the efforts of policymakers in emphasising the importance of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (Stem) in their reforms. \u201cHowever the task of improving curricula should not be seen as a matter of free-standing changes every few years, but as a structured, long-term project of continuous, strategic review.\u201d In addition, universities are accused of failing to incorporate quantitative skills into the core of the curriculum \u2013 as in countries such as the US, the Netherlands and Germany \u2013 leaving them to \u201clanguish in the margins\u201d. Prof Sir Ian Diamond, chair of the British Academy\u2019s quantitative skills strategy group, said: \u201cOur ability to handle data and reason using numbers will not be transformed overnight. But we need to put in place the structures that will begin to effect that change. \u201cWhichever way we look at it \u2013 the sheer potential for our economy and society on the one hand, and the risks of not acting on the other \u2013 this is an agenda that demands the interests of decision makers at the highest level.\u201d Former national statistician and chair of the British Academy project, Dame Jil Matheson, added: \u201cFor our ambition to be fully realised within a generation, we must not underestimate the cultural change that is required \u2013 starting now \u2013 primarily, but not entirely, with the UK\u2019s education systems.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
