The meeting, which was also attended by the agent Pini Zahavi, who acted for the Russian in negotiations over his takeover bid, took place at Abramovich's house in London last Thursday evening. Confirmation that talks took place is sure to undermine further the position of Claudio Ranieri as manager at Stamford Bridge. The national coach was photographed alongside Zahavi arriving at the billionaire's SW1 home. Yesterday Eriksson had to issue a public explanation of the talks given the increasingly precarious nature of Ranieri's position. Eriksson is contracted to England until after the World Cup finals in Germany in 2006, but fell short of denying that he was offered the post at the Premiership club in a carefully worded statement released by Soho Square last night. \"I can confirm that last week I met with Pini Zahavi and the new owner of Chelsea Football Club - Roman Abramovich - at Mr Abramovich's property in London,\" he said. \"Pini Zahavi and I have been good friends for 20 years, since I was coaching Benfica. As Pini spends a lot of time in London, we regularly meet socially. \"Additionally, I have known Roman Abramovich for several months and during that time have also enjoyed socialising with him when he is in London. \"However, due to the intense media profile given to Mr Abramovich's involvement with Chelsea, I accept that this meeting may create unfortunate speculation. \"Therefore, I would like to once again categorically reaffirm my total commitment to my role as England head coach. I am thoroughly enjoying the current European Championship qualifying campaign and I am looking forward to leading England to success in the future.\" Zahavi's presence is hardly likely to reassure Football Association sceptics over Eriksson's long-term commitment to the England role. They were alerted last year when Sir Alex Ferguson claimed the Swede had shaken hands with Peter Kenyon to succeed him at Old Trafford before the Manchester United manager's u-turn over his retirement. The Israeli acted as the gobetween who brought Chelsea and Abramovich together and has forged a reputation as a major player in football's biggest deals. Whatever the basis of the FA's concerns, the contact between Abramovich and Eriksson has left Ranieri's position virtually untenable. The Italian, who took up the reins in west London three years ago, was under threat the moment the Russian completed his \u00a329.6m purchase of a 50.09% stake in Chelsea Village and declared himself \"not sure\" about Ranieri's credentials. The new owner has already made inquiries for a number of players - Ronaldinho, Milan's Alessandro Nesta, Barcelona's Patrick Kluivert, Arsenal's Thierry Henry and Juventus's Edgar Davids - with minimal input from his manager. Suggestions that Abramovich may interfere in team affairs prompted Ranieri to threaten to walk out on the club, just as he did at his previous employers, Atletico Madrid, in 2000 following intervention from the club president Jesus Gil."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
