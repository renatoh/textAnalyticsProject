Turley, 30, is helping the Northamptonshire club establish themselves in the Second Division with a series of excellent goalkeeping displays. But he knows that, if the current regime had been in place at the FA 12 months ago, he could now be serving a two-year suspension with his career in ruins. He is the mystery player the FA allowed to escape last year with a rap over the knuckles despite the fact he was the first player in England to test positive for a banned anabolic steroid. It was such a secret the FA's spokesman refused to acknowledge it had even happened. \"We cannot confirm that a player has a problem with a drugs test. We cannot confirm a hearing has taken place. We cannot confirm if anyone has been punished,\" he said. The fact that a player had even tested positive became public only because it appeared in the quarterly doping report published by UK Sport, who had conducted the test on behalf of the FA. Far better known and wealthier competitors in other sports or from other countries who had tested positive for nandrolone, the same steroid as Turley, were far less fortunate. The 1992 Olympic 100 metres champion Linford Christie had his reputation ruined by a two-year suspension. The 400m runner Mark Richardson was forced to miss the Olympics in Sydney. The Dutch defender Jaap Stam saw a multi-million-pound transfer to Lazio from Manchester United turn into a nightmare. Doping experts believe that in all these cases the drug was ingested unwittingly in a health supplement. The FA warned all professionals about the supplement earlier last season, pointing out that it could have unwelcome effects and would not be accepted as a satisfactory explanation for testing positive. Yet Turley claimed successfully to a disciplinary hearing that prescribed drugs could have triggered the result and a suspension would cause him serious distress because of a personal problem. Warned if he tested positive again he would be banned for life but allowed to continue playing, Turley enjoyed an impressive season as Rushden won the Third Division title. Rushden's rivals may wonder at the fairness of this action. The tough stance adopted by the chief executive Mark Palios has done much to restore the FA's reputation abroad. Now he must drive home the message that England takes the problem seriously. Since news of Ferdinand's case broke other examples of where the FA has failed to take strict action are emerging. In another case of a player claiming to forget he had been asked to undertake a test, Manchester City's Christian Negouai escaped with a warning last year. Ferdinand is unlikely to be so lucky."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
