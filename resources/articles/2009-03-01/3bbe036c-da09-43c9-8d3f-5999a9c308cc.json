Burrow, who was making his first appearance since suffering a back injury a month ago, was cleaned out in the 16th minute by a spectacular but legal tackle from Manly's outstanding second-row Anthony Watmough, after receiving a hospital pass from Peacock. The tiny scrum half sent away the stretcher bearers but had to be helped from the field looking understandably groggy, and a Rhinos team already missing three of their overseas players were still coming to terms with that latest disruption when Peacock earned himself a second trip to the sin bin for fighting in four matches this season with an attack on the Manly prop Josh Perry, which sparked a lengthy brawl and could land him in trouble when it is watched by the disciplinary authorities this week. The scores were 0-0 when Peacock went off, but Manly led 12-0 when he returned and three more tries in the space of five minutes early in the second half removed any doubt about the outcome, although Leeds finished strongly to earn a respectable final scoreline. The Sea Eagles from Sydney's northern beaches therefore became the first Australian club to be crowned world champions since Sydney Roosters inflicted a 38-0 defeat on St Helens in 2003, ending a run of five consecutive British wins \u2013 and providing particular satisfaction for their coach Des Hasler, who was a member of the team beaten at Wigan in 1987 in Manly's only previous World Club Challenge appearance. There is quite a tradition of brawling in these fixtures, with most involving at least one wholehearted scuffle. But the World Club Challenge has not seen such a sustained all-in dust-up as this for a while \u2013 in fact, since Manly's last appearance in the game 22 years ago, when their 8-2 defeat at Wigan was punctuated by a series of fights, and their second-row \"Rambo\" Ronnie Gibbs was sent off. To be fair to Manly they could not be held responsible this time, as Peacock launched a series of punches at their prop Josh Perry for no visible reason. It seemed very harsh on Perry that he should be sin-binned with Peacock for his retaliation, but Leeds still suffered the most as a result of the incident, as in the 10 minutes the props were off, Manly scored two tries to take a 12-0 lead. The first was a dreadfully soft score for Leeds to concede after they had defended so manfully for the first quarter, as Manly's full-back Brett Stewart caught them napping to wriggle over from close range. The second came directly from another piece of Leeds indiscipline, this time a high tackle by the centre on Carl Ablett on his roughhouse opposite number Steve Matai. Manly capitalised brilliantly with the second-row Anthony Watmough steaming on to Matt Orford's perfectly delayed short pass and showing impressive pace on a 40-metre charge around the Rhinos full-back Lee Smith. Orford converted both, and Manly should have scored a third try that would have killed the contest off after 33 minutes, with Watmough again doing the damage only for Stewart to drop his pass with the line at his mercy. Peacock was back on the field by now and underlined his admirable qualities with a terrific try-saving tackle on Manly's stand-off Chris Bailey. Then Leeds gave themselves a little hope by pinching a scrappy and controversial try late in the first half. Orford seemed to have denied Danny McGuire by holding him up in the in-goal area with a classic cover tackle, but the video referee Steve Ganson ruled that the ball had rolled backwards when McGuire tried to ground it, and that by touching it down Jamie Jones-Buchanan had therefore claimed a legitimate try. But Sinfield was unable to convert, and three minutes into the second half Manly re-established their 12-point lead with Stewart's second try, after Carl Ablett had fumbled the chance to clear up an inside pass from Michael Robertson. Leeds had introduced the 17-year-old Kallum Watkins at right centre at half-time, but two minutes later they were again left exposed down that side of the field. This time Robertson kicked infield straight into the arms of the supporting Stewart, and although he was pulled down by the covering Ryan Hall, Watmough bagged a simple second try from the next play. Things started to get embarrassing for the Rhinos when Manly romped in from long range again, Heath L'Estrange supporting Shane Rodney's break and sending Matai clear. Leeds had sufficient resolve to stem the flow and hit back with three slick tries of their own, the huge hands of the Samoa second-row Ali Lauitiiti setting up first the veteran centre Keith Senior and then his powerful young wing partner Ryan Hall, with Danny McGuire grabbing a last consolation. But for even the most jaundiced Yorkshiremen in an excellent 32,569 crowd, there was no doubting southern hemisphere superiority last night.
