They retreated until they could no more, surviving to see off Norwich City\u2019s late retort. Such trepidation was to be expected given March was the last time they recorded back-to-back league wins. Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl\u2019s side held on to savour victory, with first-half goals by Danny Ings and Ryan Bertrand paving the way to a win that hoists them out of the bottom three. After a rocky start Southampton have garnered seven points from the last available nine to relieve pressure on Hasenh\u00fcttl and allow the Austrian to enjoy his one-year anniversary in charge. \u201cIt has not been an easy last month or two months but a very important one for me as a manager,\u201d Hasenh\u00fcttl said. \u201cI never had a situation like this \u2013 such a long time without winning [an eight-game winless run] \u2013 but I think in the end this experience is very important for me. I\u2019m happy that I went through such a period and I\u2019m thankful the club is going a different way, not immediately thinking about sacking the manager but supporting and I must say thank you to everybody in the club.\u201d Hasenh\u00fcttl is adamant Southampton are a better side these days and, as much as a return of six points in five days was a welcome pick-me-up, the manager was most pleased with the front-foot manner of his side\u2019s performance. Ings\u2019s headed opener and Bertrand\u2019s volley stemmed from James Ward-Prowse set pieces during a charismatic first-half display. \u201cMore important for me is that we have found a way we want to play and that we have got our identity back,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s more important than every win.\u201d Teemu Pukki\u2019s eighth goal of the season sent a familiar ripple of anxiety through the home crowd, particularly given how easily Southampton\u2019s defence was carved open, with the Norwich striker lashing into the roof of Alex McCarthy\u2019s net after galloping on to Alex Tettey\u2019s threaded ball. If Southampton were in unfamiliar territory at half-time, they were almost in dreamland when Ings chested Nathan Redmond\u2019s hooked pass and sent a shot rasping past Tim Krul\u2019s left post. Shane Long was again lively and departed to a standing ovation five minutes from time. For Norwich it was a bitterly disappointing evening after an encouraging showing and result against Arsenal on Sunday. Norwich, as Daniel Farke acknowledged, were punished for a painfully sluggish start, having not truly troubled Southampton until Pukki struck with over an hour played. The substitute Marco Stiepermann, who was introduced at half-time alongside Tettey, had sent a shot over after collecting Pukki\u2019s pass, which was artfully dummied by Cantwell, while Sam Byram squandered a chance to snatch an equaliser but Norwich got what they deserved. \u201cWe are not Liverpool or Man City \u2013 [those] sides can sometimes allow themselves to have a slow start or a slow half and they can still react because they have unbelievable qualities,\u201d Farke said. \u201cWe are a newly promoted side, who hardly spent any money in the summer and we have to be at the top of our game in each and every second in order to be competitive.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
