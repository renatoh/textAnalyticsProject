But as news broke on Wednesday that five members of the Melbourne University Publishing board had resigned, along with its chief executive, Louise Adler, in a coordinated protest against a proposed new direction for the publishing house, some of the Australia\u2019s highest profile public figures started letting their thoughts be known. On Twitter, the shadow treasurer, Chris Bowen, called the move \u201ca very serious blow to quality writing about Australian politics, history and culture\u201d and implored the University of Melbourne to \u201cseriously reconsider this terrible decision\u201d. Bowen has had two books published by MUP; he told Guardian Australia that while he didn\u2019t agree with all their publishing choices, MUP was making \u201ca valuable contribution to the body politic\u201d and the university was making \u201ca fundamental error\u201d. The Labor leader, Bill Shorten, also an MUP author, congratulated Adler for her \u201cremarkable contribution\u201d to the industry. At the prize ceremony for the Victorian premier\u2019s literary awards on Thursday night, the Victorian creative industries minister, Martin Foley, called on the university to reverse its decision. The former foreign affairs minister Gareth Evans told Guardian Australia that it was \u201ca very sad day for Australian publishing\u201d. He called Adler \u201ca giant in the industry \u2013 creative, dynamic and huge contributor to the broader public debate about issues\u201d. MUP published across the political divide \u2013 including books by the former prime minister Tony Abbott, the Howard government minister Peter Reith, and Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young \u2013 but it also published across the cultural spectrum. \u201cWe\u2019ve lost a substantial publisher,\u201d Nobel prize-winning scientist Peter Doherty, who wrote multiple books for MUP, told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt was a real niche and lot of really interesting people wrote for it. It\u2019s a real loss. I\u2019m very saddened by the whole thing.\u201d But underneath the public lament lies a much more complicated power struggle: a long-running battle of ideas about the very purpose of a university publishing house, from public access to ideas and the market realities of printing books, to the perception of institutional prestige. The loss of Adler alone signals an abrupt and profound transformation for MUP. For years, Adler\u2019s name has been synonymous with its brand, which has gone beyond academic publishing into more public facing works for a general readership. Its contributor stable now includes not only respected academics such as Rebe Taylor, Mark McKenna and Stuart MacIntyre, but also the who\u2019s who of Australian political life. Journalists, too, including many at Guardian Australia, were published by Adler or knew her personally. The sudden about-face by the publisher of choice for so many high-profile public figures seemed, on the face of it, baffling. That MUP pushed beyond the realm of scholarly monographs into more public-facing works was no accident. Its current incarnation is a consequence of a review that was conducted in the early 2000s that aimed to \u201cpreserve, strengthen and modernise the press\u201d. The company was directed, among other things, to put greater emphasis on commercial ventures and the digital rather than print publication of academic titles. Adler was recruited to spearhead that new direction. Her appointment was controversial from the get-go \u2013 she has always been a divisive figure in the tiny Australian publishing community \u2013 but the new approach also put many academic noses out of joint. \u201cThere was always a problem about making the money work,\u201d Hilary McPhee, founder of now-defunct publishing house McPhee Gribble and member of that initial review committee, told Guardian Australia. \u201cLouise has always been under pressure at Melbourne University to balance a commercial publisher with an academic publisher,\u201d McPhee said. \u201cThat has been there right from day one and it always will be there. It\u2019s not a bad tension. \u201cShe managed that balancing act extremely well. But it infuriated a lot of conservative academics.\u201d Adler\u2019s decision to publish the memoirs of gangster Mick Gatto in 2010 was seen by many as a scandalous decision for a university publisher, and a slap in the face for many of the serious writers and academics whose books were published alongside it. It was accompanied by rumblings within the industry that Adler was offering disproportionately large book advances to secure high-profile talent, and that the financial health of the publishing house was suffering substantially as a result. Prof Peter McPhee, chairman of the MUP board between 2011 and 2017, told Guardian Australia that, in 2012, at the conclusion of another review into the publisher\u2019s activities, the decision was made to steer away from splashing cash in favour of a more careful curation of titles. \u201cThere had been a perception before then that MUP was publishing some stuff that really should have been left to commercial publishers,\u201d McPhee said. \u201cSo we made a very deliberate decision in 2012 that we were only going to publish books that the university community would feel comfortable with. And my view is that\u2019s what we have done.\u201d Rumours that MUP was in dire financial straits have dogged the publishing house for years. Both outgoing chair Laurie Muller and former chair Peter McPhee claim MUP has been, at least subsequent to 2012, in robust financial health. But the publisher has always, at least in part, been subsidised by the university. Muller told Guardian Australia that rumours that it had to repeatedly go back to the university to replenish its capital were largely untrue save for a period during the global financial crisis when MUP \u2013 and many other publishers \u2013 suffered substantial losses. Yet this week the university claimed MUP had run at a loss since its inception, and that it had spent $26m on bailouts over the life of the publisher. But should the financial precarity of a university publishing house require a compromise of editorial independence? Melbourne University vice-principal Adrian Collette told the Australian last July that whatever the outcomes of the most recent review, MUP\u2019s editorial independence would not be compromised. But Muller said on Wednesday that he understood an editorial advisory board would now be instated to \u201cdetermine what is published, separate to the main board and separate to the editors or the publisher\u201d, he said. That may have much to do with the influence of the two most senior figures in the University of Melbourne administration: the current vice-chancellor, Duncan Maskell, and its chancellor, Allan Myers QC. A generous Liberal party donor, a practising Catholic and one of Australia\u2019s wealthiest men, with stakes in businesses from Polish breweries to remote cattle stations, Myers became chancellor of the university at the beginning of 2017. As a QC, Myers has represented figures such as Kerry Stokes, Alan Bond, Gina Rinehart and Andrew \u201cTwiggy\u201d Forrest. Recently, perhaps befitting his staunch Catholicism, which extends to his membership of the lay Catholic order the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, he was engaged as counsel to Cardinal George Pell during the royal commission into institutional responses to child sexual abuse. Stories that Myers vehemently objected to the publication of ABC journalist Louise Milligan\u2019s book Cardinal: The Rise and Fall of George Pell resurfaced this week in the wake of the MUP resignations. Milligan\u2019s controversial book, which was published in 2017, detailed historical abuse allegations against Pell, and raised serious questions about his knowledge and actions in the wake of multiple revelations of institutional abuse within the church. Guardian Australia has spoken to a number of sources who allege that Myers made his perspective on MUP\u2019s commercial output, including Milligan\u2019s book, known in no uncertain terms, at one time saying the trade arm of the publishing house produced \u201cairport trash\u201d. Myers reportedly ordered the review subsequent to a heated meeting with then-chair Peter McPhee and Adler. Myers has denied these allegations, saying that he \u201cnever expressed to anyone except privately within my family\u201d his views on Milligan\u2019s book, and \u201cnever said any such thing in any council debate or any discussion concerning Melbourne University Press\u201d. Then there\u2019s the issue of stature. In September 2018, Glyn Davis, the university\u2019s vice-chancellor for 14 years and a strong supporter of Adler and the publishing house, resigned. Duncan Maskell was appointed in his place: a British alumni of the University of Cambridge and its former senior pro vice-chancellor (planning and resources), Maskell is a veritable product of that 800-year-old institution \u2013 which has one of the most prestigious and dominant university presses in the world. He is the author of the new strategy for MUP, and appears to have a much more conservative view of what a university publisher should be than his predecessor. University of Melbourne pro vice-chancellor (engagement) Pro Su Baker said in a statement that as an asset of the university, MUP \u201cshould focus on being a high quality scholarly press in support of the University\u2019s mission\u201d. While MUP say they will honour their obligations to the books currently under commission, effectively the new trajectory means eschewing political memoir, narrative non-fiction and the vast majority of its trade publishing output in favour of work from within the academy itself. It is not surprising that some parts of the university community have welcomed the announcement. There is intense structural pressure on academics to publish to advance their careers; a university publishing house that visibly, if not entirely in practice, steers away from a scholarly purview is therefore always going to find themselves the subject of contention. But there are concerns that the University of Melbourne\u2019s ambition to narrow its scope and its deepen its reputation for scholarly publishing would be hampered by simple logistics. The Australian market for scholarly works is tiny, distribution of books is expensive and there\u2019s no readily accessible international market for publications in Australia like there is in Europe. Muller told Guardian Australia: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t take a lot of back of the envelope arithmetic to show that, if it\u2019s not subsidised very heavily, it is a financially unviable approach.\u201d Finally, there\u2019s the question of audience. After all, what is a publisher for if not to reach people? \u201cOne of the really exciting things in recent years is that university presses have had a really evolving view about what their role is in that particular ecosystem,\u201d Wheeler Centre director Michael Williams told Guardian Australia. \u201cThat they are not just about academic work, they are about taking research and making it more widely accessible. The permeability between the university and the trade only led to amazing publishing. And so it\u2019s worrying if the limitations and financial realities mean that people are returning to more conservative definitions of what a university press does.\u201d Doherty said: \u201cMy intention in writing books was never to talk to other scientists. \u201cI\u2019ve personally held the view that one of the roles of universities, a very important role at universities, and actually we\u2019re constantly being told this, is outreach to the broader public.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
