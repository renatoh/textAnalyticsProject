Don't read on if you haven't seen episode eight \u2026 Daniel Martin's episode seven blog Humans The problem with finales is that, as much as you want every little strand tied up neatly, the results are never quite as satisfying as those in your head. Or the 21st-century extension of one's head \u2013 the internet. But Toby Whithouse resolves his at-times-uneven second-season arc near seamlessly. The very fact that the show's human baddies haven't had much of a coherent plan has made their antics all the scarier: a bitter old priest, a brilliant, misguided professor and an indifferent comedy technician have conspired to make something truly dangerous out of their very lack of focus. Lucy's assertion that the spooky flatshare was so very dangerous didn't really hold much water; instead the issue was human failings. There's been Lucy - smarting after the other scientists \"hid all my stuff and drew a cock on the back of my lab coat\" after her \"God's Blueprint\" book led her into Kemp's clutches - and her \"fuck up\" of falling into Mitchell's bed, simply out of wanting somewhere to belong. Kemp beginning to relish the journey over the destination, going full-on unhinged. (Did anyone else whiff a pervy thing for Professor Jaggat among all that stuff with the Garfield mug?) When he finally lost it and started randomly killing folk, it did admittedly undermine the character \u2013 but it also gave the story the proper jeopardy it needed. In the final act it would have been nice to see Mitchell recruit Lucy, so we could see more of the excellent Lyndsey Marshal in series three. But as we will discover, it's going to be crowded with recurring characters already \u2026 Vampires Mitchell isn't allowed an act of heroism to made amends for last week's massacre on the train. Things aren't so simple in this world Whithouse has created; you simply have to pick up the pieces and deal with what you've done. \"The only difference between you and me,\" he sneers at Lucy, \"is that you had a choice.\" Do we agree with him, gang? Werewolves It's now traditional for George to turn hero at the end of a season. And the events that lead to his and Nina's madcap jailbreak bring their story full circle. Their reconciliation is the only nod to what you might call a happy ending \u2013 and anything that allows Tovey and Keenan more screen-time together deserves all our high-fives. Also, it's lovely to see Tully \u2013 Dean Lennox Kelly's Britpop werewolf who scratched George in the first place \u2013 come good from beyond the grave, leaving George the message that \"all the werewolves die in the tank\". About the only person who did get to make amends. Annie I'm assuming that whatever Annie exactly does to Kemp at the end when she comes through the door is one of those questions you're not supposed to ask. But Annie's predicament, of being torn between a chance to pass over and a \"life\" in the only place she's ever belonged, gives Crichlow more chances to steal the show. As for the curveball of her pained appeal to her friends from purgatory \u2026 so hell lies in forms and administration. Theories, people? Best Line Mitchell: \"God made man in his own image, but what if that included his rage and his spite and his indifference and his cruelty? We're all his children, but God's a bit of a bastard.\" Best Scene That same one, Mitchell and Lucy's non-redemptive two-hander, batting back and forth over who has the bloodiest hands. It had clear echoes of Garth Ennis's darker-than-hell comic series Reaper. Incidentally, when can we see that adapted for television? The Last Rites You know how teachers sometimes give the brightest schoolkids the hardest time? That's how it's sometimes felt with the second series of Being Human: the knowledge of how supernaturally brilliant this series usually is, has made moments when it drops the ball even slightly feel like a personal affront. The vampire story plodded at times, George and Annie both had at least one episode where they felt surplus to requirements, and the Kemp and Lucy arc came in too early and found itself meandering. And there wasn't nearly enough Nina. So there's been a sense that here was a six-part series stretched out to fill eight episodes. That said, when you think about what this series has achieved for Brit fantasy \u2013 the quality of the performers, the closeness-to-the-bone of the writing \u2013 it still feels like the sort of landmark show that doesn't come along very often. And with the stakes nicely raised, I'm confident that a further series won't be the beginning of inevitable decline. Better still, the closing teaser promises the resurrection of poetic vampire psychopath Herrick \u2013 with the consequence that vampires can come back from the dead after all. It's time to bring out the #BringBackIvan hashtags, friends. You know what needs to be done \u2026"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
