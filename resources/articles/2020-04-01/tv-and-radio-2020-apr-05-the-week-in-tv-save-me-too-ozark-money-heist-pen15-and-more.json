I\u2019ve said it before: in an aeroplane, you\u2019d want your pilot to be the dullest man you would flee at any party, utterly without \u201cedge\u201d or wacko sense of humour, and so it is with Auntie: stoic, thoroughbred, pewter, a little Pooter. But reliable, and justifiably popular: days like these, you really don\u2019t want to be getting your news over the fence from some wheedling Twitter anarchist with self-esteem issues. Yet \u2013 oh, the dramatic output! Was Belgravia and Our Girl really the best you could do this week? It\u2019ll get better, it always does. But for now I\u2019m giving great, gulping thanks for the sprawling panoply of 21st-century channels. And for the return of Save Me, Lennie James\u2019s tour de force of a couple of years back. Those still reluctant to give Sky their shilling \u2013 I know, I know, but \u2013 should hold their nose while biting the bullet. A Now TV stick is eminently affordable (all the cash you\u2019ll be saving not buying that nonexistent fruit and veg) \u2013 \u00a38.99 a month to get Sky Atlantic, on which James\u2019s searing ensemble drama is worth the outlay alone. We\u2019re back at the Palm Tree, an east London pub so grotty, so loving, so flawed, so human that it must (in fact, does) exist. Nelly Rowe (James), the irrepressible, irresponsible charmer of a keen amateur drunk, is 17 months on from having had his daughter abducted by a grooming gang: he failed to rescue Jody, but has rescued against most odds a vulnerable substitute in the shape of young Grace. Nelly has grown, if not sobered, up: Jody\u2019s absence haunts him, to the point of vengeful obsession, and there\u2019s just the target, right there in court, in the shape of smug grooming businessman Gideon Charles (Ade Edmondson, and a remarkably subtle, intense performance; finally, I believe the gentleman can act). It says a lot about this show that so many quality actors from series one \u2013 Stephen Graham, Suranne Jones, Jason Flemyng, Kerry Godliman \u2013 put other projects on hold to join the sequel, which also features Lesley Manville as Gideon\u2019s understandably mortified wife. All six episodes are now available, but I\u2019d urge you to be parsimonious, seek delayed gratification. It is, if anything, better than the original, charting the toxins spread throughout an entire community via just one tiny group\u2019s sociopathic sense of sexual entitlement, and thus the disjointed distrusts that must fester and breed: a Hazchem barrel left leaking lazily in the Mile End rain. I\u2019m back in love with Ozark, after an iffy second series in which the producers didn\u2019t seem to know quite what to do with Jason Bateman and Laura Linney. Once they\u2019d got them established in Osage Beach, Missouri, trying to make amends for their Chicago white-collar dodgy deals by getting into bed with, um, a Mexican drug cartel, it doldrummed a little, hence some snitty reviews, one making reference to a Poundland Breaking Bad. But the 10-part third season is gloriously back on track, with Linney truly coming into her own as the boiler-room fire in the hole. Hubby Marty (Bateman), despite his squirrely financial alchemy, is left looking in comparison less Ozarks and more Walton\u2019s Mountain. Crucially, series three introduces Tom Pelphrey as Wendy\u2019s (Linney) bipolar brother Ben, whose charming role encapsulates a version of a Greek chorus, as in when he asks Marty: \u201cDo you realise what you\u2019re doing here? Do you know how far from normal every single thing you\u2019re doing actually is?\u201d Until Ben stops asking. There are shocks aplenty. If this is Poundland, I can\u2019t wait for the shops to reopen. Similarly, Money Heist is the Spanish gift that keeps on giving, like flamenco \u2013 yearningly romantic with a broiling undercurrent of mayhem. This is the best foreign-language series in this or arguably any other year. The Professor, as our criminal mastermind is known, lost at the end of the last series not only his brother but his One True Love. Now, he suddenly finds OTL is still alive, the victim of a dastardly stratagem by authorities. Tables are turned, mental cliff edges stepped back from. Unfortunately, the prof is trying to coordinate his seven alternative plans (in one entire episode!) from underneath an iron trough. What\u2019s more, he is threatened by a ground-pawing bull \u2013 only the Spanish! \u2013 while, inside the bank, his colleagues, comrades, conquistadores, bicker bloodily. There will be ichor. There will be sangre. Splendid. I rather wanted to enjoy Feel Good, because of great reviews, and did so by and large. Comedian Mae Martin\u2019s semi-autobiographical, six-part account of an expat Canadian bisexual has warmth, it has depth, it has all-round top-notch performances. Yet, and I accept I\u2019m probably against the tide, I just couldn\u2019t warm to Martin\u2019s character. She is (and penned her character as such) the sort to worry inordinately, over at least an episode-and-a-half, about her new girlfriend, English rose Georgie (Charlotte Ritchie), going to a wedding alone, and the worrying takes a specific and repeated form: \u201cWhat if you cry? What if there\u2019s no one there to hug you?\u201d This, to me, is the equivalent of being asked: \u201cWhat if you meep? What if there\u2019s dortoo wheeb T46 fradje?\u201d And yet, that quibble apart, this is a loving, embracing show for our times, and explores with resonance and wit many chasms few of us ever explore, such as addiction, and the need for love versus neediness. More fun, seldom less resonant, and with frankly more laughs, is Pen15, a kooky rites-of-passage triumph in which Maya Erskine and Anna Konkle, both about 33, play versions of themselves in the year 2000, negotiating the first year of middle school somewhere in butt-middle America. It\u2019s astonishing how swiftly credible they become as 13-year-olds. Also, how universal that age-experience must be: despite the unobtrusive attention to period detail \u2013 tramrail teeth, dialup AOL \u2013 the bit where Maya is labelled UGIS (ugliest girl in school; her mum\u2019s just cut her hair) will plunge all into reminiscences of savagery thought unbearable, until you bear it. Just as, in Feel Good, Georgie\u2019s accidentally morphined coming out will have you punching the air in delight. Miss Scarlet and the Duke looked as if it might almost be OK to spend a little lazy, brain-off, lockdown time with. It featured a sparky, feisty etc young lady in bonnets, who inherits her late father\u2019s detective business in Victorian London and has to prove herself, with steely quips and sleuthing skills and a coy smile, against Big Bearded Men. As it turns out, it\u2019s woeful dreck."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
