Speaking to the Association of Chief Police Officers, Mr Brown said it was vital to win hearts and minds, and today's generation had to address the threat. \"We must work across society to isolate the extremists from society to protect and advance the British way of life,\" he told the Acpo conference in Manchester. Mr Brown, who becomes prime minister next week, praised the police for the work they had done in tackling Islamist extremists and bringing them to justice. In a speech covering many aspects of law and order, Mr Brown also proposed earlier involvement with families deemed to be troublesome. \"We need to intervene earlier when children show the first signs of behavioural problems,\" he said. In an echo of Tony Blair, Mr Brown proposed that some parents might need to sign \"parenting contracts\" to \"change their own behaviour\". Mr Brown told delegates that he would not shirk from giving the police more powers to deal with weapons crime. \"The clear message needs to go out to young people that carrying a weapon will be dealt with seriously: five years for guns, two years for weapons.\" Under what he claimed would be a radical review of drugs policy, he said dealers should be named and shamed within communities and drugs education needed to be emphasised in primary schools. Mr Brown acknowledged the changing nature of policing in the 21st century, when officers have to deal with an international terrorist threat, organised crime and increasingly sophisticated internet crime while also being on the beat in communities to tackle gang culture and antisocial behaviour. He promised to provide police with the technology to reduce the hours spent on paperwork and more Taser guns to tackle the weapons threat on the streets. Ken Jones, the president of Acpo, referred to this changing role when he called for an independent commission to look at the nature and purpose of policing in England and Wales. \"We need to take politics out of the equation and we need an independent, apolitical, authoritative view about what the police service ought to be like for the next 10, 20, 30 years,\" he said. \"The police are the people and the people are the police and for a view of policing to survive it has to be seen as apolitical. Clearly the government of the day has its say, but the longer term nature and purpose of policing needs to command broad support of all political opinions, not just from one political party or another.\" Mr Jones said it was important the police were given a direction in the face of demands for more neighbourhood policing on the one hand and the need to tackle terrorism on the other. \"We are being asked to do more things, which we are taking on willingly, but we can't do everything. We do need to look at what it is we are actually here to do.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
