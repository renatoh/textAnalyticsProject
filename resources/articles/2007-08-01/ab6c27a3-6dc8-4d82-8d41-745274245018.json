As for great days, they seemed to be a thing of the past. Yet any punter will tell you that the world looks very different after a couple of decent winners, and while Sheikh Mohammed does not bet, he will have left Goodwood yesterday evening in the same gleeful mood as a backer walking out of Ladbrokes with a pocket full of cash. It took just 40 minutes for Godolphin's outlook on racing life to improve significantly, and not simply in terms of the autumn's major championship events. Their horizon now extends well into 2008 too, after Rio De La Plata's impressive success in the Group Two Vintage Stakes, while Ramonti's brave victory in the Group One Sussex Stakes should make him a serious player in races like the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes and the Breeders' Cup Mile. The relatively meagre return for the millions that Godolphin has spent on bloodstock in recent seasons has led to growing speculation that the operation has lost its way since 2004, the last season in which Saeed bin Suroor, Godolphin's trainer, was the British champion. As he enjoyed their success yesterday, though, Sheikh Mohammed insisted that there is no crisis of confidence at their stables in Newmarket. \"This is a free country and you can write what you want,\" he said, \"but I have a different idea. I have a great team, I think it is the best team in the world, and I am very happy with them.\" For Simon Crisford, Godophin's racing manager, it is a case of the racing business working in cycles, and the wheel, perhaps, now starting to turn. \"Nothing's changed since three years ago when Saeed was the champion trainer, we won \u00a34m in prize money and had six winners at Royal Ascot,\" he said. \"The only thing that's changed is the horses. \"This season and last season have been very disappointing by our standards, but we can only do the best we can with what we've got. We can only play with the cards that we have in our hands, and what goes around comes around.\" Yesterday's two victories were satisfying in different ways. Ramonti held off a late challenge by Excellent Art, in the dark blue Coolmore stud colours of John Magnier, the Sheikh's great rival in the international bloodstock business, to take the Sussex, and his courage will be a very useful attribute as the remainder of the season unfolds. \"He's a really tough horse, a big fighter, and that counts for a lot in racing,\" Frankie Dettori, his jockey, said. \"I didn't want it to be a sprint, so from two and a half out I said 'come on, let's go', and I knew that if anybody got near me he would fight because he has such a big will to win. I was a bit scared when Jamie [Spencer, on Excellent Art] came at me, but Ramonti didn't let me down.\" Rio De La Plata, meanwhile, was arguably more significant still, as he offers a realistic hope that Godolphin will have a top three-year-old colt for the first time in several seasons. He is a big, attractive colt who moved with the grace of a ballerina on the way to post and looked just as smooth as he quickened clear of Lizard Island on the way back. \"He'll probably go straight to the Dewhurst,\" Crisford said. \"He's the sort of horse who might be a possible for the new juvenile race on turf at the Breeders' Cup. He's got a great attitude and he'll have a Guineas preparation.\" Rio De La Plata was swiftly cut for the 2,000 Guineas by all the bookmakers, with Ladbrokes' quote of 14-1 comfortably better than anything their rivals could offer. Henrythenavigator, who seems to be Aidan O'Brien's main hope at this stage, is clinging to favouritism at around 8-1. Trainer Mark Johnston also had a double, but in the week when Nic Coward, chief executive at the British Horseracing Authority, called for an end to factionalism in the sport there was a reminder of the task he faces when Johnston, and other fellow trainers, refused to speak to television broadcasters. \"This is the anniversary of [the introduction of] 48-hour declarations and we've all had enough,\" said Johnston. \"We've had enough of being blamed for what has been an extremely bad job. As far as I'm concerned the boycott will go on until I see something happening.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
