First against second ended all square here but it is no exaggeration to suggest that the outcome could have been as convincing as that from last Sunday when the Premiership's leading lights met up. There was no Manchester United-Arsenal reprise because Fulham permitted Bolton to score from a direct free-kick early in the second half - it was their only attempt on target - and then allowed their own smoothly assured game to disintegrate. Their discipline went as well when the substitute Luis Boa Morte was shown the red card after retaliating with a mouthful of spittle for a heavy challenge from Robbie Elliott. \"He spat in my face twice,\" said the Bolton defender, who had to be held back by colleagues after the 80th-minute flashpoint. \"Spitting is just something you don't do in football and he did it twice.\" There can be no excusing Boa Morte's reaction even in the face of a robust rearguard deployment which sometimes leant towards physical excess.. Fulham must expect that kind of approach when their extravagant movement and passing ability leave them untouchable by opponents. \"In footballing terms they are way above everybody else,\" conceded the Bolton manager Sam Allardyce, and it hurt him to admit it with his own team next in line, albeit 12 points behind. Yesterday's result was all- important for Bolton because, having lost heavily at home to Blackburn the previous weekend, they could ill afford another crushing defeat, not with the race for second place intensifying and with their fifth-round FA Cup replay with Blackburn following on Wednesday. Yet no other outcome looked possible as Fulham were quickly into their stride, moving the ball with precision and pace across the full width of the pitch even though their opponents put five in midfield and set out to frustrate. Corners were a particular problem in the first half and after four minutes Simon Charlton was forced to clear off the line as Louis Saha met Bjarne Goldbaek's delivery. Later in the half Dean Holdsworth and Elliott came to the rescue in similar fashion. Bolton were contributing in full to their own discomfort. Maybe disorientation is a natural consequence when faced with an opposing side who protect their possession so assiduously. Nothing else could explain what happened to Colin Hendry when he completely missed his kick and set up John Collins, who could only strike the post. It did not seem to matter when, in the 42nd minute, a delicious piece of craft broke Bolton's grim resistance. Sean Davis and Rufus Brevett combined and Saha's neat turn produced a pass for Barry Hayles, who expertly threw off Hendry's challenge before dispatching a clinical finish. Bolton pulled level through Per Frandsen's set piece six minutes after half-time. And despite Lee Clark never tiring in his prompting and Collins finding the woodwork again, Fulham couldn't break their visitors' resistance. So, as the man on the public address said, just a 12-point lead. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
