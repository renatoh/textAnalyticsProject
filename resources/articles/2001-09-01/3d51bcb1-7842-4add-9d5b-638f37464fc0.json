The two concerts by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra under their music director Daniel Barenboim were an incontrovertible demonstration of the orchestra's peerless qualities, its immense tonal resources, and almost subliminal rapport with its conductor. The power of their partnership was obvious from the first few moments of Friday's concert, when the overture to Wagner's Tannhauser was given a range of dynamics that almost defied belief. But it was the Mahler symphonies (the First and Seventh) that ended the programmes that really took the breath away. A relatively recent convert to Mahler, Barenboim conducts the music with an irresistible zeal. His intensely involved readings sounded the full emotional range of the music, from the soft effusions of the First's funeral march to the brash C major assertions of the Seventh's finale, and its strange discursion into \"Turkish music\". Barenboim made all the facets of the still-puzzling Seventh cohere truthfully, just as he had plotted a faultless course through the more straightforward episodes of the First. These were exceptional performances, packed with memorable details and awe-inspiring orchestral playing. Barenboim has always made a point of promoting new music in Chicago, and both programmes included works commissioned by the orchestra. Elliott Carter's 1993 Partita is the first movement of his magnificent Symphonia, completed four years later, but remains a striking, stand-alone piece, a virtuosic play of instrumental colours punctuated by irreverent bangs and crashes, offering a kaleidoscope of moods and characterisation. Aurora is a concerto for piano and small orchestra by the CSO's current composer-in-residence Augusta Read Thomas, written for Barenboim to conduct from the keyboard. Slowly decaying notes in the piano are contrasted with sharply attacked chordal sequences; it moves towards a reconciliation of the two ideas and then unexpectedly transcends them with a female voice that emerges to pronounce a final, mysterious benediction. Conception and execution are beautifully judged; Barenboim's and his orchestra's performance (the UK premiere) was exemplary. Sandwiched between these two Proms was a late-night concert of brass and choral music, given by London Brass and the BBC Singers, and including another striking premiere. Harrison Birtwistle's Tenebrae David is a brass memorial to the composer's close friend David Sylvester, the art critic, who died in June. A brooding chorale launched by stark calls and interrupted with angry outbursts, it is stark and profoundly moving. There was also another outing for Birtwistle's millennium fanfare Sonance 2000, and a first chance to hear his beautiful Three Latin Motets divorced from their original theatrical context in The Last Supper. Here they were conducted by Stephen Cleobury and interspersed with Takemitsu's Signals from Heaven; it was a strange juxtaposition, though not as curious as the inclusion of Britten's Hymn to St Cecilia in the same programme, sounding even more mawkish and contrived than usual. The CSO Proms will be broadcast again on Radio 3 on September 17 and 18. Royal Albert Hall"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
