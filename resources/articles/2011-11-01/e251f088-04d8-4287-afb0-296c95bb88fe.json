An interview he had given to L'Equipe \u2013 spun to suggest he would review his position at the end of the season \u2013 was the subplot to Saturday's 2-1 win for Arsenal at Norwich, masterminded by Robin van Persie, who scored twice. Afterwards, Wenger felt compelled to explain himself. His contract expires in 2014, but he feels obliged to examine whether he is doing enough to justify his position. \"I said the only way I would leave is if I didn't give what was expected,\" he said. \"There are many people questioning what I do. If at the end of the season you feel you didn't deliver you have to consider. I'm committed to the club and will respect it to the last day of the contract unless I feel I'm not good enough. I have to honestly rate my performance. Did I take the maximum out of the players? After 15 years I have many questions and have to analyse the situation objectively. It is the club of my life, and will remain so unless I don't do well enough. If I really am a pain.\" Wenger is being linked with a move to Paris Saint-Germain, but emphasised: \"I'm completely committed to this club. I'm committed to my contract.\" The L'Equipe interview had been conducted a couple of weeks ago, and Wenger intimated that with the continued improvement of his team's performance and results he is feeling increasingly positive. As to the question of what constitutes a good enough finish to meet his expectations, Wenger smiled wryly at the idea that the top four is a minimum requirement. \"I have to wait and see the quality of my work at the end of the season \u2013 it is not as simple as top four or else. After the 8-2 [defeat at Old Trafford] I was determined to put things right, more than ever. These thoughts are always in my mind \u2013 every manager is like that.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
