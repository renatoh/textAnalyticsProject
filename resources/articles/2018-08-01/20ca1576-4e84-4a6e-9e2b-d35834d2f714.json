A year later, and as the club are preparing for the Champions League return leg of their qualifier against Dynamo Kyiv on Tuesday, fans are free again to exercise the extraordinary Czech talent for scepticism as Beijing dismantles CEFC China Energy. Questions over Chinese investment in European football clubs have multiplied since a clampdown in the country last year on capital flowing to such outposts. Slavia\u2019s tale of rags to riches and potentially back again will not stifle that concern. Fans are clinging to club claims that all will be fine now that the Chinese state conglomerate Citic has reportedly bought a 49% stake in CEFC Europe, the local unit that owns Slavia. However, inside the club little is known and the atmosphere is jumpy, say sources. The club\u2019s chief executive, Martin Krob, who failed to respond to questions for this article, told one supporters\u2019 group in May that he is hopeful the cash would continue to flow but the only thing that does seem clear is that CEFC \u2013 which saved Slavia in 2015 from potential bankruptcy and a decade of decline \u2013 has fallen from favour in Beijing. Military links probably powered CEFC\u2019s rapid rise from obscurity to become China\u2019s seventh largest private company. Disintegration looks likely to be even quicker. Although CEFC Europe formally owns 22 businesses in the Czech Republic, activity at its Prague offices ground to a halt in the spring, according to sources. That leaves Slavia supporters worried about skyrocketing costs. CEFC Europe provided \u00a311m in financing in 2017. In comparison Viktoria Plzen, who pipped Slavia to the 2018 title in May, made a loss when they also took the 2016 championship. \u201cSlavia cannot survive on its own,\u201d says Ondrej Kreml, the editor of the fans\u2019 forum slavistickenoviny.cz. \u201cThe worst-case scenario is if the ownership issue slides into limbo.\u201d CEFC arrived in the Czech Republic three years ago, riding on the back of a campaign by the president, Milos Zeman \u2013 an enfant terrible who enjoys whipping up controversy \u2013 to attract Chinese investment. However, that brought its own challenge. Hackles were raised when Prague was all but closed down for a visit by China\u2019s president Xi Jinping and a government minister\u2019s meeting with the Dalai Lama prompted a servile letter to Beijing. Installed in Prague castle as Zeman\u2019s adviser was Jaroslav Tvrdik, a former defence minister. CEFC\u2019s chairman, Ye Jianming, soon joined him in the presidential office. An avid Slavia fan, Tvrdik allegedly persuaded his new friend to buy the club days before a bankruptcy hearing, insisting the money could end years of mismanagement at the famously dissident club. Tvrdik, promoted to chairman of Slavia and CEFC Europe, has had run-ins with CEFC headquarters over the control of some assets, according to sources, but not Slavia. The resurrection of the Czech club was merely a vehicle to prove Chinese trustworthiness. Around \u00a32bn has been pumped into European football clubs since Xi launched a campaign to develop China into a world force in the sport. The strategy was also to open the way to acquisitions in more strategic industries. Chinese state companies are eyeing Czech plans to expand the nuclear fleet. For CEFC and Slavia the plan now looks in tatters. Ye is believed to be detained in Beijing and the club are mired in uncertainty. Tvrdik insists all is well but has offered no detail and little of his usual unbridled enthusiasm. He has denied reports that their Eden Arena will be sold a year after CEFC \u201cmiraculously\u201d bought the stadium from unknown parties. Citic has visited Slavia several times, ostensibly only to discuss building an academy to train China\u2019s Olympic team. The other 21 companies held by CEFC Europe have also been visited to gauge their potential. Received wisdom suggests CEFC wound up on the wrong side of a Beijing power shift, while the Chinese communist party is also seeking to rein in the country\u2019s debt-laden billionaires. Debt is reported at \u00a313.3bn and CEFC\u2019s assets have been put under the control of a committee led by Chinese Development Bank, the company\u2019s largest creditor. Other clubs have had trouble with Chinese money. Until securing new investors in July Aston Villa appeared to be teetering on the edge of bankruptcy due to the financial difficulties of the Chinese owner, Tony Xia; Milan were taken over by a US financial group the same month when Li Yonghong failed to pay off large debts. The Wanda Group, which bought a 20% stake in Atl\u00e9tico Madrid in 2015, is also now shedding assets, including most of its shares in the Spanish club. Such travails raise concern about investors from such opaque economies. The U-turn on Xi\u2019s footballing dream \u2013 China introduced limits on investment in overseas sports last year \u2013 complicates the picture further. Citic has some football form, holding a slice of City Football Group, the Emirati-led group that owns Manchester City and several others across the globe, but many suggest a purchase by one of the secretive local billionaires backing Zeman\u2019s Chinese investment push could be Slavia\u2019s best bet. The former Liverpool and Slavia forward Vladimir Smicer says he would welcome such a move. \u201cMaybe the Chinese will still be here for a long time, but I\u2019d prefer a Czech owner \u2013 look at Sparta,\u201d he adds, noting Slavia\u2019s fierce rival has enjoyed over a decade of stability under the billionaire Daniel Kretinsky. The Czech/Slovak financial group J&amp;T may be a candidate to fulfil Smicer\u2019s wish. Following a brief but vicious fight over CEFC\u2019s failure to pay off debt, the local billionaires signed a cooperation agreement with Citic in late May. The new Chinese owner continues to mull over plans for its new assets in the Czech Republic, as well as the fate of Tvrdik. Citic is said to be prepared to inject huge funds into Slavia in a bid to buy immediate success, but uncertainty still reigns. Following several months of tough negotiations, the Nigeria striker Peter Olayinka arrived for a club record fee of \u00a32.7m in late July but other targets have slipped away. A \u00a34.5m bid for Mahmoud Hassan collapsed when he pulled out at the last minute and assets, many procured during thee 2017 summer\u2019s transfer push, have also been shed, including the Portuguese midfielder Danny, the Ukrainian Ruslan Rotan and Turkey\u2019s Halil Altintop. Citic is also said to be upsetting the balance behind the scenes at Eden. Krob, the head of the supporters\u2019 club before Tvrdik made him general manager, has long been concerned about piling more liabilities on to the balance sheet, especially while the ownership and financing remains so opaque. He is now reported to be on his way out of the club."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
