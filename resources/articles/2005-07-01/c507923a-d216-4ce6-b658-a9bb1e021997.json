Last year, in the same publication, Loder had a team of 142 in training, of which a staggering 86 were two-year-olds, but this year he has 62 horses of which only 14 are juveniles. \u00b7 Last week's revelation in The Observer that a new daily gambling paper, The Sportsman , is to be launched next year has led to speculation among racing journalists as to who will be working for the publication. Since the announcement, it is believed the paper has wasted little time in looking for staff with several well-known writers believed to have been approached. Some are concerned that those involved may just be a little too high brow for the ordinary punter. New editor Charlie Methven, who formerly wrote The Daily Telegraph 's gossip column, was educated at Eton and Oxford, while the venture is backed by fellow Old Etonians Ben and Zac Goldsmith. The other main driving force behind the project, former Telegraph executive director Jeremy Deedes, is another Eton graduate. \u00b7 Recent racecourse attendances may not be totally good news for the British Horseracing Board's marketing department. Since William Hill won their data rights case against racing's rulers, the BHB marketing operation has been run on a virtually non-existent budget throughout 2005. So the fact that racing's popularity appears to have increased with or without the BHB's marketing efforts - they put the improvement down to more commercially driven racecourses - has led at least one major racecourse figure to suggest that the huge sums spent in that area over past years may not have been necessary. BHB marketing director Chris John is believed to be paid a six-figure salary. \u00b7 Racecourses have resorted to many side attractions in an effort to bring in the crowds, but it is debatable whether a celebrity presence at the Newbury meeting a week today is likely to draw many extra punters through the turnstiles. Wacky former children's television presenter Timmy Mallett is expected to be on hand to front the racecourse's radio station in association with BBC Radio Berkshire. \u00b7 Lindus Atenor, who made all to land a Lingfield nursery last weekend, is owned by BBC racing commentator Ian Bartlett who named her after the 19th century singer Jenny Lind. Born in Stockholm, Lind was an operatic star in Europe before being taken to the United States by the famous impresario PT Barnum in 1850 where she was a great success and gained the nickname of the Swedish Nightingale. Lindus Atenor is out of the mare Nightingale Song. Lind spent the latter part of her life in England and was a professor of singing at the Royal College of Music."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
