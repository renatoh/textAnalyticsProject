Some fields were already of russet-coloured stubble, others striped with rows of cut grass lying out to dry. We reached surviving patches of pine and gorse, relics of what was once wild heathland stretching across all the country from Poole to Christchurch, now almost totally built over by the development of Bournemouth and its suburbs. Dorset heathland declined from 40,000 hectares in 1750 to 5,600 in 1983. Only on the Studland side of Poole harbour is the landscape still relatively wild and unspoilt, though Brownsea was utterly wild for a spell in the last century. In the 1920s, a reclusive owner dispatched all other residents to the mainland, and parts of the island, long inhabited, began to revert to natural heath and woodland. Then, after the shock of a wildfire, she banned all public access to the island and retreated into a hermit's existence, allowing nature complete licence. After she died in 1961, aged 98, the island passed to the National Trust, which set about sensitive clearance and management of the woodland, open space, wetland, lagoon and beach. After landing, we took the boardwalk through the reed beds, climbed the pine hills on a carpet of cones looking for red squirrels, and gazed across Purbeck and the harbour, all the while with the sense of being apart, and on an island \u2013 albeit one that lies only a stone's throw from the affluence of the Sandbanks waterfront properties."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
