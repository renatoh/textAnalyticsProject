Consumer minister Melanie Johnson has hit out at \"arm-twisting\" companies which persuade people to part with hard-earned cash in return for holidays that never materialise. Launching the new advice scheme, Ms Johnson said holiday clubs were not linked to the rights of a particular property, as with time shares, and, therefore, consumers were not protected by legislation. \"People are being tricked into shelling out thousands of pounds on what turn out to be empty promises,\" she said. \"We now have effective laws to outlaw scams with time shares, but holidaymakers need to be warned about the tricksters seeking to get around the rules by rebranding their products as holiday clubs,\" Ms Johnson said. Often \"bait-and-trap\" techniques are used where people are offered a free holiday or gifts to attend a presentation about the scheme. Once there, they are bombarded with pressure-selling and often sign up just to get away, Ms Johnson said. Holiday club hot spots include the Costa Del Sol, Tenerife, Lanzarote, Gran Canaria and Bali. Sue and Steve Cliff of High Wycombe, Bucks, who were conned out of \u00a310,000, were approached while on holiday in Tenerife. They were taken by taxi to the company's office where they were promised four weeks' holiday a year in four-star accommodation at dates of their choice and the chance to reclaim their initial investment after 51 months. They paid an initial deposit to the company, Dinastia, of \u00a31,556.99 and then a final payment of \u00a39,450. They only received a welcome pack 13 months later, with the intervention of their solicitor. They are trying to recover their money. In conjunction with the Association of British Travel Agents, leaflets about the scams will be handed out to holidaymakers with their tickets. The Timeshare Consumers' Association receives about 70 complaints a week about holiday clubs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
