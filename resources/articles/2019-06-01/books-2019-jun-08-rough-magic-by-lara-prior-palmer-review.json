Lara Prior-Palmer was 19 when in 2013, to the surprise of all, she became the first woman to win the 1,000km Mongol Derby (the course of which is based on Genghis Khan\u2019s 13th-century horse messenger system). I am afraid of horses, bored by competitive sports and no more interested in Mongolia than a person of average curiosity should be, and yet I found Rough Magic strangely compelling. It\u2019s not the writing, which veers between adolescent philosophising (\u201canimals were our first teachers\u201d) and moments of raw brilliance. It\u2019s not the quest narrative of the race, because we know from the beginning that our heroine wins. It\u2019s not the landscape, because Prior-Palmer resists romanticism (\u201clittle rock there again, little bush here again\u201d), and if you\u2019re trying to ride across the steppe as fast as possible, landscape is mostly an inconvenience. The charm of Rough Magic is rather that of the narrator herself, an English ing\u00e9nue who could come straight from Vita Sackville-West until you see glimpses of Shirley Jackson. She enters the race after the deadline, far too late to train or even assemble the right kit for racing such a huge distance on 25 Mongolian horses. She eats all her snacks when bored at start camp before the race begins, and for the same reason takes all her painkillers, antibiotics and anti-inflammatories out of their packaging and jumbles them together unrecognisably. She forgets to take the pill and doesn\u2019t pack sanitary protection so she ends up bleeding on to the saddle. She doesn\u2019t take a change of clothes or toilet paper, is nowhere near the 5kg baggage limit, can\u2019t work the GPS. And yet, in narrative terms, she knows exactly what she is doing: the mythical version of this story, she says, \u201cappealing to a certain British psyche\u201d, is \u201cgirl on erotic power animal traverses the exotic\u201d. For most of the race she is ambivalent about the idea of winning \u2013 such a conformist obsession, unfamiliar to a natural truant, the black sheep of a family committed to getting on and getting in (to Oxford) \u2013 and the moment of triumph brings embarrassment and anticlimax. The effort, anyway, was not exactly to be first, but to stop Devan, a pink-clad Texas blonde from winning. Devan annoys Lara from the beginning by being well-trained, well-prepared, well-sponsored and hubristically certain of her own victory. Someone needs to take her down: \u201cShe does need toppling. Momentarily I imagine her with antlers.\u201d But at the end, when Devan lies weeping, \u201cquaking like a washing machine\u201d, there\u2019s just awkwardness. It\u2019s the resistance to the obvious narratives that makes Rough Magic so appealing: the book undermines lazy women-in-the-wilderness tropes at every turn. The narrator is not \u201cfeisty\u201d or \u201cquirky\u201d, just a bright young woman out of her depth, persisting out of cheerful spite and narrative momentum rather than any noble calling. She\u2019s annoyed by the horses at least as often as in mystical communion with them. She cries when things hurt, argues with her brothers in her head, doesn\u2019t call home even when she wins. The insistence on a messy, mildly malicious and generally uncooperative form of youthful success is fresh and very cheering. \u2022 Rough Magic is published by Ebury (\u00a316.99).
