Fittingly, the world junior 1500 metres champion had the longest training run of her career \u2013 albeit by mistake \u2013 yesterday morning, 24 hours after an impressive performance in her major senior debut at the Great Edinburgh International Cross Country. Twell is rated one of the top British hopes for success in London in three years' , but she insisted that will only be the starttime. \"Everyone is looking positive towards 2012 and I cannot wait,\" said Twell. \"But sport does not end in 2012. I will be 22 and it was always my ambition to be at those Olympics in the 1500m. The fact they are in London just makes it even more exciting. After that I want to step up in distance to the 5,000m for 2016, and to step up again for 2020. I like to master things and give myself challenges in life.\" On Saturday Twell mixed it with two of the top cross country women in the world. On the course at Holyrood Park that staged last year's World Cross Country Championships, Twell never looked overawed when she joined the group of leaders that included Mestawet Tufa, of Ethiopia, and the Kenyan Linet Masai, the bronze medallist, from 12 months ago. In the end Linet had the power to break away to win on the 5.6km course in 19min 2sec from Tufa in 19:13. Kenya's Viola Kibiwott was third in 19:14 with Twell fourth in 19:16. As Brendan Foster, Britain's Olympic 10,000m bronze medallist, and BBC commentator, said: \"I cannot remember ever seeing a British woman 1500m runner displaying such cross-country endurance.\" \"I'm not totally satisfied with fourth,\" said Twell. \"I have high expectations of myself. I didn't cover and go as quickly as the others when Masai made her break. Then with 200m left I needed another injection of pace which I didn't have. It's something I must work on.\" Her coach Mick Woods said: \"The marathon is something that we have planned for a long time. We have a good idea where we are moving and it depends how quick she runs the 1500m.\" With the wind blowing through her hair, tThe 19-year-old was out for 1hr 38min across the Aldershot countryside yesterday morning and this greatest young talent rising star of British athletics used it to her advantage in her long-term marathon aim. \"I didn't see this morning's run as a difficult challenge,\" she said. \"I love the freedom of such a run. It is something I relish and part of the pathway to my future.\" \"It was an accident,\" added Woods. \"The terrain we run over is great and it's just they [the training group] went slightly further out and were over the time by eight to 10 minutes. Am I worried? Why would I be worried?\" It is often said that it can take 10 years to become a world-class athlete. Twell, touted as a worthy successor to Britain's marathon world record-holder Paula Radcliffe, Twell has just completed a decade in running since she started as a nine-year-old with her father and went to Woods at Aldershot, Farnham and District club. Woods has been with her ever since. He is now UK Athletics' performance coach at St Mary's University in Middlesex where Twell is studying Strength and Conditioning Science. But for a teenager, the maturity of her scheduling is beyond her years. Twell, who spent time living in Germany, Northern Ireland and Colchester as she grew up because her father was in the army, said: \"It definitely helps that you can strive forward and have an idea where you are going. I take these characteristics into life. If am due to meet someone, I turn up on time. It is all about discipline.\" It is a philosophy that is even working in her education. She has exams this week and took revision with her to Edinburgh. She will finish her University course in 2010, leaving her enough time to prepare for London as a full-time athlete. \"Steph in an athlete who works hard to achieve what she achieves,\" said Woods. The next major step for the triple European Junior Cross Country champion should be the World Cross Country Championships in Amman, Jordan, in March before a summer season where she aims to make the 1500m at the World Championships in Berlin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
