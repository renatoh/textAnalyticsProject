Sir Jeremy Greenstock told MPs on a Commons committee that Mr Straw had asked him not to release his book, saying he would be \"letting the system down\" by writing about his experiences. Sir Jeremy said he thought the foreign secretary wrongly feared the book would be damaging to the government and that his intervention played a part in his decision to put his book on hold. The diplomat has written about his time as Britain's special representative in Baghdad from September 2003 to March 2004. He submitted a draft of the book to the Foreign Office for vetting. He went to see Mr Straw last July after being told the foreign secretary had \"strong objections\" to the book. Giving evidence to the House of Commons' public administration select committee, Sir Jeremy said: \"He said he thought it was going against the norm, that I was letting the system down and he believed in quite severe restrictions in the whole area of publishing one's official experiences. \"He hoped I would consider what he was saying and desist.\" But he said it was clear Mr Straw had not read the text. \"I was a bit puzzled he was saying it without having looked at my text, particularly as I thought what I was writing was helpful to the government's case on Iraq rather than the opposite,\" Sir Jeremy said. He said there was not much in the book that was sensitive or critical. But he accepted \"some parts of government\" would have been angry if he pressed ahead with publication. He also denied there was anything in the book which could damage Britain's relationship with the United States. Sir Jeremy denied he had caved in to pressure from Mr Straw to shelve the book. He said after Mr Straw's intervention, officials requested further changes to the book. He also said the atmosphere had become more \"febrile\" because of a row over the publication of the memoirs of Sir Christopher Meyer, Britain's former ambassador to Washington. He insisted it was his decision to put the book on hold. He said it could be published in the future, saying it was \"not in the deep-freeze, it's in the fridge\". In a memo to the committee he added: \"Contrary to the impression gained ... the final decision was mine. It remains my decision whether to return to the book in the future.\" Another former British diplomat, Sir Christopher Meyer, was accused of breaching confidences by the same committee in December, after publishing memoirs in which he accused cabinet ministers of being \"political pygmies\". The former Labour foreign secretary and SDP founder, Lord Owen, also gave evidence to the committee today about the writing of his autobiography. He said the \"mess\" over political memoirs from politicians and civil servants stemmed from the separation between impartial administration and political decision-making becoming \"damagingly blurred\". In his memo to the committee he said: \"I have never known a time in the last 40 years when there has been so much disillusionment, bordering on contempt, for politicians by civil servants and diplomats and vice-versa.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
