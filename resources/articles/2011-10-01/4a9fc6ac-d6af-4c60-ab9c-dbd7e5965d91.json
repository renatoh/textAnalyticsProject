Setting up shop at the Cairndale Hotel in Dumfries, the proximity to the border should attract soul worshippers from all over the country, keen to soak up the vibe generated by over 50 international DJs and live acts. Headliners include Chicago house legend Lil Louis, best known for his 1989 hit French Kiss, deep house don Kerri Chandler, Wigan Pier veteran Greg Wilson and New York producer/DJ Todd Terry, plus live action from disco chanteuse Evelyn \"Champagne\" King, Cassio Ware, Deep City Soul and Debbie Taylor. Scots soul boys Gareth Sommerville, Harri and Dave \"Klink\" Allan show off their mixing skills, while keen amateurs can book a slot for the open deck sessions. Cairndale Hotel, English Street, Fri to 6 Nov Patric Baird Tummy Touch 15th Anniversary Party, London Fifteen years is an inordinately long time in dance music, so congratulations are in order for Tim \"Love\" Lee, who's guided his Tummy Touch label safely to its crystal anniversary, a landmark due to be celebrated with a glass or two of rum punch at XOYO this Friday. Tummy Touch enjoyed early success, scoring a chart hit with Groove Armada's At The River, before carving a niche for itself as a reliable purveyor of frisky downtempo exotica, with bongo-heavy releases from the likes of Tutto Matto and Los Chicharrons. In more recent years, the label's put out albums by Tom Vek and New York heavy disco collective The Phenomenal Handclap Band, both of whom appear here (the former on the decks, the latter live on stage). Other DJs include Andy Spence of New Young Pony Club, and Mr \"Love\" Lee himself, sure to be rocking the most extravagant facial hair in the building. XOYO, EC2, Fri Sam Richards Mulletover Halloween 2011, London Mulletover's Halloween party is always the busiest event on its calendar, which is why this year it's swapped the dingy environs of the Great Suffolk Street Warehouse for the 3,000-capacity Proud2. The relatively glitzy venue will become a ghoulish rave den for the night, with the Bitch N' Stitch crew on hand to provide revellers with suitably hair-raising Halloween makeovers. Room One is headlined by two DJs who rarely disappoint, Berlin minimal house stalwarts Steve Bug and Tobi Neumann, plus there's a live set from Israel's Guy Gerber, who's hopefully not too traumatised from his recent stint working with P Diddy. Room Two sees Andrew Weatherall and Ivan Smagghe dropping spine-chilling tunes together under their Wrong Meeting guise. Proud2, SE10, Sat Sam Richards Hit&amp;Run, Manchester Long loved, its slow dilapidation lamented by both clubbers and live music fans, Manchester cheered at the recent purchase and refurb of the Ritz. Gig listings so far don't overly impress and most new club nights seem to have slipped into the obvious territory offered by previous owners, so the city's promoters and cool clubbers are all looking to Hit&amp;Run for a gauge on what potential lies here. Their Halloween edition is an especially dark and twisted offering, including dubstep act Tek-One live alongside DJ sets from Phace, drum'n'bass DJ Fred V and regulars Chimpo and Elvee. HMV Ritz, Whitworth Street West, Mon Marc Rowlands Westfest, Shepton Mallet Just as hardcore in the matter of intemperate climate survival as they are in BPMs, Slammin' Vinyl's Westfest takes place tonight at Shepton Mallet's Showground. As usual, it's a seven-arena beast with a tilt twixt drum'n'bass and hardcore plus every sub-genre in between. The relatively surprise-free lineup includes Andy C, Dougal, Hixxy and Darren Styles, although one innovation is a gabba and hardcore techno arena hosted by Twisted's Darkside.
