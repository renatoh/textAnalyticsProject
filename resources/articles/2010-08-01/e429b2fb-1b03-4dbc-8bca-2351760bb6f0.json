Labour now holds just 10 of the 200 seats in the east, south-east and south-west. If we want to win the next election, we have to build trust and support in seats like ours. We are all supporting Ed Balls because he best understands what we need to do to regain the trust of voters we lost in the south. Some may suppose our main challenge is how we appeal to middle-income voters. While it's vital we do not lose their support, close analysis of the results shows they largely stuck with us. The real challenge, as in the rest of the country, is winning back millions of voters on lower incomes, who felt we were no longer in touch with their concerns about jobs, housing, fair migration and protecting our public services. Ed Balls has addressed many of these issues in his campaign. He understands our area and the hopes, fears and aspirations of the voters we lost this time round. And we believe he is the candidate best placed to set out a credible economic alternative to the deflationary mistakes being made by the Tories and Lib Dems, campaign hard to shorten the life of this coalition government and win again in the south and across the country.
