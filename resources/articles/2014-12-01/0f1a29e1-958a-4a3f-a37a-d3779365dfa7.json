Netflix\u2019s flagship drama signalled its return in typically stylish and intriguing fashion with a 12-second teaser video that was captioned \u201cA special message from the White House\u201d and had the date of 27 February included. Spacey won plaudits playing the dangerously ambitious career politician Frank Underwood and helped Netflix bag a hit with an original drama, albeit one that was based on a British series of the same name. Kevin Spacey\u2019s co-star Robin Wright was also featured on the clip and plays his Lady Macbeth-esque wife Claire, who is known to utter lines such as \u201cSeduce him. Give him your heart. Cut it out and put it in his fucking hands.\u201d Along with showing the third series of House Of Cards, Netflix will also be launching in Australia and New Zealand in early 2015 and developing an adaptation of Lemony Snicket\u2019s A Series Of Unfortunate Events. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 December 2014. An earlier version gave the quote from Claire Underwood incorrectly as \u201cCut out his heart and put it in his hands\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
