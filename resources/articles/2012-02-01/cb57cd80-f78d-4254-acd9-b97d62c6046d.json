The Liverpool manager said of Su\u00e1rez, who has not played since the 1-1 draw with Blackburn Rovers on Boxing Day: \"He'll want to play, won't he? There is a lot to be taken into consideration \u2013 the way the other boys have played without him and the fact he has not played for a month. \"After five or six weeks out, it's not automatic someone will come straight back into the team. It depends on the individual, it depends on our needs; not just who we have available but who we are playing against.\" Su\u00e1rez has always been good at beginnings; almost exactly a year ago he scored at Anfield 16 minutes into his Liverpool debut. It was his first domestic club game since a seven-match suspension for biting PSV Eindhoven's Otman Bakkal while playing for Ajax two and a half months before. At the start of this season, Su\u00e1rez had been given three weeks off after playing the pivotal role in Uruguay's Copa Am\u00e9rica triumph. He was thrown straight into the opening fixture against Sunderland and scored after a dozen minutes before fading badly in the second half. Dalglish said he was astonished that Su\u00e1rez, Andy Carroll and Steven Gerrard have spent only 69 minutes together on the pitch. The combination of two very different strikers, who cost Liverpool \u00a358m, supplied by perhaps the finest English midfielder of his generation should have been irresistible. However, injuries, Su\u00e1rez's suspension and Carroll's indifferent form have meant the trio have barely featured together. But all are available for the match on Monday night. Gerrard was rested for the 3-0 win at Wolverhampton Wanderers but will return at Anfield. Carroll, who had not scored a Premier League goal in three months, found the net at Molineux while there is an argument for reintroducing Su\u00e1rez in front of his own supporters. The alternative would be pitching him in at Old Trafford for his first game since his ban. \"I had no idea Stevie, Luis and Andy had played so infrequently together but they have been injured at different times,\" said Dalglish. \"We'd better put them together in training to see if they can play together. \"Steven was overworked in the run-up to the Wolves game; we were probably a little unfair on him asking him to play against Manchester City, Manchester United and Bolton. It was best he got a well-deserved break but he should be back. \"Certainly, things are looking better. Andy is looking strong now at the end of games \u2013 he was running strongly at the end of the Wolves match.\" When Su\u00e1rez and Carroll were paraded 12 months ago, the talk was that they would form the kind of little and large partnership Anfield had not seen since Kevin Keegan and John Toshack formed the spearhead of Bill Shankly's sides. In the event, they have made little impact as a pairing and Dalglish said they might have to adapt like Dirk Kuyt, who came to Merseyside from Feyenoord as an out-and-out striker, has done. \"If they are asked to play in a position that might not be a number one choice but they are comfortable in, then that is helpful.\" They will be facing the only side to have won at Anfield since Dalglish's return, although the Liverpool manager said that game in May featured \"the stupidest penalty I have ever seen\". There were no excuses for the 4-0 beating Tottenham handed out at White Hart Lane in September. The dismissals of Charlie Adam and Martin Skrtel may have contributed to the size of the defeat but Harry Redknapp's side had been in command before the red cards came out. Even after Spurs had endured heavy defeats by City and United early in the season, Dalglish predicted Tottenham would be \"right up there\" come the business end of the campaign and he still considers them championship material. \"If they hadn't had so many players unavailable at the start then the results they got against the two Manchester clubs may have been a little bit more positive,\" he said. \"They deserve to be where they are, if not higher. There are still 15 games to go. They can still do it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
