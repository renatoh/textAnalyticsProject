The beeping. The PA announcements. The fluorescent lights. The deliberately disorientating layouts. The way you have to crouch to reach the cheapest item and constantly resist the bright and shiny objects placed right at eye level. They\u2019ve been socially engineered over decades to make you spend more than you\u2019d like to, on things you don\u2019t need. Even for competent adults it\u2019s meant to be tough. I am not a competent adult. I am highly distractible. One look at a bag of rotisserie chicken and I\u2019ll flash back 15 years to my time behind the checkout counter, bodily resisting the urge to vomit as I swiped whiffy charcoal chooks through the scanner on an underage hangover. Even when I enter with a meticulously planned list, I can\u2019t stick with it. Another thing I\u2019m too distracted for? Writing a meticulously planned grocery list. All this before we even contemplate the ethics. The palm oil, unfair labour practices, out-of-season figs and acres of unnecessary plastic. In season two of Fleabag, when Phoebe Waller-Bridge got down on her knees in a confessional booth and said \u201cI just think I want someone to tell me how to live my life\u201d, it could have been me, on aisle three, seconds from requiring a clean up. So I submitted myself to a higher power. I abandoned the vanity of deciding what to eat. I abandoned the torment of procuring it. Every Sunday morning, my partner and I undertake a sacrament. We walk to the farmer\u2019s market and pick up a veggie box. If this activity sounds painfully middle-class, you\u2019d be right. But just because it\u2019s got the trappings of bourgeois virtue-signalling doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not economical. For $44 a week, we get more than enough fruit and vegetables to feed two adults, and a carton of 10 eggs, from cheerful chickens. The veggie box is comprised of whatever\u2019s cheap and plentiful week to week \u2013 which means whatever is currently in season. When we planned our meals in advance and shopped for groceries in the supermarket, our food bills were far higher. Whatever\u2019s in the box forms the central basis of our meals for the week. We do not choose what we\u2019ll eat. The box chooses for us \u2013 we just augment its contents with protein and spice. Often that protein is the eggs, from the box. The veggie box allows me to be a better person than I actually am. I do not eat local, seasonally sourced produce of my own volition. The box makes me do it. I do not fit in a five-a-day because I have the willpower to make healthful choices \u2013 I do it because vegetables are the only thing in the house, and thus the easiest thing to eat. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning I did not learn to pickle leftover produce because food waste is a climate scourge, I did it because otherwise the contents of the next box will look over my crisper with judging, potato eyes and find their accomodation lacking. I do not home-dry fresh chamomile for tea because it sounds like a lovely thing to do (it is), I do it because there was chamomile in the box, and so the chamomile must be consumed. At the moment, I\u2019m reading Wendy Wood\u2019s Good Habits Bad Habits. In the book she details how much of our day is spent in thoughtless automaticity. We run along tracks we\u2019ve already carved without much care and attention. These tracks can be good for us, or they can be profoundly destructive \u2013 it all depends on our environment. So much of the environment that\u2019s built for us is designed to trap us into making the worst possible choices. To pick the bright and shiny objects that have been set for us at eye level. What we think of as convenient is actually draining \u2013 it drains our health, our wallets and our environmental resources. A cheap, seasonal veggie box is a different kind of habit. It places that choice in the hands of a person that knows best \u2013 in my case farmer Hapi and his wife Cath \u2013 and allows me to repeat the benefits of their good decision making. Sure, there\u2019s joy to be found in deciding what you\u2019ll cook for the week \u2013 but for me, that joy can only flourish amid constraints. The veggie box means I no longer have to deliberate at the grocery store \u2013 by robbing me of choice, it has given me freedom."}, "isHosted": false}}}
