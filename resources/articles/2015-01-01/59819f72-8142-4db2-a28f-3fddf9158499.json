Pardew was approaching his 34th birthday in the summer of 1995 and the end of his playing spell at Charlton Athletic when he was taken on a brief loan by Tottenham to feature in their unwanted Intertoto Cup campaign. The club played four matches at the tournament\u2019s group phase and the final one, four days after Pardew had turned 34, was the farcical 8-0 away loss to K\u00f6ln. Tottenham picked a team of youngsters, reserves and players on loan in all of the games, as they had been opposed to playing in the first place, but the problem was that K\u00f6ln took it extremely seriously. The German club, who had hoped to advance into the Uefa Cup, took Tottenham apart in a tie marked by cracking goals, bad hairstyles and black comedy. Chris Day, who is still playing for Stevenage in League Two, was in goal for Tottenham that day, aged 19, and he described it as \u201cTottenham reserves against World Cup players.\u201d He remembers how his opposite number, Bodo Illgner, the Germany World Cup winner in 1990, told him beforehand that he was warming up at the wrong end. \u201cIn a way, I suppose I am part of Spurs\u2019 history,\u201d Pardew said, of his involvement in the 8-0 defeat. \u201cIt was the end of my career and I was looking for a club. I was asked: \u2018Would you like to come to play in the Intertoto Cup for Spurs?\u2019 I said: \u2018OK, that sounds like a good idea.\u2019 It was specifically on that basis. \u201cI remember the live TV cameras being there. That was the first time I saw a camera behind the goal and I thought: \u2018This is going to be entertaining,\u2019 bearing in mind it was their first team. We literally had the youth team, a couple of reserves, and some mercenaries \u2013 I was one of them. I still enjoyed it. It was a great experience.\u201d Gerry Francis was the Tottenham manager but he left control of the team to his assistant, Chris Hughton. None of the club\u2019s first-team players were involved. \u201cI don\u2019t recall seeing Francis at the games,\u201d Pardew said. \u201cHe was probably watching from the beach somewhere.\u201d Sheffield Wednesday and Wimbledon also played in that summer\u2019s Intertoto Cup, with Wednesday taking it seriously \u2013 they narrowly failed to emerge from the group stage. However, like Tottenham, Wimbledon had not wanted to play and they also picked weakened teams to exit after poor results. Both Tottenham and Wimbledon were banned by Uefa from European competition as a result of their selections but the punishment was lifted on appeal. Pardew joined Barnet on a free transfer after the Intertoto Cup and he played there for two seasons before moving into management. Tottenham had been forced into playing the Intertoto Cup by the authorities and they can highlight the circumstances behind the thrashing by K\u00f6ln. But the fact remains that Uefa and Fifa recognised it as an official match and, as such, it has entered the record books."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
