The season is still young \u2013 this is only round seven of 19 \u2013 but with the title fight now finely balanced and both drivers looking for an edge, the magnificent Circuit Gilles Villeneuve may yet mark a tipping point. Undoubtedly Hamilton had the measure of his team-mate in the opening races, taking four poles and three wins, but Rosberg came back in Spain with a victory from the front of the grid. Then there was Monaco. Mercedes\u2019 error in sending Hamilton to the pits under the safety car cost him the win that he had thoroughly deserved after a dominant performance, and handed Rosberg victory. Hamilton was resolutely uninterested in discussing the mistake again in Canada but the win that fell into Rosberg\u2019s lap has put him just 10 points behind his team-mate, making Sunday\u2019s race a challenge for control of the title fight. Hamilton is looking to put Monaco behind him as quickly as possible with another win, and Rosberg needs to prove that he can repeat his form from Spain and mount a credible bid for the championship. Realistically the fight is between the pair of them, with Mercedes still enjoying a significant advantage over the rest of the field. But it is one made all the more interesting by their starkly contrasting characters. Recently Bernie Ecclestone emphasised this when in conversation with Rosberg. \u201cWhen it comes to F1 I am a huge Lewis fan because he is a super promoter of the sport. From a pure business aspect \u2013 sorry, Nico, if I have to say this \u2013 you are not so good for my business,\u201d he said. \u201cI still believe that Lewis is the best champion that we have had in a long, long time. He manages to get to all different walks of life: red carpet, fashion, business, and music \u2013 you name it. That is not your [Nico\u2019s] fault or his. You two are just very different characters.\u201d As the sport\u2019s promoter, it is hardly surprising Ecclestone is in favour of the attention Hamilton\u2019s lifestyle brings to Formula One. But he also has a point, amply demonstrated by Rosberg\u2019s level-headed response. \u201cHe wants some movement out there, and Lewis does a lot of that in his own way,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m a bit more reserved in that sense, so it is not something that surprised me.\u201d Reserved indeed, but he is also articulate, considered and quick, with a driving style to match. At this race last year both Mercedes suffered failures to their MGU-K energy recovery systems. Without it acting to slow the car there was a huge load on the rear brakes. The pair continued to battle but it was Hamilton, who likes to aggressively carry speed into the corners, who lost his brakes and had to retire. Had the pair kept fighting doubtless Rosberg\u2019s would have gone too, but he managed to bring his car home in second \u2013 a result he considers one of his best. His response to the win in Monaco was equally measured. It was, he said, \u201cone of the luckiest. It wasn\u2019t as emotional as the previous years, part of me really felt for the other side of the garage, who deserved it and it just went wrong. So that took some of the joy away.\u201d Which is all eminently reasonable but also in its way indicative of what many see as the lack of excitement and character present in modern drivers. Hamilton, however, as Ecclestone has recognised, is happy fully to embrace everything that goes with what is surely one of the best jobs in the world. His lifestyle \u2013 hanging out with the Kardashians, making music in LA \u2013 has attracted criticism, to which in Canada he was giving short shrift. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live to any ideal,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m being a grown-up and I am a world champion. I don\u2019t want to live as a world champion as everyone expects a world champion to be \u2013 I want to live how I perceive a world champion should be and behave.\u201d He admits to having matured over the past few years, and it can be seen in the way he deals with setbacks such as that at Monaco, but with the caveat that to have expected him not to have grown would be foolish. \u201cOver the years I try to do what I want to do and everyone has an opinion about what I do and I think, \u2018Just focus on your own life\u2019. Don\u2019t watch me, I\u2019m doing what I like to do and I\u2019m sorry if it doesn\u2019t make you happy,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s strange because people say a Formula 1 driver has to fit into this square box. Jim Clark, Gilles Villeneuve, all these drivers fit square in that box. Just because I don\u2019t doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not good for the sport.\u201d Nor does it have any impact on the day job, which is as important as ever. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he replied when asked whether he believed winning meant as much to him as it did to Clark. There is no doubt Rosberg feels the same but both drivers, different as they may be in their roles in the circus, will feel the need to impose their own personal perspective with a win in Canada."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
