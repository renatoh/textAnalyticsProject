But frequently the most exciting aspect is keeping an eye out for the plonker who forgets to lick his top lip after a long slurp of latte. You might be surprised to know, however, that such assemblies are full of useful opportunities. Whether it's impressing your tutor or stunning your new boss, a meeting is an ideal environment to make a big impression. Just be sure that it's a good one. 1. Be prepared \"Doing your homework is very important. It reduces the number of assumptions you make about the agendas that might be present,\" says Gill Brewer, business psychologist. \"It's really about chatting to people, finding out what it's about and who is going to be there. It reduces the element of surprise.\" And if there's any related reading material, scan through it beforehand and consider what points you would like to raise, if any. 2. Get there early Make sure you take a notepad and a couple of pens. And Gill suggests turning up five or ten minutes early with the aim of making some form of connection with everybody as they arrive. You can chat about the weather or join in with whatever else people are talking about. It doesn't have to be fascinating, just functional. Even if you merely nod your head and smile at new arrivals you're establishing yourself as a valid member of this particular gathering. 3. Make your presence felt That strong sense of being involved and enthusiastic needs to continue right through the dullest discussions. \"In other words, lots of eye contact with the person who is speaking, nodding with the points that you agree with and maybe make some notes,\" says Cristina Stuart, managing director of communications training company, Speakfirst. You can even make some verbal sounds of agreement. But don't get too carried away; you don't want to end up looking like a nodding dog in the back of a white Escort. 4. Speak up If you have something to say, ensure it can be heard. \"The last thing you want is to make some comment and have it ignored completely,\" says Cristina. \"Speak more loudly than you feel comfortable - that's usually about right - and more slowly than you feel comfortable with. Inevitably when people start speaking they feel nervous and they speak too quickly.\" They also fiddle anxiously with hair, jewellery, ties or pens. Don't, says Cristina. It's distracting and this along with the stuttered 'ums' and 'ers, 'you knows' and 'I means', will devalue your message and make you seem less confident. \"When you're making a point, stick to it and don't digress,\" says Gill, even if the atmosphere is relaxed and encourages chatter. \"Meetings flow in and out of being formal and informal and if you're a newcomer it's not about getting too cosy.\" 5. Deal with interruptions Just as you want to get that crucial point across, somebody interrupts. \"It's very important to have a couple of phrases that you can use,\" says Cristina. She suggests saying simply, 'Let me just finish this section, then I'll come back to that point'. But this does have to be done quite firmly as people are often keen to get their voices heard, even if it's at your expense. 6. Take action \"Offer to get involved with any action points that have been agreed,\" says Gill. \"That's another way of getting heard and it ensures your place for the next session because you have to report back.\" However, be realistic about the time you have to commit to the work. You won't look too clever if you don't have time to complete the project you were so keen to take on board. 7. Set your goals Know what you want to get out of it, says Gill. Meetings can be good forums for personal development and give you an opportunity to practise assertiveness and communication skills. It's a high risk strategy if there are very senior personnel present but if there are people who you feel comfortable with then go for it. \"Finally,\" says Gill \"leave only a good impression. Don't cock it all up by telling a rude joke just before you leave.\" Wit is a tricky area and for the experienced meeting attendees only - as are lattes. Speakfirst runs a range of spoken communication courses which include 'Effective Presentations' and 'Personal Impact'.
