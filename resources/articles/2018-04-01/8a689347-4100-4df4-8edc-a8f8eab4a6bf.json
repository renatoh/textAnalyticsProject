Liverpool have beaten the newly crowned champions three times this year, sealing a place in the Champions League semi-finals against Roma as a result, yet trail City by 17 points in the Premier League having played a game more. Klopp believes it will be possible to close that gap next season despite expecting City to improve. \u201cUnfortunately, the job City have done in the last few years is outstanding,\u201d the Liverpool manager said. \u201cThey brought together a team in a fantastic age. There is still a lot to come from them. They will not stop refreshing the squad, that\u2019s clear, but whatever they do it will stay possible to beat them \u2013 that\u2019s how it is. \u201cThe gap between us and City didn\u2019t happen in the games against them, it happened in the other games. It\u2019s not important how good City will be, it\u2019s about how we can get all the other points plus the points we got so far again. That is why it is always possible to be closer. But are they able to dominate? They don\u2019t have a limit to spending, so I don\u2019t know. \u201cMaybe it depends on all of us. Our age group is good as well, the best years are coming. That\u2019s why we try to build on it.\u201d Klopp has vowed to field a strong team at West Bromwich on Saturday despite hosting Roma in the first leg on Tuesday, insisting qualification for next season\u2019s Champions League remains a priority. And he believes competition at the top of the Premier League will intensify next year with Liverpool aiming \u201ca little bit higher\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t fear the challenge,\u201d he said. \u201cThis year, if City plays a normal season, which they didn\u2019t do, then it would be really close until the end because we are now all close together. \u201cUnited is four points ahead, Tottenham is two points behind. It\u2019s a real fight for all positions. All the big six pretty much delivered this year but City delivered best. It\u2019s difficult to deal with success just as it is difficult to deal with other things in football but I\u2019m sure they will be strong again. It doesn\u2019t make life easier but it\u2019s not impossible for us to step a little bit higher.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
