But it was probably the best of his three formula one victories so far, a 70-lap marathon throughout which he was kept on his toes by the presence of Kimi Raikkonen's Ferrari looming large in his McLaren's mirrors. From pole position Hamilton was able to accelerate cleanly into the lead going into the first corner, swinging confidently across the nose of Nick Heidfeld's BMW Sauber as Raikkonen came charging through from the second row to relegate the German driver to third place as the pack scrambled out of the tricky 180-degree turn. From that point on, Hamilton was never headed in a race where he had to judge carefully the way he lapped slower cars, straining to avoid sliding wide on the treacherous build-up of rubber debris which awaited the unwary off the racing line. \"It was a very emotional race and an eventful weekend,\" said the British driver. \"During the last two weeks the team has done a great job with the car and we have definitely made a step forward. However, the Ferrari was also as fast today and during the final laps Kimi put a lot of pressure on me. \"I managed to pull out a slight gap in the first stint but during the last two stints I had some slight problems with the steering of the car. This meant that Kimi was able to close on me, which made me a little nervous. But the team told me on the radio that all was well, which meant I could push right to the end.\" Behind Heidfeld, Fernando Alonso was satisfied with fourth, although he blamed traffic for missing out on a top-three finish. The McLaren driver, who was demoted from pole position to sixth place on the grid after Saturday's qualifying incident, was stuck behind Toyota's Ralf Schumacher for several laps, losing a lot of time to the leaders. Once in clean air he lapped a lot faster but eventually had to settle for fourth, right behind Heidfeld. \"We knew it's very hard to overtake at this circuit,\" the Spaniard said. \"We know it's hard starting from behind, and we were dreaming about reaching the podium. We were close but it wasn't enough. But fourth place is not bad. I lost one point compared to the maximum that was possible for us. \"I spent the whole race with traffic, first with Ralf and then with Heidfeld, and it was pretty hard to drive with someone in front.\" The world champion is now seven points behind Hamilton but believes that Saturday's penalty robbed him of a possible victory. \"It's a lost opportunity because I think this weekend I was faster,\" Alonso added. \"Yesterday I got pole and today when I was in clean air I was very fast, so I think I could have won, but it was not to be. In three weeks there's another race and I'll try again.\" The Spaniard, however, is confident that the title battle is still far from over. \"I think it's not going to be decided until the last race. I was two points behind and now I'm seven behind, but we were 14 behind a few races ago so we are doing fine.\" Hamilton, of course has other ideas. Felipe Massa had a race to forget. During Saturday's qualifying his Ferrari ran out of fuel in the pit lane and had to be pushed back to be refuelled. He ended up 14th on the starting grid and finished the race in 13th place, his worst result of the season after a no-finish in Canada. \"It was a horrible race. There are no other words to describe it,\" the Brazilian said. \"But I have not lost confidence. We must not give up.\" Massa's troubles were magnified by the success of his team-mate, Raikkonen. With McLaren not adding any points in the constructors' championship because of an FIA penalty, a better performance from Massa could have helped Ferrari substantially close the gap with the British team. The Italian team still carved eight points from the McLaren lead and now trail 138-119. Since Robert Kubica's horrendous crash at the Canadian grand prix in June the Pole has quickly returned to form, scoring points in four successive races, just as he scored in the three before Canada. Along with his team-mate, Heidfeld, who finished third yesterday, Kubica has led BMW to the \"best of the rest\" title, behind McLaren and Ferrari. His fifth place at the Hungaroring helped BMW add 10 points, the most scored by the team at a single race. \"My race was pretty good,\" said Kubica, who started seventh on the grid. \"I had to start with used tyres, therefore the first laps were very difficult for me. Nick had a good result and this is good for the team.\" BMW are in third place with 71 points, more than double the 33 accumulated so far by Renault, the defending constructors' champions."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
