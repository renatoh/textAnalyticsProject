MacColl died after being struck by a speedboat propeller while diving in a marine nature reserve off the Mexican island of Cozumel. Observer journalist and author Will Buckley joins David Dein (Arsenal FC), David Mellor (broadcaster) and Peter Salmon (BBC) for Is Football TV's Own Goal?. Chaired by Stuart Cosgrove (Channel 4), the panel will examine whether the saturation of live football coverage available on TV could lead to overexposure of the \"beautiful game\". And if so what does this hold for the future for both broadcasters and the game? \u00b7 The Edinburgh TV Festival runs from 27-29 August.
