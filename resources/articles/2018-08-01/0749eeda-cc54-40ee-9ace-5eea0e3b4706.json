The bees had swarmed the hotdog stand, a block south of Times Square, around 1pm. Thousands watched a Reuters livestream \u2013 the stand is located outside the news agency\u2019s New York headquarters \u2013 and followed on Twitter as a police officer was called in to remove the bees. With a vacuum cleaner. A section of the street at the corner of 42nd Street and 7th Avenue was closed as the delicate procedure took place. Officers from the New York police department stood guard, some more willingly than others, as one of their colleagues donned a beekeeper\u2019s hat and approached the hotdog stand. The bees had gathered in a densely packed, roughly 15-square-foot clump, and the unidentified officer, who wore a white jacket, thick gloves and has a moustache, proceeded to vacuum up the bees. The bee cleansing took about 40 minutes, much of which was watched online. By around 3pm, the officer, who told journalists he \u201chas training\u201d, had removed the bulk of the bees, but many remained in the area, swarming around a selection of soft drinks displayed on the hotdog stall. Asked if it was safe to remain in the area, a uniformed police officer pointed to his colleague and said: \u201cHe\u2019s sucking them up.\u201d He added: \u201cThere\u2019ll be no more problems.\u201d Andrew Cot\u00e9, who runs the New York City beekeepers\u2019 association, had answered a call from the NYPD and was watching as the bees were removed. Removal by vacuum cleaner \u2013 it was a specially adapted vacuum cleaner \u2013 was common, Cot\u00e9 said. He estimated there were 20,000 bees on the umbrella, but said: \u201cYou\u2019ve got to count the legs and divide by six to be sure.\u201d Cot\u00e9 said of the bees\u2019 motivation: \u201cI think they wanted a hotdog.\u201d Under further questioning, Cot\u00e9 clarified that he was joking about the bees wanting a hotdog, and instead this late-August swarm had likely occurred because of an ill-managed beehive. He said there were a number of hives within a block of the hotdog stand. By 3.15pm police had re-opened the street, although a number of bees were still on the scene. Cot\u00e9 chastised the Guardian for ducking as some of the bees flew past. \u201cYou won\u2019t die,\u201d Cot\u00e9 said. \u201cUnless you\u2019re anaphylactic.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
