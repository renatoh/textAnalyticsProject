Made a decent save from Alexander-Arnold. 6 Kieran Trippier Did not enjoy facing Man\u00e9 but only rarely got really turned by the Senegal striker. Did not turn Liverpool and attack either, though. 5 Toby Alderweireld One half of a Belgian partnership, he was steady and secure at the back and was not often troubled by Roberto Firmino. 6 Jan Vertonghen The other Belgian dealt well with Salah when Spurs got turned and the Egyptian went beyond Rose. Struggled with an arm injury at one point. 7 Danny Rose Broke through Liverpool\u2019s press and into space beyond. Nutmegged Salah only to then put ball straight out of play. 6 Harry Winks Helped Spurs gain control (65% possession by half\u2011time) after the early setback, tidy, bar one or two stray passes. 7 Moussa Sissoko Played well but 22 may for ever be the number that defines his final, the second when he raised an arm in open invitation. 6 Christian Eriksen Moments of quality, including the superb pass that almost put Son clear, but they were only moments from the Dane. 6 Dele Alli Had arguably Spurs\u2019s three best chances: one was blocked, one was headed over, one looped gently into the arms of Alisson. 6 Harry Kane Had more joy bringing others in than receiving from them. Late and sought-for tumble spoke of frustration for the returning forward. 5 Son Heung-min The man Spurs looked to after going behind and as they accelerated late on, but only occasionally did the South Korean find incision. 7 Substitutes Lucas Moura for Winks 66 Came on and might have levelled it with 85th minute volley. 6 Eric Dier for Sissoko 74 Indecisive in the final goal. 5 Fernando Llorente for Alli 82 There was to be no miracle this time. n/a Liverpool Alisson The Brazilian made his first save in the 80th minute and his second six seconds later, then stopped Eriksen\u2019s free-kick. 7 Trent Alexander-Arnold Threat was implicit in every run and cross from the man who has so many assists but it was rarely realised. Fizzed a shot past the far post. 7 J\u00f6el Matip Strong and alert, the Cameroonian made a handful of important interceptions and was decisive in the second goal. 7 Virgil van Dijk Calm and commanding in the air once again. Came up with a superb response when it looked as if Son might get in with 15 minutes left. 7 Andy Robertson Perhaps more restrained than normal but worried Spurs when he did run and produced a rasping shot towards the end of the first half. 7 Jordan Henderson Industry, interceptions, tirelessness. Henderson, in other words. The Liverpool captain scuffed his late shot wide but it did not matter. 6 Fabinho The Brazilian started a little sluggishly on the ball but grew into the game. 6 Georginio Wijnaldum One lovely ball for Salah, scampering up the inside-left line. Control rather than creation, though, and the semi-final star went off early. 6 Mohamed Salah First touch, goal. Stretched Spurs but he found Vertonghen waiting whenever he came inside away from Rose. 6 Roberto Firmino Departed before the hour having had very little impact. Legitimate to ask whether a player who missed the end of the season was fully fit. 5 Sadio Man\u00e9 Did he aim for Sissoko\u2019s arm? Last year\u2019s scorer against Real Madrid was the target of most of the early out-balls and a concern for Trippier. 6 Substitutes Divock Origi for Firmino 58 An unlikely hero again. Had energy and the goal that ended it, superbly struck. 7 James Milner for Wijnaldum 62 Best chance flashes just past the post. Risky late challenge. 6 Joe Gomez for Man\u00e9 90 Saw out added time. n/a"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
