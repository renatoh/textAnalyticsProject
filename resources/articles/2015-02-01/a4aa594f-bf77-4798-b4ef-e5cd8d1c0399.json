More than 44,000 people turned out on a bitterly cold afternoon to watch Sunderland win only their second Premier League home game this season and they were clearly minded to forgive Gus Poyet months of cautious tactics and boring football. The manager greeted a victory which almost certainly prevented the Stadium of Light from turning against him with sensible circumspection. \u201cThe challenge now is to know that we\u2019re not OK,\u201d said Poyet who spent the preamble to Burnley\u2019s visit stressing the need to \u201cre-connect\u201d with his north east public. \u201cWe\u2019ve won a game, that\u2019s all. I need to make sure we don\u2019t get into any comfort zone. This has to be a turning point.\u201d There have been too many false dawns on Wearside for anyone to be quite sure whether the Uruguayan\u2019s switch from a negative version of 5-3-2 to a slightly more ambitious 4-3-3 will come to be regarded as a watershed. Particularly as this was an uncharacteristically inarticulate Burnley performance during which Sean Dyche\u2019s star player, Danny Ings, was substituted in a strop after failing to make any impact. If that was partly down to another excellent central-defensive display by John O\u2019Shea, Dyche acknowledged Ings had been so distracted by transfer speculation that he had considered omitting the forward altogether. \u201cHe\u2019s young, he\u2019s human,\u201d said Burnley\u2019s manager before reiterating his conviction that Ings will still be at Turf Moor on Tuesday morning. It proved a much happier day for Sunderland\u2019s strikers, with Connor Wickham drifting inwards from his nominal right-wing station to head home Anthony R\u00e9veill\u00e8re\u2019s excellent cross, before Jermain Defoe tapped in another cross from an overlapping full-back, in this instance the outstanding Patrick van Aanholt. It was Defoe\u2019s first goal since arriving from Toronto and crowned the former England international\u2019s most enjoyable experience in a Sunderland shirt. Equally important as moving three points ahead of Burnley \u2013 and four above the bottom three \u2013 was his team-mates\u2019 willingness to press the visitors high up the pitch before crossing into the area at every opportunity. \u201cMy first games here we played very deep and it\u2019s not easy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut this was a lot better, we were a lot tighter, we broke quickly and got lots of crosses into the box. It was a massive, must-win game but this team\u2019s certainly capable of scoring goals, especially with the supporters here. The atmosphere\u2019s electric.\u201d The only caveats are that Poyet still found no starting places for his two most inventive individuals, Emanuele Giaccherini and Ricardo \u00c1lvarez, while the 4-3-3 system essentially leaves Defoe in the lone-striker role to which he is not ideally suited. Happily, he seems content enough. \u201cI can play up front on my own,\u201d said Defoe. \u201cI\u2019ve done it before, I don\u2019t mind. I have the energy to work both sides.\u201d If such enthusiasm will please Poyet, he was even more delighted to hear a specialist tell him that Lee Cattermole\u2019s latest knee injury is not as serious as feared and should sideline the team\u2019s most important midfielder for no more than three weeks. \u201cI was a little bit nervous,\u201d said Sunderland\u2019s manager. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy now.\u201d Man of the match Patrick van Aanholt (Sunderland)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
