Things could get a whole lot better for the former jockey at Punchestown today with Roll Along in the feature race, the Guinness Gold Cup. Typical of Llewellyn's fortunes, Roll Along (6.05) did not build on his opening victory over Air Force One and Gungadu at Ascot last October. But his good run in last month's Cheltenham Gold Cup, when sixth behind Kauto Star, was more like it and at 10-1 Roll Along represents value in this Grade One contest. Unlike several of today's rivals who went on to run at Aintree, Roll Along has been kept fresh for this. He finished 25 lengths ahead of Albertas Run in the Gold Cup, on whom the first-time cheekpieces will need to have a dramatic effect. Imperial Commander, who is vying for favouritism with Notre Pere, has always finished his races off well when he is on song and he can also show the benefit of a comparatively light campaign. The Ryanair Chase winner should stay this trip. Ascot's first Flat meeting of the year has attracted runners from the Sir Michael Stoute stable who could be bidding for big-race honours later on. Perfect Stride (3.20) figures among the entries for the Queen Anne Stakes at the Royal meeting in June and this lightly raced colt should be competitive in today's Listed company. Patkai (3.55), seven-lengths winner of the Queen's Vase at Royal Ascot last year, will be aimed at the Gold Cup if all goes well. The Sagaro Stakes looks a good starting point for this useful staying prospect. Stoute has had problems with Evasive's 2,000 Guineas preparation, and yesterday the colt was out to 10-1 from 8-1 with Hill's for Saturday's Classic at Newmarket, where watering is planned. \"We haven't received the expected showers,\" said Newmarket's clerk of the course, Michael Prosser, yesterday. \"The remainder of the week promises to be largely dry, with even the anticipated rainfall on Thursday looking to be light in nature. With this in mind, we will look to water the course on Wednesday and also, potentially, on Friday with a view to producing a decent, fast surface. Currently the ground remains good to firm.\" Ron Cox's tip of the day Crown Choice 8.20 Kempton Walter Swinburn has been firing in winners on the all-weather here in recent weeks, one of his successes being Crown Choice, who got off the mark in a maiden event over this trip. The form is hard to weigh up, though the fourth has since come out and won, but Crown Choice certainly looks reasonably treated for this handicap debut from a mark of 80. He looks sure to improve."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
