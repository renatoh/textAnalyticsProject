Ahead of election day, activists, legislators and political operatives had warned the Biden campaign that it wasn\u2019t doing enough to woo Latino voters, a diverse and fundamental constituency for the Democratic party. The apparent failure prompted some stern immediate criticism from some of the party\u2019s leading figures. \u201cI won\u2019t comment much on tonight\u2019s results as they are evolving and ongoing, but I will say we\u2019ve been sounding the alarm about Dem vulnerabilities w/ Latinos for a long, long time,\u201d tweeted the US congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. \u201cThere is a strategy and a path, but the necessary effort simply hasn\u2019t been put in.\u201d As Latinos went to the polls this year, they had three clear priorities: the coronavirus pandemic, healthcare costs, and jobs and the economy, according to the 2020 American election eve poll. On Tuesday night, the news wasn\u2019t all bad for Democrats. Biden won Arizona, where Latinos represented a key voter demographic. Overall, around seven in 10 Latinos voted for the former vice-president, polling showed. \u201cIn some ways, about Latinos, the story of the night is that they made a difference for both candidates,\u201d said Clarissa Martinez, the deputy vice-president of the Latino civil rights and advocacy organization UnidosUS. Both presidential nominees had been polling neck-and-neck in Florida. But when Clinton\u2019s nearly 30-point margin of victory in Miami-Dade county slipped to just over seven points for Biden, the coveted swing state threw its 29 electoral college votes behind Donald Trump. Trump won a majority of the state\u2019s sizable Cuban-American vote, according to NBC News exit polls, after targeted campaigns painting Biden as a socialist. Biden also lost Texas, a reliably red stronghold that Democrats had hoped to turn blue through high voter participation. South Texas\u2019s Nueces county went to Trump by a wider margin than four years ago, after O\u2019Rourke had flipped Corpus Christi and its surroundings in 2018. Whether Republicans regained the south Texas territory because of Latinos voting for Trump or higher turnout by other demographics is unclear at this point, said Juan Carlos Huerta, a professor of political science at Texas A&amp;M University, Corpus Christi. In the nearby Rio Grande valley, where Clinton dominated in 2016, Biden also lost ground. He\u2019s leading only by a five-point margin in Starr county, which is 96.4% Hispanic or Latino, and which Clinton claimed by a whopping 60 points. Meanwhile, he\u2019s up 17 points in neighboring Hidalgo county, which is also majority Latino. That\u2019s still a generous margin, but nothing like Clinton\u2019s 40-point victory in 2016. Victoria M DeFrancesco Soto, an assistant dean at the University of Texas\u2019s LBJ school of public affairs, hypothesized that Biden\u2019s underperformance in the border region compared to 2016 could be attributed to two factors: the Clintons\u2019 popularity among Texas Latinos and the fact that grassroots, old school campaigning couldn\u2019t happen amid the pandemic. In the valley, it became clear that \u201cthe enthusiasm for Biden isn\u2019t what the enthusiasm for Clinton was,\u201d said Manuel Grajeda, the Texas strategist for UnidosUS. Both Republicans and Democrats haven\u2019t focused on Latinos there as much as in other major counties, Grajeda said. That was \u201ca missed opportunity\u201d that showed up in the election results, he added. The relatively narrow margins for Democrats along the border came even as Latino voters flocked to the polls in Texas. During the incredible turnout in the state for early voting, an estimated 1.9 million Latinos voted, Grajeda said, including about 500,000 first-time voters. \u201cThe key to success with the Hispanic community in Texas is engagement, and very early on,\u201d said congressman Joaqu\u00edn Castro, who won re-election Tuesday night. \u201cAnd making sure that we get to folks who have not participated in the political process before. \u201cThat continues to be a challenge that we\u2019ve gotta make sure that we meet.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
