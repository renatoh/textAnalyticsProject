The supermarket chain knocked more than 2p per litre off the cost of unleaded and diesel. The price of unleaded petrol now stands at an average of 92.9p per litre and the price of diesel has dropped to an average of 94.9p. Sainsbury's was reacting to drops in the price of crude oil, which fell as low as $70 a barrel - a level not seen since early summer. Sainsbury's first cut prompted two other supermarket chains to follow suit. Tesco knocked 2p per litre off all grades of its fuel, while Asda slashed three to four pence off its unleaded petrol and 2p off diesel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
