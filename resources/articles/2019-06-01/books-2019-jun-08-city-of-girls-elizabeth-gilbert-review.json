Daphne du Maurier resented Rebecca until her dying day, and JK Rowling didn\u2019t rebrand herself as Robert Galbraith for nothing. But when your name is Elizabeth Gilbert and that book is Eat, Pray, Love, the reactions are extreme; utter adoration or visceral loathing, with little in between. In her third novel, it is spring 1940 and 19-year-old Vivian Morris has dropped out of her Ivy League college and been \u201cbanished\u201d to a New York City in the midst of will-we-won\u2019t-we-join-the-war indecision. But as Vivian puts it, \u201cexile in New York is no exile at all\u201d. The city is all glamour and excitement, with a hysterical edge familiar to readers in a contemporary world on the brink of global crisis. Sent to live at her bohemian Aunt Peg\u2019s down-at-heel mid-town theatre, The Lily, Vivian falls headlong in lust with a colourful world that has little in common with her privileged Wasp upbringing. Worldly showgirl Celia Ray, streetwise leading man Anthony Roccella, grande dame Edna Parker Watson and her beautiful-but-dim actor husband Arthur, along with Hollywood wheeler-dealer Billy Buell, are like nothing and no one Vivian has ever encountered before. She\u2019s not slow to cast off the moral and emotional shackles of her strait-laced, buttoned-down upbringing, embarking on a series of affairs and acquiring for herself a very different sort of education from the one that her parents would have deemed appropriate. If this all sounds like something straight out of vaudeville, it is. And intentionally so. This is a work of historical fiction, and Gilbert\u2019s prose, while not immaculate, zings with the mood of the era. In fact, like Gilbert\u2019s previous novel, A Signature of All Things, it\u2019s so true to life in places \u2013 including real historical figures in the story \u2013 that it occasionally feels like pastiche. But Gilbert is nothing if not emotionally intuitive, and while City of Girls is unquestionably a sexy, glamorous romp, its similarities with vaudeville end there. The plot bristles with moral intent: Vivian\u2019s fall, when it inevitably comes, is complete and damning and utterly gendered, its repercussions shadowing the rest of her life. Yet Gilbert wouldn\u2019t be the woman she is \u2013 one who \u201cspoke her truth\u201d and left her husband to embark on a relationship with her female best friend, even as the friend was dying from pancreatic cancer \u2013 if she was to allow her female characters to be destroyed by society\u2019s disapproval. And it\u2019s at this point that the novel\u2019s true heart is revealed. Shame and scandal have taken on renewed meaning in the internet age: it\u2019s almost becoming a cliche to assess creative work in the context of #MeToo, Donald Trump, Harvey Weinstein, Bill Cosby and co. At the same time, it\u2019s impossible to divorce artists from the climate in which they work, and Gilbert has been vocal in her concern that women\u2019s sexual agency, always under threat, is particularly at risk right now. \u201cWe\u2019re at this incredibly explosive moment of female anger and resistance, in terms of abuse against women,\u201d she has said. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t want to see lost [is] the idea of women pursuing sex because it\u2019s something they want to have.\u201d Gilbert has long since severed her bond with shame \u2013 and thank goodness. In other hands, this novel could have had all the adventure and enjoyment, but none of the depth; instead she makes it into a glorious, multilayered, emotionally astute celebration of womanhood. It would be easy to dismiss City of Girls as joyous escapism, and God knows there\u2019s little enough of that around right now. But look more closely and what you\u2019ll see is an eloquently persuasive treatise on the judgment and punishment of women, and a heartfelt call to reclaim female sexual agency. \u201cAt some point in a woman\u2019s life, she just gets tired of being ashamed all the time,\u201d says Vivian as she looks back on her life. \u201cAfter that, she is free to become whoever she truly is.\u201d Let\u2019s hope Gilbert is right. \u2022 Sam Baker\u2019s The Woman Who Ran is published by HarperFiction.
