That is something nobody could have said four years ago. That is really special.\u201d The German inherited a team 10th in the Premier League when he took charge in October 2015 and has steered Liverpool to three European finals, with Tuesday\u2019s 4-0 evisceration of Barcelona taking them to a second successive Champions League showpiece. Liverpool host Wolves on Sunday looking to become champions of England for the first time in 29 years and knowing that, even if they do not overhaul Manchester City, who face Brighton and are one point clear, a total of 97 points would be the third-highest in top-flight history. Klopp admitted he had reservations when he was appointed at Liverpool because he believed a culture of short-termism at Anfield would make it hard to bring incremental improvement. \u201cIn that moment I thought that pressure in the club and from around the club was much bigger than it really was,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody gave me the feeling that, not people inside [Liverpool], that you have to win silverware. Nobody is interested in development or in the game itself. \u201cThat made my life a bit uncomfortable in the beginning because I have not [got] a time machine so we need time to develop things.\u201d Liverpool\u2019s standout players this week have highlighted twin elements of Klopp\u2019s development, both from signing players and from improving those he inherited. Alisson excelled against Barcelona \u2013 \u201cHe saved our lives then,\u201d Klopp said \u2013 and the \u00a367m buy was the world\u2019s most expensive goalkeeper before losing that tag to Kepa Arrizabalaga four weeks later. \u201cWe had to pay a lot of money for a goalkeeper but then Chelsea had to pay a lot of money for a goalkeeper, too,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cThe prices keep going up. It is easy to realise Alisson Becker is a wonderful goalkeeper; the only thing is that he makes spectacular things look really easy.\u201d Divock Origi, who joined before Klopp, had played only 577 minutes this season until he delivered last week\u2019s winner at Newcastle and the decisive brace against Barcelona. \u201cShowing up the way he did, it\u2019s been \u2018Divock Origi week\u2019,\u201d Klopp said. \u201cWhen you think about how much he was not playing, maybe you think that I don\u2019t like the player that much or I don\u2019t trust him too much. But that is actually not right. It is difficult to get in a team when you have Salah, Man\u00e9 and Firmino.\u201d With Roberto Firmino ruled out, Origi is set to face Wolves. Klopp had wolves of a different kind on his mind as he reflected on the job Jordan Henderson and James Milner, two others he inherited, did against Barcelona. \u201cThe energy level Hendo and Milly had, I thought they were like wolves who nobody had fed for eight weeks. They were unbelievable.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
