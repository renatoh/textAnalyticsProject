That's a question I sometimes ask myself, just to check how I feel about having a lot less money than I used to. If it's raining, maybe an image of a holiday somewhere warm and dry might pop into my head. Eating tapas in a Spanish mountain village, basking in the sun, maybe a nice cold beer or two ... Then I remember mile-long airport check-in queues, delayed flights, the elbow-shoving horror of the baggage collection carousel, and armed police with machine guns, and any desire to go on holiday strangely vanishes. Maybe when the boys are a bit older. Some days I might think how much easier it would be to just buy some of the things we need for the smallholding, such as beehives and a goat shelter, rather than go through the effort of learning to make them virtually from scratch. Wouldn't it be great to have all the kit, just like that, rather than waiting? Then I remind myself how much we enjoy making things. Yes, it would be faster to buy stuff, but we get a more lasting sense of achievement from things that we've made. \"Wouldn't you like to just treat yourself for once \u2013 maybe do something pampering for a change?' is another question I occasionally ask myself. I try to imagine going out and buying something new and shiny just for the hell of it, but the desire simply isn't there. As for something pampering, such as a massage \u2013 I'm not stressed out like I used to be in my old life, so my shoulders and back are fine, and I don't actually need one. Also, I'll let you into a secret: I've been cutting my own hair now for the past year. It's easy because my hair is long, though I do sometimes ponder what I'm missing from my \u00a340 haircuts of old. Admittedly there's no complimentary cup of herbal tea, posh biscuit or head massage. No celebrity gossip magazines for me to flick through, and no need to engage in slightly forced conversations about what I'm up to at the weekend. No, I much prefer the snip-and-go efforts of late. But this doesn't stop these thoughts wafting in and out of my head teasingly, even if it is becoming increasingly easier to bash them away as I find myself becoming a fully fledged barterer and \"doer\". Increasingly keen to suggest swaps and exchanges in place of money, I think I'm tapping into my old entrepreneurial, haggling self in a way I feel comfortable with \u2013 and it's fun. From swapping one of our free range plucked and prepared bronze turkeys for an equivalent value of organic beef from a local farmer, through to getting a Jack Russell puppy in exchange for some of our time helping another neighbour with lambing (not that we actually know how), I'm intrigued to see how far I can take it. Despite the hard work, our new life provides satisfaction on so many levels. The most challenging thing about it all, about choosing to live on less money, remains the reactions of others. As a former corporate \"go-getter\", it has been humbling, amusing, sometimes frustrating and most of all interesting in so many ways. While our downshift has become more normal for friends and family, especially with many others we know now having to watch the pennies, it's interesting how we are perceived by some to be \"in need\". This was illustrated most clearly at Christmas, when we received a flurry of food and alcohol hampers from well-intentioned family and friends. All very thoughtful and indeed welcome, but blatantly a result of our reduced coffers, when the truth is, because we produce an increasing amount of our own ingredients and make an effort with cooking, we eat like kings every day. It's probably time for me to admit that, actually, we are going to have a little holiday of sorts this year. My brother is getting married, and in the two years since our downshift family weddings have proved to the only occasion guaranteed to draw us thrifty peasants away for a weekend. So again we'll be pootling off to Brighton, dusting off some glad rags and stepping back closer to our old lives for a few days. Weddings bring people together in a way few other events really can. It's ironic, then, that these very happy occasions can often become the epitome of the \"must-have\" culture we have been attempting to turn our backs on. The wedding industry is the most enthusiastic of any I've experienced when it comes to those little \"add-ons\" \u2013 by which I mean costs. Where else could some only half-decent photographer get away with charging \u00a31,000 for just about getting Auntie Doris and Uncle Harold in frame? I've found myself balking in dismay on behalf of my brother and his lovely fianc\u00e9e that their wedding venue of choice has the cheek to charge \u00a312.50 corkage per bottle if you select your own wine. On the basis of there being 80-plus bottles, you're talking in excess of \u00a31,000 for \u2026 opening bottles. I now imagine myself actively scanning the room and looking as each bottle is opened, pondering what they could have bought for themselves instead: a Muscovy duck, sack of spuds, 10 fence posts etc. But as our move has gradually become less embarrassing for my family, I have promised not to dwell on this \u2013 not too much, anyway. Suffice to say, if I think about holidays or \"treats\" now, I'm genuinely not bothered. The truth is that I no longer lead a life which I'm desperate to get away from for even a weekend. I don't need to de-stress and unwind. We have all we need right here. Well, apart from the sun \u2013 but you can't have everything."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
