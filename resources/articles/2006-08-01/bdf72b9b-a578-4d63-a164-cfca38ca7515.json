Asked to open in one-day cricket for the first time this season, Anthony McGrath hit the third limited-overs century of his career, bettering his 109 not out made in 1997 with a match-winning 148 from 120 balls. The 30-year-old, his 14 one-day internationals and four Tests unlikely to receive embellishment, is having some season. His fourth championship hundred last week against Lancashire took him past 1,100 runs at an average of over 60 but his season's one-day average had been only 19 before yesterday, so the chance to bump it up on a typically placid Taunton strip and against a struggling Somerset side was just too good to pass up. For Somerset are in a bit of a muddle at the moment. It was only a year ago that they were nursing hangovers from their most unexpected Twenty20 triumph. Yesterday there was no such excuse for some of their woolly-headed outcricket. Having inserted Yorkshire, there seemed an air nearing resignation about Somerset. Being bottom of the championship can do that, a tentative mindset doubtless compounded by the return to Australia tomorrow of their captain Cameron White. Despite scoring a championship double-century last week and a muscular, dangerous-looking 34 here there are concerns over a wrist injury, so Somerset, having already agreed that the disappointing spinner Dan Cullen should not return after Australia A duty, will endure the remainder of the season without an official overseas player. With their appointed captain Ian Blackwell recovering from shoulder surgery - he will feature in a second XI match against Middlesex this week - a leader for tomorrow's championship match against Glamorgan is yet to be specified. The opener Matthew Wood tried it earlier in the season and did not fancy it: it will be no surprise if others feel the same. For Somerset's bowling attack, with Andrew Caddick rested yesterday, is serving up some rather tasty fare at present, and McGrath and his opening partner Craig White tucked in gleefully in posting 118 for the first wicket, Yorkshire's highest in any competition this season. Having said that, though, they might have been too tardy in indulging fully as they displayed an all too common English trait of conservatism in the first 15 overs. McGrath did not find the boundary until the 12th over and it was only the introduction of Peter Trego for the 12th over - which went for 14 - that induced anything approaching gluttony. Arul Suppiah was then unfairly asked to bowl his left-arm spin with the fielding restrictions still in place and disappeared for 18 as McGrath hit the first two of his six sixes, both over long-on. Suppiah did persuade White, later prevented from fielding by a stiff back, to sky to deep extra cover but that merely brought the imposing figure of Darren Lehmann to the wicket. His 74 from 65 balls was as predictable as it was effortless. It is to McGrath's credit that his late-innings lofting over extra cover lost nothing in comparison. \"If [Cameron] White's out, they're all out\" some of the dispirited locals were saying of Somerset's reply. However, there is much talent - if unfulfilled - in their young batting and three of them made attractive half-centuries, with the 22-year-old left-handed opener Neil Edwards's his first in the one-day game. But once captain White mishit high to mid-on, James Hildreth pleased equally with a sprightly 40-ball fifty. A smart leg-side stumping from Gerard Brophy dispatched Hildreth and when Edwards immediately top-edged a sweep it appeared Somerset had too much to do. But at least Wes Durston's explosive 34-ball fifty ensured Yorkshire needed Deon Kruis to atone for earlier punishment by bowling his yorkers skilfully at the death."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
