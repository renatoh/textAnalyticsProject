BSkyB chief Tony Ball is set to become the latest of Mr Murdoch's key lieutenants to leave their jobs after enjoying immense success within his empire. Is this another sign of a conscious policy of cutting down to size those executives within his empire that he feels have become \"too big for their boots\"? The Guardian today revealed Mr Ball was likely to step down as chief executive in \"weeks rather than months\" after a series of disagreements with Mr Murdoch, but those with an intimate knowledge of the way the 71-year-old mogul operates said Mr Ball's imminent departure was no surprise. From former Sky executives Sam Chisholm and Mark Booth to 1980s Sun editor Kelvin McKenzie and former Sunday Times editor Andrew Neil, Mr Murdoch has never been afraid to part company with executives at the height of their powers. \"In any argument with Murdoch, there is only one winner,\" said one broadcasting executive. Others pointed out Mr Murdoch's long history of supporting his \"favoured sons\" before casting them aside when they believe they have become irreplaceable. \"In football parlance, no one is allowed to be bigger than the team - except Murdoch himself of course,\" said one experienced executive. In many ways, the football comparison is an apposite one, as it was football that did much to build Sky into the broadcasting powerhouse it is today. Like Alex Ferguson selling off David Beckham when he perceived his loyalties to have shifted away from Manchester United, Murdoch has seen off a string of star executives. \"There's a long history of this. He is very attached to the master-servant relationship,\" said another source of Murdoch. Tony Ball has gone out of his way to present BSkyB as a separate entity to the rest of the News Corp empire in an effort to convince ministers, regulators and the City the two should be considered separately. News Corp owns a 36% controlling stake in BSkyB, and the company is always at pains to point out it is not run by Murdoch or any of his placemen. But insiders say the size of his shareholding belies the extent of his influence. \"Ball might give the impression that Sky is run independently, but nothing happens without Rupert's agreement. He's very hands on.\" While extremely proud of the BSkyB operation, making it the template for his newly acquired satellite broadcasting businesses in Italy and the US, the general consensus says Mr Murdoch is keen to show who's boss. \"No major decisions are taken without running them past Rupert first. He has the final say,\" confirmed another senior source. Most of the senior executives polled by MediaGuardian.co.uk believed it was the right time for Mr Ball to go, having taken BSkyB as far as it could in terms of growth. \"He's taken them to 7 million subscribers, proving the City wrong in the process. Growing that figure is just going to get harder,\" said one source. Few believed he would take another job in British broadcasting, with opinion split on whether he would remain at News Corp in some advisory role. \"He's a very rich man and doesn't have that need to keep proving himself over and over again. I wouldn't be surprised to see him end up in the City,\" said one source close to Mr Ball. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
