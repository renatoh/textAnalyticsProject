Tippett won only six of his 35 games and Rushden, who joined the League in 2001, sit third bottom of League Two, which they slipped into after relegation from the old second division last May. Stewart Robson, the club's technical director, has also left. \"It is in the best interests for a change of management at this time,\" the club said in a statement. \"Jon Bolle, the youth team coach, will also be relinquishing his responsibilities.\" Ipswich's reserve striker Pablo Counago, out of favour and out of contract in the summer, has rejected a move to Cordoba, bottom of the second division in his native Spain. The 25-year-old, who has been available on a free for the best part of a year, is still on a lucrative deal secured in the club's Premiership days. \"We have had an amicable meeting with Pablo and he understands that he is probably going to have to move to get first-team football,\" said the manager Joe Royle. \"He accepts that Shefki [Kuqi] and Darren [Bent] have done well and it is going to be very hard for him to earn a new contract here. The best thing for Pablo is to move now and earn himself a new contract elsewhere.\" Leon Knight yesterday stated that he may leave Brighton if contract talks are not resolved soon. The 22-year-old former Chelsea reserve has scored in his last two league matches and claims he is keen to stay with Albion. \"It's early days yet and I think there will be a few more meetings before I put pen to paper,\" he said. \"I don't know when they will be. If it doesn't happen soon then maybe I will end up not staying - but I am still intending to sign.\" Doncaster have invited the 27-year-old Iceland international Gretar Hjartarson for a trial after watching him in a friendly at Scunthorpe. Sheffield Wednesday have terminated the striker Guylain Ndumbu-Nsungu's contract by mutual consent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
