The funding \u2013 to be outlined in Tuesday night\u2019s budget \u2013 forms part of a $450m security package \u201cto strengthen intelligence capabilities and to counter extremist messaging\u201d. The $450m is on top of the $630m four-year funding boost the government provided to police and security agencies for counter-terrorism activities in the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook in December. Tony Abbott, who has pushed through a series of bills to expand the powers of law-enforcement and spy agencies over the past 10 months, confirmed the extra spending would be included in the government\u2019s second budget. \u201cTo help combat terrorism at home and deter Australians from committing terrorist acts abroad, we need to ensure our security agencies are resourced properly and have the powers to respond to evolving threats and technological change,\u201d the prime minister said in a statement issued on Tuesday. The prime minister said the funding would include $131m to help the telecommunications industry upgrade its systems to implement mandatory data retention, under which companies must store customers\u2019 details \u2013 such as the senders and recipients of emails, phone calls and text messages \u2013 for two years. \u201cMetadata is essential to most counter-terrorism investigations and for detecting and prosecuting other serious crimes,\u201d he said. Data retention laws passed both houses of parliament in March after the Coalition and Labor stared down objections from minor parties and independents about \u201cmass surveillance\u201d and intrusions on privacy. The Senate voted in favour of the legislation despite continuing uncertainty over the costs of the data retention obligations, which are to be phased in. Abbott had previously not answered direct questions about the amount the government would contribute to businesses to assist with the cost of implementation. Some estimates suggested the total industry costs would be about $300m. \u201cWe have said to the industry that we are prepared to make an appropriate upfront contribution to the cost. We are continuing to talk to the industry about precisely what that will be,\u201d Abbott said in March. The other elements of the security spending in Tuesday\u2019s budget are $296m \u201cto strengthen the capabilities of our intelligence agencies, including updating information technology systems\u201d and $22m \u201cto combat terrorist propaganda and counter violent extremism\u201d. The attorney general, George Brandis, announced the latter initiative during a visit to the United States in February to attend Barack Obama\u2019s summit on countering violent extremism. At the time, Brandis said it would include social media monitoring and analysis, while the government would work with the Australian Communications and Media Authority, private sector and international partners \u201cto take down or otherwise address extremist content\u201d. On Tuesday Abbott said authorities needed to challenge the recruitment methods used by extremist organisations, particularly online. \u201cThis measure will challenge terrorist organisations\u2019 lies and propaganda online. This will make it harder for terrorist groups to attract vulnerable Australians, particularly young Australians, through the internet and social media,\u201d the prime minister said. The government has previously said that any new spending measures in the budget would need to be offset with equivalent cuts elsewhere. The source of the funding for the security measures is not yet clear, but the details are expected to be spelled out in the budget papers."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
