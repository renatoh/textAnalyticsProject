The former vice-president, Joe Biden, will face off with South Bend\u2019s mayor, Pete Buttigieg, and senators Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders on the second evening. NBC announced the lineup on Friday for its two-night debate, which will begin 26 June in Miami, and is set to be the first direct showdown between the Democrats vying to take on Donald Trump. Representatives of 20 campaigns gathered in a conference room at NBC headquarters Friday as candidates\u2019 names were picked out of two boxes. There were separate boxes containing the names of candidates polling at or above 2% and those who polled below 2% \u2013 an attempt to make sure most of the lesser-known candidates were not grouped together. Still, four of the six top-polling candidates landed on 27 June, setting the stage for a high-stakes evening. Being paired with Biden, 76, and Sanders, 77, could give Buttigieg an opportunity to emphasize the \u201cnext generation\u201d theme that he has been touting. At 37, the mayor is the youngest of the leading contenders. Sanders and Warren, considered favorites of the party\u2019s liberal wing, won\u2019t be going head-to-head. Among the rest of the field, Washington\u2019s governor, Jay Inslee, could use the opportunity of a night less crowded with frontrunners to draw attention to his climate-change agenda. Colorado\u2019s former governor, John Hickenlooper, who has been among the most aggressive critics of Sanders\u2019 democratic socialism, will have a chance to make those points to him face-to-face. Featured on 26 June will be Warren, Booker, O\u2019Rourke, Inslee, Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar, former Housing and Urban Development secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, former congressman John Delaney of Maryland, congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio. The next night\u2019s lineup has Biden, Sanders, Harris, Buttigieg, Hickenlooper, the New York senator Kirsten Gillibrand, the Colorado senator Michael Bennet,the author Marianne Williamson, the entrepreneur Andrew Yang and the congressman Eric Swalwell, of California. NBC will face its own test, to see if it can make compelling programming out of crowded, fractious stages on the opening nights of debate season. The debate will be shown both nights in prime time, 9pm to 11pm, on the broadcast network, as well as on MSNBC and Telemundo, and it will be streamed on various platforms. The NBC personalities Lester Holt, Savannah Guthrie, Chuck Todd, Rachel Maddow and Jos\u00e9 Diaz-Balart will be featured."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
