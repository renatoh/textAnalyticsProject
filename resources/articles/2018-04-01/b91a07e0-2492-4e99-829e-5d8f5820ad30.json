Researchers at the University of Oxford analysed data from more than 50,000 people across the UK and 27 other mainly European countries to compare their psychological states with their educational achievements. They found that for men, exceeding their parents\u2019 educational achievements have a positive effect resulting in reduced psychological distress, while falling short appears to have a damaging effect on men\u2019s wellbeing with an increase in psychological distress. The research, launched on Tuesday at the British Sociological Association\u2019s annual conference at Northumbria University, contradicts earlier studies that found improving on parental academic achievements appeared to have little positive impact on psychological state. The study found that the consequences of doing better or worse than their parents were \u201cobserved primarily among men rather than among women\u201d. The authors said: \u201cOur results suggest that the role of social origins, net of intergenerational mobility, is much more significant for men than for women. This corroborates some earlier evidence that men\u2019s life chances are more related to their social origins than life chances of women.\u201d The team of three researchers at Oxford\u2019s department of social policy and intervention and Nuffield College divided educational attainment into three categories: in the UK, top was degree level, A-levels middle, while bottom was GCSEs or lower. They compared this with an overall score for psychological distress. They found that men whose educational achievements were in the bottom level, and whose parents were in the top, were more than twice as likely to be among the top 10% most psychologically distressed group of individuals than those whose educational level matched their parents\u2019. The psychological effect of this gap in attainment is comparable with the gap between those who were divorced and those who were not, according to the researchers, or the gap between those in an ethnic minority group with the ethnic majority. The paper, titled Intergenerational Education Mobility and Psychological Distress in Europe, found that men with middling educational achievement whose parents were top achievers were 75% more likely to be psychologically distressed than those whose level was the same as their parents. Men whose educational level was at the top and whose parents\u2019 were at the bottom level were 50% less likely to be psychologically distressed than men whose level was the same as their parents. Alexi Gugushvili, a co-author of the report, said: \u201cGetting a higher educational achievement than one\u2019s parents is associated with a reduced level of psychological distress, even after the direct effect of individuals\u2019 and their parents\u2019 education and other conventional explanations of distress are accounted for. \u201cOn the contrary, falling short of one\u2019s parents\u2019 education tends to raise the distress level, and a big disparity is especially harmful for men\u2019s psychological health status. \u201cFor men, parents\u2019 educational achievement and intergenerational mobility retain an important influence on their psychological health after accounting for individuals\u2019 social class and other explanations of distress, but no effect is observed for women\u2019s distress. \u201cThe reason for this could be that men are more likely than women to attribute success and failure by pointing to their own merits, abilities and effort, rather than factors they have no control over.\u201d Gugushvili and his fellow co-authors, Yizhang Zhao and Erzs\u00e9bet Bukodi, analysed data from the 2012-14 European Social Survey, which was conducted among 52,773 people aged 25-65 across 27 European countries and Israel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
