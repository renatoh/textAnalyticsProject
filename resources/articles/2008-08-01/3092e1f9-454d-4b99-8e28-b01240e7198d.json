In this work, the Festival Chorus was in fine voice and, when in full Elgarian flood, the aura was redolent of all that is great about this festival tradition. The Philharmonia, too, were strong advocates for the expressive instrumental writing, often vividly descriptive when conveying the glitter of the 30 pieces of silver that are Judas's reward for betraying Jesus, and in terms of emotional characterisation, Judas's subsequent remorse. Yet, it was a lack of defining dramatic insight that made this performance less than totally inspirational. The conducting of this year's artistic director, Adrian Lucas, was reliable but stolid, with neither the lyrical sweep of Elgar's phrasing nor a realisation of its natural propulsion towards focal structural points. Of the soloists, it was Peter Savidge's Jesus who stood out for the clarity of his words and for his sense of compassion, not least in relation to Michael Pearce's anguished Judas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
