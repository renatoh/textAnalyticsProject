No sooner does one record-breaker come home, than another sets sail. There was young Mike Perham who parked up in Portsmouth at the weekend, having sailed round the world on his own. For nine months, Mike, who was 16 when he set off, battled terrifying winds, monster waves and loneliness, with only his iPod for company. What's wrong with Bebo, hanging around shopping centres, sending obscene text messages or whatever it is normal 17-year-olds are supposed to do? And Mike comes from Potters Bar in Hertfordshire; where did he get the idea from, looking out of his bedroom window at the M25? A couple of days earlier, only a court order prevented 13-year-old Laura Dekker from Holland setting out to break Mike's record in her own 26ft boat, Guppy. (I'm not quite sure what a 13-year-old is doing owning a 26ft yacht \u2013 in my family the rule was no yachts until we were 16.) Anyway, young Laura's going to have to wait to get her teeth into the Cape Horn and Southern Ocean. There's more. Because barely had Portsmouth recovered from welcoming home Mike when in sailed Hilary Lister. Pah, you say, Hilary has only sailed round Britain, and at 37 she's a grown-up. But then she is paralysed from the neck down, and she steers her boat and operates its ropes by sipping and puffing on straws. What is it with all these people doing incredible things in boats? Here's a woman who knows a thing or two about chasing yachty records. A Dame rather, Ellen MacArthur. \"Sailing gives you a sense of freedom that is unparalleled, and I think that is a large part of its appeal,\" she says from Cornwall, where she's doing some charity work. \"Anyone of any age or ability can sail and feel that freedom, and when you point the boat's bow at that distant horizon there is a feeling which grows in you telling you not to stop.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
