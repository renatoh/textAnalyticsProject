The investigation began earlier this month, when the pair told police in Madrid that the mother\u2019s partner had cheated them out of a total of \u20ac60,000. It later emerged the daughter\u2019s partner, who claimed to be a senior member of Spain\u2019s secret services, had suggested they recover the lost money by killing the mother\u2019s boyfriend. They paid him a \u20ac7,000 downpayment on the understanding he would arrange to have the mother\u2019s boyfriend killed and sell the dead man\u2019s organs to raise the \u20ac60,000. When the killing failed to take place, the mother and daughter felt defrauded and went to the police again. \u201cOfficers then proceeded to arrest the two women and set about tracing and arresting the male suspect,\u201d Madrid police said in a statement. \u201cThey have not ruled out the possibility that he may have swindled other people.\u201d They said the three suspects were waiting to appear before a judge and that the victim of the plot had been found \u201cin perfect health\u201d. The Spanish news agency Efe reported that the three suspects were all Spanish citizens, with no criminal records. They did not give their names, in line with Spanish police practice, but Efe reported that the mother was 52, the daughter 20 and the daughter\u2019s boyfriend 29. Officers are looking into the background of the man and how he came to have false documents bearing the logo of the state intelligence agency, the National Intelligence Centre. They also found a document in which he had allegedly laid out how he planned to carry out the killing and sell the victim\u2019s organs. According to Efe, the man had a fake CV, which claimed he was a lieutenant colonel, an expert marksman and a specialist in interrogation and \u201celimination\u201d. It also said he spoke 22 languages, including Bengali and Hawaiian."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
