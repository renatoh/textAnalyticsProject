Last Saturday, Jimmy Bullard was a picture of fun as he orchestrated a goal celebration that caused amusement among managers, players and supporters up and down the country. What a contrast with yesterday afternoon, when the Hull City midfielder looked a broken man as he headed down the tunnel in tears and wore the expression of a player who seemed to be doubting whether he would make it back on to a football pitch again. How serious Bullard's injury is remains unclear and the crumb of comfort for the 31-year-old is that the damage is to his left knee and not the right, which has been operated on twice in the past three years to repair the cruciate ligament. He will undergo a scan, probably tomorrow, when the swelling has gone down, but the pain etched on his face as he beat the ground in frustration following an aborted attempt to continue told its own story. The injury, which occurred in the 15th minute when Bullard fell awkwardly after tumbling over the top of James Milner, overshadowed a match in which Aston Villa ran out comfortable winners to move up to fifth place in the Premier League and complete a highly satisfactory week following their victory over Portsmouth in the Carling Cup quarter-finals on Tuesday. Bullard's torment was understandable. This was only his sixth appearance for Hull following his \u00a35m transfer in January and having fought back from what had appeared to be a career-threatening injury he was regaining his best form. On Friday he was named as the Premier League's player of the month and no one at Hull underestimates his value to the team. The Villa supporters, many of whom stood to applaud when he was helped along the touchline, also seemed to recognise the contribution Bullard makes to football in general with his happy-go-lucky demeanour. \"It's too early to say [the extent of the damage],\" said Brian Horton, Hull's assistant manager, who was doing his best to sound optimistic about the outcome. \"You don't want to see him [in the emotional state he was in]. He's just come back and he's been playing brilliantly. He fell awkwardly, but it's his other leg. He could be all right for next week.\" Horton admitted, however, that it was impossible to ignore Bullard's reaction at the time of the injury. \"He did look worried and we can't get away from that fact. So we are also worried. He's been put in a brace, but until we get the scan we can't say. He's a top-drawer lad. He's bubbly, infectious and a good player. Hopefully, he'll have the scan and there's nothing wrong.\" Villa were already a goal to the good by the time Bullard departed and the only surprise was that it had taken 14 minutes for the breakthrough to arrive. Luke Young squandered an excellent chance inside 22 seconds, when he dragged his shot wide with only Matt Duke to beat, and Emile Heskey was guilty of wasting another glorious opportunity when he bore down on the Hull goal only to take a wayward first touch before scuffing his effort wide. When the goal did come, it was left to a central defender to punish Hull's porous backline. Milner, who was outstanding throughout, slid a wonderful pass into the path of Richard Dunne and, with the Hull defence conspicuous by their absence, the Republic of Ireland international took a touch before hammering the ball in. It was his third goal of the season and Heskey should have taken note at the way it was dispatched. Villa doubled their advantage in bizarre circumstances as Steve Sidwell, who was warming up at the time, played a part in the second goal. The hapless Duke dashed from his area to head out of play and Sidwell, standing on the touchline, caught the ball and quickly handed it to Gabriel Agbonlahor. The striker's throw-in found Milner in space and, with Duke frantically trying to get back into position, the England international expertly lifted the ball into the unguarded net. Hull improved for a period after the restart and Craig Fagan threatened to punish Villa's complacency when he struck a left-footed shot against a post. Villa, however, added a deserved third in the closing minutes when John Carew converted from the penalty spot after Duke had hauled down Ashley Young \"I was really pleased with our performance,\" said Martin O'Neill, the Villa manager. \"And I thought Milner was brilliant. His goal summed up his performance.\" THE FANS' PLAYER RATINGS AND VERDICT Mark Rutter, Observer reader It was a walk in the park for us. Our first-half display was as good as any Premier League unit has shown this season. It was sublime. James Milner was in immense form and should surely be nailed on to get picked by Fabio Capello for the World Cup. He played centre-midfield and ran the show. Stewart Downing added balance on the left, while Richard Dunne and the back four operated very effectively. Hull City couldn't even get near us. The fan's player ratings Duke 5; McShane 6, Gardner 6, Dawson 6; Zayatte 6, Boateng 7; Garcia 6, Marney 5 (Vennegoor of Hesselink 77 5); Bullard n/a (Fagan 19 6), Hunt 6; Altidore 5 (Barmby 54 7) Rick Skelton, HullCityOnline.com I think we were absolutely dire. We were never going to get back into the game, especially after Jimmy Bullard had to go off. Villa's first goal was the result of just terrible defending. Richard Dunne found acres of space to score ... it set the tone pretty early on. We did hit the crossbar but other than that we had nothing on target and never created anything. The team were awful to a man, with the exception of George Boateng.
