A solid set of half-year figures and the resumption of its share buyback programme with \u00a3175m still to be spent helped C&amp;W gain in early trading. But as the day wore on and analysts picked over the management's warnings of potential earnings volatility, the stock eased back to close up 2.25p at 121p. C&amp;W's management, led by chief executive Francesco Caio, yesterday gave its most comprehensive assessment so far of where the company is going, setting out how its Bulldog broadband business will dovetail with its existing UK operation and its new acquisition Energis to create a real infrastructure-based competitor to BT. Within three to four years it expects this business to make sales of more than \u00a32bn on a much-reduced cost base, due to C&amp;W's investment in a new \"next generation network\" - allowing it to secure double-digit margins. Meanwhile its overseas operations will provide the bedrock for dividend payments. The trouble is that in the short term the integration of Energis coupled with the transition of existing customers from services run on its high-cost legacy network to C&amp;W's next generation network - which has still to be built - could lead to volatility in profits. Having been clobbered last month by a shock profits warning that sent C&amp;W shares tumbling from 142p to close to 100p, the last thing dealers wanted to hear was that there could be more. Elsewhere among telecoms stocks, O2 rose 0.25p at 196.75p on very high volumes as half the market seemed to give up on the hope of a new bidder emerging for the firm and the other half whispered that perhaps Japan's NTT DoCoMo, O2's partner for its new i-mode data service, would like to play. Either way the stock remained under Telef\u00f3nica's 200p-a-share offer price. In the wider market, the FTSE 100 closed up just 0.1 points after losing early gains to close at 5460.9. Hedge fund Man Group led the risers, up 37p at \u00a316.16, after broker DKW raised its target price to \u00a318.90 from \u00a317.50. Among the fallers was brewer Scottish &amp; Newcastle, down 10.25p at 482p, despite solid results from its BBH joint venture, which leads the fast-growing Russian market. Mining stocks returned to favour, with strong gains overnight in Australia providing a running start. Rio Tinto gave a bullish presentation re-emphasising the growth opportunities provided by China and, perhaps less obviously, by the recovering Japanese economy. Meanwhile investor concerns over an imminent counterbid by Xstrata for Canadian group Falconbridge appeared to fade. Some analysts suggested the appeal of miners was best seen in the context of dollar weakness and resilient commodity prices. Xstrata closed up 30p at \u00a313.25, Rio Tinto up 5p at \u00a322.59 and Anglo American up 37p at \u00a317.39. Xstrata was not the only subject of confused bid speculation. Among the midcaps, Britain's largest engineering services firm, Amec, rose 16.5p to 358.25p on rumours of a bid from Spanish construction firm Acciona. The stock gained 7% at one stage before easing back after a quite categoric denial from Acciona. The prospect of a break-up bid still appears to surround Amec, though some optimistic market whispers have suggested there could be good news for the company concerning its bidding for London's Olympic Park contract. Others believe it is no longer in the running. Electrocomponents, the electrical and industrial supplier, rose \u00a318.25 to 253.5p after reporting a drop in first-half profits, widely trailed following a profits warning two months ago. The dip, however, has been followed by a less widely anticipated encouraging period of recent trading. Deutsche Bank analysts said: \"The current revenue performance is much better than expected, driven by a rebound in the UK.\" They suggested a target share price of 308p - but their optimism was not shared everywhere. Investec noted Electrocomponents' dividend appeared to be under considerable strain and was likely to remain so \"for several years\". Panmure concurred, moving the stock from a hold recommendation to sell. In a research note it said: \"Fundamentally the stock is unattractive but the yield of 8% provides support, despite the fact management is eating into the capital of the business.\" While the debate continues, the group's recent trading helped lift shares in rival group Premier Farnell, up 12.5p at 152p. Reed Health Group rose 19p to 54.5p after the healthcare recruitment firm received a takeover offer from the its founding family, valuing the business at \u00a332.8m. Following an early jump, the share price spent much of the day at a slight premium to the 55p-a-share bid before drifting back slightly. Bidder James Reed &amp; Partners said it had received irrevocable undertakings to accept its offer from a substantial proportion of shareholders. Before yesterday, however, discussions with Reed Health independent directors had failed to secure a board recommendation for the offer. The independent directors have instead advised shareholders to bide their time. Finally, fund manager New Star Asset Management enjoyed a strong debut, with shares soaring from the flotation price of 225p to close at 277p. Each-way on Axon Analysts at Altium Securities believe that a decision will be made this week on a \u00a3500m, 15-year contract with Birmingham city council, and that a consortium led by Capita Group is in with a strong chance. An official announcement is expected in mid-December but the stockbroker has already picked Capita's partner, IT consultancy Axon, as a \"buy\". It believes Axon, up 0.25p at 235p, could be exposed to between 10% and 15% of the value of the contract - equating to \u00a350m to \u00a375m over 15 years, with a sizable sum likely to be booked next year. Hedging its bets, however, Altium notes that the firm could be left with nothing more than burdensome bid costs should the contract be awarded to its rival IBM. Forecast margin gains, then, would be \"unlikely ... in the short term\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
