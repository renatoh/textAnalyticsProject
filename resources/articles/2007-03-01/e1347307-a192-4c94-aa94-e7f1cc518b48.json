His second full-length album reflects this to stunning effect. Though Ananda has been described as the most melodic man in minimal techno, it's the percussion on Bambusbeats that is most impressive. Pounding, rattling, dancefloor-friendly beats combine with African-influenced live drumming, delicate cymbals and steel drums to make for an experience that is brutal but intricate. There's no let-up in pace, but the variety of textures, from the metallic groove of Sweet Decay to the lush deep house of Lamakova, keeps you on your toes. Meanwhile, Ananda uses his gift for melody in ever more irresistible ways: the bounce of the horns and house piano on Blauer is smile-inducing, while the album's highlight comes with Egge, a Detroit techno monster that begins with cutesy, cut-up vocals and ends with grinding drill sounds that will aid clubbers everywhere in losing their minds. Exquisitely crafted and polished, this is a sleek and unstoppable machine of an album."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
