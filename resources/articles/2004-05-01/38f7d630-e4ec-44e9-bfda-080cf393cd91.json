The England captain twisted his right knee during net practice at Lord's on Monday and was immediately rated as doubtful for the match. But scans on the joint, the same one that required an operation 18 months ago, revealed no ligament damage. Although the prognosis remains poor, Vaughan underwent intensive treatment yesterday, and a decision on whether to wait further will not be taken until this morning at the earliest. Should Vaughan be forced to pull out, Marcus Trescothick, who tends to run the show whenever the Yorkshire player is absent from the field, will almost certainly lead the side for the first time as official captain, despite the presence of two former skippers in Nasser Hussain and Mark Butcher. The selectors would also have to decide whether Butcher should be elevated to his old opening role in order to bring in the Durham middle-order batsman Paul Collingwood, or to give a Test debut to the Middlesex captain Andrew Strauss, a specialist opener who made a solid start to his international career in the recent limited-overs series in the Caribbean. It is also possible that both could play should the conditions preclude a spinner and England decide to bolster the batting instead. New Zealand have left Shane Bond out of the team. The absence of the fast bowler had already been flagged, with the tourists keen not to rush a prize asset back after a year's lay-off with stress fractures to his back. According to the Kiwis' coach John Bracewell, he is close to match fitness and is targeting the second Test at Headingley, which begins on June 3. They are bolstered, however, by the return of their experienced and most destructive batsman Nathan Astle to the middle order. Astle, who has played 59 Tests, has had injury troubles of his own with a chronic knee problem that required surgery after the last World Cup and threatened to end his career. Stephen Fleming, passed fit after a slight groin strain, will move up the order from No3 to open with Mark Richardson. \"We've made one adjustment,\" Bracewell said. \"Stephen feels at home in the opening position, in that he has become quite familiar with it at one-day level.\" Northamptonshire's members have accepted the balance sheet for the past financial year despite it revealing that more than \u00a3247,000 is missing. The chairman Simon Schanschieff apologised for \"poor stewardship\" of the financial management. A former employee of the club has been arrested and is on police bail. New Zealand: Richardson, Fleming (capt), Astle, McMillan, Styris, Oram, Cairns, McCullum (wkt), Vettori, Tuffey, Martin."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
