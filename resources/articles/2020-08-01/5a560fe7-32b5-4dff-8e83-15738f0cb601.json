In the end small margins counted against us.\u201d Nuno was not referring to the uncharacteristic penalty hesitation from Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez or the controversy over minor infringements that surrounded it, for by that stage he had not seen any replays of the incident. Wolves supporters felt that Yassine Bounou was marginally off his line when he saved Jim\u00e9nez\u2019s unconvincing shot, but more importantly television replays revealed that Diego Carlos, who cleared the ball before Jim\u00e9nez could reach the rebound, had encroached into the penalty area before the spot kick had been struck. \u201cI didn\u2019t see the images, but if that is the case you would expect VAR to have intervened,\u201d Nuno said. There was no such respite for Wolves, possibly because the remote officials were concentrating on a much more fractional line decision involving the goalkeeper. \u201cWe can\u2019t do anything about it now,\u201d Nuno said. \u201cIt\u2019s just one more detail to consider.\u201d The Wolves captain, Conor Coady, said no blame ought to attach to Jim\u00e9nez for missing the penalty. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be pointing at him, he\u2019s done more than enough for us this season,\u201d the defender said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have conceded, that\u2019s all. We fell for a sucker punch in the 88th minute. We\u2019re all gutted because there won\u2019t be any European games next season, even though we finished with more points than last time, but that\u2019s football.\u201d His manager took the longer view. \u201cWe are here because we have had two really good seasons,\u201d Nuno said. \u201cThe Premier League is challenging enough but we are in Europe because we want to improve. I think everyone back in Wolverhampton has enjoyed the journey, and though we are down at the moment the future is still bright.\u201d On potential movement in the transfer market, he added: \u201cLet\u2019s look at what we need. The club has been amazing. We started in Championship, first season was hard, second season, and we\u2019re all together in this. It\u2019s about making good decisions which can help us and stop us making mistakes.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
