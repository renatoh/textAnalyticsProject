Most falls cause no injuries other than a few bruises, and wipe-outs can often be a source of much amusement to your friends. However, to help tip the odds in your favour, here are a few pointers. The most important rule is: if you're going to crash, let it happen. If you're sitting way back on the tails of your skis, don't fight it. It's probably safer just to flop on to your side and skid to a halt. When your knees are bent to the extreme of their range of movement, they are weak and vulnerable. While you're trying to recover from this position, any unexpected twisting movement could easily cause a rupture of your anterior-cruciate ligament - the most common injury in skiing. When you feel yourself falling sideways, never put your hand down to break your fall. The only thing you may break will be a thumb, especially on dry ski slopes. Just let yourself fall to the side, and let your rump bear the brunt of the impact. That way, the worst injury you'll suffer will be a juicy bruise. You can learn a lot about \"falling technique\" from watching World Cup racers on TV. You'll often see that, once they've crashed, they try to end up sliding on their back, with their feet in the air, especially if one or both skis are still attached. This prevents any damage being done by their skis catching in the snow and twisting their legs. And because they keep their legs straight, their knees are stronger and more resistant to twisting forces. If you're skidding along the ground at speed, try to think quickly, regain your bearings, and pay particular attention to any solid obstacles (trees, pylons, rocky outcrops) in your path. If so, you must try to manoeuvre yourself around so that you take the impact feet first rather than headfirst - leg injuries are seldom as serious as head injuries. In any case, trying to skid feet first is always a good habit, because it means you can dig the edges of your skis (or ski) into the snow to slow yourself down. It may happen that you find yourself hurtling down a steep slope with neither ski attached. In that case, you need to perform the so-called \"self-arrest procedure\". Try to spin so you're skidding along on your stomach, with your feet facing down the hill. Then, slowly perform a press-up. As your shoulders rise, your toes will dig into the snow and slow you down. After the fall, you'll have to get up again, hopefully fairly speedily, so as not to keep your friends waiting. Before trying to stand up, make sure your skis are facing exactly across the slope. Otherwise, they'll start to set off before you're fully upright. Then, you can usually push yourself up using your ski poles, by putting them together in the snow above you. Place your downhill hand on top of the poles, and hold the base of the poles with your uphill hand. You should now be able to pull yourself upright. If you're unlucky enough to have fallen in deep powder, you may find that your poles sink deep into the snow whenever you try to push yourself up on them. The solution is to place your poles flat on the snow, in a crossed \"X\" shape. You should then be able to lean on the intersection of the two poles without sinking in, as the pressure will be more widely distributed. Of course, your skis may no longer be attached. If one is still on, spin around on your back until you're lying sideways on the slope, with your ski across the slope below you, attached to your downhill foot. This means that once you've stood up, you'll be putting on your uphill ski, which is always easier. If both your skis have come off, put on the uphill ski first, then spin around through 180 degrees, pivoting on your ski-less boot. Now, when you're putting on the second ski, it will also be the uphill ski. A perennial problem, when putting your skis back on, is removing snow from the soles of your boots. This is necessary, otherwise your safety bindings may not function correctly. Many people like to knock the snow off with a ski pole, but the most efficient way is to scrape the sole of your boot along the toe piece of your binding. In deep snow, you might find it easier to stick the tails of both skis in the snow, at an angle, before putting them on. If you push them into the snow so that the heel pieces of the bindings are just above the surface of the snow, it'll be easy to click into the bindings without them becoming filled with snow. \u0095 Next week: Manoeuvring around the mountain.
