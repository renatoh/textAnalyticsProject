Andrew, in his newspaper column on the morning of the international, questioned what England had achieved under Woodward following their third consecutive failure to win the grand slam. Woodward reacted by saying that if the board of England Rugby did not take action against Andrew, he would \"have to consider my own behaviour in the future. It is their decision to make: if they decide that it was tolerable for a director of rugby of one of our leading clubs to make those comments, I would have to bow to the decision, but my view is that the remarks were not acceptable.\" Andrew said he was exercising his freedom of speech and had not used the column to attack Woodward individually, merely make observations of fact. Though England Rugby will not be taking the matter further, it is today expected to make a statement regarding the drawing up of a code of conduct for those involved in the professional game. Andrew had not broken any written rule and to have charged him with bringing the game into disrepute would have run the risk of the move being challenged legally, but he may be asked to make a choice between his media commitments and his work with Newcastle, though that would also precipitate a legal intervention. Twickenham is also looking to avoid a showdown with the International Rugby Board over ways of funding developing nations who are feeling the pinch in the professional era. The IRB has accepted that the \u00a36m it raises through the World Cup every four years is not going far enough and it has proposed a levy on the eight foundation unions: England, France, Wales, Scotland, Ireland, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand. The IRB called a meeting of the leading nations last month due to fears that some smaller unions were in danger of going broke. Under their scheme, 2% of the gate receipts of each match hosted by one of the eight would go to the IRB to be reinvested in the board's other 86 members. That would have cost the Rugby Football Union around \u00a3240,000 this year whereas its own scheme, which was unveiled yesterday, would see an outlay of some \u00a3150,000. The RFU's plan is for the eight leading unions to adopt two countries each, offering them practical assistance throughout the year. The proposal, which has been submitted to the other unions, would see England \"adopting\" Canada and the United States, a manoeuvre that should guarantee the RFU Canada's vote next April when England and France compete for the right to stage the 2007 World Cup. The RFU, which has a lucrative television contract with BSkyB, is also concerned about the future of its November internationals. England will play Australia, New Zealand and South Africa at Twickenham next November, but the tour schedule for 2003 and beyond still has to be drawn up with some unions, including New Zealand's, feeling that international fixtures are being devalued by their frequency."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
