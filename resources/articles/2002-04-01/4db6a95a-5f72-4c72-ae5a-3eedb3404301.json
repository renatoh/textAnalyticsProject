As the Yorkshire team stumbled to relegation with a record of two wins in 14 games, while giving Norwich a great chance of a spot in the play-offs, Dennis said he understood their reaction. \"I sympathise with supporters who have been behind us magnificently and today saw too many of our players who had no pride in wearing the red shirt,' he said. Barnsley had seen their keeper Andy Marriott, who was sound throughout, have a magnificent spell before Norwich finally broke through with David Nielsen's vital opening goal in the 41st minute. In the 37th minute when Nielsen was tripped by Mike Flynn in the area Marriott made a superb diving save to his left to stop Nielsen's penalty, and then arched back acrobatically minutes after to turn over for a corner what looked like being a certain goal from Paul McVeigh. It should have inspired his team-mates but seemed to evoke no response whatsoever, and from the corner by Mark Rivers Nielsen pounced in a crowded six-yard box to atone for his penalty failure and stab a low drive past Marriott. Said dejected manager Steve Parkin: \"The players let our crowd down. Marriott had a good game and saving that penalty should have been the lifeline to spur us on. But we did not battle for the ball or pass it well, and too many players just did not do their job today.\" Said Norwich manager, former Northern Ireland international Nigel Worthington, who has reinvented the Carrow Road team from a relegation-threatened side to Premiership hopefuls: \"What we have done today was magnificent, and they have deserved everything they have achieved so far\" Barnsley's demise probably started earlier in the season under a different managerial regime, and there were few reasons for optimism from early in yesterday's Oakwell clash. On his 27th birthday Barnsley's leading scorer Bruce Dyer tried hard early on to put Norwich on the back foot, and in the 20th minute had a tremendous hooked drive blocked at close quarters by alert keeper Robert Green, while earlier the 14-goal striker seemed to be pulled down by defender Malcolm Mackay when he beat the keeper onto an astute through ball. But referee Alan Leake waved play on, and Norwich, whose passing was a vital factor of their supremacy, began to get a grip on the game. The second half called for determination by Barnsley as they came out 1-0 down, but within six minutes Norwich had killed the Yorkshire side off with a second goal when McVeigh, who had been alert and lively throughout upfront, reacted quickest to a right-wing Clint Easton free kick to head past the unprotected Marriott. Now Barnsley will spend next season in the third strata of the English league for the first time since being promoted with Rotherham United and Charlton Athletic from the old Third Division in the 1980-81 season. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
