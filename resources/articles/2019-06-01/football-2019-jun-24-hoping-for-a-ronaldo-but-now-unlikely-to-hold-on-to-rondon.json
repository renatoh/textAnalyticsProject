Having seen their club endure 12 years of mostly downward drift under the stewardship of spivvy blowhard billionaire Mike Ashley, a month ago they found themselves daring to dream as news broke of yet another potential takeover. And not just any potential takeover \u2013 oh no! This one was being spearheaded by an apparently ambitious sheikh whose family is purported to be worth around \u00a3150bn. While it is easy to understand the unbridled optimism of Geordies absolutely desperate to rid their club of an owner with no apparent interest in owning their club, neutrals could be forgiven for smirking knowingly at preposterously premature, euphoric talk of what kind of bells and whistles the club would employ when the time came to \u201cAnnounce Mbapp\u00e9!\u201d Whatever about talk of takeovers \u2013 as many as three different ones are currently progressing with glacier-like speed \u2013 on Monday a more monotonously predictable announcement was made by Newcastle, who confirmed the worst fears of supporters by releasing a statement saying that manager and firm fan favourite Rafael Ben\u00edtez will not be renewing his contract when it expires on Sunday. \u201cWe have worked hard to extend Rafa\u2019s contract over a significant period of time,\u201d parped a statement, referring to the tireless efforts they put into reportedly offering him a one-year deal on no extra money, with precisely no additional assurances that he would be given funds to improve the team. Hoping for a Ronaldo but now unlikely to even hold on to a Rond\u00f3n, Newcastle fans are understandably enraged by the latest act of inertia by a bawdy banter-merchant whose enthusiasm for challenging insubordinates to drinking contests and subsequently chundering his guts up into pub fireplaces outweighs his desire to propel Newcastle up the Premier League table. Ashley is 54 years old. With one of the best managers Newcastle have ever had in demand by Chinese club Dalian Yifang, whose owner has offered to double his wages, Ben\u00edtez will be OK, but what the future holds for Newcastle\u2019s long-suffering supporters remains unclear. The Fiver\u2019s predicting more misery, more uncertainty and some big decisions to be made as the deadline looms for season ticket renewals. To pick a random animal, you can only punch a police horse so often before it rears up and lashes back in anger and even the patience of some of the most devoted fans in England must be wearing gossamer thin. In the meantime, whoever runs the Netflix Twitter account had some sage advice for Geordies in need of a pick-me-up on yet another gloomy day in their recent history. \u201cIf there\u2019s any Newcastle fans who want cheering up,\u201d they said, \u201chere\u2019s a quick reminder that Sunderland Til I Die is still streaming on Netflix UK and Ireland.\u201d LIVE ON BIG WEBSITE Join Beau Dure at 5pm BST for Spain 0-4 USA!

QUOTE OF THE DAY \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever play in another game like that\u201d \u2013 England\u2019s Jill Scott keeps it simple when trying to sum up the mind-bogglingly chaotic scenes during England\u2019s 3-0 World Cup win over Cameroon. FIVER LETTERS \u201cRe nominative determinism: a good spot by Robert Heath re Bonsegundo. In the early days of Pan American Airways (PanAm) they only had a single route (between Key West, Florida and Havana, Cuba). PanAm\u2019s chief suit\u2019s name was Juan Trippe\u201d \u2013 Mark Robinson. \u201cOccasionally I notice in your screed that there is a Stop Football movement in England. No further effort needed. VAR is doing it for you\u201d \u2013 Dale Chase. \u201cHow did we manage to go through Van Gaal\u2019s wonderful young generation of Ajax players in the mid-90s, his painfully dysfunctional years at Barcelona (largely with the same Ajax players) and the astonishingly dull Manchester United years without knowing that his name isn\u2019t actually Louis, it is Aloysius Paulus (the article is in Spanish but it\u2019s in the first line of the piece under the picture). He should be a Caesar (imperial Roman leader not dog food) with that name\u201d \u2013 Noble Francis. Send your letters to the.boss@theguardian.com.

NEWS, BITS AND BOBS England fans have told how they were escorted from the ground following the 3-0 defeat of Cameroon after tensions flared in the crowd. Like Whitney Houston before her, Marta believes the children are our future. Well, Brazil\u2019s future, to be precise. \u201cWomen\u2019s football depends on you to survive \u2013 value it more!\u201d she roared after Brazil\u2019s 2-1 defeat by France. \u201cWe\u2019re asking for support \u2026 there\u2019s not going to be a Formiga forever, there\u2019s not going to be a Marta forever.\u201d Ed the Red has rustled up a bit more cash and tabled an improved offer for Aaron Wan-Bissaka, meaning suits from Manchester United and Crystal Palace will meet to fine-tune a deal to take the full-back to Old Trafford. Mallorca have been promoted to La Liga by beating Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a 3-2 on aggregate in a play-off. And no, not even The Fiver\u2019s siesta-taking, castanet-clacking Spanish cousin Juan Miguel Manuel Ole! Ole! Ole! Fiver knows why it was played yonks after the season ended. Argentina are into the Copa Am\u00e9rica quarter-finals after a Sergio Ag\u00fcero-inspired 2-0 defeat of South American heavyweights \u2026 oh, Qatar. And Maurizio Sarri has had a pop at (not so) Big Paper. \u201cThe English media is made up of big newspapers and then the tabloids on an inferior level,\u201d he swiped. \u201cIt fortifies you but what disappointed me was that in Italy people only reported the attacks of the tabloids and not the more prestigious and reliable newspapers like The Times.\u201d STILL WANT MORE? England proved their appetite for the fight against Cameroon but Norway will have seen enough to be optimistic for the quarter-final, so says Louise Taylor. The Indomitable Lionesses\u2019 childish antics undid their positive work in the group stage in emphatic fashion, according to Suzanne Wrack. Super-Mr 20% Mino Raiola is a player\u2019s dream and a manager\u2019s nightmare, writes Richard Williams. Jacob Steinberg reckons Manchester United\u2019s fruitless search for a director of football means players are thinking twice about taking Ed the Red\u2019s millions. Six Months after South Africa won the 1996 Rugby World Cup on home soil they repeated the trick at the Africa Cup of Nations. Ian Hawkey has the lowdown. Mauritania make their Afcon debut on Monday night, only seven years after they were ranked the fourth worst team in the world. Paul Doyle tells the story of a desert football revolution.
