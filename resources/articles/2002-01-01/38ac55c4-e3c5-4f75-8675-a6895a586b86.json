Arsenal won planning permission from Islington Council a month ago to build a 60,000-capacity state-of-the-art stadium half-a-mile from Highbury on a site which is currently an industrial estate. The new ground would cost the club an estimated \u00a325m - although they have acknowledged the development could rise to double that amount - and would be ready for the 2004/05 season. It has been designed by the company which created Stadium Australia, centre-piece of the 2000 Sydney Olympics. Livingstone revealed he would have rejected Arsenal's original planning proposals but had been impressed by the latest plans and by the fact that the Premiership club have increased their contribution for local transport improvement from \u00a35.75m to \u00a37.595m. A statement revealed he also \"welcomed the significant proportion of affordable housing included in the development\". Livingstone said: \"I would have refused permission for Arsenal's original proposal but my planners have worked closely with the club, Islington Council, Transport for London and the London Development Agency, and turned an unacceptable scheme into a world-class scheme that London can be proud of. \"The new proposal will bring a package of \u00a360m of benefits to the local area,\" he said. \"It is a very good scheme indeed. The original plans would not have been acceptable but these are a model of what we would like to see from others. It will mean the area is a lot more attractive place to live in.\" The proposal is for \"a high-density, mixed-use development of three large brownfield sites\" which, the statement claimed, is \"in line with the Mayor's emerging planning policies\". Livingstone added: \"I have listened very carefully to the advice of those who still object. On balance, I believe that the new package of proposals will give London a world-class stadium, new homes and jobs and a better environment, and will help to regenerate a part of London desperately in need of major investment.\" \"Arsenal sat down with my planning officers and are putting money into community projects and it has become a model for developers. If every other developer had the social conscience of Arsenal I would be well pleased. \"After the Wembley and Picketts Lock fiascos it will be a real boost for London to build a world-class stadium.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
