I never realised I was creative or had an eye until I was in my early 20s when, waitressing in New York, I met two fine-art photographers. They offered me an internship, after which I went professional. There were events, freelance commissions \u2013 but not enough to make a living. Back in the UK, I retrained as a nurse. But I didn\u2019t stop taking photos. Today, I\u2019m a paediatric matron at St Mary\u2019s hospital, Paddington, London. Back in March we got a call saying we needed to change one of the children\u2019s wards into an adult Covid-positive one. A&amp;E was overwhelmed and the adult wards were overflowing. The children\u2019s wards, by contrast, were not as busy as usual. That evening we started to admit adults, most elderly, many needing palliative care. We had to learn about Covid as we went along. The consultants from the infectious diseases unit would come and talk to us, but we were all so busy it was difficult to stand back, take stock, and understand what was going on. We were, of course, all wearing full PPE, our faces hidden behind masks, but I would say to patients: \u201cYou know we\u2019re smiling underneath?\u201d We had gloves on but could still hold their hands, reassure them. Sometimes I would take home the clothes they\u2019d come in wearing and wash them so they could go home with clean clothes when they were discharged. It felt important. Humane. We\u2019re still in touch with some of our patients from those weeks, or family members we got to know over FaceTime. One lady still sends us cakes and biscuits every week. There were problems accessing PPE \u2013 so many times we almost ran out. We all worked so many extra hours. I lost count, but then it wasn\u2019t like any of us had anywhere else to go \u2013 we couldn\u2019t see our friends or families, so work became our family throughout that time and we supported each other. It was exhausting and intense but there was an energy about what we were doing. Adrenaline kept us going. It\u2019s not always appropriate to bring a big camera on to the wards, so I take a lot of my pictures on iPhone. I photograph my fellow workers, the domestics, porters, doctors, ward managers, the people on reception \u2013 people forget about them, but they\u2019re there every day, on the frontline. Many photos capture intensely private moments, anguish in colleagues\u2019 eyes, or exhaustion in their faces. This image is of Arman, a domestic at St Mary\u2019s. Without him \u2013 cleaning the floors, emptying the bins, making sure everything on the wards is safe \u2013 the hospital could not function. I came across him one afternoon as I was walking down a corridor. He was behind that door, pointing. He\u2019d got trapped clearing rubbish away, because most normal routes around the hospital had been closed off, or made one-way. I was struck by how he was doubly isolated: behind the door, behind his PPE. I had to untape the door to let him and his trolley out \u2013 but first I asked him if I could take his picture. People in jobs like him are so often invisible \u2013 especially when they are in PPE you can\u2019t even recognise them \u2013 but they are what the NHS is really about. The unsung heroes. I had mixed feelings about the clapping. I was like: \u201cWhy? We\u2019re just getting on with it, doing our jobs. You never clapped us before.\u201d And when I saw the politicians doing it, I felt quite uncomfortable. Do they really care? We haven\u2019t had a decent pay rise in so many years. And then my photos ended up on TV, on Grayson Perry\u2019s Art Club. He wanted people to submit art on the theme of pets and I found a picture I\u2019d taken years ago, of me and my friends, happy and relaxed in the sun at a dog show in Primrose Hill. Grayson interviewed me over Zoom and commissioned me to take some pictures of my work at the hospital, which to be honest I\u2019d been doing anyway, but I didn\u2019t tell him that. Those images then featured in the final episode, and they\u2019re also going to be part of a forthcoming exhibition at Manchester Art Gallery of his favourite work from the TV show. That led in turn to Chris Difford getting in touch. I grew up listening to Squeeze \u2013 my dad loved them and played their music all the time. Difford asked if he could use my photos on his new collaborative album Song Club. And then it turned out that they had inspired the whole album; there\u2019s a beautiful song called Hannah Takes Pictures by Kathryn Williams, and another, Working on the Frontline, is all about my working day, complete with a video that features me rapping, really badly! I love taking pictures \u2013 I\u2019m so interested in people \u2013 but how can you not love being part of saving lives? It feels like the two parts of me have finally merged. I was shooting one of the anti-mask protests a few weeks ago and got a picture of Piers Corbyn being arrested. As I was taking his picture I had to stop myself putting my camera down and saying to the police: \u201cCan you not manhandle him, guys? He\u2019s an old man!\u201d The nurse in me couldn\u2019t help it. I would never be the photographer who stands back and photographs someone jumping off the bridge. I\u2019d be the one in the frame before that, holding his hand, stopping him. \u2022 Hannah Grace Deller\u2019s photographs are in Grayson\u2019s Art Club exhibition at Manchester Art Gallery, opening in December.
