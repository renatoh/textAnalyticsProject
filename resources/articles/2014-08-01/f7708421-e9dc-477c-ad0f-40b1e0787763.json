He answered the question marks about whether his fragile tendons could get through the rounds to become the first Briton since Darren Campbell in 1998 to win a major 100m title. \u201cI\u2019d have loved to have gone quicker but the championships are all about executing your race,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the build-up we had delays and faulty starts so it was about concentrating. I didn\u2019t think I got the best of starts and I actually thought I messed up my opportunity of even picking up a medal but once I got through my drive phase I was able to pull away.\u201d Dasaolu was helped by the absence of another Frenchman, Jimmy Vicaut \u2013 the fastest man in Europe this season \u2013 who pulled out before the semi-finals with a thigh injury. But as Dasaolu pointed out afterwards, he has had struggles to overcome too. \u201cI wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to be here at the beginning of the year,\u201d he said. \u201cThe weather wasn\u2019t the best and we were delayed by half an hour but I zoned out and focused on the job in hand.\u201d And there was further glory for British sprinters as Tiffany Porter also won gold in the women\u2019s 100m hurdles. She was ahead at the start and, though the French athlete Cindy Billaud came dangerously close to pipping her on the dip, Porter held on to win in 12.76 sec, with Billaud second in 12.79 and Cindy Roleder of Germany third in 12.82. Porter, who was born in Michigan but has a British mother, said: \u201cThis is my first gold medal so I couldn\u2019t be happier. I had a great start but the rest of my race wasn\u2019t great. But it\u2019s really important to stay composed and execute the 10 hurdles to the best of your ability.\u201d There was more unexpected success for Britain in the women\u2019s 100m as Ashleigh Nelson won bronze behind the brilliant Dutch heptathlete Dafne Schippers, who is gunning for the 100m and 200m double at these Championships. But while Schippers, who won world championship bronze in the heptathlon last year and was the pre-race favourite, looked merely relieved to win in 11.12 sec \u2013 an impressive time given the spitting rain and a strong headwind of -1.7m \u2013 Nelson was utterly elated. The 23-year-old from Stoke, who describes herself as a tomboy who loves make-up and fashion, was not expected to feature in the medals but showed her potential with a personal best of 11.19sec in the heats and backed it up in the final to become the first British 100m sprint medallist at the European championships since Andrea Lynch in 1974. \u201cThe last few years have just been managing injuries and it\u2019s been tough,\u201d said Nelson. \u201cThis year I wanted to come back and make sure I was in the final here because when you\u2019re in it you never know what might happen.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t feel like that was my best race and I feel like there\u2019s a lot more to come. It\u2019s taken a lot of persistence and belief from myself and the people around me. I can\u2019t thank everyone enough.\u201d Earlier in the night Conrad Williams, Martin Rooney and Matthew Hudson-Smith all progressed through to \u2019s men\u2019s 400m final by winning their semi-finals. But Christine Ohuruogu was made to puff a little more than she would have liked in qualifying for the final of the women\u2019s 400m in a modest 52.66sec \u2013 more than a second slower than her opening round on Tuesday and behind the Spaniard Indira Terrero."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
