The safeguarding proposals were drawn up in a separate document to the review published last week showing that Covid-19 kills disproportionately high numbers of people from ethnic minorities which prompted criticism from MPs over the absence of any recommendations or guidance. Prof Raj Bhopal, a scientist who had been asked to peer-review the unpublished recommendations file, told the BBC that parliament had \u201cnot been told the full truth\u201d. The findings from Public Health England (PHE) said that people of Bangladeshi heritage were dying at around twice the rate of white Britons. It also found that other minority ethnic groups were at up to 50% higher risk of dying. PHE said the recommendations will be published next week when submitted to ministers. Bhopal, from the University of Edinburgh, described the report as an \u201copen secret\u201d and had \u201cevery hallmark of a [government] report ready to go to the press\u201d. He added: \u201cIf you consult the public, you must publish the results. Otherwise, you\u2019ve wasted their time, you\u2019ve wasted your own time, you\u2019ve wasted taxpayers\u2019 money, and you\u2019ve lost trust.\u201d Bhopal said the document titled Beyond the Data: Understanding the Impact of Covid-19 on Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) Communities, and marked \u201cofficial sensitive\u201d, contains evidence from 4,000 parties. PHE said in a statement: \u201cThe government commissioned PHE to conduct an epidemiological review to analyse how different factors can impact on people\u2019s health outcomes from Covid-19. This was published in full on 2 June. \u201cIn parallel, Prof Kevin Fenton, on PHE\u2019s behalf, engaged with a significant number of individuals and organisations within the BAME community, to hear their views, concerns and ideas about the impact of Covid-19 on their communities.\u201d Labour called the incident a \u201cscandal\u201d and \u201cyet another in a litany of failures to support BAME communities during Covid-19\u201d. Marsha de Cordova MP, Labour\u2019s shadow women and equalities secretary, added: \u201cThe government must now urgently publish these recommendations in full and provide an explanation for its lack of transparency on this review. Black Lives Matter is more than just a slogan, we cannot wait any longer for action to tackle racial injustice.\u201d Dr Khailash Chand, honorary vice president of the British Medical Association, told Channel 4 News: \u201cThe truth is coronavirus is not racist but it has definitely exposed structural and systematic racism in the NHS. \u201cWe have been asking and pleading to the government to look into it and sort this racism out once and for all.\u201d The mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, said ministers must urgently explain why they refused to publish the work and put it out immediately. One of the country\u2019s largest unions described it as \u201cgoing beyond mismanagement of the crisis and has stepped into institutionalised racism\u201d. In a statement, the GMB said: \u201cBy suppressing further investigation into the disproportionate deaths amongst BAME communities and refusing to put in place the recommended additional protection, this government will have cost lives.\u201d PA Media contributed to this report"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
