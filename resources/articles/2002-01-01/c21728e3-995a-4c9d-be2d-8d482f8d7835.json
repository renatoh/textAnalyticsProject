At the stroke of one minute past midnight (9pm GMT), automated teller machines across the country were primed to disgorge the seven new banknotes that will redefine the EU's common identity and ever-deepening economic integration. With more than 70% of Greeks supporting the euro, the new currency is more popular in Greece than anywhere else in the eurozone. Greece was the last nation to be formally inducted into the eurozone, in July 2000, and the changeover on Europe's southernmost flank received a warm welcome. Even dyed-in-the-wool leftwingers and hardline nationalists agree that Athens, euroland's poorest partner, stands to gain greatly from dealing in one of the three strongest currencies in the world. \"The boost will be as much psychological as political,\" says economics professor Vasillis Pesmazoglou. \"As a Balkan country with security worries with Turkey and various minorities, the euro's introduction can only be healthy.\" For mandarins at the European Central Bank, Greece - which failed in its first attempt to join the economic and monetary union - is now seen as a trailblazer for wannabe EU member states and countries such as Britain which have so far resisted the temptation to adopt the euro. But while advocates of the euro cite its simplicity as a main advantage, the currency caused considerable confusion in Greece in the run-up to January 1. In a series of EU surveys, less than one third of Greece's 11m inhabitants said they felt \"informed\" about the new currency. That compared to a eurozone average of 53%. The vast majority of older Greeks did not know what the euro's conversion rate is (one euro to 340.75 drachmas). Some did not know when the new currency was being introduced. \"I don't have the slightest clue about the euro,\" said truck driver Yiannis Rangoussis, 60. \"All I know is that retailers are already rounding prices up, and I'm going to be ripped off because I'm won't be able to count the change when I pay for things in drachma and get euros back.\" The problem of ignorance is particularly pronounced in remote mountain areas and on Greece's 200-plus inhabited islands. More than four out of five of Greece's 250,000 small and medium sized businesses failed equip themselves with euros before today's switch to the single currency. In the face of such bewilderment, the Greek prime minister, Costas Simitis, last week ordered the navy to dispatch 16 warships to dozens of Greek islands to arrange urgent seminars at schools. The Greek Orthodox church - which regularly denounces the EU for diluting local culture - last weekend helped efforts to educate people about the euro, as thousands of explanatory leaflets were passed out to congregations. \"The conversion effort will be neither simple nor easy,\" admitted Mr Simitis. The socialist leader, whose government doggedly pushed for Greece's entry into the eurozone, said the publicity blitz would last until February 28, when the drachma ceases to be legal tender. \"We're also asking that kids help their parents [make the conversion],\" said Maria Yennitsariou, a Bank of Greece official who has designed a comic-strip and board-game to acquaint Greek children with the new money. Economists also hope that the euro will sound the death knell of Greece's thriving black economy, currently estimated at around 40% of GNP. But like all of the single currency's member nations, Greece will find it tough to remain competitive in euroland. The real challenge now lies in meeting \"real\" economic convergence with their partners - a prospect that makes painful structural reforms increasingly inevitable. With euroland's most state-controlled economy, the government now faces pressure to deregulate the Labour market, embark on a programme of privatisation, develop technological skills and modernise the cumbersome civil service. \"In this atmosphere of celebration there is little room for critical thought, but we should take note,\" warns Giorgos Stathakis, who heads the department of economics at the University of Crete. \"There have been other common currencies in the past, like the one in Scandinavia before the war, which collapsed because of the social costs that emerged with the pressures of recession.\" In Greece, where wages are 30% lower than the EU average, powerful trade unions mindful of EU dictated reforms are already planning industrial action. The eventual price for Greece of adopting the euro may be very high indeed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
