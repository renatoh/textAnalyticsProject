The Chelsea manager was adamant Glenn Murray\u2019s winning goal eight minutes from time should have been ruled out for offside, and that his own side should have been awarded a penalty just after the hour mark when the ball struck Simon Francis\u2019s arm in the area. Yet his criticisms were relatively downbeat, a reflection perhaps of Football Association sanctions earlier in the campaign, with his mood reflecting exasperation at his team\u2019s inconsistencies. \u201cBefore this game I was still thinking we could finish top four,\u201d said Mourinho, whose team loiter 14th, three points above the relegation zone and a distant 14 from the top four. \u201cEveryone up there is losing points. Only Leicester are consistent in victories, they keep winning and winning. Every other team, even the top ones, are finding consecutive victories difficult. So before the game it was realistic to think our quality would take us out of this position, but maybe now we have to think about top six. \u201cI\u2019m concerned, of course. If our players are not able to give the maximum every day, that is a problem. If you analyse match after match, there are a few players who are finding it difficult to be consistent. You think there is an evolution [in their form], but maybe it is just one moment in which they are good. So all I would say is: \u2018Let\u2019s think about winning the next game and forget about setting targets.\u2019 To fix targets is impossible with our inconsistency.\u201d The lack of progress, with each mini-revival pursued by another dismal setback, has undermined Mourinho\u2019s authority, though the manager reiterated his belief that he retains the confidence of the club\u2019s hierarchy. The reality is there have been four losses \u2013 to West Ham, Liverpool, Stoke and now Bournemouth \u2013 in seven league games since the owner sanctioned a statement issuing a public vote of confidence in the manager in early October. While Eddie Howe and his players celebrated \u201cthe best individual result in the club\u2019s history\u201d with their owner, the Russian businessman Maxim Demin, delighted in the tunnel post-match, Mourinho was left to bemoan his strikers\u2019 lack of bite up front while reiterating he would not petition the board for funds to be spent in January on reinforcements. \u201cWell, we have a good striker in Diego, a good striker in R\u00e9my,\u201d he said. \u201cThey proved last season they could score the goals the team needs. I don\u2019t speak about Radamel Falcao because he\u2019s been injured for a long time. The reality is that, this season, they are not scoring enough goals for us. \u201cBut, again, I feel that we don\u2019t have the right to ask the club for new players. I don\u2019t think so. We started the season with this squad. We have to do better. The players have to do better. And it\u2019s more about the players having to do better than the club to go to the market. I think people must feel responsibilities. The owner, the board \u2026 they are not responsible for the bad moment. The responsibility of the bad moment is mine and the players. \u201cWe didn\u2019t deserve to lose this game. Our opponent \u2013 in the period that they thought only of defence \u2013 managed to get a goal and there was a clear mistake from the referee. And I think it is a clear handball and penalty with the score at 0-0. So the referee made a mistake, and the linesman made another mistake, but that\u2019s football. But in the first half we were not aggressive enough, in the second half we arrived in dangerous positions a lot of time with a lot of crosses from the right-hand side, but didn\u2019t score.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
