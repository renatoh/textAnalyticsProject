With shares plummeting, the situation is dire. Most pensions are heavily invested in the UK stockmarket, which yesterday dipped below 5,000 points to its lowest level for three years. The value of the average personal pension will be down about 20% since the start of the year. Final-salary schemes, which provide gold-plated occupational pensions, have lost almost \u00a320bn in the last few days and \u00a350bn since the beginning of the year. Should I stop paying into my pension? Only if you are facing extreme financial difficulties. Most financial advisers will say a slump is a buying opportunity and pension contributions will not only benefit from full tax relief but also buy more shares. They say at moments like this everyone needs to hold their nerve or maintain their inertia, whichever applies. Investments should also be long term, which makes the ups and downs of recent times less important against the long term upward trend. What about my other investments? Most financial advisers have switched a large proportion of their own savings into deposit accounts or government bonds over the last year. One said yesterday that he was about 10 to 15 years away from retirement and had 25% of his savings in cash and bonds. Other investments look distinctly unsafe at the moment. Commercial property, already in a slump, will be in a worse state now that Lehman's offices are empty. Residential property has dived 12% and could be off 50% in real terms by 2010, according to some predictions. So should I put everything in cash? Anyone who received shares in former mutual insurers or building societies should transfer them into a broader range of stocks or seek out a high interest-bearing bank account. But is cash safe when banks and building societies can go bust? Savers are protected on \u00a335,000 of deposits under the government's current safeguards. But it is hard to see how the government could let any bank go bust and allow savers to lose out. It saved Northern Rock, after all. What else can we do to protect savings? Savers should spread money between banks so they do not exceed the \u00a335,000 limit per bank for protected funds. Those worried about pensions can shift between funds so they are more heavily invested in cash and government securities. Anyone with spare cash should pay off debts to reduce outgoings. National Savings are the safest investments as they government backed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
