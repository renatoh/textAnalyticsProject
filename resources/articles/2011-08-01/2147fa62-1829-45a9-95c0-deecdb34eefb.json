Liverpool are close to taking their summer spending to \u00a354m with the \u00a36m purchase of Jos\u00e9 Enrique from Newcastle United and, having paid \u00a357.8m for Andy Carroll and Luis Su\u00e1rez in January, FSG has sanctioned the biggest spending spree in the club's history. Not surprisingly John W Henry, the club's principal owner, has admitted it would be a major disappointment should Liverpool fail to qualify for the Champions League this season. Werner has refused to set defined targets but said FSG's investment in the club is far from over. \"I don't want to promise so much,\" the Liverpool chairman said. \"I know John has said we're going to be top four and Kenny [Dalglish] says well why can't we win. But we just want to move forward \u2013 we want to be better this year than last year and just keep going on the right track.\" Werner added: \"I think the most important thing, and it may seem obvious, is put on a quality product for your fans. These are people who spend their hard earned pounds to come to see the club, and we've got supporters all around the world, who expect a quality product, and so it's been our goal to try to improve our position on the pitch and to try and create an environment for players to say they want to play in Liverpool, and to bring some of the lustre that all the fans know back to the club.\" Liverpool's chairman has echoed Henry's view on financial fair play, however. The club's principal owner recently backed Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's suspicion of Manchester City's \u00a3400m naming-rights deal with Etihad Airways, tweeting: \"A club's best player has to be worth at least 10% of your naming rights. Mr Wenger says boldly what everyone thinks.\" Werner said: \"I hope there's some teeth in it because I think it's healthy for the sport. It will make the sport more competitive. Part of our assumption when we came in last year was that financial fair play was coming into existence and that we'd hope it would have some teeth. It will make the performance on the pitch more competitive.\" In an interview with LFC TV, entitled \"Tom Werner: Up Close and Personal\", which airs on Friday at 7.30pm, the club chairman also backed Dalglish to continue his dramatic overhaul of the team's performances this season. Werner added: \"I can't think of somebody who embodies the relentlessness and the drive and the attitude of excellence better than Kenny. Obviously we knew of him before we met him. I think he is a natural leader; I've had the privilege to watch him as he trains the men at Melwood. And I just think he's so charismatic and I think he's been able to instil a sense of purpose into the club; and when he says something, I think people listen.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
