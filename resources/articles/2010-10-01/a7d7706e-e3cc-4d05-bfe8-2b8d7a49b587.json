In the immediate aftermath of the carnival atmosphere of Camp Hope, it was almost as if the appeal of the rescued miners corroded as soon as it hit the atmosphere. So mysterious, heroic and unknowable while trapped below ground (\"What happens in the mine stays in the mine\"), once they were out, for all they had suffered, they could have been all the Big Brother contestants in history being evicted at once. Stories started tumbling out like puppies. This miner was sulking because he didn't get to emerge last. This sister was furious because she didn't get to throw the welcome home party. The arrival of a wife and mistress at the camp provoked universally playful coverage. At least for now. Indeed, while the miners are said to have received \"media training\", are they truly prepared for what's to come? The media onslaught, the inevitable backlash. The fact that almost as fast as they can wash off the rock dust and adoration, they may find themselves bathed in the spittle of a capricious zeitgeist. Considering what may lie ahead, maybe they should have sent Max Clifford down in that capsule for a quick chat before they came up. This is not some pious oration on the miracle of 33 saved lives being tarnished by an \"unseemly\" dash to make a quick buck. Far from it. After all they've been through, if any people deserve to benefit, it's these guys, if only for the way they generated worldwide publicity for the parlous state of mines worldwide (another disaster was announced in China this weekend). They seem more than entitled to make a bit of money. The question is: how long before the world starts wearying of them? At the very least, there is bound to be hand-wringing over the miners being corrupted by fame and money. Funny how it's only the poor we worry about in these circumstances. The skewed logic of modern culture dictates that while it's fine for the rich and famous to continue to be corrupted by fame and money, it's deemed an absolute tragedy when the poor succumb. Hence we're curiously at peace with Paris Hilton waltzing around town with her one Chanel-embossed brain cell. Yet along come people such as the Chilean miners and before long it's \"what havoc will fame and money wreak upon them?\" The exact same patronising bunkum was aimed at the glorious young stars of Slumdog Millionaire. To their credit, the film-makers made great efforts to look after and guide them, but it didn't stop the western worrywarts: \"Now little Indian children, you are being rewarded for appearing in an international movie hit. Don't go blowing it all on sweeties or heroin, will you?\" In truth, no one needs to be concerned about the miners being \"corrupted\". As with any situation, the stupid ones will blow it, while the smart ones won't. The real concern is that they'll end up with far too much fame and not nearly enough money. Was this \"media training\" sufficient? How well advised are the Chileans with their big break, which could help them and their families far into the future? The way the stories have been spilling out, there is this unnerving sense of (non-western) media naivete. One can't help but presume that some of it is being given away for free, which is something the likes of Ms Hilton would never do. So I wasn't entirely joking about Mr Clifford. He should get in there and offer his services free. Far from begrudging the miners their brush with instant celebrity, we should all be hoping these truly deserving poor are getting the best deal. A cheat, a cad and a complete loser David Arquette is a Prince Charming for our times. Unburdening himself to shock jock Howard Stern about his marital split from Courteney Cox, Arquette revealed that he'd had sex with Jasmine Waltz. He and Cox (\"Amazing woman, an emotional being\") hadn't copulated for months. Cox was more insecure about their seven-year age gap than he was. His encounters with Ms Waltz made him feel \"manly\". Later, Arquette apologised, via Twitter, for \"sharing too much\". Who told stubble-faced, crumpled T-shirted, perma-midlife-crisis-afflicted boy-men such as Arquette that they could get away with all kinds of coded insults and cruelties as long as they toss in \"amazing woman, waffle, mumble, mutter\" at some point? Hadn't copulated for months \u2013 that's one for their six-year-old daughter's scrapbook. \"Emotional being\" (translation: hormonal nag). Insecure about the age gap \u2013 the patented Guy Ritchie manoeuvre: \"She's infinitely more interesting than me, but I know how to turn the knife.\" The \"feeling manly\" comment was clearly a pop at the (ahem) emasculating hell-hag that is Cox, but an own goal none the less. It bizarrely implies that women are somehow responsible for conferring manliness. That where manliness is concerned, women giveth and women taketh away. Really? I'd have thought that \"being manly\" was entirely up to the man himself. Sure, Hollywood makes things stranger, but somehow you can't imagine John Wayne or Humphrey Bogart asking their respective spouses: \"Is it OK with you if I'm manly today?\" By insinuating that he had to cheat with another woman to access his sense of manhood, Arquette revealed more about his own whiney, immature, resentful self than he could have possibly imagined. Ms Cox should seize her opportunity to ditch him \u2013 he's wearing his inner child on the outside. Don't expect Sugar's babes to excel at business Karren Brady rebuking the women on The Apprentice for \"misrepresenting businesswomen\" was odd. The team lost after designing a ropey beach bookstand for those people who can't be bothered to hold a Stieg Larsson paperback. Having achieved an unprecedented zero sales, the team degenerated into a screeching row. It was at this point that Brady admonished them, saying they should be setting an example. Rot. The contestants on The Apprentice are \"cast\" for their disparate and volatile personalities. Otherwise, it would be a series of people being reasonable, hard working and occasionally doing birthday collections for each other and we can't have that \u2013 it would be deadly dull television. Hence gobby, disruptive Joanna Riley stayed last week, while relatively quiet Joy Stefanicki went. With this in mind, it was puzzling to see Brady talk of misrepresenting businesswomen. The Apprentice contestants, male or female, aren't there to represent normal business people. The only people they could conceivably be said to represent are other Apprentice contestants and from where I was sitting they were more than fulfilling the brief."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
