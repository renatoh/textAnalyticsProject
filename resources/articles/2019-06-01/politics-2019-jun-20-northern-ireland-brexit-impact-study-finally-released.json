The study was published by the Brexit select committee after it was obtained by a member of the public via a freedom of information request. The so-called \u201cmapping exercise\u201d was conducted in autumn 2017 but never shared with the select committee despite repeated requests from the chairman, the Labour MP Hilary Benn. It shows that the consequences of Brexit are not exclusively related to trade and customs checks, the focus of arguments presented by hard Brexiters that ultimately led to the departure of Theresa May as prime minister. Among the areas identified are an all-Ireland congenital heart disease network \u201cto ensure that vulnerable children receive treatment on the island of Ireland\u201d. Some 46 of them are classed as \u201cnot underpinned or linked\u201d to an EU law but listed because of their link to the Good Friday Agreement or another area of cooperation between Ireland and the UK. \u201cThe network has a single surgical centre in Dublin and a specialist children\u2019s cardiology centre in Belfast, supported by cardiology expertise in local hospitals and an all-island academic programme which is under development,\u201d the 35-page document says. Other areas of cooperation across the island of Ireland that will be affected by Brexit include major emergencies and A&amp;E services, cancer research and health promotion. Also underpinned by the EU are everyday services such as the operation of cross-border taxis and mobile phone roaming services. Ireland\u2019 prime minister Leo Varadkar said: \u201cI\u2019m glad that it now has been [published] and it really sketches out the very large number of areas where there is north-south cooperation, co-operation between Northern Ireland and Ireland. That cooperation is so much deeper than trade issues it applies to so many other things. \u201c[The mapping exercise] really sketches out what the Good Friday Agreement is all about, which is power sharing in the north and increased co-operation north south and east west. So when we talk about avoiding a hard border and also protecting the Good Friday Agreement they are not the same thing. It is both of those things that we seek to protect.\u201d Repatriation of waste, the prevention of the spread of animal diseases such as BSE and TB, flood risk management, wildfire initiatives and horse racing are also listed in the study. The Brexit select committee said the list showed the extent to which cooperation on the island of Ireland was underpinned by the Good Friday agreement and \u201cthe extent to which each is underpinned by existing EU legal and policy frameworks\u201d. Among the most serious issues impacted by Brexit is cross-border policing. It is known that both the Garda S\u00edoch\u00e1na and the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) are concerned about the future of data sharing and potential difficulties in apprehending criminals who flee across the border in the absence of the European arrest warrant system. But the mapping exercise also lists \u201cliaison, training, disaster planning, joint investigations and communications\u201d. It also notes there is a cross-border agency on smuggling and tax evasion, involving the Irish Revenue Commissioners and HMRC. Nineteen areas are listed as \u201cavoiding a hard border\u201d and include everything from the central issues of customs and physical checks on live animals crossing the border to rules on movement of national treasures. The latter is governed by EU rules that \u201cstop national treasures from leaving the country and prevent illicit trafficking and looting\u201d. Movement of medicine across the island is also an issue as \u201cNorthern Ireland and Ireland is currently treated as a single entity by pharma and medical device companies\u201d, and will be subject to checks unless EU regulations apply. David Lidington, the de facto deputy prime minister, told Benn that the documents \u201cwere produced as part of a scoping exercise\u201d and were intended to form the basis of discussion and not to be published separately. The government has never published its full Brexit impact statement for Northern Ireland. The mapping exercise does not detail the contingencies for police or for the supply of energy, for example. At one point the government considered putting a flotilla of barges in the Irish Sea to deliver energy to Northern Ireland if it were to become cut off from the all-island energy grid. A government spokesperson said: \u201cWe are steadfast in our commitment to uphold the Belfast/Good Friday agreement throughout the Brexit process in all scenarios. \u201cThe mapping exercise was a factual discussion between the UK government, Northern Ireland Civil Service, European commission, and Irish government to map current north-south cooperation between Northern Ireland and Ireland.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
