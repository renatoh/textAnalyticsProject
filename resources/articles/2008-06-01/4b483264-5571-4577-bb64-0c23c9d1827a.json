But for most other audiences, Korman's tour-de-force performance as the corrupt attorney general in Mel Brooks' western spoof came as a revelation. Among the many humorous moments, Korman reaches the height of his eloquence, and the peak of his career, in the brilliant \"catalogue aria\". \"I want you to round up ever vicious criminal and gun slinger in the west ... I want rustlers, cut-throats, murderers, bounty hunters, desperados, mugs, pugs, thugs, nitwits, halfwits, dimwits, vipers, snipers, con men, Indian agents, Mexican bandits, muggers, buggerers, bushwhackers, hornswogglers, horse thieves, bull dykes, train robbers, bank robbers, ass-kickers, shit-kickers and Methodists.\" As his sidekick colourfully suggests: \"Mr Lamarr, you use your tongue prettier than a twenty-dollar whore.\" The \"fourth wall\" - that between the performer and the audience - is often broken in the film such as when Korman addresses the audience, and, at the climax, when he jumps into a taxi and says, \"drive me off this picture\". Brooks first discovered Korman when his wife, Anne Bancroft, told him to watch him on The Carol Burnett Show. After Blazing Saddles, Brooks cast Korman, though to less effect, in High Anxiety (1977) as a weird psychiatrist given to S&amp;M sessions, History of the World Part I (1981) as Count de Monet at the court of Louis XVI (Brooks) correcting people who call him Count da Money - and almost unrecognisable under a grey wig and beard and posh English accent as the head of an asylum in Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995). Korman, who was born in Chicago, described himself as an \"insecure loner\" as a child. His father was a travelling salesman, whom Korman called \"a Willy Loman type, rather bitter that he never had the chance of an education\". Despite, or because of, his insecurity, Korman started acting in school plays and turned professional at 12, when a local radio station signed him. After serving in the US navy during the second world war, he studied acting with Uta Hagen in New York and tried to make it on Broadway, but spent most of the 1950s working in restaurants. \"I tried to get on Broadway, on off-Broadway, under or beside Broadway,\" he said. After returning to Chicago and working in summer stock theatre, Korman moved to Hollywood in the early 1960s and began working regularly on television, doing the voiceover for the Great Gazoo, in The Flintstones, and appearing on The Danny Kaye Show, The Lucy Show and The Jack Benny Program as \"second banana\", ie the comic foil to the star or \"top banana\". But it was on The Carol Burnett Show that Korman got the chance to display his multi-talents, for which he won four Emmys. He was at his best as rather pompous, bullying individuals and, as a big-bosomed Mother Marcus, in drag, a Yiddish grandmother based on his own grandmother. Korman's strength lay in comedy sketches and his attempts at situation comedy, such as his own Harvey Korman Show (1978), were not successful. \"I'm much better at playing a variety of characters in skits than one part,\" he explained. For example, Korman was miscast as Bud Abbott, the straightest of straight men, opposite Buddy Hackett as Lou Costello in the television biopic Budd and Lou (1978). And, apart from Blazing Saddles, he was seldom used well on the big screen. Nevertheless, he got laughs as a randy school principal in Lord Love a Duck (1966) and as Jack Lemmon's drinking buddy on a commuter train in The April Fools (1969). Some of his other film appearances were in a lame musical version of Huckleberry Finn (1974) in which he and David Wayne appeared as conmen, the King and the Duke, and both gave performances as broad as the Mississippi. Korman also played the villain in Herbie Goes Bananas (1980) and a losing gambler in The Long Shot (1986). The latter co-starred Tim Conway, his partner in many a Carol Burnett Show skit. The pair toured the US for some years until they were in their 70s. \"I don't know whether either one of us was the straight man,\" Conway remarked. \"The most important thing in comedy when you're working together is for one guy to know when to shut up. And we both knew when to shut up.\" He is survived by his second wife and four children. \u00b7 Harvey Herschel Korman, actor, born February 15 1927; died May 29 2008"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
