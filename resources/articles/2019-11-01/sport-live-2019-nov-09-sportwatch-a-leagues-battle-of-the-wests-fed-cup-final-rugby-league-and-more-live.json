Some excellent performances to speak of today, most notably by the Matildas and Ashleigh Barty. Western United will sleep soundly tonight, knowing that the team they\u2019ve assembled is more than capable of matching it with the A-League\u2019s elite. Also some less-than-impressive efforts today. But we\u2019re not mentioning any names, are we Great Britain Lions? I\u2019ve had fun but I\u2019m now running late for an appointment with my mattress. See you next time. A gutsy performance from United to come back from a goal down and take all three points as well as their maiden home victory. The result puts United level on points with the Wanderers, who tonight had their colours lowered for the first time this season. It\u2019s still early, but both teams look capable of doing something meaningful this season. Australia have rallied from 12 points down to beat Samoa at the Oceania rugby sevens championship to secure their spot at next year\u2019s Olympics. Tim Walsh\u2019s men won 19-12 in the Olympic play-off thanks to a composed second-half lead by bench spark Henry Hutchison and captain Lewis Holland, whose late charge down and try sealed the win. Things looked dire earlier though with Samoa scoring twice despite playing the bulk of the first half with six men. Three times Australia coughed up possession in attacking positions and, trailing 12-0 at the break, it looked as if Australia would be scrapping for a Tokyo berth in an all-or-nothing tournament on Games eve. Hutchison changed the narrative though, carrying with composure and scoring the first try before forcing a turnover that led to the next. Holland missed the conversion that would have put them in front, but moments later charged down a Samoa kick and jumped on the loose ball to ensure his men would be in Tokyo next year. Newcastle coach Ernie Merrick is fuming over a VAR decision not to award a penalty after his midfielder Nick Fitzgerald had appeared to be pushed in the back in the 22nd minute of their 1-1 A-League draw with Perth. Yet to win a match after four games this season, the Jets led 1-0 until the 86th minute when Glory\u2019s Diego Castro popped up late to dash their hopes on Saturday at McDonald Jones Stadium. And despite several late chances to score, including the Glory\u2019s Alex Grant being red-carded in the 87th minute, Merrick has delivered a stunning spray at referee Jonathan Barreiro over the first-half incident. \u201cBefore we start, let\u2019s get the penalty out of the way. Have you ever seen a more blatant penalty? A push in the back, extended arm in the penalty box. How is that not a penalty?\u201d Merrick said. At half-time, Merrick was seen to approach the referee to seek clarification, but said he did not receive it. \u201cWhen he wasn\u2019t speaking Spanish, yes I spoke to him,\u201d Merrick continued. \u201cHe speaks a lot of Spanish during the games and talks to the opposition a lot in Spanish. We\u2019re in Australia, I would have thought he would be speaking English most of the time so we can all hear what he\u2019s saying to his mates.\u201d A-League: 58 mins: Goal! Western United 2-1 Western Sydney Luck\u2019s a fortune for Appiah-Kubi, who finds himself in the right spot when G\u00fcl\u00fcm\u2019s fluffed attempt at goal falls at his feet. In the end it\u2019s an easy shot to the right of the keeper to put United in the lead for the first time tonight. A-League: 50 mins: Western United 1-1 Western Sydney Huge delay here with VAR holding centre stage, as VAR likes to do, ruling on whether the ball, headed by McDonald into the chest of the Wanderers keeper, has in fact crossed the line. Confusion abounds, and you can\u2019t deny it is good theatre, but the ruling is NO GOAL. United players are convinced (of course) and so are the Fox Sports commentators, but it\u2019s what VAR thinks that counts. I promised you our report on Great Britain\u2019s rugby league loss to New Zealand in Christchurch. And I am nothing if not a man of my word. A-League: HT: Western United 1-1 Western Sydney So, where were we? Oh, yes. Geelong. Well, since Durante\u2019s equaliser there hasn\u2019t been much to report. Save for yellow cards to Patrick Ziegler and Ersan G\u00fcl\u00fcm, and Kone\u2019s injury-enforced substitution for Calver, the first half more or less fizzled out. United, however, have probably been the superior team and will be on better terms with themselves. And no Berisha? Don\u2019t start me. A-League: 13 mins: Goal! Western United 1-1 Western Sydney The Wanderers barely have a moment to enjoy their lead before Durante rises at the far post and heads home to restore parity. A pretty easy win for the Kiwis in Christchurch. I\u2019ll have a spanking good match report for you very shortly. Until then, I\u2019ll leave you with this to ponder. A-League: 5 mins: Goal! Western United 0-1 Western Sydney A very tidy start for the Wanderers in Geelong, with Thomas Duke finding himself on the receiving end of a nice ball from Georgievski. Duke could\u2019ve blazed away, he could\u2019ve gone for power, he could have fluffed it completely, but what he did was caress the ball with the inside of his right boot and curve it past the keeper. Pretty to watch. Fiji have edged Papua New Guinea 22-20 in their Oceania Cup rugby league Test in Christchurch. It was a lot closer than many had predicted but Fiji\u2019s second-half defence ensured they clung on for victory. After a quiet opening quarter, the game exploded into life when prop Tui Kamikamica opened the scoring for Fiji in the 22nd minute. That set off a back-and-forward period in which both sides scored before PNG captain Rhyse Martin kicked a penalty goal on the stroke of half-time to give his side a 14-12 lead at the break. Tries to Viliame Kikau and Ben Nakubuwai in the second spell gave Fiji a slender advantage which proved the difference. * * Again, thanks to AAP We\u2019re not far away at all from the opening whistle in the A-League clash between Western United and Western Sydney Wanderers. Teams: Western United (3-4-3): Kurto (GK); Gulum, Durante, Chapman; Pain, Jertec, Kone, Risdon; McDonald, Diamanti, Appiah-Kubi. Subs: Scott (GK), Burgess, Hamill, Pierias, Calver, Stamatelopoulos, Vujica. Western Sydney (4-4-2): Lopar (GK); Wilmering, Ziegler, McGowan, Georgievski; Muller, Baccus, Schwegler, Yeboah; Meier, Duke. Subs: Suman (GK), Adam, Trew, Russell, Grozos, Mourdoukoutas. Should be a good game. The Wanderers are in fine form and the new boys haven\u2019t been too shabby, either. I\u2019m tipping a high-scoring draw and, in the 81st minute, a rousing rendition of Go West\u2019s King Of Wishful Thinking by the entire crowd, players and administrative staff. It\u2019s certainly been a big week for women\u2019s football in Australia, so you could be forgiven - I once had an editor who despised this turn of phrase, couldn\u2019t understand it and never allowed it - for cutting them some slack against Chile this afternoon, especially as they were first-up after the World Cup. But when Sam Kerr\u2019s in your team, who needs excuses? Perth have survived a massive scare to defeat Adelaide Strikers by two runs in a last-ball cliffhanger at Karen Rolton Oval. Bridget Patterson, who played the knock of her life to drag the Strikers out of the mire, needed four to win off the final ball from Heather Graham to haul in the Scorchers\u2019 3-173. But Patterson, who had crunched six fours and three sixes in her sizzling 60 from 32 balls, couldn\u2019t quite find the rope one last time. * Brisbane Heat have leapt to second position on the WBBL ladder after thumping Sydney Sixers by seven wickets in Saturday\u2019s blockbuster at North Sydney Oval. In a rematch of last season\u2019s final, the reigning champions were untroubled in cruising past the Sixers\u2019 modest 7-123 with 19 balls to spare, leapfrogging them and Adelaide Strikers in the standings in the process. With her sister Grace Harris (26 not out) at the other end at the end, Laura Harris raised the Heat\u2019s fourth successive win over the Sixers by smashing Hayley Silver-Holmes over the long-on fence for her second six. Openers Beth Mooney and Maddy Green contributed 25 apiece and No.3 Jess Jonassen top-scored with 33 to cap a fine all-round game before the Harris sisters finished with a bang to make light work of the chase. * A stunning masterclass from captain Jess Duffin has propelled Melbourne Renegades to a last-ball, four-wicket win over Hobart Hurricanes at CitiPower Centre in St Kilda. With one required off the final delivery to reel in the Hurricanes\u2019 5-150, Maitlan Brown calmly flicked Nicola Carey past square leg for the winning run, snapping the Renegades\u2019 three-game WBBL losing streak. The home team was in huge trouble earlier in the chase when they slumped to 3-12 after Hobart spearhead Belinda Vakawera (2-21) had started with a wicket-maiden and proceeded to cut through the top order. But the Hurricanes simply had no answer for Duffin. * * With thanks to Australian Associated Press. International rugby league: 47 mins: New Zealand 20-2 Great Britain It hasn\u2019t been a great tour of Oceania for the Lions and tonight the fans in Christchurch are being treated to the Kiwis tucking into the visitors. Must\u2019ve been the haka. This one\u2019s just out of the oven. The Jets led for much of the game after Jason Hoffman\u2019s strike after 31 minutes, but Perth were always in the contest and deservedly shared the spoils thanks to Diego Castro\u2019s equaliser with barely four minutes of regulation time remaining. Newcastle needed a win here to lift themselves from near the rear of the ladder, but a point on the road will do the Glory nicely. A straight answer to that question is: very, very good, the best female tennis player on the planet if you really want to know. A not-so-straight answer to that question is: don\u2019t you know how good she is? Where have you been, under a rock? Anyway, this superb player, who is looking forward to a can or two on the couch after her amazing year, gave Caroline Garcia a tennis lesson this afternoon to draw Australia level with France in the Fed Cup final. Onya, Ash. Good evening, sports fans. The footy seasons are over, the Test summer hasn\u2019t yet begun, but I tells ya, it\u2019s been a pretty big day in sport. And it\u2019s not over yet. With the Fed Cup, WBBL, A-League, international rugby league and the mighty Matildas in action, today is ample proof that there is no such thing as a lull period in sport. I\u2019ve got updates and results galore to bring you, but before I do that, wrap your staring gear around this."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
