The move was condemned by some on social media as \u201cbrainwashing\u201d, but according to the universities\u2019 regulator, the Office for Students (OfS), institutions now have a duty to facilitate the electoral registration of students. Dan Elphick, a music lecturer, was among those to flag up his efforts to encourage student votes, when he said he was setting aside five minutes of his lecture time to allow students to register online, adding: \u201cI see this as being a vital part of their education.\u201d The initiative has been supported by the University College Union (UCU), which represents university workers, and is being replicated by lecturers elsewhere in the country before the 26 November deadline for registration. The UCU general secretary, Jo Grady, said: \u201cIt\u2019s great that some lecturers have taken the initiative and devoted a few minutes of their lessons to reminding students how to get registered, and we would encourage others who can to do the same. \u201cIt\u2019s really important that students\u2019 voices are heard in the upcoming general election, and UCU has been working closely with the National Union of Students to explore how we can support students in colleges and universities to register to vote.\u201d There are concerns that the date of the general election, which coincides with the end of term and the start of the Christmas holiday, could diminish the student vote as many head home. Some students are confused about whether to register at home or at university. In fact, they can register at both, although must vote only once. All parties will be watching the student vote closely. During the 2017 election, a number of seats appeared to have been swung by students, including Canterbury, where a well-organised student vote resulted in Labour winning the seat with a 20% swing. As well as the NUS and UCU, a #MakeTheVoterPledge campaign has been working to ensure that universities fulfil their duties to encourage students to register, highlighting the fact that, while 96% of over 65-year-olds are registered to vote, one in three young people are not. Elphick\u2019s initiative was quickly picked up by other university staff, who have either already taken similar action or plan to. \u201cI gave students five minutes at the start of the lecture and I gave them the [voter registration] link,\u201d he said later. \u201cI explained a bit about the rules, about who can vote. Their reaction was positive.\u201d Since then Elphick has added the link to his email signature and plans to give brief reminders in future. \u201cI can\u2019t afford to lose five minutes of every lecture.\u201d Following the introduction of the Higher Education and Research Act 2017, the onus is now on universities and colleges in England to enable the electoral registration of students as a condition of their registration with the OfS. Jisc, which develops digital services for the higher, further education and skills sectors, recently launched a student voter registration service. With students\u2019 consent, the service collects essential information at the time of university enrolment and automatically transfers it to electoral registrars at local authorities. So far, 2,000 students at 22 universities and one further education college have signed up. Dr Paul Greatrix, a registrar at the University of Nottingham, said: \u201cEnabling student voter registration has been a significant challenge for many years. Now that all universities in England have a legal obligation to help enable students to get on to the electoral register, every institution will want to do this, as quickly and securely as possible.\u201d Meanwhile, a poll of students by YouthSight on behalf of the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) suggests Brexit will be a key factor when students make up their minds at the general election, with 74% of the view that the country was wrong to vote to leave the EU. The overwhelming majority of those polled want a say on the final Brexit deal via another referendum (70%), and if there were another referendum, almost three-quarters (73%) would vote remain. Most say Brexit could affect how they vote, with 29% saying it will \u201cstrongly impact\u201d their voting choice; a further 42% say Brexit will affect their vote \u201cto some extent\u201d, and 53% are willing to vote tactically over Brexit. Nick Hillman, Hepi director, said: \u201cThe student vote may or may not make a big difference at this election. It all depends on how close the overall result is. But when the student vote is discussed, the conversation tends to dwell on issues like tuition fees. In fact, at this Brexit-focused election, candidates\u2019 views towards the EU could be a bigger factor when students decide how to vote.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
