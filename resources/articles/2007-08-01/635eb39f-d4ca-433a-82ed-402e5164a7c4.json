But at the base of his 6ft 4in frame, and carrying Flintoff's fragile hopes of a prolonged international career, will be a pair of tailored boots designed to give plenty of support to his troublesome left ankle. And this pair is just the first step in a quest for what his specialist sports shoemakers describe as the \"golden boots\" that will end his protracted injury nightmare. Since returning from a third operation on the joint late last month, Flintoff has been testing prototypes produced by his bat-maker, Woodworm, who are in collaboration with specialist shoemakers and the England and Wales Cricket Board. The specifics of the boots are yet to be revealed but the 29-year-old is said to be \"very comfortable with wearing them\" and it is hoped they will work the magic. Flintoff is known to have flirted with several different types of footwear over the years in an attempt to cushion his left ankle - the one with which he crashes on to the pitch with every delivery - and Woodworm expect a lengthy period of trial and error before they get this right. \"We're working with bespoke footwear manufacturers who are very, very skilled at making tailored solutions for athletes,\" said a Woodworm spokesman last night. \"These are just the first boots and could be one of a series of two or three prototypes before we finally decide which boot Andrew wears. He's got some off-the-shelf tailored boots in the short term. Everyone is working to produce the golden shoes that sort his injury problems out.\" Flintoff is likely to have undergone a series of scans in which his left foot would have been \"bombarded with lasers\", according to Jeff Fitzpatrick of the bespoke shoe manufacturers Bolton Bros. Every movement, from walking normally to bowling at full intensity, is analysed and, after length computer analysis, the footwear is produced. The exact make-up of the boots could be made public in the next month but they are sure to feature soft padding in the form of an orthotic insole to cushion the player's landing. One of the UK's leading arthroscopic surgeons believes a contraption similar to that worn by the British tennis player Andy Murray, known as a Richie brace, will be used in them but he has issued a warning over Flintoff's chances to return to his best form. \"The Richie brace straps itself around the ankle and supports inversion and eversion, and is normally with some sort of orthotic under the foot to control the rest of the hind foot's movement,\" said Simon Moyes of the Wellington Hospital. \"It is designed to let him rehabilitate without further injury. That's the up-side. But by restricting movement it's going to reduce his power. It's going to compromise his ability and, therefore, may compromise his bowling. I would expect him not to be up to full speed with that on.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
