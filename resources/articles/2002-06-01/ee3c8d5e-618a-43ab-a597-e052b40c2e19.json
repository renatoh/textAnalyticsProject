Whereas France and Uruguay pounded each other into extinction in a match with all the blood and thunder of an old-time sixth-round FA Cup replay between teams from opposite ends of the league, England's seemingly toothless performance against Nigeria in fact gave Sven-Goran Eriksson's players exactly what they wanted. Those back home who delayed the onset of the working day in the expectation of further heroic exploits may have been disappointed with what amounted to a bilateral non-aggression pact. There is, however, a significant satisfaction to be had from seeing an England side showing itself capable of doing the minimum, as the Italians would - particularly when doing any more would probably have prejudiced their chances of further progress. Eriksson seemed happier with the draw than he would have been with a win. His remarks afterwards revealed the value of finishing second in the group, thereby booking an appointment with Denmark in the cool of Saturday evening in Niigata rather than meeting Senegal in the furnace of a Sunday afternoon in southerly Oita. \"It's always difficult, playing an African team who keep the ball and make us run, run, run,\" he said of yesterday's match. \"It was very, very hot.\" The extra 19 hours of recovery time would be less important, he implied, than the conditions and the opponents. \"You can talk about it being better to meet this opponent or that opponent,\" he continued. \"I think this World Cup shows you that you never know. Senegal would have been keeping the ball and making us run. Denmark are well organised and much more direct. I don't know which is better. We'll know that afterwards. \"The important thing was going through. We did that. We're not going home tonight. We had one big first target when we arrived here and that was to survive the 12th of June, and here we are. Now we need to set another target. Reaching the quarter-final would be very good.\" Yesterday's match did not reach the highest levels of competitiveness, or even the foothills. Chances fell to both sides, but there was no great anguish when David Seaman parried Jay-Jay Okocha's free-kick on the half-hour or when Paul Scholes's 20-yard drive was diverted on to the post two minutes before half-time. Was Eriksson disappointed not to win? \"I was not. I think it would have been a different game if we had needed to win to qualify.\" He admitted that they had eased up in the closing stages after learning that Swe den had taken the lead against Argentina in the parallel match in Miyagi. \"That meant it was difficult for us not to go through. We didn't want to attack too much because it would be crazy to lose the ball and let them score a goal. It was important for us to control the game as we did nearly all the second half.\" In his own mental file, yesterday's second period could be added to the first 35 minutes against Sweden and 80 minutes of the game against Argentina as sustained examples of the way he wants England to play. But against the strolling tempo of the youthful Nigerians, it seemed a pity that England had not taken the opportunity to make more chances, particularly for Michael Owen. There is a weakness at the creative centre of the team, and Guy Roux, the sage of French football, put his finger on it after yesterday's final whistle. \"England have quality up front,\" he said, \"and their defence is a serious proposition, but their creative play is a bit average. David Beckham isn't a playmaker. He gives good long balls, but you can't always score from long balls. Scholes is a good player, very busy, he gets goals and does a lot of other things, but there's nothing really exceptional there. He's a complete player, but he doesn't have the supreme quality of the very greatest. England need an extra player.\" In the absence of such a man, or at least until Joe Cole is considered sufficiently mature to be given the task, a concentration on pace and directness is Eriksson's alternative. Long passes swiftly played can, as he pointed out the other day, take two or three opponents out of a game more effectively than any other tactic. But to achieve success by that method requires the co-operation of opponents willing to defend high up the field and leave space behind them. Germany, in Munich last September, and Argentina, last Friday, were willing to take such a risk, and paid for it. Denmark, like Sweden, may confront England with a different set of ideas, and other means will be needed to break down their defence. So far England have scored two goals in three games, the first from a corner kick and the second from the penalty spot. They need to start scoring from open play, and they need goals from Owen, who is starting to look slightly fretful about his failure so far to get his name up with the likes of Raul, Jon Dahl Tomasson and Miroslav Klose among this World Cup's leading goalscorers. \"I think he's okay,\" Eriksson said, \"and I shouldn't be at all surprised if he scored his first goal at the weekend.\" On the coach's behalf it should also be pointed out that there have been previous England administrations who would have been unable to supervise even a semi-arranged draw. \"England did their job today,\" Roux concluded. \"They played an intelligent match. And at this tournament the chief characteristic of the English team is its intelligence.\" When, you have to ask, did a hard-headed foreign observer last say that? The application of intelligence and realism was always going to offer England's only chance to get back on the road to real success, and that is what we saw yesterday in Osaka. Not pretty, certainly, but definitely progress. \u00b7 Arsenal's Nigerian striker Kanu has admitted that he will be struggling to be fit for the start of next season, claiming that he has \"a very, very serious\" leg injury after missing his country's 0-0 draw with England in the World Cup qualifier in Osaka."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
