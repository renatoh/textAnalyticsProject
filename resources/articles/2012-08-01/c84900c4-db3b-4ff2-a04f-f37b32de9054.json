There was already a sense of withdrawal from compulsive handball and dressage and beach volleyball fixes. The velodrome, theatre of the extraordinary, appeared to be quietly contemplating a future that might struggle to match its first two weeks of boisterous life. To suit the mood, in Ibiza-like sunshine, chill-out tracks had replaced the normal Britrock opening ceremony playlist on the park's Tannoys. Every girl wanted a final souvenir photo with the lads from the army, and in the Westfield Centre, posses of otherworldly Olympians sporting China tracksuits and Ukrainian Lycra were stocking up on take-home presents, jogging purposefully between the Disney store and Victoria's Secret in fluorescent trainers. Elsewhere, the colour seemed to be draining subtly from the event. You could convince yourself that the wildflower meadows that have been such a feature of the landscaping of the park were showing the first hint of running to seed (imitating pretty much everything else about the organisation of these Games, they had blossomed spectacularly, on cue and all at the same time). Even the ever-vibrant volunteers were admitting to flagging just a little. Raymond Cook, a semi-retired maths teacher from Islington, hasn't missed a day. \"It has been the most amazing fun but it does take it out of you a bit,\" he said. \"On your feet for eight hours... This is my last shift and I need to get back and cut the lawn, which is a foot high...\" Cathy Edwards has been getting up at 3.30am to come in from a friend's house in Surbiton. \"We are going to be lost without it next week,\" she said. \"It has become a routine and I have made lots of friends. We had a bit of leaving party yesterday, free ice creams, and a big thank you, but it was a bit sad to think it's all over and back to work.\" Matesh Rozario, who lives up the road in Newham, said: \"Every single day has been a highlight and we aren't always used to that around here.\" He hopes that the \"sense of the place just buzzing\" will continue, \"perhaps the Paralympics will carry it on at least for a while...\" Up in the BBC gantry overlooking the Park, Sue and Dame Kelly were having greasepaint applied for the penultimate time. The stadium itself was closed in anticipation of the last big night of athletics, waiting for another momentous moment from Mo. Couples and families breakfasting on Medal Mount in the sun were watching Tom Daley finally recollect a script that seemed to have been written for him prenatally as he began to make perfect entries into the clear blue water of the Aquatics Centre in his morning semi-final. Had we ever doubted that he would fulfil his destiny as face \u2013 or abs \u2013 of the Games? And of course, while there was still the chance, Team GB was deftly accumulating medals in what by now seemed a slightly blas\u00e9 spirit, to cement what only a week ago would have looked a scarcely credible third place in the medal table. On bright Olympic mornings such as this one, it's worth remembering that as recently as 1996 Britain came home with a solitary gold medal from Atlanta, and finished in 36th place in that table, a couple of places behind North Korea; that in the last London Games in 1948, we achieved five golds, for 12th; and that the national team has not finished above a Russian squad in a medal table since the revolution. You could almost feel sorry for British gold medallist number 26, Ed Mc-Keever, who powered to victory in the early morning canoe sprints, over 200 metres. There was a bit more canoeing to see on the lake after that triumph. For a few heady seconds it appeared as though his team-mates, Liam Heath and Jon Schofield, would produce an unexpected gold in the two-man 200m final. They led early in the race only to be squeezed into a bronze by the Russian and Belarusian boats. They were happy enough with that: \"It was tough,\" Schofield said, \"At one point I didn't think we'd make it to the line at all...\" It had also been touch and go all week for the men's hockey team, who were hoping to match Britain's women in the bronze medal match against Australia. The British men have been through an \"I get knocked down but I get up again\" tournament, coming back miraculously on a couple of occasions \u2013 including in an earlier match against the Aussies \u2013 to make it out of the group before suffering a proper drubbing in the semi-final, 9-2 against the brilliant orange Dutch. Australia, who had come into this tournament as favourites, took the lead midway through the first half. The green and gold contingent in the arena, who have not had much to sing Waltzing Matilda about in these Games, had turned out in force to see their team at least record a Pyrrhic victory in this Ashes match. The Team GB comeback habit at first proved compulsive, however. Ten minutes before half time, 19-year-old Harry Martin made a spirited attempt to run straight through the middle of the Australian defence, and from the resulting penalty corner Iain Lewers equalised with his third goal of the tournament. Prior to the match, Sean Kerly, hero of the gold-medal winning team of 1992, had suggested that the long fortnight, and all the distractions of the Games, might have taken their toll on the British team in the semi-final. \"There's a sense of euphoria in the Olympic Village \u2013 it's really exciting and it's difficult for two weeks to keep your mind on the job,\" he said. \"But ultimately your job isn't done until the end. All they can do is try to put it out their mind, feel the pain of defeat and know they never want to feel it again.\" Led by an oompah band in the stands whose repertoire did not extend much beyond Rule Britannia, Team GB refused to give a quarter against an Australian team unaccustomed to defeat. The match was at times ferociously competitive and some of the more robust exchanges led to a sound I've not heard before in these Games \u2013 (good-natured) booing at some contentious refereeing. It was like an intruder from some other less utopian land. And it's not often that a football final featuring Brazil is relegated to \"other news\", but at the Park the defeat of the inventors of the beautiful game at the hands of Mexico in the Wembley final was of only passing interest. Having repelled Australian pressure in last-ditch defence against a series of penalty corners, one found its way in, leading to a desperate closing quarter of an hour as Britain attempted to repeat the miracle of qualifying. For once, the happy ending didn't happen; Australia scored again to win 3-1, leaving the last acts of Team GB's last days to be written by others."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
