Whatever one may think of the current state of the May 1 observances in the post-socialist era, here at least is a day definitively for the outdoors. Today, happily for the majority, the prospect is of dry weather across the middle of the country at least. But whether May Day for you means dawn madrigals on Magdalen tower, a workers demonstration through the centre of your city or a even a Morris dance around the local Maypole, this is surely a holiday on which to get outside, and one on which the rain is more than usually an unwelcome participant. Britain has a long but only intermittently vibrant May Day tradition. The roots of today's holiday are lost in time, but the bank holiday itself was introduced in the 1970s. In those days the BBC still often carried live coverage of the Soviet Union's missile-dominated Moscow May Day parade, while Britain's trades unions still cut a substantial figure with their own (missile-free) parade. In more recent years, the day has inevitably lost some of its former focus and political allure. It tends to be more disparaged than any other public holiday, partly for ideological reasons, partly because it sits so close to another bank holiday in only four weeks' time, and partly because the spring weather is all too often a bit chilly. A survey sponsored by Sainsbury's last week suggests that most children will spend most of today watching television. Of all our bank holidays, this is the one that is most in need of refurbishment or simply a better focus. The answer to that challenge surely lies where May Day's own roots also lie - in the springtime outdoors. In response to all those fine words from public figures recently about the need for healthier lifestyles and proper exercise to avert obesity, perhaps the May Day holiday could become a focus for outdoor activity of all kinds. The London Marathon and similar participatory events could be given a permanent place on this holiday too - providing that we promised not to stay home and watch them on television, that is."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
