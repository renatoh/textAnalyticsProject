Gavin Newsom, the California governor, declared a state of emergency on 27 October, as crews worked to control several large blazes, including the Tick fire in the Santa Clarita Valley and a brush fire near the Getty Museum in Los Angeles. The largest of the fires, the Kincade fire in Sonoma county, forced almost 200,000 people to evacuate. Meanwhile, millions of people across California are without power, as utilities blacked out entire swathes of the state in an effort to prevent more blazes. Extreme weather has contributed to the wildfires\u2019 intensity. The past weekend saw a \u201chistoric\u201d wind event in the northern San Francisco Bay Area with gusts of nearly 100mph. \u201cI\u2019ve been in the business 30 years and I\u2019ve never seen anything like this,\u201d said Steve Anderson, a forecaster in the San Francisco office of the National Weather Service. Here\u2019s what else you need to know about the crisis: Is this normal, or is it global heating? Wildfires are part of life in California and a natural part of the ecosystem, and autumn is the traditional high-risk season for fires to break out. However, experts broadly agree that the climate crisis is making the conditions for wildfires worse, and extending the season for longer. Since 1970, temperatures in the western US have increased by about double the global average, lengthening the western wildfire season by several months and drying out large tracts of forests, making them more fire-prone. \u201cClimate change is increasing the vulnerability of many forests to ecosystem changes and tree mortality through fire, insect infestations, drought and disease outbreaks,\u201d a major climate assessment by the US government states. Cal Fire, the state\u2019s wildfire disaster agency, says that \u201cwhile wildfires are a natural part of California\u2019s landscape, the fire season in California and across the west is starting earlier and ending later each year. Climate change is considered a key driver of this trend.\u201d Prominent figures, including the congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the environmental scholar Bill McKibben, have called the fires an urgent reminder that we need to cut carbon emissions drastically or face irreversible climate breakdown. Why are there power outages? California\u2019s power companies fear that their equipment may start new fires amid high-risk weather conditions, including the fierce winds the state saw in past days. Rather than risk trees toppling power lines or other equipment malfunctioning, Pacific Gas &amp; Electricity and Southern California Edison have preventively cut off power to more than a million customers, sometimes for days on end. PG&amp;E, California\u2019s largest utility company, filed for bankruptcy in January as a result of numerous litigation over its role in the 2017 northern California fires and the 2018 Camp fire, the deadliest in state history. The current power shutoff is not the first this year, but it is the largest so far and unprecedented in the state\u2019s history. Authorities have not yet confirmed what sparked the Kincade fire, but PG&amp;E said a 230,000-volt transmission line near the wine-country town of Geyserville malfunctioned minutes before that blaze erupted on Wednesday night. What\u2019s going on with the wind? Strong fall winds are typical in California, so typical in fact that local residents refer to them by proper names \u2013 \u201cthe Diablos\u201d in the north and \u201cthe Santa Anas\u201d in the south. The winds are caused when high-pressure air inland warms, dries and picks up speed as it travels down the Sierra Nevada mountains toward the Pacific coast. This year\u2019s record heat in Alaska, as well as unseasonable cold in other western US states, have made that wind pattern even more extreme than usual. How do these fires compare to previous years? The 2017 and 2018 were the two deadliest wildfire years on record. The Kincade fire is still only a fraction of the size of the 2017 northern California fires, which killed 44, and there have been no fatalities linked to the fires yet. But in a state still reeling from the aftermath of the 2017 fires, as well as the 2018 Camp fire in Paradise, which left 86 dead, the shadow of previous disasters is looming large. Rebuilding in places like Paradise has only begun, while some people have only recently returned home now face having to leave again. And from northern California to Los Angeles, residents are grappling with the sinking sense of that their state has become unlivable amid a \u201cnew normal\u201d of debilitating heat, an endless fire season, mandatory mass evacuations and forced power shutdowns to prevent new blazes."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
