Klopp has attracted widespread criticism for refusing to play senior players in the fourth-round replay or take charge of a game that clashes with the club\u2019s scheduled mid-season break. He apologised to the League One side on Tuesday for taking the spotlight from their comeback in the first tie with his post-match comments but, on his stance over the replay, he was unrepentant. Liverpool\u2019s manager claimed the Football Association did not consult \u201csports-responsible people\u201d over playing replays during the break as he hit back at the organisation for stating all clubs had accepted the dates before the season started. He also insisted Critchley, the under-23s coach, was the best man for the job of leading a team of under-23s at Anfield next Tuesday. \u201cCould I be here for the game?\u201d said Klopp. \u201cOf course I could but that would be a complete misunderstanding of management and coaching. It\u2019s not about showing up for the team for two days or one day training and now I tell the boys [what to do]. They need their coach and they get their coach: Critch.\u201d The FA has described the mid-season break as a \u201cplayer break\u201d but Klopp confirmed he would be taking one too and would not be at Anfield for the replay. He dismissed the idea of watching from the directors\u2019 box. \u201cWhat difference would it make? Why should I be there? Give me a reason why I should,\u201d he said. \u201cOn the football side it is clear and the other thing is we have to make a stand.\u201d It was put to Klopp that he should be present because he is Liverpool manager and supporters will be paying to attend, albeit with the club reducing ticket prices to \u00a315 for adults and \u00a35 for young adults. But he insisted the decision was a matter of principle in his long-running complaint over the demands on international players as much as to respect their first mid\u2011season break. \u201cWe had to make a decision. If you have a group of players, and I work with them a lot, they are human beings with families and I respect them a lot. We don\u2019t say to them: \u2018Now you can go away\u2019 or \u2018Now you can\u2019t go away\u2019. That is constantly an open question and I don\u2019t like open questions. I think that always takes concentration away. I think it\u2019s necessary that these boys, these all\u2011time players who constantly play, get their time off. We are a football team and we are a group together. We are all or nobody. We had to make the decision then and we made it. Of course we thought we would go through, we would win, but we didn\u2019t and although it was not in the beginning it is now a principle thing. \u201cThey scored the equaliser and I thought \u2018OK\u2019 but now we have to stick to it. And I really think there are bigger problems in the world to be honest, much bigger problems, than if the manager of LFC \u2026 I really don\u2019t understand that you make it so big. You can write whatever you want but you make it so big that I should be in the directors\u2019 box because people pay money to watch the game and what do I do?\u201d Klopp insists his stand is necessary given the increasing workload that leading players face. \u201cEverybody said it has to change,\u201d said the manager, who confirmed Curtis Jones, Harvey Elliott and Pedro Chirivella would play against Shrewsbury. \u201cIt will be more if we don\u2019t try to put in a break, it will be more.\u201d But he admitted his stance could encourage big clubs to seek a breakaway league. \u201cThat\u2019s not my idea and I really don\u2019t like it but it looks like it could happen. At one point probably when I am not in the business any more, it can happen.\u201d Sadio Man\u00e9 will miss Wednesday\u2019s Premier League visit to West Ham and the home game against Southampton on Saturday with a small muscle tear. The influential forward is expected to be fit after his side\u2019s mid-season break."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
