Iraqi citizens are beginning to speak relatively openly, even with much of the feared security apparatus still in place, in a way unthinkable just a few weeks ago. Thoughts are naturally turning to Iraq's future after Saddam; humanitarian aid, albeit limited, is now entering the country through Umm Qasr. This does not mean that the successful completion of the military campaign can be taken for granted. The use of chemical weapons, for example, or further civilian deaths, could yet change the nature and mood of this conflict. Yet it is also clear that the military campaign has achieved much in just two weeks of action. Progress to Baghdad has been swift. Many of the legitimate concerns and worst fears of those morally and instinctively opposed to the war have not, as yet, come to pass. Environmental disaster in the southern oilfields, mass refugee flows into Jordan or the dragging of Israel into the conflict have all been avoided. Both the Iraqi and coalition death tolls have been lower than many initially feared. The political challenges which lie ahead may well prove more complex and intractable than the military action they follow. That the legitimacy and legality of this war have been widely questioned makes it imperative that the United States and Britain keep their pledges on humanitarian aid and Iraq's future and seek to build a multilateral framework for the reconstruction of Iraq, in which the United Nations must be closely involved. The plans revealed in The Observer today for Britain to play a significant role in the immediate post-Saddam future may be a welcome first step. When Tony Blair and George Bush meet in Belfast tomorrow, they must make clear that their goal is to pave the way for a broad-based and representative Iraqi-led government and that Iraq's democrats must be included in the transitional administration, to help emphasise that a swift defeat of Saddam should not be viewed as a humiliation for the Arab and Muslim world. This is not a time for Pax Americana, whatever some in the Pentagon might think. Nor is there any credible case for threatening new conflicts in Syria or Iran. Instead, this is a time for sober planning with only one objective - to give back to the Iraqi people more than they have lost over the last weeks of military action, and more than two decades of dictatorship."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
