You, next to play, have the ace of the suit led. The instinct of many players is to grab the ace. It takes a lot of experience to realise that often you will be better off not taking your ace: declarer was going to win either this trick or a later one with the king anyway. And the position may be like this: North (Dummy) 3, West (Partner) J1085, East (You) A764, South (Declarer) KQ72 If you grab your ace when declarer leads dummy's singleton, declarer has two established winners on which two losers from dummy can be discarded. Duck your ace, and she makes only one trick in the suit. More complex positions can occur in which it is correct to duck. Today's deal is from the Lady Milne trophy. East-West vulnerable, dealer South. When England met Ireland, Sarah Teshome for England became declarer as South in four hearts following a transfer sequence. West led a diamond to dummy's queen and East's king. The diamond return was taken by dummy's ace, and because the defenders were threatening a diamond ruff, declarer had to draw trumps. Three rounds of hearts were played ending in the North hand, and declarer asked for dummy's singleton three of spades, putting East in the position we have been discussing. The Irish defender went up with her ace and switched to a club, but Teshome was in control. She won with the ace of clubs and led the queen of spades, covered by West with the king and ruffed in dummy. Returning to her hand with the jack of diamonds, declarer discarded a losing club on the jack of spades and claimed her game for the loss of one spade trick, one diamond and one club. But if East had ducked the ace of spades, West could win with the king."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
