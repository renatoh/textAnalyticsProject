A cautionary guide will be produced by Fare \u2013 formerly Football Against Racism in Europe and now a pressure group that campaigns for equality in football \u2013 and dispersed to fans travelling to the tournament. Being gay is not illegal in Russia but the country has a law banning teaching about homosexuality in schools and there are numerous cases where gay people from foreign countries have been attacked because of their sexuality. Piara Powar, executive director of Fare, said:\u201cThe guide will advise gay people to be cautious in any place which is not seen to be welcoming to the LGBT community. The same message is there for black and ethnic minority fans \u2013 do go to the World Cup but be cautious. If you have gay fans walking down the street holding hands, will they face danger in doing so \u2013 that depends on which city they are in and the time of day. \u201cThe guide will also include some detailed explanations of, for example, the actual situation of the LGBT community in Russia. It is not a crime to be gay but there is a law against the promotion of homosexuality to minors. Issues relating to the LGBT community are not part of the public discourse. Gay people have a place in Russia which is quite hidden and underground.\u201d Fare has also written to Fifa on behalf of two fans\u2019 groups from Britain and Germany to ask for permission to raise a rainbow flag inside stadiums during the World Cup, which begins in June next year. Although political displays are banned inside stadiums it is understood the governing body would not consider rainbow flags to fall into that bracket and fans would be welcome to wave them before and during games. The World Cup draw takes place on Friday at the Kremlin, where organisers will hope football is the focus of attention. But fears that the spectre of homophobia and racism could deter some supporters from travelling to Russia are very real. Fare is imploring Fifa to introduce an official rule whereby fans can be reprimanded under a specific charge of homophobia. The plea follows the court of arbitration for sport\u2019s decision to cancel two fines imposed by Fifa on Mexico\u2019s FA after their fans loudly chanted the Spanish word \u201cputo\u201d \u2013 widely known to be an anti-gay slur \u2013 during international matches. Fifa had to bring charges under general fan misbehaviour as opposed to specific homophobic abuse. \u201cSince the Brazil World Cup we have seen variations of that chant becoming a big thing in football,\u201d said Powar. \u201cThere is no offence of homophobia in Fifa\u2019s rules and we have made clear that there should be. It is critical there is a clear message about Fifa\u2019s ability to act in these cases against the fans that are responsible.\u201d Far-right extremist groups have already had around 300 people banned from attending the World Cup. The former Chelsea midfielder Alexei Smertin was appointed as an anti-racism and discrimination inspector at the Russian Football Union and appears to be taking the problem seriously, issuing fines to offending clubs. Powar said: \u201cIn Russia it tends to be that politicians feel they are being attacked and say it is all a western conspiracy driven by the western media \u2013 usually the UK media \u2013 and then after a while they accept there are some issues and quietly get on with dealing with those issues. The local population are pretty proud of the fact they are hosting and want to be seen as acting as a good host.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
