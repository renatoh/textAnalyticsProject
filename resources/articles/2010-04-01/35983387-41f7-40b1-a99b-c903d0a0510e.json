She collects objects on her travels, keeps mementoes from special occasions and scours junk shops. Then, like a museum curator, she displays them in much the same way the rest of us do a new Habitat lamp or Ikea cushion. \"Think of all the stuff you own that has emotional or historical significance,\" says Court, a stylist and designer. \"It's just a matter of finding ways to incorporate them into your surroundings. This means you'll end up with a home that's distinctly yours, and not just a replica of a homewares catalogue.\" Aside from personalising a space, this approach is a cheap, flexible way of transforming your home. \"Rooms should evolve to suit your mood or current obsessions,\" Court says. Her advice? Look for vintage hardware \u2013 hooks and nails, say \u2013 and you'll find distinct shapes that are no longer available and that will bring a certain authenticity to your home. Visit thrift shops and markets. And always take a camera on your shopping trips. \u2022 Etcetera, by Sibella Court, is published by Murdoch Books at \u00a320.
