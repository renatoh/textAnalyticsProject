Nottinghamshire, hoping to become the first side to win the competition on their own ground, needed 11 runs from the final ball, bowled by Leicestershire's Jimmy Allenby. Will Smith hoisted the high full-toss over mid-on for six. So Leicestershire won their second Twenty20 title by four runs. But television replays suggested that the ball was above waist height and should have been called a no-ball, which would have cost two further runs. Notts, in other words, should have been given an extra ball, with three runs required from it for victory. Jones, who was standing at square-leg for the last over, admitted: \"I looked at it on TV when I got back and it was a no-ball. It was a marginal one but it was a no-ball. I must say that I was concentrating on the four men inside the circle and keeping the water out of my eyes at the time, because it was raining very hard. And I had the lights in my eyes. \"But these calls are often very difficult. I would be in favour of a rule change, where a no-ball is called when it is above stump height. Because everyone knows where the stumps are.\" When it comes to the height of the ball, the standing umpire looks to the square-leg umpire for guidance before making his own signal to the scorers. Hartley, the standing umpire on Saturday evening, said last night: \"I wish I had called a no-ball because I saw it on TV this morning and it was one, albeit a marginal one. \"But, if you didn't see it, you can't call it. I didn't pick up the height of the ball until it was hit. And the fact that it was hit to mid-on influenced my judgment a little. It is difficult to hit a high ball down the ground. It normally flies over square-leg or midwicket. \"The height rule, though, is when the batsman is standing upright and he is rarely upright when playing a stroke, so it is a difficult one, especially when the call is a tight one, as it was here.\" But the Nottinghamshire batsman Samit Patel felt the non-call denied them the opportunity of recording a remarkable victory. \"It was clearly a no-ball and it cost us the chance to win the final. We got so close,\" he said. In the circumstances, however, with glaring floodlights and driving rain, few people were prepared to give the umpires a hard time for getting such a marginal decision wrong and Mick Newell, the Notts coach, confirmed later that he would not be making a formal complaint. \"I think a no-ball should have been called and I'm disappointed because I thought it was fairly clear. But it happens. It was a tough situation and, if they don't see it, they don't see it.\" Leicestershire, though, deserved their title for playing the best cricket on finals day. Their total of 177 for two, with Darren Maddy top-scoring with 86 not out, was the highest score in the final of this competition. But Twenty20 cricket does not have a hoary history and it was really nothing more than a par score - four runs more in fact than they had made in their semi-final against Essex, a game they won by 23 runs. Their strength, though - apart from the prolific Maddy, the first batsman to score 1,000 runs in this competition - is in the field. They field like tigers and, with two spinners bowling a tight line, there is something of the old Gloucestershire in their one-day cricket. The captain Jeremy Snape, who once played at Nevil Road, has brought a huge influence with him. The success of Twenty20 is likely to lead to another increase in the number of matches in 2008 or 2009. David Collier, the chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board, said yesterday: \"We are going to be carrying out a review over the next year and we will looking at the possibility of expanding the zonal rounds, which would mean an additional two matches.\" The danger lurks that the domestic game could become too greedy about Twenty20, as it is about one-day cricket in general. The old knock-out trophy, now wearing the clothes of C&amp;G, has been ruined by its switch to a league format, even though there will be semi-finals next season. Collier does accept that Twenty20 should not be played throughout the season, though. Now the ECB, if it is truly serious about Twenty20, should look beyond the gimmickry of these finals days, with its mascot races and cheap presentations, and let the competition stand alone as perhaps the biggest single day in the domestic game's calendar."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
