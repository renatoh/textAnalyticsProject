With 16 months now under her belt, the managing director, Michelle Guthrie, is getting on with her \u201ctransformation\u201d agenda which includes creating the $50m GIG, or Great Ideas Grant, creating 80 new jobs in regional Australia and shedding 200 jobs in management, support and content areas. Now, with the help of consultants, she is attempting to reorganise the national broadcaster for the post-analogue age. What this means is rearranging the broadcaster along genre lines rather than the traditional platforms of television, radio, news and online. Nothing is set in stone but the idea is to put a TV show such as Catalyst and a radio program such as Robyn Williams\u2019s The Science Show under the new genre heading of science \u2013 and to move them out of the TV division and Radio National, respectively. The science unit would be platform-agnostic and produce content for TV, digital and radio, sharing resources and ideas. The \u201cproposed content team design\u201d has been informed by a lengthy period of programming and commissioning workshops and \u201ccascade sessions\u201d that content leaders \u2013 executive producers in the old language \u2013 have held with their teams. All of it has been done with pitch-perfect management speak so beloved by the ABC bosses. \u201cThis feedback is informing how we organise our content teams to focus on audiences and how they want to consume content, rather than based on platforms,\u201d the latest memo says. \u201cAs we have discussed in our workshops and cascade sessions, our aim is to create opportunities for our people to grow our reach and relevance to Australian audiences. It is also important that the roles, work flows and culture is fundamentally better than what we have now.\u201d This radical restructure will necessarily mean loss of empires. The executive team responsible for managing the restructure are Gaven Morris (news), David Anderson (TV) , Fiona Reynolds (regional) and Michael Mason (radio). Adding to the power struggles inside Aunty is the arrival of John Lyons, the former associate editor of the Australian, who has landed the powerful role of head investigative and in-depth journalism, making him responsible for 7.30, Australian Story, Four Corners, Q&amp;A, Insiders, Offsiders, Lateline, Foreign Correspondent, Behind the News, AM, PM, The World Today and Correspondents Report. Bauer\u2019s risk management The Bauer chief executive, Paul Dykzeul, is a plain talker. He is unfazed by criticism the company has received after an exodus of magazine editors and senior management since he took over in June. \u201cIf people think I\u2019m a prick, if people think I\u2019m an asshole, that\u2019s fine, he told Mumbrella this month after shaking up the magazine company. \u201cI can\u2019t do anything about that.\u201d So it\u2019s perhaps not surprising the historic $4.5m payout to the actor Rebel Wilson has not cramped his style. In an interview with trade publication MediaWeek, Dykzeul conceded the judgment was a \u201cdifficult issue\u201d but it\u2019s business as usual as far as celebrity gossip is concerned. \u201cThere are some significant issues for media generally in that document, which we want to consider,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one goes out of their way to get it wrong and to defame people. The company has been through this on many occasions and I have been through it when we lost the biggest case ever in New Zealand some time ago. \u201cThis won\u2019t materially change our business. I am not suggesting the amount of $4.5m is insignificant. [Celebrity coverage] is the nature of what we do. There are risks attached to what we do and we have to accept those risks.\u201d Lowy highs There was passionate support for foreign news reporting at the Lowy Institute\u2019s media awards in Sydney on Saturday night at which the New York Times columnist Bret Stephens delivered the keynote address. Australian foreign correspondents past and present, including Leigh Sales, Hugh Riminton, Chris Reason, Michael Usher, Ed Roy, Max Uechtritz, Michael Carey, Philip Williams and Monica Attard, turned out in force to support the dying art of Australian correspondents covering the world for Australian eyes. Stephens referred to the controversy that followed Lowy\u2019s invitation for him to speak at the media award ceremony, which was to be named after the late ABC broadcaster Mark Colvin. But Lowy removed Colvin\u2019s name after a family disagreement. \u201cI\u2019m aware of the controversy that has gone with my selection as your speaker,\u201d Stephens said. \u201cI respect the wishes of the Colvin family and join in honouring Mark Colvin\u2019s memory as a courageous foreign correspondent and an extraordinary writer and broadcaster. And I\u2019d particularly like to thank [Lowy director] Michael Fullilove for not rescinding the invitation. \u201cThis has become the depressing trend on American university campuses, where the roster of disinvited speakers includes former secretaries of state Henry Kissinger and Condoleezza Rice, former Harvard University president Larry Summers, actor Alec Baldwin, human rights activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali, DNA co-discoverer James Watson, Indian prime minister Narendra Modi, film-maker Michael Moore, conservative Pulitzer prize-winning columnist George Will and liberal Pulitzer prize-winning columnist Anna Quindlen, to name just a few.\u201d You can read Stephens\u2019 speech in full here. Matt Brown\u2019s home truths The nominees in the room included the ABC\u2019s PNG correspondent, Eric Tlozcek, Fairfax\u2019s Nick McKenzie and Sashka Koloff and Guardian Australia\u2019s Ben Doherty and Nick Evershed. Nine\u2019s new political editor, Chris Uhlmann, who was nominated along with Fairfax for his work on Four Corners, was stopped from attending at the eleventh hour by bushfires along the Hume. Popular winner Matt Brown, the ABC\u2019s Middle East correspondent, gave an emotional speech in which he thanked his parents for \u201cnever once asking me to stay home\u201d despite the fear of fate intruding again, as it did 23 years ago with the loss of his sister. ABC news management conspired with the Lowy Institute to get Brown home for the award, without letting on that he was the winner. Brown said his entry was based on a Four Corners report but also for a whole body of work on Islamic State and Mosul he had done over several months for online, either directly or repurposed from radio and TV reports. The corporate line, Brown said, is that we are a multi-platform organisation available wherever and whenever audiences want us, but in reality \u201cABC editors are better than any editor anywhere in the world at squeezing more product out of a reporter for more platforms than you can imagine\u201d. Tibetan in, M\u0101ori out at SBS Every five years SBS Radio has to rethink what languages it will provide as a result of changes to the population \u2013 a further 1.3 million people have migrated to Australia in that time and nearly 4.87 million speak a language other than English at home. Using the Australian Bureau of Statistics census data, SBS World News Radio reviewed its roster of 70 languages and, with a high degree of diplomacy, brought new communities into the fold and cut others adrift. Adjacent to this difficult process \u2013 which sources say has led to groups turning up at SBS to lobby in person \u2013 is the death of the SBS Radio news broadcast. Hidden in the fine print was the decision to end the broadcast of the daily English-language news bulletins \u2013 which had already been cut to just a half-hour a day \u2013 from 20 November. World News Radio, a current affairs program broadcast weekdays at 6pm on the AM networks in Sydney and Melbourne and on the national network, will be \u201cdiscontinued\u201d. Instead SBS will offer on-demand audio news updates. The seven new languages SBS will add are Telugu, Karen, Tibetan, Hakha Chin, Rohingya, Mongolian and Kirundi (Rundi). Twelve languages are being dropped: Kannada, Tongan, Norwegian, Cook Island M\u0101ori, Fijian, Swedish, the African program in English, Lithuanian, Malay, Latvian, Danish and M\u0101ori. SBS\u2019s director of audio language and content, Mandi Wicks, said she had made the tough decisions based on published criteria such as size of population and high needs. \u201cIt\u2019s a long and sensitive process because Australia has changed so much in the last 40 years since SBS was set up and our challenge is to continue to evolve,\u201d Wicks said. \u201cPeople value those services which provide them with important news and information.\u201d Like the news bulletins, the new languages will be launched as digital-only because they are designed for much younger audiences and will feature podcasts and online articles. Each language service will include news and current affairs, as well as guides to accessing healthcare and other services in the Australian community, celebrating culture and discussions on Australian values. Despite the changes SBS Radio will remain the most linguistically diverse public broadcaster in the world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
