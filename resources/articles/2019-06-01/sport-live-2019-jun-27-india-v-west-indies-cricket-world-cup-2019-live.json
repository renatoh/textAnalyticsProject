Damian Burns (23rd over) added a PS, which we now have time for. He\u2019s in St Helena, which, as you know, is in the South Atlantic. \u201cP.S. The St Helena cricket season came to a close last Saturday, where the final match of the season saw the Royal Challengers (RMS T20 cup winners) take on Jamestown Heat in another low-scoring thriller for the 25-over knockout cup. Jamestown struggled with the bat, managing to post a measly 125 in their 25 overs (having thrashed the Sandy Bay Pirates in the semis with a score of 245). This should have been a doddle for the Challengers, who successfully chased 190 in the semis to defeat the league champions Levelwood Allstars, and whose squad boasts almost half of the team that toured Botswana last year for the ICC World Twenty20 Africa C Qualifiers. Some feisty early bowing by Jamestown had the Challengers 8-3 off 2, and soon 24-4 off 4, however some solid middle-order batting got them over the line with 5 overs to spare and 4 wickets in hand. \u201cFor a population of 4000 in the middle of the South Atlantic, it\u2019s incredible how this island manages a six-month cricket season with 9 teams competing in four separate tournaments, and also sends a squad to compete internationally. My university had 5000 students and we could barely get together 9 players!\u201d Clearly, a few universities need to move to the South Atlantic. Thanks to Damian and to you for your company, your emails, your Dantean nuances and your refreshing scepticism about India\u2019s abilities. We\u2019ll be back tomorrow with South Africa v Sri Lanka, with the latter eyeing the semi-final slot that England are determined to hawk around. The captains speak. Jason Holder is dignified in defeat, praising his bowlers (\u201cthey\u2019ve had a reasonable campaign\u201d) and bemoaning his team\u2019s fielding. \u201cWe\u2019ve let ourselves down significantly.\u201d He may be thinking of the moment on Saturday night when Carlos Brathwaite had all but laid on the miracle they needed against New Zealand, only to get carried away and try to win it in style when a few singles would have done fine. Virat Kohli mainly talks about MS Dhoni, who was first poor, then effective, then poor again, then, for a moment, superb. \u201cIf he says 265 is a good score,\u201d Kohli says, \u201cwe don\u2019t aim for 300 and end up with 230.\u201d But \u2013 no offence to old man Dhoni \u2013 it still feels as if opponents will be relieved not to see Rishabh Pant coming out to join Kohli. So here\u2019s the table, as brought to you by The Guardian. India are all but through, and West Indies are down in the doldrums with South Africa. India are not top of the table, because they still have that ridiculous game in hand, but they are top on net run rate, with 1.16 to England\u2019s 1.05. That\u2019s the second time this week that India have knocked England off a pedestal \u2013 the first being the No.1 world ranking for ODIs. The tectonic plates are shifting. Shami\u2019s been robbed. Kohli is named Player of the Match, presumably by someone watching cricket for the first time. He did get the highest score, but the game was won by Shami. Here\u2019s Anand with another interesting point. \u201cHaving been used to finding our players in the top run getters or wicket takers but having a poor campaign,\u201d he says, \u201cI find it very interesting that none of the Indian bowlers or batsmen are in the top 5 wicket takers or run scorers but India have been doing well. Feels like we are NZ in disguise.\u201d If so, there\u2019s a glimmer of hope for the other top teams: it means India will lose in the semi-final or final. Well, West Indies managed half the runs. And when the scoreboard says India were twice as good as them, it doesn\u2019t lie. Shami took 4-16, Bumrah 2-9: between them, they bowled 12.2 overs and took 6-25. That\u2019s the sort of pain that used to be inflicted by West Indies\u2019 quicks on India. Pandya and Kuldeep chipped in with a wicket apiece, and Chahal took a couple. The chinks that Anand mentioned are certainly there in the Indian batting, but the bowling, at the moment, is word-perfect. Umpire Kettleborough forgets to raise the finger, but West Indies have raised the white flag. And that is that. India were shaky with the bat but absolutely imperious with the ball. They march on, the only invincibles left in this World Cup, while West Indies tumble out. It\u2019s June 1983 all over again, only this time there are no surprises. Thomas ducks into Shami\u2019s bumper, and it looks like a glove... 34th over: West Indies 143-9 (Roach 14, Thomas 6) Kohli could easily apply the coup de grace by bringing back Bumrah or Shami, who each have four overs left. But he seems to feel that his wrist-spinners need the practice, which allows Roach to keep on mowing. And Brian Withington is back. \u201cSurely the answer to your question regarding England\u2019s prospects on Sunday (over 27) is that the excellent Bumrah is due a well-deserved day off in preparation for the Sri Lanka game and the knock-out stages. Surely?\u201d 33rd over: West Indies 135-9 (Roach 6, Thomas 6) Roach connects with a wallop off Kuldeep and gets four over mid-off. It\u2019s all over bar the slogging. 32nd over: West Indies 129-9 (Roach 1, Thomas 5) To add insult to injury for Chahal, Thomas survives to slog him into the deep, where a not-too-hard chance is dropped by KL Rahul. Not that it matters. A blast from Abhinav Dutta. \u201cThis is utter tripe from West Indies. Well this World Cup is now a foregone conclusion but if this lot remains placid after a shit-show of this scale, they haven\u2019t the darnedest chance of lifting themselves out of their cricketing rut. I\u2019d wager they are a better lot at Tests than ODIs but this should result in a rocket being lit under their collective bottoms when India visit them after the World Cup. In all likelihood they\u2019ll self-combust but who doesn\u2019t like the prospect of some fire in Babylon? \u201cWatching Kohli\u2019s India is like watching a peak-era Australia lite. Not very likeable, unless you are among the billion-odd. I am too but don\u2019t have much love for 11 Djokovics clad in cricket vests.\u201d The ball did touch the ground, Michael Gough decides, before Kohli caught it \u2013 so umpire Illingworth\u2019s day goes from bad to worse. The soft signal is out, so this may well be curtains. 31st over: West Indies 124-9 (Roach 1, Thomas 0) A maiden from Kuldeep to Roach. Thanks for the breather, guys. 30th over: West Indies 124-9 (Roach 1, Thomas 0) Cottrell plumped for do-or-die, as advocated by a Mr B Johnson \u2013 in other words, do for two minutes (a slog for four, a swing for six), swiftly followed by die. Another one! Cottrell had a go, but then he went back and missed a straight one. In the last six overs, West Indies have made 26-5. 29th over: West Indies 114-8 (Roach 1, Cottrell 0) A successful return for Shami, who may have seen his mate Bumrah closing in on the Player of the Match award. We could really do with someone arguing that India are not, in fact, all-powerful. Cometh the hour, cometh Anand. \u201cLooks like India are cruising through this one. While they might still be the only undefeated team in the World Cup, the side is not without chinks in the armour. I for one, am worried about our fragile middle order and the really long tail. Things could get very exciting if India have to chase 300 and are 30/3. Am I worrying too much?\u201d Yes, but you also have a point \u2013 any team, at any time, can seize up under pressure. Scrub that burning-deck stuff. Kohli takes off Bumrah (6-1-9-2) and brings back Shami, who persuades Hetmyer to slap it to backward point. This is getting a bit sad. 28th over: West Indies 112-7 (Hetmyer 18, Roach 1) Shimron Hetmyer has taken over the role of the boy stood on the burning deck, as Sunil Ambris is indisposed. Kohli posts a leg slip for Chahal and Hetmyer glances the ball straight to him. It\u2019s Pandya, and Mike Atherton reckons he\u2019s got his fingers under this, but it\u2019s not given. Respite of sorts. 27th over: West Indies 107-7 (Hetmyer 14, Roach 0) Bumrah follows the two wickets with two dots, as Kemar Roach, understandably, just tries to survive. The Indian fans are dancing, singing, smiling, bubbling, revelling in this, summoning the shades of the West Indies fans at the first two World Cups in England. It was umpire\u2019s call, so that\u2019s tough on Fabian Allen. Bumrah has now bowled 32 balls, conceded nine runs, and taken two wickets. How on earth are England going to handle him on Sunday? To the very next ball, also from Bumrah. Worth a try, it\u2019s quite high and on leg stump... Bumrah finds the edge, and Dhoni, who\u2019s been awful behind the stumps, suddenly remembers that Pant is breathing down his neck and takes a fine, diving, one-handed catch. Game over, barring miracles. 26th over: West Indies 107-5 (Hetmyer 14, Brathwaite 1) Chahal beats Hetmyer, who answers back smartly with a cut for four. The win predictor is giving India 96 per cent now. The other 4 per cent relies heavily on Hetmyer and Brathwaite putting on a hundred. \u201cJust to add to the pedantry,\u201d says Jim Pavitt, \u201csince the original is, of course, in Italian and is \u2018Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch\u2019intrate\u2019 (which could be translated as \u2018Abandon every hope, you that enter\u2019) then I don\u2019t see the problem with your original Dantean reference, which could just be viewed as a slightly more flexible translation.\u201d That\u2019s very sporting of you, but all this is some way over my head. I did Classics, so Dante was far too modern. 25th over: West Indies 101-5 (Hetmyer 9, Brathwaite 0) Kohli sends for Bumrah, which is the action of a sadist, or a man who fancies an early finish. Bumrah comes close to taking Brathwaite out with his toe crusher. \u201cDante,\u201d begins John Starbuck, promisingly. \u201cYes, I\u2019m hoping the OBO will get to some nasty gossip about some traitor\u2019s actions and misquote things about the ninth circle (ice) of the Inferno. We can probably do without massed angels of various degrees, though. Depends who wins the CWC.\u201d 24th over: West Indies 98-5 (Hetmyer 6, Brathwaite 0) So it looks like yet another doomed chase. Will any captain bat second now, unless the rain returns? Holder drives, loosely, and only gets half a bat on the ball. It\u2019s a simple catch for Jadhav at extra cover, and West Indies are on their way out of this World Cup... unless Carlos Brathwaite can smash another hundred. 23rd over: West Indies 97-4 (Hetmyer 5, Holder 6) Since Jason Holder came in, things have calmed down, even though India\u2019s prime spinners are on. At the same stage, India were 112-2, so the runs are still not a problem \u2013 it\u2019s those pesky wickets. Here\u2019s Damian Burns. \u201cI\u2019m really enjoying the low score, high pressure matches this World Cup is throwing our way. Since the start the whole narrative that modern cricket is a batsman\u2019s game has been overturned somewhat.\u201d More from him shortly. 22nd over: West Indies 92-4 (Hetmyer 4, Holder 4) Chahal finally enters the fray, and instantly finds sharp turn out of the rough outside the left-hander\u2019s off stump. Hetmyer\u2019s eyes light up, he goes for a mow, misses it, and Dhoni misses it too, conceding four byes. He\u2019s had a better day with the bat than with the gloves. \u201cRe: \u2018errors in Dante references on OBO coverage\u2019 (11th over),\u201d notes Colum Farrelly. \u201cI do hope someone is picking this topic for their Ph.D. thesis.\u201d Nice one. 21st over: West Indies 84-4 (Hetmyer 2, Holder 2) After that failed champagne moment, it\u2019s back to the milking. Hetmyer hasn\u2019t got going, so Pooran decides it\u2019s time to go big... and slogs Kuldeep straight to Shami at long-off. That win predictor must be around 90 per cent now. 20th over: West Indies 80-3 (Pooran 29, Hetmyer 0) Kohli has decided that today is the day to get funky. His second spinner is not Chahal but Kedar Jadhav. Pooran cuts him for four, with some authority. Dhoni, by the way, missed a stumping off Kuldeep in the previous over, down the leg side. One more piece of ammunition for the Pant fans. There was an inside edge, not spotted by umpire Illingworth. He played in a World Cup final, in 1992, the last time England were decent. It\u2019s Kuldeep, out of the back of the hand. Hetmyer, who propped forward, seems confident. 18th over: West Indies 71-3 (Pooran 27, Hetmyer 0) At last, a pull goes for four, as Pandya bowls a rather friendly bouncer and Pooran says thanks very much. When he tries it again, it\u2019s back to the old top edge, again landing safely. Ambris then plays a more muscly pull, also for four, before perishing next ball. Out comes Hetmyer, in a floppy hat, like Roy Fredericks in 1975. Just when he was getting going, Ambris plays around a straight full one, and doesn\u2019t bother to review. 17th over: West Indies 60-2 (Ambris 26, Pooran 17) Kuldeep beats Pooran with a beauty, 84 kph and turning sharply away from the left-hander. Still, a partnership is building here. 16th over: West Indies 56-2 (Ambris 24, Pooran 15) At drinks, somebody must have told Ambris that if you find the boundary, you get four. He spots a half-volley from Pandya, opens the face and strokes a square drive. That\u2019s the Ambris who went to Dublin the other day and made 148. 15th over: West Indies 50-2 (Ambris 19, Pooran 14) More milking of Kuldeep, and West Indies have finally made it to fifty. \u201cBowl slower,\u201d says Dhoni, apparently under the impression that he is still captain. And that\u2019s drinks, with India lording it, as usual. Please can we have a few upsets? 14th over: West Indies 45-2 (Ambris 17, Pooran 11) Ambris, facing Pandya, plays the most successful pull of the innings, which isn\u2019t saying much \u2013 but he does keep it down this time, and collects a couple of runs. At this rate, he may carry his bat for 55. 13th over: West Indies 42-2 (Ambris 15, Pooran 11) Kuldeep almost sneaks through Pooran\u2019s defences, as a bottom edge threatens to dribble onto the stumps. The run rate required is only just over six; the question is whether West Indies can get to 40 overs, let alone 50. And here\u2019s Pete Salmon. \u201cFeels increasingly like Chris Gayle is the Universe Boss,\u201d he reckons, \u201cand the rest of us prey to his gravitational pull. Obviously a few weeks ago he decided Test cricket was the way forward, and has now made himself available. And started changing his technique to suit, 0 off 12 the other day, 6 off 19 today. Meanwhile the lunacy of scores in the 400s has been replaced by sedate 270s, and fast bowlers are taking wickets. I feel like we are all waking up from a fever dream, and soon we\u2019ll be watching players in white with a camera at only one end, and it will be 78-1 at lunch at the Oval, with Lever off a short run and Chris Gayle laughing at us from the heavens.\u201d Is that John Lever, or Peter? 12th over: West Indies 39-2 (Ambris 14, Pooran 9) Now it becomes clear why Kohli sent for Pandya. He digs it in at Ambris, who top-edges a pull, not once but twice, and gets away with it both times as the ball loops into no-man\u2019s-land. Pooran has been more assured, but when he gets a free hit after a no-ball, he can only slap it for a single. India right on top still. 11th over: West Indies 34-2 (Ambris 12, Pooran 7) In a better bowling change, Kohli summons Kuldeep Yadav, with his wrist spin. The batsmen do well to work him around and take five off the over. And now, a word from my fact-checker. \u201cHate to be that green ink pedant picking up on minor errors in Dante references on OBO coverage,\u201d says J Murdoch Smith, \u201cbut it\u2019s \u2018Abandon *all hope*, ye who enter\u2019. Hope is all (much like England\u2019s imminent World Cup future).\u201d Ha. And thank you. I\u2019m all for Dantean pedantry, myself. Live by the pen, die by the pen. 10th over: West Indies 29-2 (Ambris 10, Pooran 4) Kohli takes Bumrah off, much to the batsmen\u2019s relief, and brings on Hardik Pandya, the one Indian bowler who won\u2019t necessarily be licking his lips at this dusty, two-paced pitch. And that\u2019s the lowest 10-over total by any team in this World Cup. 9th over: West Indies 25-2 (Ambris 8, Pooran 2) The role of the boy on the burning deck has fallen to Sunil Ambris, who has decided to get \u2019em in singles. Nicolas Pooran follows suit and they collect four off Shami\u2019s over, which is a tiny triumph. \u201cI know he\u2019s out now,\u201d says Jon Salisbury, \u201cbut a bit strange there\u2019s been no replay of Gayle\u2019s early LBW shout. Looking at it again on rewind it seemed to hit him on the foot in front of leg stump, Dhoni turning down the review. He got one wrong in an earlier game too but I guess it didn\u2019t cost them - would have loved to see Kohli\u2019s reaction had it been out (and Gayle gone on to big things).\u201d I suspect you\u2019re right. 8th over: West Indies 21-2 (Ambris 6, Pooran 0) Four byes off Bumrah, which is as good as it gets for West Indies at the moment. That ball from Shami has been replayed several times already and rightly so. It had a classical upright seam, it jagged in, and it hit the top of off \u2013 just the length that England\u2019s (very good) bowlers couldn\u2019t locate against Australia on Tuesday. 7th over: West Indies 16-2 (Ambris 5, Pooran 0) Another cracking over from Shami, who has figures of 4-0-11-2. His mate, meanwhile, has 3-0-5-0: they are a hell of an opening pair. I bet James Vince can\u2019t wait to face them. Here\u2019s Hari Shankar. \u201cJust looking ahead at the next England game against India. Would it be a great contest between two imploding batting line-ups? Losing their dashing openers to injury, the middle order is full of plodders. Confidence is not exactly high. A lip-smacking quarter-final contest that one is going to be.\u201d That\u2019s one way of putting it. Abandon Hope, all ye who enter here. Shai Hope drives, expansively, and Shami\u2019s in-ducker ducks in through a big swinging gate. West Indies have now lost the two batsmen most likely to make a hundred. 6th over: West Indies 12-1 (Ambris 5, Hope 1) Hope is a good player, well suited to this World Cup with its old-school platform-building, but Bumrah has him on toast. First ball: a jaffa past the outside edge. Second ball: same again, taking the edge, which Hope does well to keep down so it falls short of Kohli at second slip. Last ball: yorker, stabbed out somehow. Too good. 5th over: West Indies 10-1 (Ambris 4, Hope 0) Shami bounces Ambris, who pulls, rather uncertainly, perhaps because the pitch is two-paced. Ambris gets away with it, but Gayle doesn\u2019t. The win predictor jumps to 70 per cent. \u201cIf India lose today,\u201d says Zaf Ayub, \u201cthey come out doubly determined on Sunday ......\u201d True. As if England supporters could be any more spooked. That is the big one. Gayle, who never looked happy, sees a short ball from Shami, misjudges the bounce and gets it high on the bat, presenting Jadhav with the easiest of catches at mid-on. India on top. 4th over: West Indies 9-0 (Gayle 6, Ambris 3) Bumrah beats Ambris, all ends up, and keeps Gayle quiet. The Universe Boss is rattled enough to take a quick single, for the first time in several decades. The win predictor is giving India the better chance, 57 per cent. Personally I\u2019d put it a bit higher, but the game is there to be grabbed by either side. 3rd over: West Indies 7-0 (Gayle 5, Ambris 2) Shami bowls to Ambris for the first time and instantly cuts him in half, like a magician. West Indies have ben watchful so far, but Gayle often does this for four or five overs before pulling out the fireworks. A tweet from someone who seems to be called Reserve EVM. \u201cJoin the millions of Indians wondering why we have the accumulator combo of Shankar, Jadhav and Dhoni instead of using Dinesh Karthik, Jadeja and Pant. Especially when you\u2019ve lost the explosive power of Dhawan. Mysteries abound.\u201d 2nd over: West Indies 5-0 (Gayle 4, Ambris 1) At the other end it\u2019s Jasprit Bumrah, the world\u2019s next great fast bowler. Sunil Ambris may be young but he\u2019s canny enough to take a single first ball, chopped down to third man. Gayle treats us to a few more leaves and then Bumrah appeals expansively for LBW. It was a yorker, and a good one, but India don\u2019t review, perhaps feeling that it pitched outside leg. Gayle might argue that it pitched on his big toe. 1st over: West Indies 4-0 (Gayle 4, Ambris 0) Mohammed Shami opens the proceedings and Chris Gayle goes leave, leave, leave, edge \u2013 a Harrow poke, or French prod, to Dhoni\u2019s right. When Gayle finally smacks one, it goes straight to extra cover. And here\u2019s Brian Withington. \u201cMust concur with your surprise at India\u2019s omission of the mighty Rishabh, further tinged with disappointment about being denied the opportunity to trot out the trusty line that \u2018Pant\u2019s on fire\u2019 as he goes through the gears.\u201d Thank you, Brian, for that, and above all for the single quotes. Thanks Michael and congrats on an assured debut. Afternoon everyone. Which way do you see this one going? Michael feels 269 is very gettable. I would agree if it weren\u2019t for the mysterious gravitational pull exerted by this World Cup. Only one team has succeeded in hunting down a score of 250 \u2013 the buccaneering Bangladeshis. West Indies were on the receiving end of that drubbing, so this is their chance to redeem themselves. They bowled well in parts. Kemar Roach and Jason Holder were immense, supplying the old Glenn McGrath double whammy \u2013 thrust plus thrift. But the other bowlers managed neither of those things. Sheldon Cottrell, so incisive at the top of the innings in this World Cup, shone for about five minutes at the death. But India were fitful too (what ARE they doing leaving out Rishabh Pant?). So the scales are nicely poised. I\u2019ll hand you over now to Tim de Lisle, who knows his way around an OBO. I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed my stint, hope you feel the same about the cricket. Good luck to both teams. Bye! Some breaking news over on our county cricket blog. Somerset\u2019s Marcus Trescothick is to retire at the end of the season. Join John Ashdown for more. So, this is very nicely poised. Roach was the pick of the bowlers, 3-36 off his 10 overs, and well supported by Holder and Cottrell. India didn\u2019t really get going, just two batsman (Kohli and Dhoni) reached it past 50 and only Pandya had a strike rate of over 100. That all adds up to an excellent bowling and fielding performance from the West Indies, who made one big error in the missed stumping opportunity for Dhoni. That proves costly, and could easily be the difference by the end of the day\u2019s play. Remember, West Indies need to win here to stand any chance of making the top four. They always tend to play their best when their backs are slightly up against the wall. A lot of pressure will be on Suni Ambris, who has come into the side today and will open the batting with Chris Gayle. There\u2019s a lot here for the Indian bowlers. Bounce for Bumrah, and plenty of turn to interest Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal. Game on. 50th over: India 252-7 (Dhoni 56, Kuldeep 0) Six for Dhoni off the first bowl, as he heaves a poor short ball into the stands on the on side. An excellent Thomas yorker keeps the veteran on strike, but Dhoni responds by clubbing one down the ground for four. That\u2019s his fifty! Dhoni is refusing the singles here, quite sensibly. A dot ball follows, in which Dhoni appears to break the toe of his ball. He\u2019ll have a new bat for the last ball \u2026 six! Dhoni swings his new bat, and creams one into the stands again! Why would Thomas bowl short? A yorker, surely?! Anyway, that\u2019s the final Indian total, West Indies require 269 to win. Very gettable, but India\u2019s spinners could well have a big say in the second innings. 49th over: India 252-7 (Dhoni 40, Kuldeep 0) That\u2019s the end of Cottrell\u2019s bowling, his 10 overs end for 50 runs and two wickets. Dhoni on strike for the final over, to be bowled by Thomas. Shami out for a duck. Cottrell gives him some short stuff, Shami goes after it, and only manages to glance the ball off the glove and through to Hope. We are well and truly into the Indian tail now. That was coming. Pandya mis-judges a slower ball from Cottrell and skews the ball high to Allen in the deep. The first wicket for Cottrell and the first salute of teh day. It was a straight-forward catch from Allen, but he\u2019s been excellent in the field today, tidy in the deep and up close to the stumps, and he deserves his catch. 48th over: India 249-5 (Dhoni 38, Pandya 46) Pandya skies a full toss over fine leg with an outside edge. Brathwaite can\u2019t get under it, but at least stops the ball from finding the rope. Dhoni is next to get away with one, giving Thomas a caught and bowled opportunity but the Jamaican can only get one hand to the ball, and ultimately drops it. Pandya ends the over by smashing another lofted effort through the covers for four. India will still be hoping for 270 here. 47th over: India 238-5 (Dhoni 36, Pandya 37) Pandya is not hanging about now, clipping Cottrell over mid-off for four, and working a few more ones and twos with some big strokeplay. Technically he doesn\u2019t have everything perfected but he\u2019s an aggressive player and the sort you\u2019d want in this situation. \u201cI came to London from the sub-continent to watch India play,\u201d answers Ashish Suri to my earlier request. \u201cAlbeit it was 6 years ago and it was to see India beat in England in England in England during the Champions Trophy 2013. Still here, for the rematch.\u201d 46th over: India 229-5 (Dhoni 34, Pandya 30) After a mini-conference on the wicket, Dhoni and Pandya look as though they\u2019ve had enough. Dhoni has a spring in his step now, and he smashes Brathwaite\u2019s second delivery for four, and has the quickness between the wicket to run for a few more. Brathwaite has been very expensive, he\u2019s going at 11 an over from his three overs. 45th over: India 219-5 (Dhoni 25, Pandya 24) Dhoni is still dealing in singles, he\u2019s hit just one boundary since he\u2019s come to the crease. \u201cOn the whole I find the batsmen of yesteryear to be better than our current crop simply because of how much more difficult it was back then,\u201d emails Milind Pania. \u201cI grew up on 90\u2019s cricket but I heard and have since watched, heard and read about enough to realise how much the game has skewed in favour of the bat. On an unrelated note, my email to the OBO during the Australia vs England game got me in touch with another cricket fan in Berlin from the unlikeliest of places. :) Keep up the good work and here\u2019s to the Kiwis learning from yesterday, improving and winning the whole thing.\u201d 44th over: India 214-5 (Dhoni 25, Pandya 24) Pandya goes past Dhoni\u2019s score with teh first ball of the over and in just 19 balls, less than half the balls that Dhoni has faced. It looks like the India pair are targeting Brathwaite, hitting through the ball with mixed results. Two balls go up in the air, both falling short of the West Indian fielders. Cottrell seems to have a problem with his knee after retrieving the latest shot, and the physio is called on. After some magic spray, he\u2019s OK to resume. Despite India\u2019s troubles with the bat, their fans are still in full voice. I wonder how many of those fans have travelled over from the sub-continent? Any India fans that have travelled, do get in touch. michael.butler@theguardian.com or @michaelbutler18 on Twitter. 43rd over: India 204-5 (Dhoni 21, Pandya 18) The 200 up for India, but they have still got a lot to do in these final seven overs, you think will have to get at least 250. \u201cI am an Indian and I can\u2019t understand why the commentators don\u2019t talk about Dhoni\u2019s slow run rate,\u201d emails Argha Banerjee. \u201cThis is ridiculous now with Dhoni at 20 runs for 40 balls. Sachin was right. Madness that he got trolled in India for saying that.\u201d For reference, Tendulkar made the following comments after the nervy Afghanistan win: I felt slightly disappointed, it could have been much better. I was also not happy with the partnership between Kedar and Dhoni, it was very slow. We batted 34 overs of spin bowling and scored 119 runs. This was one area where we didn\u2019t look comfortable at all. There was no positive intent. 42nd over: India 200-5 (Dhoni 20, Pandya 15) Brathwaite finally comes into the attack. Interesting that he\u2019s been introduced so late, perhaps Holder sees Brathwaite as the best bowler at the death. That said, this is an expensive over, one three, one four, two wides, a total of 13 runs. India will be hoping this is the start of something. 41st over: India 187-5 (Dhoni 18, Pandya 4) \u201cTime for Hardik Pandya to stand up!\u201d emails Max Bonnell. Well he\u2019s certainly going on the offensive. Off Holder\u2019s final over, he bashes one back down the pitch and straight onto the stumps (no deflection), then completely misjudges a short ball, and it lucky to see the ball land safely. Holder ends his overs with just one further run, with Dhoni swinging and missing his final ball. That\u2019s two wickets and 33 runs from his 10 overs, another brilliant effort. The Indians have really struggled to pick his bounce today. \u201cHow close is Holder to becoming a Windies GOAT?\u201d He\u2019s the best player they\u2019ve got, methinks ...\u201d Certainly the best player at the moment. I\u2019d be interested to hear from West Indian fans on how they see him in comparison to the stars of yesteryear? 40th over: India 186-5 (Dhoni 17, Pandya 4) Pandya tries a quick single, but Dhoni sends him back. It seems the veteran recognises what a precarious position India are in. Allen finishes his 10 overs with two runs, no wickets for 52 runs, although he should have had Dhoni with a stumping. 39th over: India 184-5 (Dhoni 17, Pandya 4) Kohli looks like he\u2019s going to burst into tears as he looks out from the Indian dressing room, back in the pavilion. He can\u2019t quite believe what has happened, but new batsman Pandya wastes no time in pulling Holder for four, despite a valiant dive at the ropes by Cottrell. A huge breakthrough for West Indies! Kohli played two strokes in this over \u2013 the first a supreme clip through mid-wicket for four, making a mockery of Holder\u2019s pace and bounce. But then, an absolutely terrible shot, the sort I was playing at school in the U14 B team. It\u2019s short of a length, but a low bounce means that he just shovels it to the substitute, Bravo, and midwicket. A deathly silence falls over Old Trafford, save for a few West Indian fans. Kohli shakes his head, India are in trouble here. 38th over: India 176-4 (Dhoni 17, Kohli 68) Just two more runs from the over. I wonder when Kohli is going to ramp up the rate. We can\u2019t be far away from some power hitting. Excellent, tight bowling from Allen. 37th over: India 174-4 (Dhoni 16, Kohli 67) Holder back into the attack for West Indies and he\u2019s being very attacking with his field. It\u2019s paying off, with Allen particuarly impressive at point in fetching a Dhoni slash. Just three off the over. 36th over: India 171-4 (Dhoni 14, Kohli 66) Regardless of what the result is here, what this match has proved is that India are beatable. England will be looking at this underwhelming batting performance with interest. 35th over: India 166-4 (Dhoni 9, Kohli 66) For all their good work with the ball, that will be the moment West Indies will revisit if they go on to lose this game. That\u2019s the second successive game that Dhoni has been caught out coming down the wicket \u2013 against Afghanistan he was not so lucky, stumped off the bowling of Rashid Khan. At least with his cover drive remains in top nick, and he finds two more runs with a classic stroke. That\u2019s the end of Roach\u2019s bowling: 10 overs, three for 36 runs. Outstanding stuff from the Barbadian. 34th over: India 162-4 (Dhoni 9, Kohli 62) Dhoni comes careering down the wicket \u2013 with the reckless abandon of someone leaving the office on a Friday \u2013 but completely misses the ball. Hope makes one grab at it \u2013 drops the ball \u2013 has another chance to pick the ball up and sweep through the bails, but again drops the ball! Dhoni survives! That\u2019s a real let off and really poor from Hope. It could be a turning point in this game. 33rd over: India 154-4 (Dhoni 8, Kohli 56) \u201cCan\u2019t see India reaching 300 with their Diplodocian tail,\u201d writes Dean Kinsella, and I have to agree with him. Unless these two put on an almighty stand \u2013 which they are very capable of doing \u2013 I\u2019d probably adjust India\u2019s total to around 270-280? That\u2019s very gettable for the Windies. 32nd over: India 152-4 (Dhoni 7, Kohli 55) With Allen taking the ball, Kohli has opted for a cap, rather than his helmet. India\u2019s run rate is still sub five an over, so West Indies will be very happy with this. 31st over: India 150-4 (Dhoni 6, Kohli 54) Kohli nipped off for a convenience break during drinks but after a slight delay, is back to face Roach. Kohli nicks a thick edge down the third man, and Holder responds by re-instating Gayle at third slip. This is a good contest between Kohli and Roach, whose point of release is very wide of the crease, so entices the batsman into playing a shot. Economy rate is 3.83 for Roach off eight overs, which is ruddy brilliant against this batting line-up. Two runs off the over, 150 up for India. As Nishan Venugopal has pointed out to me on email, that\u2019s over 20,000 runs for Virat Kohli in international cricket, and he is the fastest man ever to reach that milestone. The king. 30th over: India 148-4 (Dhoni 5, Kohli 53) Thomas returns to the crease. Kohli \u2013 one of the fastest and fittest men between the wickets \u2013 wants a quick two but Dhoni isn\u2019t quite up to speed, and holds his hand out to his captain apologetically after the first single. Dhoni makes up with it with the bat, cutting nicely through point for four. The old man has still got game. 29th over: India 140-4 (Dhoni 0, Kohli 51) In comes Dhoni and he sees off the rest of the over safely. India are slightly on the ropes here, but need just one more big partnership to get them up towards 300. What a game we have here! Roach finds some extra bounce past Jadhav\u2019s bat, it is initially given not out, but West Indies immediately go for a review and are already celebrating as though they know the decision is going to be reversed! Indeed it is, the ball just catching the tiniest edge and flying through to Hope. 28th over: India 135-3 (Jadhav 3, Kohli 50) That\u2019s Kohli\u2019s fourth consecutive half-century in this World Cup, bringing up the fifty with a crashing cover drive off Thomas and a little single worked into the off side. Jadhav cuts down to third man but some brilliant fielding saves two. 27th over: India 128-3 (Jadhav 1, Kohli 45) Those are the wickets seam bowlers dream of. Slightly scrambled seam, the ball just nipped away from Shankar and just about into the gloves of Hope before it went to ground. Just two more of the over, Roach has been the pick of the bowlers thus far. An absolute peach of a ball from Roach: line, length, and nicked through the keeper. Shankar will be disappointed, he looked like he was playing well, on a lovely pitch. Got a start, but couldn\u2019t kick on. 26th over: India 124-2 (Shankar 14, Kohli 44) Kohli punishes a poor delivery from Cottrell. It\u2019s short, on leg stumps, and pulled fine for four. Six from the over \u2013 I wonder when we\u2019ll see Brathwaite? He hasn\u2019t bowled a ball yet. 25th over: India 118-2 (Shankar 13, Kohli 37) Kohli gets awfully lucky, getting the smallest of inside edges onto his own pads, and was fortunate the ball did not roll onto the stumps. This is good from Holder, who has sent most of his deliveries wide of off stump. West Indies have had the most joy when they\u2019ve bowled straight and full. Just as I say that, Shankar clips a straight, full delivery through midwicket for four. Who knows what to think? Harkarn Sumal has emailed: \u201cWhen I trotted along to watch guaranteed wooden spoon holders Pakistan folding against the West Indies bumper-barrage at Trent Bridge a lifetime ago at the start of this World Cup, there was nothing more annoying all day than the guitar chap wanging away at his half-baked riffs. We should instead have had a podium installed at every ground in the tournament, with a local Morris Dancing troupe giving it their all for the duration. The regional variations in costume, moves and sticks / swords / handkerchiefs would have kept the worldwide audience enthralled, and of course the ICC could have runs text or web polls for viewers to select their favourites over the course of the tournament. The exception would have been Old Trafford matches, where a maraca-wielding solo Bez would have been the man to call on.\u201d Decent shout, that. 24th over: India 113-2 (Shankar 9, Kohli 36) Cottrell has tightened things up a lot. Just one of the over, as a Mexican wave goes around Old Trafford. 23rd over: India 112-2 (Shankar 9, Kohli 35) Shankar looks like he\u2019s having fun, driving beautifully through the covers for four, and then having a good old chuckle with Kohli in the middle about something. Perhaps Thomas could have done better with the fielding there, but Shankar\u2019s drive was straight and true. Off the final ball of the over, Shankar mis-judges a hip-high ball, but gets lucky and the ball nicks off the gloves down the leg side for four. Fine leg had no chance. Eight off the over. 22nd over: India 104-2 (Shankar 1, Kohli 35) The match is nicely poised now, then. India reach their hundred with a pair of singles. Cottrell seems intent on bowling short, to mixed results: Kohli top edges one behind, it flies too fine to be caught, bouncing a couple of yards shy of the rope. I don\u2019t think that will deter Cottrell. 21st over: India 98-2 (Shankar 0, Kohli 30) That wicket was all set up by a quite magnificent piece of fielding from Fabian Allen, who is impressing having come into the side. Allen dived to stop a sure boundary from Rahut. That was the ball before Rahut got out, and Holder did the rest, the ball just clipping his pads on its way to the stumps. Rahut clean bowled by Holder! Swing and miss from Rahul, who was trying to clip one through midwicket across the line, but instead saw his off-stump completely upended. \u201cThat\u2019s what I\u2019m talking about,\u201d says Michael Holding in commentary, in that unique voice. 20th over: India 98-1 (Rahul 48, Kohli 30) An excellent stop from Gayle, diving to his right and clawing the ball back to save four runs! Rolling back the years, Chris, showing the dexterity of a gymnast. OK, not quite, but even the Indian fans enjoyed that one. Meanwhile, some more praise for Cottrell: \u201cA disappointing game against Bangladesh aside, surely Sheldon Cottrell has been West Indies most impressive performer so far,\u201d emails Tom Ellis. \u201cWickets aplenty and run outs and spectacular catches in the field for fun, he\u2019s got that energy to drag a much-needed win out of a lacklustre Windies. Plus his trademark celebration is second-to-none \u2013 who wouldn\u2019t want to see that salute a couple of times today?\u201d Indeed. He\u2019s an infectious character, and his popularity is high, not least because of gestures like this: 19th over: India 89-1 (Rahul 42, Kohli 27) Some extra bounce for Holder \u2013 the ball flying off Kohli\u2019s bat to what would be silly point. Alas, no fielder there. Kohli in particular seems to be struggling with Holder\u2019s pace and bounce. Will be interesting to see if Holder gives him some chin music, if Kohli will go on the attack. Kohli was practising facing the short stuff in the outfield this morning. Two from the over. 18th over: India 87-1 (Rahul 42, Kohli 25) Rahul is starting to look very tidy indeed, playing a short Allen throwdown very late, and beating the man at third man for four. Some more good running from Rahul and Kohli sees them edge towards their fifty partnership. Yeah, some obvious gripes \u2013 guitar man, \u00a310 radios that don\u2019t seem to last more than one match \u2013 but this has been an excellent tournament so far. You feel that every team has a chance in every game. 17th over: India 77-1 (Rahul 36, Kohli 21) Holder goes again, looking for another maiden. Two dots balls come, before Rahul drives straight down the ball, beating the diving Brathwaite for the first runs off Holder. India are only going at 4.53 run rate, although of course it\u2019s still early. Chris Gayle has moved from slip to gully, we\u2019ve seen some thick edges today, so he\u2019s hoping for another. The three fielders in the deep are at cover, fine leg and third man. 16th over: India 72-1 (Rahul 31, Kohli 21) Rahul sends another thick edge for four, but some encouraging signs for Allen. Not a lot of turn, but he\u2019s bowling at a nice length, making Kohli and Rahul guess a little. Drinks break. \u201cHello, Michael,\u201d writes Smylers. \u201cI think this is your first time live-blogging actual cricket, rather than just rain mingled with the hope of cricket. How are you finding it?\u201d Hi Smylers. Yep, you\u2019re almost spot on \u2013 I did a West Indies v England washout earlier this year, and have done bits and bobs in the past. But this is my first big-un. Go easy on me, OBO regulars. 15th over: India 67-1 (Rahul 26, Kohli 21) Interesting stat that only on five occasions has a West Indian bowler completed a full 10 overs in this World Cup (for comparison, India have done it 14 times). How much confidence does Holder have in his bowlers? Holder himself is going great guns from the crease, he\u2019s yet to concede a run in his two overs. 14th over: India 67-1 (Rahul 26, Kohli 21) Mis-field from Holder allows Kohli to add another through midwicket, but West Indies have definitely stemmed the flow of runs since the powerplay ended. Would like to know what the ratio of India-West Indies fans inside Old Trafford today. It\u2019s awash with orange and blue. 13th over: India 62-1 (Rahul 25, Kohli 17) West Indies captain Holder is also a new change. I wonder how he will be feeling? Just the one wicket from the first 12 over, his side have taken more wickets from the first powerplay than any other side at this World Cup. Holder appeals for lbw, not given, and West Indies opt against taking it to DRS. Height is always an issue for Holder, who stands at 6ft7in. Replays show it would indeed have gone over the top of the bails, despite striking Kohli on the knee-roll. It\u2019s a maiden over. 12th over: India 62-1 (Rahul 25, Kohli 17) Allen replaces Roach. It should turn for Allen on this pitch, and there are visible footmarks on the pitch. Kuldeep Yadav and Yuzvendra Chahal will be watching intently. Rahul slashes at a short ball, edges it, but flashes hard and the ball flies past Gayle at slip. 11th over: India 56-1 (Rahul 24, Kohli 12) Not quite sure why West Indies are bowling so short to India. It\u2019s certainly not a weakness for Kohli, who plays a deliberately lofted shot though the covers for four. Thomas then goes too full, and Rahul plays a textbook cover drive. Thomas stuck between a rock and hard place. West Indies need a wicket, and soon. 10th over: India 47-1 (Rahul 20, Kohli 7) Three from the over. \u201cSheldon Cottrell has become a superstar in my eyes during this World Cup,\u201d emails Kerrith Britland. \u201cI saw him in the winter tour against England and thought he looked OK; I was most certainly wrong. Looks made for English conditions - hope he comes over for a county season in the future. What\u2019s your take on him?\u201d He\u2019s a magnificent cricketer. Can sometimes struggle with his length as a bowler, but as we saw in the last over, is excellent in the field also. And, of course, there was this catch against Australia. Woof. 9th over: India 44-1 (Rahul 20, Kohli 4) Thomas goes past the edge of Rahul. The big West Indian has started well and two catching half-chances just squirt wide of the West Indian fielders. Pooran can\u2019t quite get to a wayward clip of the hips from Rahul, then a thick edge just avoids second slip. Cottrell does magnificently to save the boundary, sweeping round from third man. This is good from West Indies. 8th over: India 38-1 (Rahul 14, Kohli 4) Good bowling from Roach, five dot balls before Rahul drives his down the ground. Holder runs away to retrieve it, and just about scoops the ball back the rope with his foot. Standing at 6ft7in, it\u2019s not too easy for him to get down with his hands. Looking at that replay of Rohit\u2019s wicket, I\u2019m pretty convinced that it was pad, not bat, which means the DRS decision was wrong! The camera now pans to Rohit, who is crouched over a laptop in the Indian dressing room, reviewing the decision. Interestingly it was given not out by the on-field umpire. 7th over: India 35-1 (Rahul 11, Kohli 4) Thomas replaces Cottrell in West Indies\u2019 first change, and there is some swing for Thomas! Encouraging signs for the West Indies, but Thomas finishes the over poorly, two short wide deliveries, the last of which Kohli cuts easily for four. Right in the slot, that one. 6th over: India 29-1 (Rahul 10, Kohli 0) Such a shame for India, who were building a good opening partnership. Before the wicket, Rohit had hit a six, pulling Roach high over square leg, bouncing a couple of yards over the rope. Rohit had all the time in the world there, he was seeing it like a beach ball. Rahul was next to get on the act, timing it brilliantly down the ground for four. That was nothing more than a nudge, but this outfield is lightning. Rohit is given out, after a DRS review from the Windies, and was adjudged to have nicked the ball, with Hope catching it behind. It was ultra-edge that decided that it was his bat, not his pad, that got the edge. I\u2019m not sure to be honest, it looked like pad to me! Rohit can\u2019t believe the decision, shaking his head as he trudges off. 5th over: India 17-0 (Rahul 5, Rohit 11) Rahul very nearly drags on, mis-driving a full ball from Cottrell. Next ball, our first boundary, Rohit dispatching a short-wide cut through gully. The Indian batsman are so comfortable with these short deliveries, perhaps Holder will have a word in the change over about pitching it up. 4th over: India 9-0 (Rahul 4, Rohit 4) Roach and Cottrell are bowling a lot shorter than against New Zealand \u2013 remember Cottrell took two wickets in his first two overs with yorkers. I\u2019d not sure it\u2019s as binary as that, but Gayle certainly needs to step up today. His scores at this World Cup read as follows: 50, 21, 36 and a duck against Bangladesh. Not sure that\u2019s putting the self-proclaimed \u2018Universe Boss\u2019 in as \u201cone of the greats\u201d, as he claimed yesterday. 3rd over: India 7-0 (Rahul 3, Rohit 3) Rohit swings and misses! Excellent pace from Cottrell, with the ball carrying through to Hope above head height. It\u2019s a very flat, dry pitch but Cottrell will be trying to find some extra bounce. A solitary wide and a thick edge down to third man from the over. 2nd over: India 5-0 (Rahul 3, Rohit 2) Two West Indian slips in for Roach\u2019s first over. I like that, personally. I think West Indies need to be aggressive early on. Pitch the ball up, don\u2019t allow the Indian batsman to settle in these glorious conditions. \u201cGood Morning Michael,\u201d emails Sreekanth Nandakumar. \u201cI would actually prefer India finish second in the table somehow, so a lost match somewhere will not be bad for me. Otherwise, with the form of teams I fully expect an India Pakistan semi final which I truly dread. We have been beating them in World Cups for so long that I feel a loss to Pakistan is due and I have a really nagging horrible feeling that I will come in the semi finals. I prefer England or New Zealand if it comes to that.\u201d 1st over: India 4-0 (Rahul 3, Rohit 1) Rahul sees off the first ball nicely and creams a nice drive through the covers. It\u2019s a very quick outfield and India\u2019s openers scamper for three runs. No sign of any swing for Cottrell, West Indies have Chris Gayle as their solitary slip but Rohit gets off the mark by tucking one down to fine leg. Rahul will face the first ball, Cottrell will open the bowling. \u201cWhat is the ICC have done with the pitches exactly?\u201d asks Mark Hooper on email. \u201cWhatever it is it\u2019s made this into a great competition - I saw the Windies v Bangladesh match at Taunton where normally you\u2019d expect flat-track bullies to fill their boots but it was amazing to see world-class batsmen really struggling to play themselves in.\u201d I would certainly agree with that. Yesterday, Mitchell Santner was doing all sorts with his wrist spin for New Zealand, which made Babar Azam\u2019s match-winning century all the more remarkable. For all your county action today, join John Ashdown right here. The teams are out for the national anthems. There are 23,000 people expected at Old Trafford today. What a corker of a day. I\u2019d also say that West Indies often do play their best cricket when their backs are against the walls. That said, their ODI win percentage is just 29% when they bowl first. Do get in contact if you have any thoughts on today\u2019s match, you can find me at michael.butler@theguardian.com and on Twitter @michaelbutler18. Away from the live action today, some worrying news. India: Rohit Sharma, KL Rahul, Virat Kohli (captain), Vijay Shankar, Kedar Jadhav, MS Dhoni (wk), Hardik Pandya, Mohammad Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Yuzvendra Chahal, Jasprit Bumrah West Indies: Chris Gayle, Sunil Ambris, Shai Hope (wk), Nicholas Pooran, Shimron Hetmyer, Jason Holder (captain), Carlos Brathwaite, Fabian Allen, Kemar Roach, Sheldon Cottrell, Oshane Thomas India are unchanged from the side that scraped past Afghanistan. That\u2019s somewhat of a surprise, as I thought Jadeja might get a game today in place of one of the wrist spinners. West Indies make two changes, Fabian Allen comes in for Ashley Nurse and Sunil Ambris replaces the injured Andre Russell, who underwent surgery yesterday. Not a surprise, really. It\u2019s gloriously sunny in Manchester and the pitch looks a belter to bat on. Pitch is a little off centre. Square of the wicket, it\u2019s 66m to one boundary, 70m to the other. Virat Kohli: \u201cIt looks like a hard wicket. We\u2019ve got two wrist-spinners, it\u2019s a used pitch so we see it drying out and slowing down in the latter half of the match.\u201d Jason Holder: \u201cWe wanted to bat too but if there\u2019s anything in the wicket it\u2019s probably first up. We are getting closer and closer, I\u2019ve challenged the guys to put together a complete game.\u201d Before we get to the team news, let\u2019s have a look at what this match means for both sides. After the New Zealand disappointment, West Indies are clinging on here. If they lose, they are out, which is about as clear as it gets. The Windies have won just one of their six matches so far, but can still progress if they win their final three games \u2013 and other results go for them. Sri Lanka and Afghanistan are to follow \u2013 two very winnable games \u2013 so a win today could yet prove decisive. For India, everything is going to plan. Four wins, one match rained off, and they sit comfortably in third, having played two games less than any of their rivals. You would think that they would need just one win from their final four matches to secure their place in the semi-finals. By the way, if you want to read more about the 1983 final/tournament, you could do a lot worse than these fine pieces. India v West Indies. A World Cup in England. It\u2019s 1983, it\u2019s the final at Lord\u2019s and one of the most stunning upsets in ODI cricket. For the West Indies side in their pomp \u2013 with Gordon Greenidge, Desmond Haynes, Sir Viv and Clive Lloyd at the top of the order, and the fearsome bowling foursome of Andy Roberts, Joel Garner, Malcolm Marshall and Michael Holding \u2013 this was their third consecutive World Cup final and they were widely expected to see off a an Indian side that had won just one match in their previous two World Cups. In fact, prior to the tournament India had played a total of just 40 ODIs and were 66-1 outsiders to win the whole thing. \u201cWe didn\u2019t take the game seriously,\u201d said India\u2019s first ODI captain, Ajit Wadekar, \u201cWe had no idea of field placings or tactics.\u201d The Indian team were criminally underfunded by their own board. Mohinder Amarnath taught Kapil Dev to wash his own clothes on tour to save money - \u201cactually showing me the tub in the bathroom\u201d \u2013 a process that damaged Kapil\u2019s hands so much, he was unable to bowl the next day. But things were changing. The Asian Games in Delhi the year previously had meant many households in India now had a colour TV. Most of the country was now glued to the screen. Rahul Dravid, then ten years old remembers \u201cwatching that final in Bangalore. That win inspired a lot of young kids to take to the game.\u201d It would prove to be a turning point for Indian cricket. After coming through their group as runners up, and squeezing past an underwhelming England in the semi-finals, India had made it to the final. West Indies put India into bat, swifty removing India\u2019s best batsman, Sunil Gavaskar, for just one run. A excellent partnership between Krishnamachari Srikkanth and Mohinder would see India reach 59 before a middle order collapse and a strong showing from the tail saw them reach 183 all out. \u201cIf this is not a winning total it\u2019s definitely a fighting total,\u201d Kapil would remark at the end of the Indian innings. And so it proved, with arguably the best batting line-up of the era falling for just 140 runs, with Mohinder and Madan Lal each taking three wickets. But the highlight of the day was undoubtedly Kapil\u2019s catch to remove Sir Viv Richards, the captain scampering backwards towards the boundary and taking a superb grab over his right shoulder. \u201cNo one but Kapil Dev would have taken that catch,\u201d Sir Viv would say later. Things have changed a little since then. There are 50, rather than 60 overs. A score of 183 probably won\u2019t win you the match these days. India are, of course, now a ODI superpower and have the best two ranked ODI batsman in the world in Virat Kohli and and Rohit Sharma. The West Indies are not what they were, but have come to England with a fine team, and were unlucky not to pull off a magnificent win against New Zealand in their last match. This is a huge game. Let\u2019s hope it\u2019s half as entertaining as the 1983 encounter. History tells us that the underdogs are not to be underestimated.
