As Wuhan, the city at the centre of the outbreak, began to return to normal life, Trump said the WHO had \u201cbeen wrong about a lot of things\u201d, and threatened to put a hold on WHO funding. When asked if that was a good idea during a pandemic, Trump denied saying it, and then said they would \u201clook at it\u201d. \u201cWe\u2019re going to investigate it, we\u2019re going to look at it. But we will look at ending funding, yeah, because you know what, they called it wrong, and if you look back over the years even, everything seems to be very biased toward China. That\u2019s not right.\u201d Trump has previously questioned China\u2019s reported numbers of infections, saying last week said they were \u201ca little on the light side\u201d, and referred to the outbreak as the \u201cChinese virus\u201d, prompting complaints from Beijing. The fresh salvo came against a background of a worsening death toll in the US, with New York state reporting on Tuesday its highest single-day increase, with 731 fatalities. At least 3,544 people have died in New York city alone from Covid-19. New memos revealing Trump was warned at the end of January that tough action was needed to avert hundreds of thousands of American deaths have fuelled suggestions the president is seeking a scapegoat. The WHO declared Covid-19 a public health emergency on 30 January. Almost a month later Trump, who had compared the virus to influenza, said it was under control in the US, before declaring a national emergency on 13 March. The US now has nearly 400,000 cases, and 13,000 deaths, compared with close to 83,000 cases in China and 3,337 deaths. Globally, there are more than 1.4m cases and just over 82,000 deaths. Meanwhile, the British prime minister, Boris Johnson has spent a second night in intensive care amid concerns about the seriousness of his condition, and the power vacuum he leaves behind. His \u201cdesignated survivor\u201d, Dominic Raab, still requires cabinet approval for major decisions. There are fears the UK will become the worst hit country in Europe, with more than 40% of the continent\u2019s deaths, according to forecasts. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation predicted 66,000 UK deaths from Covid-19 by August, with a peak of nearly 3,000 fatalities a day. New Zealand\u2019s swift decision to impose strict lockdown measures last month appears to be paying off, with the nation recording its lowest number of new coronavirus cases in a fortnight. In other developments: The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the outbreak began, had travel restrictions lifted on Wednesday for the first time since the months-long lockdown started. The city\u2019s 11m residents were permitted to leave the city if they had a \u201cgreen\u201d status on the mandatory health code app. The reopening came one day after China claimed to have no new deaths from the virus for the first time since January. Turkey has the world\u2019s fastest rising infection rate, growing by more than 3,000 a day. In just four weeks Turkey has reported 30,217 cases, but a lower fatality rate than other struggling countries, with 649 dead. Indonesia has confirmed just 2,738 cases and 221 deaths, but authorities are only able to process about 240 of the most accurate tests a day. The country of 264m didn\u2019t confirm its first case until 2 March, prompting fears the virus was left to spread, particularly in capital city Jakarta. President Joko Widodo has announced greater restrictions on residents, having earlier resisted lockdown measures. Italy has declared its own ports \u201cunsafe\u201d and will not authorise any migrant rescue boat to land until the end of the pandemic emergency. A former Chinese property executive and outspoken critic of China\u2019s response to the pandemic is under investigation for \u201cserious violations of discipline and law\u201d - a euphemism for graft accusations."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
