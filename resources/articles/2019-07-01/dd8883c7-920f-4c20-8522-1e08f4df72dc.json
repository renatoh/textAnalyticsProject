Nowhere near enough. Teenage striker Gabriel Martinelli has arrived from regional football in Brazil and is expected to need some adaptation and development time. David Ospina has departed for a modest fee. What do they still need to do? Lots. They are chasing width, defensive reinforcements and a box-to-box midfielder but so far negotiations are proving troublesome. Equally key is the need to shift unwanted players \u2013 also troublesome. Budget this summer \u00a340m. Amy Lawrence Aston Villa What have they done so far? Been busier than anyone and will soon have spent the best part of \u00a3100m. Seven players and counting have signed, reflecting the desire to strengthen a squad that has just won promotion but also fill the many gaps left after a clear-out at the end of last season. Jota, Anwar El Ghazi, Kortney Hause, Matt Targett, Ezri Konsa, Tyrone Mings and Wesley are the new arrivals \u2026 so far. What do they still need to do? Douglas Luiz is poised to join from Manchester City and Bj\u00f6rn Engels, the Reims defender, could well follow. Budget this summer Approximately \u00a3100m. Stuart James Bournemouth What have they done so far? Eddie Howe has freshened up his back line by again dipping into the Football League to sign the young and versatile defenders Lloyd Kelly, 20, and Jack Stacey, 23, who will compete for the left-back and right-back berths respectively. Fringe players Tyrone Mings, Emerson Hyndman and Connor Mahoney have departed. What do they still need to do? The key will be holding on to their indispensables: Callum Wilson, Ryan Fraser and Nathan Ak\u00e9. The No 1 shirt remains fairly open; Jack Butland is among the goalkeepers of interest while Artur Boruc has signed a new contract to take him beyond his 40th birthday. Budget \u00a320m. Ben Fisher Brighton What have they done so far? Another summer, another club-record fee, with Leandro Trossard an \u00a318m arrival from Genk. Brighton hope the Belgian winger, who scored 17 goals in all competitions last season, will provide further firepower. They have also bolstered their defence with the signing of the talented 22-year-old centre-back Matt Clarke, who was a big hit at Portsmouth. What do they still need to do? With Bruno retiring, links to a loan move for the Chelsea defender Reece James make sense. Keeping Lewis Dunk will be crucial, especially if Graham Potter plans to, as expected, play with a three-man defence. The highly rated Ben White has joined Leeds on loan. Budget \u00a320m. BF Burnley What have they done so far? More than this time last year. They have brought Jay Rodriguez home from West Bromwich Albion and signed Erik Pieters from Stoke as cover for Charlie Taylor following the departure of left-back Stephen Ward. Peter Crouch and Jon Walters have both been released. What do they still need to do? Not too much unless Aston Villa succeed in buying goalkeeper Tom Heaton or big offers come in for the teenage winger Dwight McNeil. Sean Dyche is reasonably happy with the balance of his squad. Budget this summer Without sales, up to \u00a320m. Paul Wilson Chelsea What have they done so far? Their only \u2018new\u2019 incoming business was Mateo Kovacic\u2019s move from Real Madrid, given Christian Pulisic joined back in January, but they have secured Ruben Loftus-Cheek to new terms. Significantly, though, they have sold Eden Hazard as well as some fringe players and agreed a deal that will take \u00c1lvaro Morata to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid permanently at the end of the season. What do they still need to do? They cannot make any further signings given their transfer ban but assessments will be made on which players will depart on loan. Budget this summer Not really applicable. Dominic Fifield Crystal Palace What have they done so far? Sold Aaron Wan-Bissaka to Manchester United for around \u00a345m, parted with a few experienced squad players under freedom of contract (Jason Puncheon, Juli\u00e1n Speroni and Bakary Sako) and recruited Stephen Henderson from Nottingham Forest as third-choice goalkeeper. What do they still need to do? Deflect Arsenal\u2019s interest and somehow appease Wilfried Zaha to stay, and secure Luka Milivojevic to new terms. Jordan Ayew is close to signing permanently from Swansea, but the club will still strive to secure a new right-back, striker and a creative forward. They will need many more if Zaha does leave. Budget this summer The money raised through Wan-Bissaka\u2019s sale, and the leeway granted to the wage bill by the flurry of quieter departures. DF Everton What have they done so far? Turning Andr\u00e9 Gomes\u2019 loan spell into a permanent stay was a priority for Marco Silva and achieved with minimum fuss for a reasonable fee. Jonas L\u00f6ssl has also arrived on a free from relegated Huddersfield as backup to first-choice goalkeeper, Jordan Pickford. What do they still need to do? Turn Kurt Zouma\u2019s loan spell into a permanent stay or, if Chelsea refuse to sell, secure another central defender. \u201cAfter that position we have three or four more [areas] to strengthen,\u201d said the Everton manager at the weekend. A message to the board if ever there was one. Budget this summer Not as substantial as previous summers and there is a need to reduce the wage bill. Andy Hunter Leicester What have they done so far? Some impressive business, most notably the club-record signing of Youri Tielemans from Monaco for a fee of around \u00a340m. Tielemans, who was superb on loan last season, appears to be a real coup for Leicester. They have also signed Ayoze P\u00e9rez from Newcastle for \u00a330m to add more goals to the team and paid Luton \u00a36m for James Justin, a highly rated 21-year-old right-back. What do they still need to do? Hold on to Harry Maguire, which will be easier said than done, and find homes for a number of out-of-favour, highly paid fringe players. Adding another midfielder is also a possibility. Budget this summer Approximately \u00a3100m. SJ Liverpool What have they done so far? Very little from a position of strength as European champions. Liverpool invested heavily last year \u2013 on new faces and new contracts for existing stars \u2013 and have so far concentrated on young talent such as 17-year-old defender Sepp van den Berg and 16-year-old Harvey Elliott. What do they still need to do? There are no glaring weaknesses to address in a team that gathered 97 points plus the Champions League last season although defensive cover is required, especially if Dejan Lovren departs. Budget this summer Last year\u2019s world record profit was reinvested in J\u00fcrgen Klopp\u2019s squad plus the new \u00a350m training complex under construction in Kirkby, but the manager will be backed if his first-choice targets become available. AH Manchester City What have they done so far? Triggered Rodri\u2019s \u20ac65m release clause to take the 23-year-old defensive midfielder from Atl\u00e9tico Madrid. Decided Leicester City\u2019s \u00a375m-plus valuation of Harry Maguire is too much (for the moment). What do they still need to do? Resolve the Maguire/centre-back situation following Vincent Kompany\u2019s departure. Budget \u00a3150m. Jamie Jackson Manchester United What have they done so far? Began promisingly with the signing of two 21-year-olds: pacey winger, Daniel James, who cost \u00a315m from Swansea City; and Aaron Wan-Bissaka, a swift right-back for \u00a345m from Crystal Palace. What do they still need to do? Buy a centre-back \u2013 Harry Maguire is the prime target \u2013 and solve the Paul Pogba headache: there is less than four weeks left of the window so, if he is to leave, Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r needs to find a replacement quickly. The same equation is true of the wantaway striker Romelu Lukaku. Budget \u00a3100m plus funds generated from any player sales. JJ Newcastle What have they done so far? Precisely nothing on the incoming front, having been without a manager since the departure of Rafa Ben\u00edtez. New signings are said to be in the pipeline once the vacancy has been filled and straightaway the new manager must set to work replacing goalscorers Ayoze P\u00e9rez and Salom\u00f3n Rond\u00f3n and out-of-contract midfielder Mohamed Diam\u00e9. What do they still need to do? Find out how much money is available for strengthening. The \u00a330m raised from the sale of P\u00e9rez could double if Sean Longstaff joins Manchester United, but that does not mean the new manager will be granted a war-chest and free rein. Budget Possibly \u00a330m. Even Mike Ashley must realise players need to be replaced. PW Norwich What have they done so far? An understudy for Teemu Pukki has arrived in the shape of Swiss forward Josep Drmic. There is also competition for Tim Krul in goal with the signing of long-standing Schalke No 1 Ralf F\u00e4hrmann. Norwich have also taken Manchester City\u2019s Patrick Roberts on loan, the winger having previously starred for Celtic What do they still need to do? Top targets are a first-choice defensive midfielder, and cover for youngster Max Aarons at right-back. But there remains expectation that another forward may yet be acquired and Hull\u2019s Jarrod Bowen and M\u00e1laga\u2019s Javier Ontiveros have been linked. Budget this summer \u00a335m. Paul MacInnes Sheffield United What have they done so far? Luke Freeman arrived from QPR for a club-record fee in excess of \u00a34m and then the Blades broke their transfer record again for the Preston forward Callum Robinson. Phil Jagielka has returned on a free, 12 years after he departed the club for Everton. Ravel Morrison has been on trial. What do they still need to do? More firepower remains key with Brentford\u2019s Neal Maupay and Swansea\u2019s Ollie McBurnie the top targets \u2013 both would cost in excess of \u00a310m. Goalkeeper Dean Henderson is set to return on loan from Manchester United and further midfield options are needed, with Nottingham Forest\u2019s Ben Osborn and Coventry\u2019s Tom Bayliss on the radar. Budget Not huge. Chris Wilder will probably have to break the club\u2019s transfer record again over the summer but he will be shopping in League One and the Championship. John Ashdown Southampton What have they done so far? They have made the loan of Danny Ings from Liverpool permanent and added Che Adams and Moussa Djenepo \u2013 two attacking players that fit the Ralph Hasenh\u00fcttl prototype, being young, fast, intelligent and comfortable with a high-pressing style. They have recouped \u00a314m by selling Matt Targett to Aston Villa. What do they still need to do? Hasenh\u00fcttl is likely to add a couple more but he could be more active with outgoing business. The club will listen to offers for Fraser Forster, Wesley Hoedt, Jordy Clasie (who will return to Holland), Mario Lemina, Sofiane Boufal, Charlie Austin and Guido Carrillo. Budget The club\u2019s Chinese owners oversaw a profit on transfers from their first three windows. Balanced books are their rationale. David Hytner Tottenham What have they done so far? They have made a good start, signing Mauricio Pochettino\u2019s No 1 target \u2013 the midfielder Tanguy Ndombele \u2013 for a club-record \u00a355m and also adding the winger Jack Clarke, although he has been loaned back to Leeds. What do they still need to do? Pochettino wants to add the Fulham left-sided player, Ryan Sessegnon and, ideally, an attack-minded midfielder but much will now depend on generating funds, meaning that the situation of the wantaway midfielder, Christian Eriksen, is pivotal. While Eriksen is in limbo, so are Spurs. Budget See above. They have already more than spent it. They could raise further funds by selling Toby Alderweireld and/or Kieran Trippier. DH Watford What have they done so far? The only senior signings are the 38-year-old goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes, not exactly a new face but certainly a popular one, who was convinced to postpone his retirement for a year, and the 29-year-old centre-back Craig Dawson, who arrived from West Brom for a fee of about \u00a35m. There have also been a handful additions to the development squad, including the former Arsenal defender Bayli Spencer-Adams and the 19-year-old Leeds striker Sam Dalby. What do they still need to do? The priorities at the start of the window were to augment central defence and to add pace and width in attack. Further defensive signings are possible but the focus of late has been on Isma\u00efla Sarr, the 21-year-old Rennes winger. Sarr is reportedly willing to join, though a fee has yet to be agreed with his club and the player\u2019s participation with Senegal at the Africa Cup of Nations has complicated the transfer. Budget \u00a340m Simon Burnton West Ham What have they done so far? Pablo Fornals was an exciting addition \u2013 the attacking midfielder joined for \u00a324m from Villarreal and helped Spain win the Under-21 European Championships last month \u2013 but all was quiet until Marko Arnautovic kicked up another stink and forced a move to Shanghai SIPG. What they need to do? Sign a striker. The sale of Arnautovic leaves a gaping hole up front and there is growing anxiety after Maxi G\u00f3mez snubbed them to join Valencia. West Ham have since turned their attention to Eintracht Frankfurt\u2019s S\u00e9bastien Haller and have also been linked with a loan move for Gonzalo Higua\u00edn of Juventus. Budget \u00a345m. Jacob Steinberg Wolverhampton Wanderers What have they done so far? On the face of it very little. There is an argument that Ra\u00fal Jim\u00e9nez and Leander Dendoncker are new signings (listed as such on the Premier League website), but it was April when Wolves triggered a pre-agreed option to make the Mexican\u2019s loan permanent, and there was an obligation to buy in last summer\u2019s loan agreement for the Belgium international. Either way, Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo, the Wolves manager, wants to bring in up to four new players. So far, an inflated transfer market has left the club frustrated. What do they still need to do? Add quality to a thin squad that will be stretched by Europa League participation. That said, Nuno prefers to operate with only 18 first-team players. Another striker and centre-back would seem to be priorities. Budget Hard to say, approximately \u00a360m. SJ"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
