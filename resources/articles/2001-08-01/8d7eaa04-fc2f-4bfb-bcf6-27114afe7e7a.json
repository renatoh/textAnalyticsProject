Six months to the day after foot and mouth erupted across the UK, the first live cattle to be auctioned were prodded into the ring at the Kirkwall Auction Mart before a small band of farmers. The last time Kirkwall held a cattle auction was on February 19, the day before the disease was spotted among pigs awaiting slaughter at an Essex abattoir. \"It is no surprise that we are the first part of the UK to resume markets because nothing comes in here,\" said John Copland, the mart manager. \"We were 325 miles from the nearest case of foot-and-mouth and all our cattle go from the island.\" Around a dozen farmers had travelled from the north-east of Scotland for the auction, and prices for the 500 cattle were said to be fair. It has been a hopeful sign but no one has been allowed to forget that parts of the country are still plagued by the disease. Tweed jackets and hobnail boots were replaced with protective clothing and disinfectant, and there were strict controls on who could handle the animals. Scotland has not had a confirmed case of foot and mouth since 30 May and there are hopes among the farming community that the country will be able to regain its export status if it remains free of the disease for a full 90 days - just a week from today. But there are also fears that the continuation of the disease south of the border may spoil Scotland's chance of re-opening export markets. And Scottish ministers have been warned by farming officials to do everything in their power to argue Scotland's case. South of the border, however, there is little to look forward to. Cattle markets are not due to resume in England and Wales until late autumn and sheep markets will not begin again until next year. Cases continue to crop up. Two were confirmed this weekend in Cumbria, the worst-hit area of the country. More than 5m animals have been slaughtered and the rural economy and tourism industry have been devastated. This morning, the new food minister, Lord Whitty, said farming could not continue as it had. Current methods of production - and in particular the pattern of production subsidies, were simply not sustainable, he said. \"We want a sustainable countryside economically, socially and environmentally. That is not achieved by production subsidies.\" His comments have upset some in the farming community but few doubt the reality behind his words. For all the familiar scenes in Orkney this morning, the last six months have changed UK farming forever.
