But that's not so if theatre needs public funding. Then it's primarily about education, inclusion and outreach. Time was when this work (but without those labels) was tackled by specialist talent and funded separately. Bigger plays were staged by people who did what they did best - and when the best was done, audiences of all sorts came. Andrew Kitchen Holmfirth, West Yorkshire We should all be angry about the disgraceful level to which drama has fallen in this country. Sentenced to die for lack of state funding by fools in government whose only memory of English literature is from their dull school days, we are denied the vast wealth that is our birthright. Drama should be everywhere: on the streets, in the park at lunchtime, in every pub and club across the land, 24 hours a day, both free and paid for. Harry Mottram Axbridge, Somerset German not forgotten C Meryon (Letters, December 4) bemoans the \"dominance of French literature and art in the UK over German\", and in particular the lack of biographies of H\u00f6lderlin and Trakl. Does he not know David Constantine's study, H\u00f6lderlin (1988), dedicated to Michael Hamburger? Trakl has been much translated into English, most recently by Alexander Stillmark. One of the most substantial biographical studies of Georg B\u00fcchner, by John Reddick, was published here in 1994. Earlier this year we at Libris published Georg Heym's poetry in a bilingual edition. Two of our biographies of German writers have actually been translated into German. It is not true that German literature is neglected in Britain; it is merely ignored by the literary editors of our broadsheets. Nicholas Jacobs Libris, London Capital, Holmes We can cease speculating about what Sherlock Holmes was up to between 1891 and 1894 (\"A four-pipe poseur\", December 4). In 1989 I was a guest of the Copenhagen Sherlockian Club. One of the members presented me with a pamphlet which incontrovertibly demonstrated that Holmes was, of course, working with Engels on Volume IV of Capital (Theories of Surplus Value). Unfortunately Engels died in 1894 and Holmes returned to Baker Street and his former occupation, leaving the work unfinished. Naturally, considering the class from which most of his clientele was drawn, Holmes himself kept quiet about this. Julian Rathbone Thorney Hill, Dorset Poetry and politics Kathleen Jamie (Letters, December 4) berates Robert Potts for admiring a poem on the Highland Clearances which Potts himself admits is \"not an easy read\". Rather, as he explains, the poem registers violence done by the well-spoken to the uneducated through the violence of its style, and so presents \"a caveat about how history is written, by whom, and why\". Ignoring Potts' reasonable and careful response, Jamie claims - with strange logic - that such not-easy poetry itself \"seeks to violate\" human community, by refusing \"coherent language\". The flaw in her argument would have become clear had she acknowledged that in the same review Potts praised another poem, by the same poet, on the hypocrisies of British parliamentary democracy. Would Jamie also call writers who \"seek to violate\" (that is, analyse, make strange, and dispute) the \"coherent language\" of politicians \"high-handed and offensive\"? Jeremy Noel-Tod Norwich Lambing times Ian Sansom's review of the Chambers Book of Days (\"Crunchy, but not the original\", December 4) managed to put me off buying the new one (full of trivia) and hunting down the old one, because some of the entries quoted were inaccurate. To give one example, Charles Lamb was not born on February 18 1834. He was born on February 10 1775 and died on December 27 1834. Laurence Inman Birmingham The story goes on Kathryn Hughes (\"Twice upon a time...\", December 4) makes an astonishing leap from a translation of Hans Andersen done in the 1840s from a German version of the original Danish, to the two books under review. She ignores the bilingual writer Erik Christian Haugaard's magisterial translation of the complete Andersen stories, published in the 1970s and in print worldwide ever since. It is hardly necessary, as she states, \"to return him to where he needs to be\" in the company of Balzac and Hugo. He hasn't gone away! Brian Lalor Dublin Singing in tongues In your otherwise excellent profile of Antonio Pappano (\"Force of nature\", December 4) you noted that the world of music was one \"where Russians and Italians rub shoulders with Oxbridge choral scholars and South Americans\". Is it not possible to be Russian, Italian or even South American, and an Oxbridge choral scholar? Peter S Dewar Bromley That's Rich Richard the \"British king\" (\"Money made the world go round\", November 20) and English king (Letters, November 27): would that be Richard of Bordeaux?
