The researchers have developed an intelligent window coating that blocks the sun's heat but allows its light to pass through. Normal tinted windows stop both. Blocking heat is fairly easy, but there is no use having a window that does not allow a room to heat up on a cold day. The new vanadium dioxide coating is smarter than that. It is designed to reflect warming infrared light only when the temperature hits 29C, but to allow visible wavelengths through under all conditions. \"Technological innovations such as intelligent window coatings really open the door to more creative design,\" says Ivan Parkin, who led the research. \"The current trend towards using glass extensively in buildings poses a dilemma for architects. Do they tint the glass, which reduces the benefit of natural light, or face hefty air-conditioning bills?\" His team announces its results in the Journal of Materials Chemistry. Key to the breakthrough is vanadium dioxide's unusual ability to alternate between acting as a metal (that reflects heat) and a semiconductor (that absorbs it). Bonds locking the vanadium's electrons in place collapse at 29C, turning the material metallic."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
