I genuinely respected the man. Sure, he gave me an opportunity to play football at the World Cup, but, more than that, I liked the way he did things. He was regimental, there were no grey areas. I fondly nicknamed him \"Rain Man\" because he was obsessive about football. He would study the game with a pedant's eye for detail. He was the sort of individual who would sit down with the goalkeepers, with genuine interest, and dissect how we do things. He was always harvesting information, wanting to know more. I hope for his wife's sake that he gets another job soon because I imagine he will be unbearable to live with otherwise. A football brain he may have been, approachable he was not. During the World Cup in South Africa \u2013 it used to make me chuckle \u2013 you could walk past and he would not even look at you. It got to the point where, if he did look at you, you would run and tell the rest of the lads: \"He looked at me!\" and then spend the rest of the afternoon wondering if it was a nice look or an irritated look. It was a bit like having the Queen around, you wouldn't know whether to walk on or bow. I'm not saying he was rude; he was just very focused \u2013 and consistent. You knew to expect formality: like an old\u2011fashioned schoolmaster, he called everyone by their surname or their position. \"Rooney!\" he would shout or sometimes just \"Hey, goalkeeper!\" His authoritarian style was unfamiliar to our players and that's perhaps one area in which the team struggled during the World Cup. But it seemed lessons had been learned and a revised approach at the Euros promised more success. Why did he resign? Although the timing of it is surprising, the circumstances are not. The England captaincy in itself would not have been the issue \u2013 no disrespect to anyone who has had the honour, but what do England captains actually do? Toss a coin? Decide which end we kick off at? (The way Capello was with detail, he probably would have decided this himself anyway.) The bone of contention would have been respect. Capello is his own man and the thought of having to defer authority to anyone else would have been unacceptable. And so to his replacement. The swell of opinion seems to be pointing in the direction of my old boss Harry Redknapp. If he is offered the job \u2013 and accepts \u2013 he would certainly be a popular choice in the dressing room. Harry is so England, it's practically poetic. Of course, most people would assume he is the polar opposite in style to Capello. At 64, with that cockney geezer accent, Harry may seem old-school football. But he's not. He doesn't tolerate drinking cultures, he's not all about getting big lumps forward \u2013 he's actually very progressive. New school, I'd say. To do well in a modern football environment you have to be. Stuart Pearce is a great example. When I played under him at Manchester City, he was all roll\u2011your-sleeves-up and growl at people. Since then, he has evolved into a seriously good international manager, with a completely different style and approach. The area in which Harry and Capello share the same approach is the team announcement. I call it \"deal or no deal\", the big reveal in the matchday dressing room. Until that moment, no one can be sure who is playing. Everyone talks about Harry's man\u2011management style as his greatest asset. Where Capello was taciturn, Harry makes you feel as though he's your best mate. Players like him because he treats everyone as an individual, making important decisions on a case-by-case basis. The genius of it is how often he gets it right. Where Capello would refuse to select a player who could not cope with full training, Harry has always been happy to make exceptions. Among the players at Portsmouth, it was well known Kanu never trained. \"King\", as we called him, never even walked up a flight of stairs. We only had one flight of stairs at Portsmouth's training ground, but Kanu would always wait for the lift. He was practically incapacitated, but on the field of play he could do amazing things. I remember one match against Middlesbrough, Kanu came on, ran three-quarters of the length of the pitch, scored \u2013 and then travelled home in a wheelchair. The year we won the FA Cup with Portsmouth, Harry made a very big exception for me. We had a game at Goodison Park on the Saturday, but I'd been invited to a family wedding the day before. I explained to Harry why it was important for me to be there. He said to me: \"Jamo, do what you want, son. As long as you don't let any goals in on Saturday.\" It took me more than seven hours to drive to the wedding. By the time I got back to the team hotel it was late and I was knackered. The next day, we beat Everton 3-0 and I saved a penalty. Harry had shown faith in me and I like to think that was my way of repaying him. I cannot imagine any other manager allowing a player to do anything like that. He's not a soft touch, though (anyone who's watched that YouTube video of him getting hit by a football will know that) and he only makes exceptions for players when he believes it will bring the best results for the team. His technical nous is not often discussed, but it is there. I remember he played Richard Hughes \u2013 a fringe player at Portsmouth at that time \u2013 in the heart of the midfield against Liverpool. That day he had a 97% success rate for passes and we drew 0-0. He was the lynchpin in the team. Stevie G said to me afterwards: \"That bloody Hughsie is like a rash, you can't get rid of him.\" If you compare Harry's CV to Capello's there's always going to be a sense of disparity. But Harry has made a habit of building teams to reach their potential. He is the opposite choice to someone such as Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, who would arrive with an impressive CV and big expectations. Harry develops teams: he did it at Bournemouth, at West Ham, at Portsmouth \u2013 taking us from relegation dodgers the year I signed to FA Cup winners playing European football \u2013 and now he's doing it at Tottenham. The consensus seems to be that England should be managed by an Englishman, of which there are very few good enough to take the job. But, in my opinion, even if there were 10 English managers all vying for the position, Harry would still be the right man.
