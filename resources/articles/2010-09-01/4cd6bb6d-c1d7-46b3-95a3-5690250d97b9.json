From the \"obsessive teenage lust\" on Coquet Coquette to the surreal perversions of Like a Tourist (\"dragon rape \u2026 unicorns eating baby meat\"), Barnes loads on the kink. False Priest's funk leanings are reinforced by special guests such as Janelle Mon\u00e1e, bringing a ray of glamour to Enemy Gene, and Solange Knowles, adding some sass to Sex Karma; but there's an undertow of spiritual angst throughout the album, too. It culminates in the spoken-word sermon of Do You Mutilate?, in which Barnes rips into the ills of hardline religion. It's a confrontational ending, but the journey there is wonderfully weird."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
