Vunipola refused to discuss his specific Instagram post and the furore it prompted in April, stating only that he will not \u201cexpand on\u201d nor \u201ctake a step back\u201d from his stance, with the England international adding: \u201cI have made my position clear.\u201d The Rugby Football Union will not place any restrictions on England\u2019s social media use at the World Cup \u2013 indeed, Eddie Jones was recently extolling its virtues \u2013 but while all players will receive guidance before heading to Japan, Vunipola\u2019s insistence that he will not impose any ban on himself, as he did during the Six Nations, has the potential to cause the union a headache. Future posts as incendiary as Vunipola\u2019s in April \u2013 stating that \u201cman was made for woman to procreate\u201d as he offered support to Folau \u2013 are unlikely because he is at pains to avoid unwanted distractions for his England teammates but there remains a sense of lingering stalemate. Both the RFU and Saracens gave Vunipola a formal warning in April but while he expressed regret for causing offence and insisted that his faith is \u201cdeeply personal\u201d he has not apologised nor removed the post. Speaking at England\u2019s World Cup training camp in Bristol, he did not address questions specifically about the post but again struck a tone short on contrition. \u201cI think we have talked about it at length, not just me, but the RFU and the people at Saracens,\u201d he said. \u201cWe came to a conclusion that this issue, that people say I brought on myself, is better off left alone. I have made my position clear and what I don\u2019t want to do is become a distraction to the players around me. \u201cIf I was a boxer and it was just me that I was affecting, I would sit here and answer your question. But it doesn\u2019t just affect me. It affects the coaching staff [and] the players, because you will be asking their opinions on it. It is firmly what I put out there and it is firmly on me, but at the same time I don\u2019t want to put them under the cosh by saying this, this and this \u2013 because that is unfair to them. \u201cI want it to be known that you guys know where I stand. I\u2019m not going to expand on it or take a step back. That is not me being stubborn, but me not wanting the players to be affected by it as it is not fair on them.\u201d Whether Vunipola\u2019s social media activity \u2013 either in the past or the future \u2013 proves a distraction for England in Japan remains to be seen. In the aftermath of his initial comments he was regularly booed by opposing fans and he was confronted by a pitch invader after Saracens\u2019s Champions Cup semi-final win over Munster. Things had died down somewhat by the end of the domestic season but Vunipola has yet to represent England since then and Jones issued a thinly veiled warning earlier this month. \u201cThat was dealt with by his club and dealt with very well by the RFU,\u201d he said. \u201cSo Billy now when he comes in he is a married man, he\u2019s on England duty and we expect him to follow the values of the team, and I\u2019m sure he will.\u201d Vunipola was married in Tonga before joining up with England and he is unlikely to receive anything but a warm reception in their opening World Cup match \u2013 against the Pacific island \u2013 on 22 September. \u201cIt would be the first time against Tonga if I play. It would be very emotional, even thinking about it now,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s where we come from, where we grew up. It would be even better to play them in Tonga, that would be crazy. Hopefully in the future that could happen.\u201d Japan will be Vunipola\u2019s second World Cup but his only start in 2015 came in the disastrous defeat by Wales, before injury struck. After that tournament he lamented the squad\u2019s failure to bond off the pitch, claiming: \u201cYou want to get to know someone on a deeper level,\u201d and that the best way to do it is \u201cwhen you go out to the pub, have a drink and break down barriers\u201d. Vunipola is confident, however, that England will not make the same mistakes four years on. He said: \u201cIt\u2019s something that we are definitely working on and something we have a lot of growth to make up in. It\u2019ll take us to a position where we can be really successful. That\u2019s somewhere with England where we\u2019ve kind of always been lacking.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
