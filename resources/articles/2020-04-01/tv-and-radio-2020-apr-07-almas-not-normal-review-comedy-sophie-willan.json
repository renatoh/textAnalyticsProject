It\u2019s based on her award-winning 2017 Edinburgh show, Branded, which drew on her chaotic childhood (some of it spent in care) as the daughter of a heroin addict and her experiences in later life as a sex worker. What was a primarily a laughter-seeking standup set has now been bulked out with a fine cast, an array of swiftly and surely drawn characters and an emotional undertow that \u2013 when the time is right \u2013 suddenly surfaces to punch you in the solar plexus and leave you breathless with sorrow. Alma (Willan) is a 30-ish woman who has just broken up with Anthony, the boyfriend she has had since she was 15. This is not to her detriment (we may side with Alma\u2019s grandma\u2019s succinct take on the man \u2013 \u201cHe\u2019s a fuck\u201d) but she can\u2019t quite see that yet. Anthony left her for the younger, hotter, soon impregnated Melanie, and with the rent to pay. Pink fur coat on, Alma cycles determinedly to the job centre to find that \u201csandwich artist at SubnGo\u201d is the only option available for someone who was a latchkey kid from five (\u201cThink Mowgli with a mullet,\u201d she suggests) and didn\u2019t go to school until she was seven. \u201cI was never much of an academic,\u201d says Alma, delicately, to her interrogator, over flashbacks of Mowgli stepping over unconscious adults to get to the cornflakes in a squalid kitchen. She is given an expression of interest form to take home and fill out. Grandma Joan, all mouth and leopardskin trousers, alongside an enduring love for fried Spam, is played by the mighty Lorraine Ashbourne. Joan took Alma in after social services took the child away from her mother, Lin, and placed her in foster care. Their roughly loving bond, formed and maintained in adversity, is one of the highlights of the half hour. Siobhan Finneran plays Alma\u2019s broken mother (once a punk, \u201cthe Iggy Pop of the psych ward\u201d), who is still confined to the Bury psychiatric hospital due to her tendency to set fire to houses whenever she is in the grip of her post-addiction psychosis. Lin has taken up painting, although Alma notes that she always liked ornamental pixies, too. \u201cIf she\u2019d discovered them before heroin, we could have had a very different life.\u201d Finneran, Ashbourne and Willan form a powerful central trio, able to pivot deftly and naturally between comedy and tragedy, hitting viewers with the hilarious or desperate truth of any moment as required. They are ably supported by fellow standup (and singer) Jayde Adams as Alma\u2019s best friend, Leanne, who, despite her unglamorous work as a butcher\u2019s assistant, is never short of a beau in Bury thanks to her exotic accent (she\u2019s from Bristol). It is Leanne who learns \u2013 from Winky Anne, although she\u2019s had that eye fixed now \u2013 that there is money to be made in escort work: \u201c\u00a37.50 an hour, I\u2019m on,\u201d she notes surlily to Alma over a pint. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve got to wear that hat.\u201d When she gets home, Alma screws up her expression of interest form and puts in a call to Winky Anne\u2019s employer instead. \u201cYes,\u201d she says firmly before we leave her. \u201cI\u2019m aware it\u2019s sex.\u201d Alma\u2019s Not Normal has much in common with Daisy Haggard\u2019s Back to Life and Aisling Bea\u2019s This Way Up. In line with the journalistic law that three of anything constitutes an official trend, I can now delightedly pronounce the birth of a new one \u2013 single-authored-by-a-female-comedian-dramas-that-capture-the-messy-imperfections-of-life-and-in-particular-the-ramifications-on-mental-health-of-previous-often-childhood-experience-and-are-brilliant-at-entwining-grief-and-laughter-and-folding-micropscopic-detail-in-with-macroscopic-coverage-of-this-crazy-thing-we-call-life. Some trends pass, of course. But some \u2013 especially when they are established by pioneers producing high-quality work \u2013 represent the beginning of a new way of doing or thinking about things. I would like to think that Alma is another sign that female-led shows are becoming a less fearful proposition for commissioners and audiences. That the weight of drama a half hour comedy can bear (or vice versa) is no longer carved in stone but can be left up to the creator and his or her talents to divine. That stories untold in the mainstream \u2013 about mental health, bad childhoods, prison sentences or any of a million other things \u2013 are beginning to be viewed as a rich seam to be uncovered, not an elephant trap for ratings. Here\u2019s hoping for more not normal."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
