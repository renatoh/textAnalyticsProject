Winston Churchill The great British bulldog was revealed to be a bit of a softie, after all. Newly discovered letters from his wife Clementine show that she would refer to him as 'my sweet amber boy', draw hearts with his name inside it and doodle cats on her notes to him. One can't imagine Eva Braun doing the same for Hitler somehow. Horizontal stripes Every woman has been told that vertical stripes flatter and horizontal ones make you look fatter. Now a researcher at the University of York has proved that this is the ultimate fashion faux pas. Horizontal stripes on clothes make the body appear longer. According to Peter Thompson, who conducted the study, scientists have known for the last 150 years that horizontal stripes perform this optical illusion. They just didn't bother telling any women. Suffolkians Residents of this gentle county have been terrorised all week by the threat that Amy Winehouse was on her way. The singer was reported to have bought a \u00a3750,000 country mansion in which to recuperate and be near her junkie husband Blake Civil-Fielder, who is in prison around the corner.

XL has left 85,000 people stranded, and thousands queued at Gare du Nord trying to figure out how to get back after the toxic fire on the French side of the tunnel. One French radio station even noted gleefully that: 'England is temporarily an island again.' Joe Biden Barack Obama's campaign to be the next US President looks like it's stuck in a rut. Even his Democrat running mate Joe Biden is questioning his leader's decision. Biden has suggested that Hillary Clinton, Obama's main rival for the nomination, might have been a 'better pick' than him and that she was as qualified, if not more so, to be Vice-President. Biden could alternatively have just blamed himself for being a bit dull. Celebrity chefs Next up on the carving block - Jamie Oliver and Gordon Ramsay. Egon Ronay has singled these two out as examples of chefs who need to remember what they actually do for a living. 'Years ago the ambition was to cook better food, now it's to get a good balance sheet,' he said. Oliver and Ramsay have a string of international restaurants between them. Ronay, meanwhile, didn't too badly out of his food guides."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
