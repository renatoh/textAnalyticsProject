They can follow their subjects from a documentary-esque perspective (like director Jean-Jacques Annaud\u2019s astonishing nature-drama The Bear), assign them voices and make their mouths move (Babe) or provide narration articulating their thoughts and feelings (The Adventures of Milo and Otis). Director John Tatoulis chose the latter \u2013 with an interesting twist \u2013 when adapting author Elyne Mitchell\u2019s beloved children\u2019s novel The Silver Brumby, resulting in a classic 90s Australian outdoors movie that plays like a bedtime companion piece to The Man from Snowy River. Narration from actor Caroline Goodall sounds rich and florid for a good reason: her character is Mitchell herself, writing an ornately worded book from the horses\u2019 point-of-view. It is a strong female-led picture, with a framing device that doubles as means to explore the relationship between the author and her young daughter Indi (Amiel Daemion). Tatoulis oscillates between them and the story Mitchell is telling, introduced to Indi on a stormy night and involving a bushman known only as the Man (Russell Crowe). The Akubra-wearing alpha male is trekking cross country in pursuit of the coveted silver stallion. After it rescues his mare from captivity, he becomes dead-set on revenge \u2013 not as dementedly obsessive as a Captain Ahab type but no less determined, partial to gazing vacantly into the distance and yelling \u201cyou silver devil!\u201d But Crowe\u2019s character never develops into much more than a cipher. Focus remains squarely equine over man, and the film is better for it. Visions of horses in their natural environment in Victorian high country are well-matched to Mitchell\u2019s narration, drawing a quaint but captivating effect that avoids the goofiness of a talking animals movie. The writer speaks from their perspective (\u201cshe taught him how to recognise the scent of man, and his dog, and the smell of his fire\u201d) as if she has a direct line to their hearts and minds, explaining their emotions and articulating trials and tribulations. These are generally two-fold: surviving the elements, including other creatures and the extremities of a snow-covered winter; and evading humans. Cinematographer Mark Gilfedder\u2019s lens soaks up resplendent surroundings like a high-powered sponge. The Silver Brumby (released overseas as The Silver Stallion) is mostly edited in classical style, with the exception of slow-motion sequences capturing the horses\u2019 movements that pop up intermittently \u2013 a couple of times too many, in fact, as if editor Peter Burgess had a big button on his desk specifically for that purpose. Production values are nevertheless A-grade, from opening images of moonlit hills graded in luminous blue, to a kamikaze chase scene involving a horse running off a cliff \u2013 an unforgettably bittersweet moment. Tatoulis understands the greatest special effect at his disposal are the animals themselves, imbuing the drama with a natural beauty that doesn\u2019t age. Not so for his follow-up, 1996\u2019s little-seen dystopian future film Zone 39: a low-budget sci-fi starring Peter Phelps as a man stranded in the desert who takes drugs in order to hallucinate visions of his dead wife. It is slow and stodgy \u2013 like an ulta low-rent Blade Runner \u2013 and something of a misfire. But The Silver Brumby is a gem: its words and images stay with you, and the film found a deserving place in the pantheon of great Australian outdoors movies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
