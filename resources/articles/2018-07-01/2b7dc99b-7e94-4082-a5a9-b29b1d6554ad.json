On Thursday, Buzzfeed reported that the MP for Lindsay faced allegations of bullying, harassment, verbal abuse and intimidation of former staff at her western Sydney electorate office. Husar, a single mother of three, is also alleged to have used her taxpayer-funded staff to conduct household, family and nannying duties for her. Buzzfeed reported that in March NSW Labor commissioned barrister John Whelan to conduct an investigation into the claims. It is expected to be completed in coming days. In a statement, Husar said she was \u201chorrified\u201d to learn about the complaints and that no staff had raised the issues with her. \u201cThese accusations don\u2019t reflect who I am or how my office operates,\u201d she said. \u201cMy office is a professional and respectful workplace, it should not be perceived in any other way and of course I\u2019m sorry if any person has been given reason to think otherwise.\u201d NSW Labor has confirmed it has an independent process for assessing complaints but would not comment on the investigation into Husar\u2019s conduct until all allegations had been considered. Asked on Friday if Husar was a bully, the Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese said: \u201cShe is a single mum, who works incredibly hard and represents her electorate very strongly. \u201cI find her a terrific person to deal with,\u201d he told Channel Nine\u2019s Today program. \u201cI had not met her ... before she ran for Lindsay, but I find her a very good local member of parliament.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
