Pilloried for shunning England's tour of India and obsessed by his faltering love affair with his native Yorkshire, he now has to withstand an even greater ignominy: it seems that he has been quite forgotten. The one fact that many people will confidently state about Gough's winter is that he is spending it entirely at home, taking time out in Buckinghamshire to rest aching limbs, play with his kids and count his benefit money. However justified his opt-out may be, England have been left to muddle through without him. But that is not entirely true. When England's one-day squad leave for India and New Zealand tomorrow, for a programme of 11 limited-overs internationals in seven weeks, Gough will be among them. From Kanpur to Christchurch he will be bustling in, red-faced, again. Quite an absence from home for a man presumed to be putting his feet up. The confusion is a product of England's policy of offering separate Test and one-day contracts. When Gough refused to tour India, a decision that ensured his Test education will remain sadly incomplete, he automatically ruled himself out of the Test series in New Zealand, but he was retained in the one-day party. He will not be overlooked for long. Like an over-cheery milkman he will whistle his own tune from the day the tour dawns, as boisterous in the dressing room as he will be on the field. It will be left to his new-ball partner Andrew Caddick, who for safety reasons also opted out of the India Test series, to make a more awkward international return, sensitive to the slightest suggestion of lingering resentment. If England's World Cup countdown is to begin here, Gough will assume his right to lead it as the most immediately compulsive cricketer of his generation. But that accolade will not arrive automatically. In a melancholy Ashes summer, when England were thoroughly outplayed, his 17 wickets cost him nearly 40 runs each. The much praised Gough-Caddick axis, which had begun to draw inadvisable comparisons with Fred Trueman and Brian Statham, never maintained the pressure. Gough, more than once, looked a bowler at odds with himself. He lacked rhythm. He lacked patience. There were times when he even lacked optimism. In Yorkshire, too, he was rarely seen - except on advertising campaigns. They won their first championship in 33 years without him. As he became at loggerheads with the county, everything got out of proportion. He claimed life had become \"almost unbearable\", talking of poison-pen letters, the committee members out to destroy him: it was becoming so overstated that by the end it had a touch of Walter Mitty. David Byas, Yorkshire's captain, uncompromising, inflexible, unerringly honest, retired at the end of the season to take up farming full-time. He had long tired of what he perceived as Gough's inflated self-worth. With Gough threatening to leave the county (he eventually decided to stay - but probably only until his contract runs out next summer), Byas thundered: \"All these complaints about committee members not liking you and nasty letters are nothing fresh. I had it for six years as captain. It is a cop-out because he has had a benefit and banked the cheque. Basically he is not worth bothering with.\" Gough's behaviour at Yorkshire's championship celebration dinner in Leeds also embarrassed many of his friends. He arrived late and, when his time came to be formally interviewed, grabbed the microphone and emotionally defended himself to a packed audience. Here was further evidence of a man under considerable pressure. His team-mates, wondering where all this huff and hubris will end, and with an eye to Trueman's blunt outspokenness, have even dubbed him \"Son of Fred\". India, with its benign pitches, will not grant Gough any favours, although he performed stout-heartedly and increasingly successfully in Pakistan and Sri Lanka last winter, and the challenge of silencing a teeming crowd at Eden Gardens by removing Sachin Tendulkar's off stump will quicken his ambitions. What England need more than anything, however, is consistent proof that his career is once again wedded to reality. Nasser Hussain, England's captain, admires Gough's ability and combative nature, and smiles benignly on his more outlandish moments. But even Hussain, a consummate man-manager, has expressed limited sympathy for the difficulties that Caddick and Gough may face upon their return. \"I don't care what will happen to those who have chosen not to tour,\" he said in Bangalore last month, as England's hopes of squaring the Test series slipped away. \"I'm more concerned about the well-being of those who are here.\" Gough's placing family above career, however dubiously timed, does not warrant knee-jerk criticism. For the second time in eight years he was at home for his son's birthday, and no one can resent that. But now, for the first time in many years, he rejoins the England side with something to prove. His response is eagerly awaited.
