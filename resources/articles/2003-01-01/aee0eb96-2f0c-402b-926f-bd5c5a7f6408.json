Ironic really, since scarcely anyone does Latin at school these days and it is apparently no longer even the sine qua non for a professor of classics. A priori, of course, there is nothing wrong with the odd choice dictum or a few pithy sententia here and there in undergraduate prose, or any other. Up to a point, licet, I say. Since the days of Chaucer's Pardoner, at least, the Latinate an un-Latinate alike have dropped such verba sapietum as part and parcel of the ars rhetorica, as an invocation of authority, or simply a means to impress. Semper idem, you might think. Indeed, academic tradition tends to encourage their use ad infinitum. We school our charges in footnote conventions full of ibids and idems, op cits and loc cits, ut infras and ut supras, vides and passims, not to mention the old et seq and the occasional s.v. And in the body of the text we are disposed to allow, even if we do not encourage, the i.e.s and e.g.s, as well as the sics and the vizs, and to disapprove of etc only because it is vague. After all, clarity and economy are the fons et origo of a good piece of written work, from the magnum opus of the professional academic to the weekly libellus of the first-year student. If these desiderata are aided by a few tags then, ipso facto, they are justified. Similarly, those tags which have become so much a part of the everyday language that they are spoken without thinking, such as vice versa, per se, ad hoc and bona fide, then surely non est tanti. We might legitimately refer to our alter ego, to prima facia evidence, and to a quid pro quo because an English alternative would be sesquipedalian verba. Per contra, however, there is no real need for sui generis, a posteriori, or pari passu as perfectly short and serviceable phrases in the vernacular would do just as well. Their use too often represents a kind of verbal tick, of which a writer may be largely unaware, and can reoccur ad nauseam, or at least to the point of extreme irritation. These are a fortiori unnecessary. Perhaps in the past when educated people were grounded in Latin and, inter alia, the classics formed part of their mental furniture the use of such things seemed less conspicuous. But in a world where the ancient languages have been marginalised and even long-established rules of grammar are being waived, then can seem at best overly self-conscious and at worst rather pretentious. Of course, it would be a reductio ad absurdem to say that we should disallow all Latin tags in our students' work, save for the odd lapsus calami. It would in any case take a deus ex machina to expunge them all. And I can hardly claim the high ground in this since I've been guilty of a pretentious Latinism or two in my time: mea culpa. But, ceteris paribus, such things are probably best confined to circumstances in which there is no convenient alternative in the mother tongue.
