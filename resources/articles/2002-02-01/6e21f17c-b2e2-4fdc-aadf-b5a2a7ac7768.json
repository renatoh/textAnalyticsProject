Gardener was penalised for allegedly breaking from his blocks too early and then, when the race was run for a second time, he finished third after making a cautious start to avoid disqualification. He then made a formal protest, complaining that there could have been a mix-up in the wiring with the blocks and that another athlete may have made the false start. The meeting manager Andrew Clatworthy and Roger Simons, head of track and field competition at UK Athletics, will now study video evidence of the incident and a tape has been sent to the chief starter Doug Webb. Clatworthy said: \"I checked the wiring on the day and I am satisfied that all was proper and in place. \"The BBC has supplied us with a copy of their pictures from the start, in normal speed and also in slow motion, so we can look at what happened as closely as we can. \"The chief starter will see these tapes and we will await his comments to see where we progress from there.\" Gardener was protesting furiously and even the crowds were calling out that the false start had been made by the American Brian Lewis in the lane next to Gardener. But the problem appears to have been with the computer system recording the athletes' reaction times to the start of the first race. Gardener said yesterday: \"We saw a print-out of those times and three other athletes had blanks by their name, which is not correct. Everyone should have a reaction time but I was the one to show the quickest which might have been the reason I received the false start. I know there is nothing which can be done to change the result of the race but I am glad the incident is being looked into, for my peace of mind if nothing else. \"I watched a video replay straight away and then I saw it again this morning and I know I did not false start. I would be the first to hold up my hands if I did and it will be interesting to see what findings come out from this investigation.\" Clatworthy added: \"Between the 'get set' being called and the bleep going off to start the race, there is a 35-hundreths of a second delay where the system sets itself. It is possible the other athletes may have gone in between that time which is why there is no reaction shown by their names.\" Gardener recorded 6.54 as he finished third behind South Africa's Morn\u00e9 Nagel who won in 6.50 with Britain's Mark Lewis-Francis second in 6.53. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
