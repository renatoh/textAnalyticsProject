In 1972, during a stay in Berne, I attended a football match between the Stuttgart Lions and the Young Boys. The match was completely unmemorable but the full team names on the scoreboard were not. The name of the Young Boys' then stadium, \"Wankdorf\", preceded the current club name. I fear that the spread of English vernacular by football fans has reduced the opportunities for such unintended and innocent amusement. Robert Cliff London \u2022 Page 1 (Women face 57-year wait for equal pay, research says, 19 August): \"Women have also been hit harder by the recession, with more female workers than men being made redundant\". Page 28 (Learning new ropes, 19 August): \"men are being hit harder by the recession than women ... male unemployment has jumped by a staggering 25% \u2013 much more than female joblessness.\" It's the diversity of opinion that makes reading the Guardian so rewarding. Julian Ashley Tunbridge Wells, Kent \u2022 Thirty years ago this month, I sat in Days of Hope bookshop in Newcastle, being lectured by super-Trot Alan Milburn on deviations from correct Socialist thought. Now he's a Tory adviser (Letters, 19 August). He was a pillock then, he's a pillock now. A Tory pillock. Chris Lilly London \u2022 How odd, in dissecting the hysteria of the oil spill (Comment, 18 August), and pointing the finger of blame, that Simon Jenkins fails to mention \u2013 even once \u2013 those in the US who share his trade. David Harvie Dumbarton \u2022 With reference to Anastasia de Waal's letter (19 August), can I be the first to report that Civitas is a mickey mouse thinktank. Oh and I didn't say that, I heard it in the staffroom. Tom Oliphant Stanley, Co Durham \u2022 Here on the Cornish coast the rain almost invariably falls to the right (Letters, 19 August), so I find myself, incredibly, more in tune with the Telegraph.
