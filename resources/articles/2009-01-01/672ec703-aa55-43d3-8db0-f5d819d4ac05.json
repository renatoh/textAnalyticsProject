Gonzalez had minimal expectations when he signed up for a ticket on his senator's website, figuring they would go to the lucky or well-connected. He was neither - until December 22 when his number came up. \"Getting this ticket was exactly like winning the lottery,\" Gonzalez said. \"I've never won anything before.\" Like hundreds of thousands of other Americans who will witness the final stage of Obama's journey down Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House, Gonzalez's trip to Washington is, in its own way, as improbable as the president's. Gonzalez knew no one in Washington, and could barely afford the airfare let alone the inflated rates of hotel rooms in inauguration week. He had to spend 10 hours a day preparing a lesson plan for the teacher that would take over his classes at a school in a low-income area of Albuquerque. But today saw Gonzalez and his partner Phelosha Collaros wheeling their luggage through a congressional office building, just east of the spot where Barack Obama will take his oath. They had their inauguration tickets in hand and a bottle of wine for their host - a friend of Collaros's boss whom they were to meet for the first time. Collaros videoed every step of their journey for a short course Gonzalez will teach on his return. \"My students are way way out in New Mexico,\" said Gonzalez. \"Most of them will never get a chance to come to Washington in their lives, so I feel a duty to bring something back to them.\" A few blocks west, beneath the steps of the Capitol where Obama will take his oath, Ekilah Poles, in orange gloves and furry hat, posed with her friends for photographs in front of a jumbotron reading: \"56th presidential inauguration\". Poles figured today was her best chance to see what Obama will see when he takes the oath on the steps of a Capitol draped with flags. She drove eight hours from Columbia, South Carolina to be in Washington, but does not have a ticket to the ceremony. \"I will be with my brethren on the Mall,\" she said. Poles realises that Obama comes to office lumbered with expectations. But all she really wants is for him to connect with ordinary Americans. \"He is not going to be able to work miracles, but I expect him to tell us what hardships we are facing, and how he is going to get us through,\" she said. \"We don't necessarily have to agree.\" A few blocks to the west, Pennsylvania Avenue was deserted of pedestrians. Tour buses lined the north and south sides of the road. Tim Andersen and Irina Kushner, lawyers who live in the Virginia suburbs, hurried along through the first flakes of snow. They wanted their view of history in advance. \"It's going to be too hectic dealing with everything and the road closures,\" said Andersen. Others could scarcely stay away, like the six students in Washington for just ten days before leaving on an exchange programme to Tanzania, who congregated in front of the FBI headquarters, about halfway along Obama's route tomorrow. \"This is crazy exciting,\" said Claire Richard, a student from Oklahoma. \"It's really touched people. My grandmother who is 96 is so jazzed.\" A few blocks west, Phil and Tracie Davis, both bankers from Charlotte, North Carolina, were on a dry run with their daughter, Ariel, 3. \"We just want to get a sense of how she is going to do in the crowds,\" said Tracie Davis. The couple had paid above the odds for a hotel room near the parade route - but did not manage to find tickets to the inauguration. No matter. \"We just came to soak it all in and so she will have a story to tell her grandchildren,\" Tracie Davis said. For guests with the means to secure a room at the luxury Willard Hotel, the atmosphere will come to them. The hotel is a mere two blocks from the White House, and offers a prime view of the parade route. Yesterday, each window along the route was draped with two flags. Anna Oginsky, who is from Michigan, booked rooms for her husband and three young children and her mother last October, even before Obama was elected. \"I just knew it was going to happen,\" she said. That sense of anticipation was building as the day wore on, and further west along Pennsylvania Avenue to number 1600, the address of the White House. The viewing stand, with its blue presidential seal and plexiglass windows, where Obama will watch the parade in his honour is complete. The stands for dignitaries have gone up. A few reminders of the George Bush era remain - like the protester shrouded in black with a sign reading: \"You boys sure know how to throw a blood bath.\" But by noon tomorrow, when Obama officially takes over as president, all that will be swept away. So too with Charlene Andrews's feeling of indifference towards the city where she was born and raised. For the first time, Andrews, who is 40, intends to see a presidential inauguration with her own eyes, and to take her son, Caleb, who is nine. The cafeteria of her workplace, a federal court house, has a magnificent view of the Capitol. Come 5am tomorrow morning, Andrews and her son will be on the Metro on the way there. \"I never felt a connection before,\" she said. \"I guess we take our city for granted, the fact that all this is around us.\" Tomorrow that will change for Andrews. \"This is so exciting,\" she said. \"I'm overwhelmed.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
