An internal police briefing note, published by Guardian Australia, showed Aboriginal drivers receive 3.2 times more fines issued during traffic stops than non-Aboriginal drivers, but slightly fewer than non-Aboriginal drivers in infringements issued by traffic cameras. The briefing note said an analysis of five years of traffic infringement data in WA showed a \u201cclear ethnic disparity\u201d in traffic fines issued by police, which contributed to a cycle of unpaid fines and was \u201clikely to lead to further police attention\u201d. WA police said they had not done anything in response to the briefing note, dated 13 February 2019, because reducing Aboriginal incarceration was a priority for Mark McGowan\u2019s government and therefore deciding on actions that could reduce Indigenous incarceration was a matter for cabinet. But Wyatt said that \u201cpolice can, and do, act on the findings of internal briefing notes, particularly around operational matters\u201d. The minister said he was not personally aware of the briefing note. \u201cHowever, I understand the broad issues captured in the note were raised with the cross-agency officers\u2019 group responsible for progressing the Aboriginal wellbeing target,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will be considered as part of the group\u2019s policy development going forward.\u201d Wyatt said he had been \u201cimpressed\u201d with the police commissioner Chris Dawson\u2019s efforts to date to improve the relationship between police and Aboriginal people. The briefing note states that an analysis of traffic infringements between 2010 and 2014 showed a \u201cclear ethnic disparity\u201d in police-initiated traffic stops. \u201cThese differences are large enough to suggest an uncomfortable distinction between automated camera and police-initiated traffic enforcement, with this distinction heavily correlated with Aboriginality,\u201d the briefing note said. \u201cIf the automated cameras are assumed to objectively reflect any actual differences in on-the-road behaviour, our data suggest that Aboriginal and non-Aborignal drivers are equally prone to breaking traffic laws.\u201d The trend was largely unchanged in data from January 2017 to mid-2018, when Aboriginal drivers still received more than three times as many penalty units from police stops than non-Aboriginal drivers, and roughly the same number from cameras. Dawson told Perth radio station 6PR on Thursday that there were \u201clessons to be learned\u201d from the report, but did not respond directly to questions about whether he believed WA Police targeted Aboriginal people. He pointed at the final lines of the report, which said the analysis \u201cby no means provide[s] conclusive evidence that deliberate bias exists.\u201d The report\u2019s author, Dr Geoffrey Barnes, told Guardian Australia that comment, which preceded a call for more research, was a standard caveat on all scientific research. Dawson told 6PR the report \u201cdoes cast doubt and we are continuing to work around it.\u201d He confirmed that the evidence-based policing unit, which produced the report, had been greatly reduced. \u201cI\u2019ve pared it right back \u2026 I have other priorities,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying it had no utility [but] I think it was over-emphasised for a moment in time.\u201d Nerita Waight, co-chair of the National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Legal Service, said the \u201cover-policing and profiling of Aboriginal people in Western Australia has been an ongoing problem for community.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, the inappropriate use of police discretion in these situations is not just a Western Australian problem, it is a problem across the entire country,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause police have broad discretionary powers they act as the gatekeepers on who enters the criminal legal system and how \u2026 \u201cBeing imprisoned, even if it\u2019s for a short amount of time, puts the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people at risk of being drawn into the quicksand of the criminal legal system, which can be deadly for them.\u201d The McGowan government last year introduced legislation to abolish the practice of jailing people for unpaid fines. That practice only applied to court fines, not traffic infringements, unless the infringement was dealt with before the court. The legislation, which is yet to pass parliament, would also allow authorities to garnish the salary of a person who has unpaid fines until the debt is cleared. It was prompted by the 2014 death in custody of the Yamatji woman Ms Dhu. Monique Hurley, a senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre, said racially motivated over-policing could cause \u201cenormous harm\u201d. \u201cThis data shows clearly that WA police have a serious racism problem,\u201d Hurley said. \u201cFor WA police and the WA government to just sit on their hands in the face of this stark injustice is inexcusable. A good government would take immediate action.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
