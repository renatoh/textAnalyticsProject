Cadbury, owned by the US confectionery group Mondel\u0113z International, said multipacks accounted for the biggest slice of its chocolate sales and the change would eliminate 10bn calories from the UK market in one fell swoop. The company said it was offering more portion control options by voluntarily committing to bring all Cadbury chocolate bars sold in multipacks under 200 calories by the end of 2021. The list of products being reduced in size includes Wispa Gold, Double Decker, Boost and Bournville Classic. However, there will be no change to the size of the bars sold individually. A spokesperson for Cadbury said: \u201cThe list price for these products will not be changing at this time. Retail pricing remains at the retailer\u2019s sole discretion.\u201d The practice of reducing product sizes but maintaining prices effectively increases their cost per ounce and is known as \u201cshrinkflation\u201d. The confectionery group has already promised to reduce the serving size of treats typically bought for children to under 100 calories by the end of this year with Fudge, Curly Wurly and Chomp bars among those to have already made the switch. Louise Stigant, the UK managing director at Mondel\u0113z International, said: \u201cWe recognise we must play our part in tackling obesity and are committed to doing so without compromising on consumer choice. A focus on portion control is recognised as one of the most effective ways of helping people balance their calorie intake.\u201d Measures to try and nudge the public into healthier food-buying habits are among policies being considered, in what has been billed a \u201cwar against obesity\u201d, being drawn up by Downing Street. Last week it was suggested that supermarkets in England could be stopped from placing chocolate and sweets as impulse purchases at the end of aisles. Cadbury has been reducing its portion sizes for several years, having introduced a 250-calorie cap on all single-serve chocolate bars in 2014 and a 98-calorie Cadbury Dairy Milk bar. Last year, the company launched Dairy Milk bars with 30% less sugar."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
