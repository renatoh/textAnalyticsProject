They may also subject you to some serious mindgames and some have been giving insights into the tricks they use to supposedly highlight the best candidates. Trent Innes, managing director of Australian accounting company Xero, bases his hiring decisions on what people do with their glass or coffee cup. \u201cYou can develop skills, you can gain knowledge and experience, but it really comes down to attitude,\u201d he recently told The Venture Podcast. \u201cAnd the attitude that we\u2019ve talked a lot about is the concept of \u2018wash your own coffee cup\u2019.\u201d Similar is the Wrapper Test, where a sweet wrapper is dropped by the door of the interview room and the candidate is judged on if they pick it up. This is supposed to provide insights into a person\u2019s selflessness and attention to detail. Another manager recently shared her way of weeding out those undeserving of a job: they don\u2019t send a thank-you email after the interview. Doing so indicates the person is \u201ceager, organised, and well-mannered\u201d, wrote Jessica Liebman, executive managing editor at Insider Inc, in a post for Business Insider that went viral: \u201cIt shows resourcefulness, too, because the candidate often has to hunt down an email address\u201d. Another CEO revealed to the New York Times that she texts prospective employees at 9pm or 11am on a Sunday, \u201cjust to see how fast you\u2019ll respond\u201d. Ruth Cornish, an HR expert, says trying to \u201chack\u201d recruitment is particularly common in fast-growing companies and tech businesses, \u201cwhere the culture is very strong. It is a way of identifying whether that person will fit: \u2018Are they right for our gang?\u2019\u201d The problem with such tricks, apart from them being potentially unethical, discriminatory and even unlawful, is that companies end up employing the same types of people. \u201cIt\u2019s not about diversity or inclusion. If you\u2019ve never been in a world of work before, or your family haven\u2019t, you may not know what etiquette is. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re not a talented person who can\u2019t do a wonderful job at that company.\u201d Claire McCartney, diversity and inclusion adviser at the HR industry body the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, says these tests seem to be an attempt to uncover people\u2019s values and behaviours, \u201cand there are ways that are much more based on evidence\u201d \u2013 for instance, asking candidates for examples of their integrity or their ability to work in a team. There is no rigour to reading into coffee cups and followup emails, says McCartney. \u201cPeople might respond differently for different reasons \u2013 they might be nervous about being interviewed. Not saying thank you to an interviewer doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not courteous.\u201d And, as Cornish points out, some employers find a followup email \u201ca bit desperate and annoying\u201d. For the candidate, these arbitrary tests \u2013 which can be as contrived as a challenge on The Apprentice \u2013 present more possibilities for post-interview angst. Was your prospective boss impressed when you picked up the greasy Greggs bag \u2013 or did you just make her uncomfortably aware that she works amid squalor?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
