Jasmine Pilbrow, 22, refused to take her seat on a flight in February last year that was headed from Melbourne to Darwin, from where the asylum seeker was expected to be deported to Sri Lanka. Another passenger also stood in protest once Pilbrow made others on the flight aware of the asylum seeker\u2019s situation. The asylum seeker was eventually escorted off the plane by police and returned to detention in Melbourne. Pilbrow was charged under the Civil Aviation Act for interference with a crew member of an aircraft and faces up to two years\u2019 imprisonment. The asylum seeker has since been deported back to Sri Lanka, according to Kumar Sinna, a Tamil community advocate and friend of Pilbrow\u2019s. Sinna said Pilbrow would plead not guilty on Friday. She will be supported in the Broadmeadows magistrates court by human rights advocates and representatives from the Tamil community, who will gather in a nearby park before the court case in a public display of support. \u201cShe is a little bit nervous but she still believes she stood up for justice and compassion,\u201d Sinna told Guardian Australia. \u201cThe Tamil community certainly believes it is a brave thing that she did and that she fought for justice. She has been heavily involved with the Tamil community and in helping asylum seekers in the past few years, so we really wish to support her.\u201d Last month the Dandenong Journal reported that about 20 Tamil asylum seekers living in the Greater Dandenong-Casey region of Victoria had been detained in recent weeks by Australian Border Force staff who raided their homes in the middle of the night. Sinna and other human rights advocates say that, despite a change in the Sri Lankan government last year, it remained unsafe for Tamils, who they say are still being detained. Human rights organisations have consistently raised concerns about Tamil asylum seekers being persecuted and tortured upon their return to Sri Lanka. \u201cThey are still facing abuse and disappearing,\u201d Sinna said. \u201cLeaving the country to seek asylum is illegal and those returned are dealt with by Sri Lanka\u2019s criminal investigation department, notorious for the rape and torture of Tamil men, women and children.\u201d Last month Australia\u2019s immigration minister, Peter Dutton, announced that the government had returned a group of Sri Lankan nationals to Sri Lanka after intercepting a boat with six asylum seekers on board. \u201cOur Sri Lankan partners provided advice that this vessel might be targeting Australia so we were ready and waiting to locate and detain the boat,\u201d Dutton said at the time. \u201cWe have worked cooperatively with Sri Lanka for several years now and, since Operation Sovereign Borders began in 2013, every Sri Lankan boat that has attempted to come to Australia illegally has failed. \u201cThis return shows that there has not been, and will not be, any change to Australia\u2019s robust border protection policies.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
