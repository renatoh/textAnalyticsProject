Those days are over. Evidence is mounting that mask-wearing restricts both the spread of coronavirus and the severity of its infection \u2013 but it was as far back as 3 April when America\u2019s Centres for Disease Control and Prevention issued a recommendation to mask up against the virus. Our sad, plagued times have since provoked numerous community authorities to oblige mask-wearing. Last weekend, Daniel Andrews called for Melburnians to start wearing a mask where social distancing wasn\u2019t possible. With the calls though has come resistance, especially in the US, and also pure drama. As the disease has also made a world where theatres are suddenly dark, it\u2019s little wonder guerrilla videos of anti-mask incidents radiate allure. The form is so familiar, the conflict clearly drawn. Cramming all the players into the hand-held frame of an iPhone is as close as anyone these days can get to the confines of a stage. Amid well-decorated sets \u2013 American retail spaces dominate the genre \u2013 is a theatrical message that costume really can mean everything. And the characterisations provide some of the most emotionally-committed performances any audience will live to see. There are grand speeches and clowning. A man in a supermarket wiped his nose and face on the security guard who informed him mask-wearing was a condition of entry. A woman filmed herself trashing a mask display, screaming. It looks like comedy, but the stakes are tragically high \u2013 and not only due to coronavirus. Anti-maskers have fought mandated public health orders with violence and assaults. In Michigan, there were arrests for a security guard\u2019s murder. It was a bus driver who was allegedly murdered by anti-maskers in France. It\u2019s the recent American incidents that stick in the mind though \u2013 perhaps because it\u2019s so hard to rationalise that a culture obsessed with Halloween, and whose seminal historical moment involved cosplaying colonists throwing tea in a harbour, has elements suddenly coy about putting a mask on. Maybe it\u2019s because the American president was still avowedly anti-mask six weeks after his own administration issued the prevention directive. He mocked others for wearing them, and said he didn\u2019t want to give the press the \u201cpleasure\u201d of seeing him in one. That line inverted this week when Trump was photographed masked-up on a hospital visit with a claim that masks \u201chave their time and place\u201d. What\u2019s changed? No one could accuse the same president, who only a month ago allowed #BlackLivesMatter protestors to be teargassed and forcibly moved on, of a sudden outbreak of consideration, nor one who claimed climate change was a hoax of a newfound respect for scientific advice. The Washington Post suggested vanity informed his original rejection of masks; did he perhaps notice the masks on political rivals Joe Biden, Nancy Pelosi and Tim Kaine made them look \u2026 rather badass? Numerous commentators have observed avowed anti-masking has come to signify allegiance to Trump in America\u2019s interminable cultural war, a rejection of instruction from those \u2013 like scientists \u2013 considered establishment, expert and elite. Scientific American identified a masculinist ideology among mask-refusing \u201cwhite men with epic swagger\u201d that seemed \u201cto view masks as emasculating face condoms\u201d. Only someone who has not been following Trumpism would believe there was no Venn overlap of the two positions. It certainly describes the tenor of the \u201csmall, loud\u201d crowd that rallied \u2013 overwhelmingly maskless \u2013 to see Trump in Tulsa. If \u201ccelluloid masculinity\u201d obliges men to put their lives at risk in the performance of the manly, the spike in coronavirus infections after that event was inevitable. Self-consciously macho Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro\u2019s Covid-positive fate is something of a case in point. The example of the Australian health minister aside, wearing masks for self-protection is hardly without association to the powerful. Mediaeval knights and samurai had faceplates for their helmets because protecting one\u2019s face from arrows was hardly considered effeminate; the US military confirmed in April it would be issuing masks to personnel. Of course, \u201cMasking your face makes you a big creampuff kitten man!\u201d is a valid critique to pose at a KKK meeting; I\u2019m quite sure no public Trumpist would struggle to obtain an invitation should they wish to try. It\u2019s analysis from social psychologists that furnish a more nuanced understanding of what mask refusals may symbolise. For Elliot Aronson and Carol Tavris, it\u2019s the behaviour of cognitive dissonance. Individual psychologies are desperate to reject any suggestion that ingrained beliefs \u2013 about the virus, gender, Trump, capitalism, expertise, the media or anything else \u2013 may indeed just be beliefs, not material truths. \u201cCoronavirus does not care about the news cycle\u201d has become a popular refrain. The painful \u2013 fatal \u2013 events it wreaks cannot be spun away. This is a confronting realisation. Our lives have been spent in a world where visible realities of poverty, cruelty and environmental destruction \u2013 the most powerful threats to our continued existence \u2013 have been hidden, minimised or ignored as the deliberate work of political opportunists, bad faith media actors and the armies of the PR industry. But again and again \u2013 as people, as voters, as consumers \u2013 we\u2019ve agreed to it. Masks antagonise because they represent the hard limit coronavirus has imposed on an ideological wilfulness that pretends we can perform our lives in a play of our choosing. We can\u2019t. What we\u2019d prefer to believe is irrelevant now; coronavirus can\u2019t be willed out of the script. The masks remind us \u201cwhat we owe to one another\u201d isn\u2019t an ideological choice any more. It\u2019s the basis for human survival. \u2022 Van Badham is a Guardian Australia columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
