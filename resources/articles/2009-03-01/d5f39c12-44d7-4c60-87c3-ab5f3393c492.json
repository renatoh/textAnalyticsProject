The horse who exploded into the racing consciousness 12 months ago when he ran away with the Queen Mother Champion Chase duly won the race for a second time, at odds of 4\u201311, yesterday and while it was no more than a businesslike performance, he is now just a 4\u20131 chance to win the next two renewals as well. No one expected Master Minded to win as he did in 2008. Displays like that come along once a decade at best. Yet as a six-year-old, he is still so young that there were those at Cheltenham who hoped he might even improve on it. In truth, it was far too much to expect. Instead, we got the equivalent of a boxer outclassing a rival inside two rounds, a clinical, controlled dispatch of the moderate opposition that was left once horses like Voy Por Ustedes, the 2007 Champion Chase winner, had opted to duck the challenge. But it was another step on the road to history too. Only Badsworth Boy has won the Champion Chase three times, and Master Minded is 11\u201310 with Hills (but as short as 4\u20137 with some bookies) to move alongside him next year, and 4\u20131 with the same firm to make it four in 2011. \"We want to look after this horse,\" Paul Nicholls, his trainer, said. \"This is what racing wants, horses like this to run year after year. He may not have been as impressive today as he was when he won last year but we know him better now. We want to win nicely but also leave plenty in the tank for the future.\" Barry Geraghty, on Petit Robin, was the only rival to mount any challenge to the favourite, although the veteran Well Chief, having his first start since April 2007, ran on well in the closing stages to finish second. \"Barry put the gun to my head down the hill, and I really had to go for it over the second last,\" Ruby Walsh, Master Minded's jockey, said. \"That's a trappy fence, you'd prefer to be going down there on your own and having a look at it, but that's championship racing and it's do or die. \"You'd trust this horse with your life, he's so sure of what he's doing. At one of the fences down the back, I asked him for a big one and he changed his mind, but you probably didn't notice because he was so quick at it.\" Master Minded is expected to have one more start this season, but not at Aintree, where he was beaten in the Melling Chase last year. \"He needs to be fresh,\" Nicholls said. \"Sandown or Punchestown [in April] could be a possibility, but the ground could be too quick for him by then.\" Walsh's success on Master Minded completed one of the finest afternoons of his career, on a day when Ireland dominated the rest of the card. The Champion Chase was his third win of the day, after the success of Mikael D'Haguenet in the Ballymore Properties Novice Hurdle and Cooldine in the RSA Chase. All three of Walsh's winners started favourite, and there were football-style chants of \"Ruby, Ruby\" as he came home in isolation on Cooldine, completing a double for Willie Mullins in the process. Cooldine jumped with such fluency and assurance that it was clear he was going to win from the top of the hill, and while Mikael D'Haguenet had to work a little harder to hold off the charge of Karabak, he too jumped with a precision that promises much when he goes over fences next season. \"We thought that if he jumped and got there, very few horses would stay with him,\" Mullins said of Cooldine. \"He's always shown me out-and-out stamina and a battle is what he loves. \"We'll probably go back to Punchestown, but I'd look forward to bringing him back here for the Gold Cup.\" Totesport offer 10-1 about Cooldine for next year's Gold Cup, while Mikael D'Haguenet is the same price with Hills for next year's RSA Chase. \"Ruby said he was a machine after he got off him at Naas [in January], he said he could be a Gold Cup winner of the future, and after today I don't see any reason why we shouldn't aim that way,\" Mullins said. \"Chasing is what he was bought for, so this is a bonus.\" Mullins has now matched Vincent O'Brien and Tom Dreaper, the only other Irish trainers to saddle three winners at a single Festival. Ireland now has eight winners at the meeting, two short of the all-time record, after victories for Ninetieth Minute, in the Coral Cup, and Dunguib, who saw off Mullins' eight-strong challenge in the Champion Bumper. Walsh, inevitably, is now all but unbackable to finish the meeting as top jockey, while he needs to add two more winners to his four so far to set a new record. Robert Thornton, however, may struggle to take his rides today after he was taken to Cheltenham General Hospital for tests after he was kicked in the stomach in a fall from Big Zeb in the Champion Chase."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
