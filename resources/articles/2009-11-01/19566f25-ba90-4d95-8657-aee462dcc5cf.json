All week the talk had been of England stealing South African-born players but in the end it was the little redhead they pinched from Ireland who won the night. Those ubiquitous friends of ours, Duckworth/Lewis, may have had the final say but it was Morgan's 45-ball 85 not out that propelled England to their highest score in the short history of Twenty20 internationals, three days after they had been bowled out for 89 in a practice game. Even after scoring 202 for six the England players might have recalled that their previous best score, 200 against India in Durban two years ago, was ultimately overhauled. When South Africa responded, Loots Bosman threatened to match Morgan, hitting 58 from 31 balls, with five fours and four sixes. South Africa were more than halfway home at 107 for two after 10 overs. But when rain finished the match they still required 76 runs from seven overs and England would have considered themselves the marginal favourites. At the end England's bowling hero was Jimmy Anderson, who conceded six runs off what turned out to be the final over; South Africa had needed only two more for victory. England's captain, Paul Collingwood, said: \"It was a great comeback after Tuesday. I knew we were a lot better than that and the boys knew it too. It was a great wicket with the ball coming on to the bat. Some of the shots Morgan played were exceptional. There was some fantastic hitting in the closing overs. [Jonathan] Trott gave us a solid base. And when the rain came we won a game within a game. England's innings got off to the worst possible start when Joe Denly was lbw to the first ball of the match, a marginal decision with the ball possibly clipping leg stump. It did not get any better for a while. Alastair Cook, passed fit after withdrawing from the nets with a sore throat the day before, scored 11 off eight balls before he, too, was lbw, advancing down the wicket to Ryan McLaren. Trott, though, seemed in the mood to make the same sort of impact that Kevin Pietersen made on his debut summer out here five years ago. He hit Dale Steyn, South Africa's fastest bowler, for four fours in as many deliveries. But after he had scored 33 from 25 deliveries he hesitated over a quick single and was run out. England were looking vulnerable at 61 for three after seven overs. But then Morgan and Collingwood added 98 in nine overs, with the Irishman dominating the stand. They put on 50 from 31 deliveries, Morgan raising the landmark by flicking Steyn into a block of flats behind the backward square-leg boundary. Then he hit another over long-on as he tore to his fifty from 29 balls. England stuttered when Collingwood was fourth out at 159 in the 17th over, driving to long-off for a fine 32-ball 57, and it seemed that they had blown their chances of reaching 200. But it was Morgan who once again came to the rescue, flicking a delivery from Charl Langeveldt over long- leg for six before hitting his next ball over backward square-leg for another to raise the 200. England came here debilitated by injury, illness and non-availability. But they won a memorable night."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
