If it happens in Surrey", "bodyText": "\u2022 A fascinating new development in the ongoing saga of the BBC and its description of waterboarding as a \"harsh interrogation technique\". A group including former World at One presenter Jack Pizzey have been agitating to have the practice plainly described as torture. The new head of news, James Harding, being a good sort with \u2013 thus far \u2013 clean hands in this regard, moves to explain the policy. We do call waterboarding torture in some instances, he says, citing a case in Surrey where a pensioner was so abused and the practice was so described. But for the most part, when the issue is waterboarding at Guant\u00e1namo Bay, the phrase \"harsh interrogation technique\" is used, reflecting the complexities there, including the past view of US administrators \u2013 stretching back to Dubya Bush \u2013 that waterboarding is not torture. Pizzey is happy to have received an answer, but unimpressed by what it says. \"If it's torture when burglars inflict it on an old lady in Surrey, how can it not be torture when the CIA et al inflict it on their prisoners?\" And what if the CIA took to waterboarding in Surrey? \u2022 The big names litter the Tory party conference, but none bigger than Alastair Campbell, who is there to promote his charities, big up his book, and generally annoy the faithful. As ever he makes his presence felt, and who dared question him as he swept into the Telegraph party, leaving stragglers in his wake. \"Labour doesn't queue,\" he was heard to say. \u2022 And as Michael Gove is cheered to the rafters in Manchester, reinforcing once again his credentials for a leadership bid should PM Dave come to grief, one is reminded that there is no bloodier political battlefield than education. There is just no escape from it. And this became clear to one diary reader, a mother, who was engaged in the perfectly innocuous practice of reading her son a bedtime story, when the narrative led them to a wordsearch. It wasn't the most difficult wordsearch, and pretty soon one line jumped out at them: \"Toby Young's Stupid Face.\" The boy didn't understand at first, but doesn't that show the value of parents reading to their children. The mother, through her giggles, was on hand to explain. \u2022 The book, The Pirates! in an Adventure with the Romantics, is by Gideon Defoe, and yet we could find no history of bad blood between him and the combative Tory blogger/free-school pioneer. So we asked the author, how did this happen? A complete accident, he told us. \"The line that looks like it says 'tobyyoungs' is just a random collection of letters. It's always an unfortunate risk when putting together a wordsearch, a bit like when the letters on Countdown accidentally spell 'IDS IS A FUCKNUCKLE'.\" So, no enmity at all? \"No personal enmity,\" he said. \"Beyond the fact that, you know, it's Toby Young, and he's a terrible, terrible man.\" We could have dug deeper but in the circumstances, that does seem reasonable. \u2022 Finally, a sadness, but things do seem to be going south for Ukip, now that the spotlight shines brightly. Not just the decision of talisman Godfrey Bloom to walk away, but also more accusations of Carry On-style racial stumbling by a party spokesman, and then the beastliness of newspapers that ran a picture of Nigel Farage positioned behind a microphone, so as to appear that he was sporting a Hitler moustache. The luck seems to be draining away, as do those fairweather friends. And we can't help wondering how much of this is connected to Farage's decision to elevate that Diary favourite Neil \"liar and a cheat\" Hamilton to a position of importance within the party. The new deputy chair told Marlborough News Online: \"My task is to win the European elections and win big. A massive Ukip win next May will be the avalanche which engulfs the Lib/Lab/Con in the 2015 general election and paves the way for the restoration of our national independence. We will change the political landscape for ever.\" But then, he ever was supremely confident of his abilities. Poor Ukip. They rise or fall with Neil Hamilton. If that isn't meltdown, what is?
