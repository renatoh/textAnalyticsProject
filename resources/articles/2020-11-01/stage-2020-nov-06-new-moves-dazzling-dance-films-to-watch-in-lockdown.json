Cold Genius has dancer Matt Foley in a flesh-coloured leotard tending towards the absurd, his bouncing, bending, quivering and tip-toeing body (choreographed by Drew Jacoby) lent gravitas by the intense, authoritative bass-baritone Justin Hopkins watching over him in an empty theatre, singing Purcell\u2019s What Power Art Thou. It\u2019s peculiarly compelling. FLTPK US choreographer Trey McIntyre has had an eventful lockdown. He moved continents, to London, and set up the online dance platform FLTPK, premiering new short dance films from different choreographers every fortnight. McIntrye\u2019s own opening film Who Am I Here? is a smart take on the \u201cdancers practising in their living rooms\u201d theme; another, Hysterical, sees the Royal Ballet\u2019s Joshua Junker living out that title trapped inside a giant bright yellow inflatable. Pablo Paris Satie For the peaceful blue sky and view over the Paris rooftops as much as anything, this solo from Paris Opera Ballet dancer Pablo Legasa is like pressing the reset button on your day. The music is Satie\u2019s dreamy Gnossienne No 1, the mood is understated, the choreography modest but it\u2019s enough to savour Legasa\u2019s dancerly bearing and faraway gaze. POB\u2019s director Aur\u00e9lie Dupont can also been seen looking divine against an empty sky, dancing Martha Graham in the film Breathing. Rosetta A slickly made (pre-pandemic) short from Ukweli Roach and BirdGang, filmed by Colin Emerson. Set to the eponymous track by electro-soul singer Kyan, there\u2019s a simple idea behind it \u2013 I won\u2019t describe it in full, but suffice to say it gives you a couple of perspectives on the same moves and you\u2019ll soon notice that the glitchy popping of the dancers\u2019 bodies doesn\u2019t always seem to be going in a natural direction ... The Same Space More multiple perspectives in Peter Leung\u2019s The Same Space for Dutch National Ballet. This is perfect for anyone frustrated by online viewing because you\u2019re stuck with someone else\u2019s directorial choices \u2013 here there are three camera angles and you can switch between them as you watch the meditative 19-minute piece play out. The online player is frustratingly small but it\u2019s an interesting proposition for the future of digital dance. Five dancers, three empty cubes, myriad possibilities. Dwell.in.g A creative response to everyone being stuck at home in the first wave of the pandemic, frustratingly still pertinent. Choreographer Rebecca Evans and Pell Ensemble sent projectors into the homes of residents in Waltham Forest, north-east London, loaded with films of solo dancers. The recipients (none of them professional dancers) then filmed themselves interacting with the projection, with some ingenious results, and a sweet turn from a toddler chasing a tiny dancer across the wall."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
