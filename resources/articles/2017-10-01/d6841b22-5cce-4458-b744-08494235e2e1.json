Their message: stay silent and obey. \u201cThey told me not to give any interviews ... and asked me to sign a letter of commitment to ensure I wouldn\u2019t get them into any trouble,\u201d the Beijing-based human rights lawyer recalled of the visit he received from members of China\u2019s vast \u201cstability maintenance\u201d apparatus. Yu, an outspoken attorney, is one of hundreds, possibly thousands of Chinese activists and petitioners coming under pressure in the run-up to a key political summit \u2013 the 19th Communist party congress \u2013 which kicks off in the capital on Wednesday. Beijing wants no surprises during the twice-a-decade gathering, which marks the end of Xi Jinping\u2019s first five-year term as China\u2019s top leader, and in recent weeks security agents have been fanning out across the country to quell even the slightest hint of dissent. Many government critics, like Yu, have been placed under increased surveillance and instructed to keep a low profile. \u201cI\u2019m under severe control. I can feel the tension,\u201d said the attorney, who has claimed he was tortured during a three-month stint in custody in 2015. A police car has been stationed outside Yu\u2019s house. Li Wenzu, the wife of another campaigning lawyer, Wang Quanzhang, who vanished into secret custody more than two years ago and has yet to emerge, was staying at her parents\u2019 home in Hubei province when police burst in to question her. \u201cI\u2019ve been under close scrutiny 24 hours a day here,\u201d she complained. Others are being forced to leave their homes altogether as part of a long-standing security scheme designed to silence objectors during sensitive occasions such as political summits or anniversaries of the 1989 Tiananmen massacre. Hu Jia, perhaps the most outspoken political activist still living in mainland China, said agents had told him he would be forcibly \u201ctravelled\u201d from his Beijing home in the coming days. \u201cPerhaps they will send me somewhere remote,\u201d said Hu, who has been under almost constant guard since June. Authorities have also tried to convince Li Heping \u2013 another crusading rights lawyer who emerged from secret detention in May \u2013 to leave town by offering him an all expenses paid holiday. \u201cWe said no,\u201d said his wife, Wang Qiaoling. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t spend a single penny of theirs \u2013 it\u2019s taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d When Xi took control of the world\u2019s largest authoritarian state, in 2012, some hoped he might prove a Gorbachev-style reformer who would usher in a period of political relaxation. The opposite has occurred. Under Xi, dissenters have been pursued with a determination not seen in decades. Hundreds of attorneys, including Yu and Li, have been targeted as part of the so-called \u201cwar on law\u201d; liberal academics, bloggers, church leaders and feminist activists have been thrown in jail or have fled abroad to escape the repression. Campaigners expect the congress\u2019 temporary \u201cstability maintenance\u201d measures to subside once delegates return home. But few expect the broader crackdown to ease. Some fear it might even escalate as Xi \u2013 who some call China\u2019s most powerful leader since Mao \u2013 enters his second term in a position of even greater political strength. \u201cThis crackdown has been going on for a long time and seems to really represent a vision of how society should be \u2013 that it should fall into line and should be unified. So I don\u2019t expect a significant let-up after the congress,\u201d said Andrew Nathan, a Columbia University political scientist and expert in Chinese human rights issues. Wang Wen, a pro-party scholar from a think tank affiliated to Beijing\u2019s Renmin University, defended the clampdown, claiming China needed \u201cauthority\u201d as Xi battled to simultaneously achieve development, reform and, crucially, \u201csocial stability\u201d. \u201cYes, I agree that lawyers, journalists, they face a few difficulties. But the problem is that special times, special periods, need special conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cYes, we like liberty. We need democracy. We need a liberal free press. Of course. They are all very good. But the problem is the timing,\u201d Wang added. Nathan said Xi\u2019s crackdown was driven by a sense among party leaders that they were under siege from a disparate coalition of political foes including Tibetans, Hong Kongers, Xinjiang Uighurs, Taiwanese and Americans. The offensive would continue in the medium term, he predicted. But in the long run it was a perilous tactic: \u201cThe way [Xi\u2019s first term] leaves me feeling in the end is: \u2018Why is he cracking down so hard? What is he afraid of? And how can that amount of tension in society last?\u2019\u201d \u201cIt leaves me feeling as though this level of social crackdown is not sustainable. Because people, in the end, have some kind of self-respect.\u201d Additional reporting by Wang Zhen"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
