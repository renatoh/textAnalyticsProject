Kudrow had just finished playing the part of Phoebe Buffay in Friends, and King had ended his run as director, writer and executive producer for Sex and the City. They had known each other for years and now they were considering working together. It should have been a match made in TV heaven but Kudrow brought a little bit of TV hell along to that lunch date, too. \u201cHe said: \u2018I don\u2019t imagine you want to do another show,\u2019 and I said: \u2018No,\u2019\u201d Kudrow recalls. \u201cThe only thing I would want to do was this \u2026 \u201d She then assumed the persona of a very different sort of performer: a jaded, craven, fading TV star, driven a little screwy by fame. \u201cShe\u2019s really phoney,\u201d Kudrow says. \u201cShe\u2019s so desperate to be in the spotlight, and she\u2019s missed it so much. She had this weird, continental-ish, theatre-y accent.\u201d Kudrow\u2019s character was not a new creation. It pre-dated Friends, and was something she had come up with while training with the Groundlings improvisational comedy troupe in Los Angeles. \u201cWe would do these character monologues,\u201d she says. \u201cI had one called \u2018Your favourite actress on a talkshow\u2019 \u2013 I didn\u2019t even give her a name.\u201d King loved the performance. \u201cThis character was so completely unaware of reality and, basically, her own ego,\u201d he says. \u201cI started laughing and we started talking.\u201d \u201cThree hours later, we had a TV show,\u201d says Kudrow. King knew that it would be difficult to make a successful show about a TV star to whom viewers could still relate. However, there was another type of programme that had been picking up ratings. \u201cIt was the dawn of reality TV and, in the writers\u2019 rooms, people were freaking out,\u201d he says. \u201cI remember season one or two of [US reality show] The Amazing Race,\u201d says Kudrow. \u201cI saw a married couple given a challenge where she had to eat such spicy food that she could barely swallow. She was vomiting and crying while her husband was screaming at her: \u2018Finish it!\u2019 I thought: \u2018That\u2019s the most humiliating thing I\u2019ve ever seen.\u2019 And it was on national television.\u201d Together they came up with an equally humiliating formula, pairing Lisa\u2019s blowsy old actor persona with this violent new format to create The Comeback, perhaps the best comedy about television in the 21st century. The first season, which aired on HBO in 2005, followed the tribulations of Valerie Cherish (Kudrow), a hapless LA actor who, having starred in a sitcom during the late-80s and early-90s, tries to find fame again, not only by signing up to play the part of a cranky old aunt in a second-rate teen sitcom, but also by agreeing to a reality show documenting her attempt to make it back on to the small screen. The series is presented as found footage from that reality show. \u201cThe Office came first,\u201d Kudrow admits. \u201cI was a fan; it definitely informed it.\u201d Despite its loose, apparently improvised feel, this new show was actually heavily scripted by Kudrow and King. \u201cWe wrote it out, right down to the \u2018Ah, ah, ah\u2019 pauses in speech,\u201d he says. Those lines were quite unlike anything Kudrow had performed on Friends. \u201cFriends was joke-driven,\u201d she says. \u201cThis didn\u2019t have that; it didn\u2019t have to be hilarious every second.\u201d Indeed, The Comeback\u2019s own fake sitcom, Room and Bored, enabled the show to satirise the crummy comedies that were once the mainstay of American broadcast TV. King says there was one show from the early-90s that he had in mind. \u201cIt was called Down the Shore,\u201d he says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much the quality of the writing, which was fine, it was that they were trying to pretend they were on the ocean, with the ocean in the background as a drop; that felt so fake to me.\u201d Kudrow feels the parody was much broader and, at the same time, more acute. \u201cThere were so many of those comedies that had two-dimensional characters and weren\u2019t that funny,\u201d she says. \u201cSometimes the writers just seemed to hate the audience. I remember saying to writers, on earlier shows \u2013 not Friends \u2013 \u2018Wouldn\u2019t it be better, if this happened or that happened\u2019, and they\u2019d be like: \u2018No that doesn\u2019t matter. The audience is just stupid. I thought: \u2018No, that\u2019s not right.\u2019\u201d The true villain of The Comeback is Room and Bored\u2019s writer Paulie G (played by Lance Barber), a bro\u2019-ish bully who delights in ridiculing Valerie. Watching the show today, it is hard not to see his treatment of Kudrow\u2019s character as a wider comment on media misogyny, but she is reluctant to accept that label. \u201cWe didn\u2019t call it that,\u201d she says, \u201cthat was just the truth, the reality; that\u2019s just the way it is.\u201d \u201cTV writers perceived any woman over 40 as not fuckable,\u201d says King. \u201cIt\u2019s in the DNA of many, many writers\u2019 rooms. The show is the closest thing to my experience in writing rooms, with male energy and the sophomoric madness that happens when people are trapped, trying to do a series.\u201d Much of the first season\u2019s spark lay in the way Valerie\u2019s old-school brassy resilience was worn thin by Paulie G\u2019s coarser approach. In fact, Kudrow believes the uneasy reception the show met when it was first aired came from the discomfort male viewers experienced watching so raw a depiction of male-on-female cruelty. \u201cThe feedback from that first season was that it was really hard to watch,\u201d says Kudrow. \u201cI think for men especially it was really uncomfortable. I was aware that it was mainly straight, white guys who couldn\u2019t watch it.\u201d King also thinks that Valerie was a challenge for audiences but the reason was because she was too nuanced. \u201cMost comedy is built on archetypes,\u201d he says, \u201cand in most TV comedies, the female archetypes were very, very limited. There was the sexy young one that everyone wanted to have sex with, and then there was the kooky, older one, who was over the hill. You weren\u2019t both.\u201d Despite respectable viewing figures \u2013 \u201cIt was getting about the same as Entourage got in their first year,\u201d says Kudrow \u2013 the show was cancelled. And then something quite odd happened: after it came off the air, viewers and critics alike began to reassess The Comeback. \u201cThey actually published revised reviews,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was rare; it was crazy rare!\u201d In 2014, 10 years after that first lunch date, when reality shows had all but conquered daytime TV and The Comeback\u2019s reputation had been restored, a second season aired, with Valerie cast in another fictional production \u2013 Seeing Red, an HBO dramatisation of her tortuous experience filming Room and Bored \u2013 and again simultaneously working on a reality production. \u201cWhen we did the second season, we addressed HBO and streaming services and where Valerie had gone,\u201d says King. \u201cShe was angry, an alcoholic and she didn\u2019t have to smile. She was dark, and the joke was for us: Valerie was being forced to be dark when all she wanted to be was light and loved. She was being hated; she became a success. That\u2019s where television is now.\u201d Despite this darkness, the second series may actually make for easier viewing; it certainly met with greater conventional success. It was, King admits, as if the world had caught up with Valerie and her hapless ambitions. \u201cValerie is my cautionary tale of choosing fame over family,\u201d says King. \u201cIt\u2019s just one of my scariest thoughts, that someone would choose this illusive thing over the real people in their lives.\u201d Unfortunately, the death of one of those very real people in King and Kudrow\u2019s life may mean we won\u2019t see a third series of The Comeback. The actor and dramatist Robert Michael Morris had been King\u2019s theatre teacher at college, before becoming a professional actor later in life. Morris had retired by the time The Comeback was casting, but King more or less wrote the part of Mickey, Valerie\u2019s hairdresser and best friend, for him, and convinced Morris to come out of retirement to perform on the show. Despite a spell of ill health, Morris reprised the role in the second season, but died in the spring of 2017. Kudrow says she really cannot see how she could make another series. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing funny about that, and you have to address it,\u201d she sighs. So is his passing preventing her from considering another series? \u201cIt is right now,\u201d she says. King, despite having known Morris for longer, is a little more sanguine. \u201cTelevision is always evolving,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can always put Valerie\u2019s head in the window and then slam it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
