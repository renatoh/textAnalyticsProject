Geoffrey Vos QC, acting on behalf of SMG, told the court that Mr Evans' behaviour leading up to his sacking in June 2001 proved \"materially adverse\" to SMG's business. SMG, the owner of Virgin Radio, was defending its decision to sack Chris Evans from the station's breakfast show during the first day of court action brought by the TV and radio star. Mr Evans is suing the company for damages and for compensation for share options he lost when he was fired after an alleged six day drinking spree. \"It is so obvious that Mr Evans' conduct - not turning up for work, sacking his team, putting in place a new team of lesser quality, appearing drunk every day in the papers, cocking a snook at Virgin Radio - is so damaging to [SMG's] business,\" claimed Mr Vos. He alleged that Mr Evans continually ignored the station's wishes and caused \"chaos\" live on air, damaging relationships with advertisers and harming SMG's business. He told Mr Justice Lightman that SMG's business depended on advertising, and Mr Evans' public attacks on Virgin Radio's management affected the advertising and the station's ratings, and as a result adversely affected the company's share price. \"What could be more damaging than the public face of the station saying in public that the management is incompetent and he is having nothing else to do with them?\" asked Mr Vos. SMG's lawyer claimed that Mr Evans breached both his presenter's contract with Virgin Radio and the terms of an agreement his Kent Farm holding company had with the station. He said that Mr Evans obstructed Virgin Radio's publicity efforts because the star would only take part in interviews and photo-shoots when he wanted to. \"Mr Evans was required by contract to give interviews, but only did so when it suited him,\" said Mr Vos. Mr Evans' lawyer, Christopher Pymont QC, had earlier said, in relation to SMG's complaint that Mr Evans failed to take part in publicity, that the star thought it was \"frankly absurd\". Mr Pymont recounted the time that Mr Evans was asked to do a Radio Times photo shoot with a host of other high-profile radio presenters. \"He was told everybody else was doing it [the Radio Times photo shoot] and his response was 'that's exactly why I shouldn't'.\" But Mr Vos also told the court that Mr Evans had made it difficult for Virgin Radio to sell promotions to clients because he often took it upon himself to change them live on air without consulting either the station or their clients. \"He made it hard to sell sponsorships and promotions. He said he knew best and was permitted to change promotions on air. \"Virgin Radio had to agree with clients the mechanic of the promotion, but if it is agreed to use a particular mechanic and the presenter chooses to change it, there is chaos caused and very unhappy advertisers,\" Mr Vos added. Mr Pymont had earlier told the court Mr Evans' version of the events that took place the week he was sacked. On June 20, Mr Evans finished his show and stayed on at the station in the belief that a meeting had been arranged with management, but no one came to see him. He feared he was about to get the sack and \"took it very hard\", said Mr Pymont. \"What he did was to go out and get very drunk, with the consequence that the following day he was not able to attend Virgin Radio and do the show.\" When his agent Michael Foster contacted Virgin Radio a few days later, he said he was told they wanted Evans off the breakfast show, said Mr Pymont. They said they did not want to see him at the studios on the following Monday. Virgin Radio then offered Evans a \u00a33 million payoff - but this was rejected, said Mr Pymont. Mr Foster asked for \u00a36 million to \u00a37 million but no agreement was reached with SMG. Mr Pymont said the allegations against Mr Evans in the case had been pursued with \"ferocity\" and \"even lurid vehemence\". He said: \"The sort of allegations that are being put forward are that Mr Evans behaved with overbearing arrogance, that he blackmailed Virgin Radio into changing the format of the show, that he was carrying on a vendetta against Mr Pearson and Mr Hain [Bobby Hain, head of SMG Radio]. \"That he was indifferent to the interests of Virgin Radio, an indifference which developed into contempt and ultimately degenerated into open and aggressive defiance.\" Counsel submitted that Mr Evans had been \"fairly brutally sacked\" without being given any chance to put his case. The case continues tomorrow and will open with Mr Evans taking the witness stand. Mr Evans is claiming some \u00a38.6m in share options was withheld after his contract with Virgin was terminated, following a highly publicised and acrimonious bust-up with his former bosses. He is also claiming damages for a breach of breakfast show contract. SMG is counter-suing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
