The tale of a delusional wannabe auteur failing to get his inane short film off the ground, Will Farrell and Ben Rowse\u2019s four-parter shows there\u2019s life in the mockumentary yet, particularly when showcasing the talents of a veritable who\u2019s who of creative British comedy. The 15-minute episodes style themselves a behind-the-scenes \u201cmaking of\u201d offered exclusively to the film\u2019s crowdfunders. But it\u2019s soon clear that no movie will ever get made. Santini (played by one half of The Pin, Alex Owen) has a pretentious title, of which he is absurdly proud \u2013 but little else to go on. We watch as he appoints an underqualified producer, assembles (and proceeds to bemuse) a writers\u2019 room, and lords it over a succession of auditionees. All the while throwing needy, David Brent-alike gazes at the camera, keener to promote himself than make the actual film. No one\u2019s stretching themselves in character terms: \u201cPlaying a deluded narcissist called Alex,\u201d as Owen deadpans in the publicity, \u201cwas the biggest acting challenge of my career.\u201d But that\u2019s part of the charm: the sitcom depicts a world of unpaid, labour-of-love creative projects, of which its creators have (painful, one might guess) personal experience. Its pleasures come from the desperate situations Farrell and Rowse engineer, as when hapless producer Adam (Adam Drake) accidentally squanders two grand of his own money in a poorly conceived bid to save face. And from the bathetic dialogue, awkward silences and minute physical business improvised by the fantastic cast. These include Drake\u2019s sidekicks in the sketch trio Tarot, Kath Hughes and Ed Easton, and Ghosts stars Katy Wix and Lolly Adefope \u2013 the latter as an innocent house-hunter legally duped into acting in Santini\u2019s film. Our antihero\u2019s delusions are spiralling skywards by now, as the sitcom presses everyone else\u2019s dismayed reaction shots into service time and time again. Fair enough: Santini is a berk, and his misadventures in film-making are cringingly funny. \u2022 Petrichor is available on YouTube."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
