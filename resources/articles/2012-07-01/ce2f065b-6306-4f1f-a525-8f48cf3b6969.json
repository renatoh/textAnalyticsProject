Several people close to Black, a prodigious art collector who has a $3.4bn fortune, identified him as the mystery buyer of the 1895 painting, according to the Wall Street Journal. Black, who owns works by old masters and impressionists, serves on the boards of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art, and helped fund a biography of Pablo Picasso. The version of The Scream he purportedly owns is one of only four versions of the work in existence and widely regarded as the best. It is the only version of the work not in an Oslo museum. Sold in a 12-minute auction in May, the piece is the only version of the work whose frame was hand-painted by Munch to include his poem explaining the work's inspiration. The artist described himself \"shivering with anxiety\" and feeling \"the great scream in nature\". The painting was sold by Norwegian businessman Petter Olsen, whose father was a friend and patron of the artist. Simon Shaw, head of Sotheby's Impressionist and Modern Art in New York, said the work was one of the most important to ever emerge from private hands on to the open market. Before its sale, Picasso's Nude, Green Leaves and Bust (1932), held the record for the most expensive painting sold at auction, fetching $106,482,500 in 2010."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
