Charles Dickens used to compose his stories like symphonies, touching each bold emotional note in turn to create a sweepingly resonant whole, albeit one full of irritating orphans. The Terry saga was the opposite: a yowling, sawing nightmare that seemed to be pressing all the buttons on its Roland synthesiser at once. Even now Fabio Capello has mercifully taken his hammer to the thing, my head is a clanging bell. My moral compass is helicoptering. I'm still worried about lots of things. First I'm worried about the effects of this on those who had previously seen the England captain as a \"role model\". For these people being a bit like John Terry isn't enough. Only being exactly like John Terry will do, and I still fully expect not just an epidemic of popular adultery, but an epidemic of adultery specifically involving ex-girlfriends of Wayne Bridge. This is the threat now to our children's children. I'm also worried that we all decided so readily the captaincy was \"a decision for Fabio Capello\", and that Capello has been forced to spend his week discussing the politics of dating with his assistant, Franco Baldini, like a pair of screechy New York singletons sitting in a booth at Dr Fagulous's Bagel Boutique talking about \"the rules\" and saying things like \"Omigod they were totally on a break\". Capello's \"full disclosure\" conversation with Terry yesterday is almost too appalling to contemplate. This is what we do to England managers. I'm worried also that I seem to be the only person who thinks John Terry did a bad thing that's different from the bad thing everyone else is calling a bad thing. I keep thinking I've hallucinated a crucial detail in all this: the fact that it's Wayne Bridge's ex-girlfriend who has now become Terry's rather sulky-looking Delilah. En ex. A girlfriend who has ceased to be. But still within the ossified sexual politics of football the big issue is how Bridgey feels. Bridgey. Our thoughts are all with Bridgey right now. This is confusing. I always thought the thing with your ex-girlfriend going out with one of your mates was that you had to just suck it up and pretend you're not bothered, even though you might actually feel sick with illogical jealousy. Not so in football where the sacred bond of \"being mates\" is apparently more important than other popular bonds, like the one that involves being married, and where Bridge's ex-girlfriend is seen as his private chattel. It's as though Terry has borrowed his bike without asking, or pushed the button on the fruit machine when it's not his go. For this offence Terry has now been sacked as England captain. Because the debate about this has centred on surreal and confused rhetoric about moral leadership and the idea of being \"inspirational\" through feisty shouting, no doubt many people will now adopt the fashionable view that we all take the England captaincy far too seriously, and that reverence for the armband is some kind of national idiot-disease. This is only half right. It is precisely because the England captaincy only matters in a ceremonial, totemic way that Capello has done the right thing. There is no moral dimension here, just the irresistible, enduring chintz of pageantry. Being England captain is like being the man who gets asked to dress up as Santa Claus at Christmas time. It's all about warm, fuzzy, nostalgic \u2013 and perhaps silly \u2013 feelings of reverence. But these are still powerful emotions; and you need some sense they're being handled gently by the kind of person you might be happy to share a long car journey with or ask to feed your cat while you're in Devon. Essentially, the England captaincy should be awarded to the player you'd most like to receive a reassuring and muscular hug from. Until recently this was Terry, who I believe would hug you unconditionally and vigorously, even though he knows you sort of hate him for his boisterous amour-propre. This is no longer the case. You worry Terry might hold on slightly too long."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
