Made from the same grape variety as Rioja (tempranillo, which is known in this area as tinto fino), it's a deftly oaked red that has a glossiness of texture and plenty of bright red and black fruit. Terra d'Alter Alfrocheiro, Alentejo, Portugal 2011 (\u00a39.95, or \u00a38.95 as part of a case, Lea &amp; Sandeman) An Australian, Peter Bright, is behind this wine, although given that he's been making wine in Portugal for 30 years, he probably counts as an honourary native by now, and the ingredient he's using here, the alfrocheiro grape variety, is as local as it gets. In Bright's hands it makes for a red filled with the flavours of ripe strawberries, cherries and plums in a juicy, silky style. Tamaya Halc\u00f3n Reserva, Limar\u00ed Valley, Chile 2010 (\u00a310.99, or \u00a38.79 if you buy two bottles, Majestic) Winemaking in Chile was traditionally concentrated around the capital Santiago and to the south in the various sub-regions of the Central Valley, but some of its most exciting wines now hail from the north, in the Elqu\u00ed and, in this case, Limar\u00ed Valleys. These are regions of bright clear skies and cooling breezes and there's a similar quality to wines such as this complex, minerally red blend with its flavours of crushed black fruit and black pepper."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
