Inspectors found prison officers were \u201canxious and fearful\u201d and were regularly targeted for attacks including arson. Officers were found asleep during lock-up periods by inspectors and several locked themselves away. The shocking details in the report include: Inmates faced ongoing intimidation, including other prisoners squirting urine or throwing faeces through broken observation panels. A vulnerable and distressed man found sitting on the springs of his bed told inspectors his mattress had been stolen three days earlier. A troubled inmate struggling with personal hygiene issues was repeatedly sprayed with water from a fire hose by other inmates who soaked him and his possessions, in what the report described as \u201cappalling bullying\u201d. One in seven prisoners said they had developed drug addictions during their time inside prison. Staff frequently lost track of prisoners, the report said, and in at least one case a prisoner who had been moved to another wing because of his intimidating behaviour found his way back to his old wing unchallenged. The smell of cannabis hung in the air and some prisoners were evidently under the influence of drugs. Testing revealed a third were using illicit substances, and trafficking was blatant, the report said. At least three recent prisoner deaths are likely to have been caused by the use of synthetic cannabis. \u201cI have inspected many prisons where drugs are a problem, but nowhere else have I felt physically affected by the drugs in the atmosphere \u2013 an atmosphere in which it is clearly unsafe for prisoners and staff to live and work,\u201d Peter Clarke, the chief inspector of prisons, wrote to the justice secretary, David Gauke. \u201cWhen inspectors at one point raised the fact that drugs were clearly being smoked on a wing, the response from staff was to shrug.\u201d The report describes a squalid environment where self-harm was endemic and conditions filthy and degraded. Vermin and cockroaches were widespread, inspectors found, and blood and vomit was left in hallways uncleaned, as well as rat droppings. \u201cI saw a shower area where there was bloodstained clothing and a pool of blood that had apparently been there for two days, next to numerous rat droppings,\u201d Clarke wrote. Cells had exposed wiring and broken windows; prisoners slept in freezing conditions. The inspectors raised grave concerns about high-risk prisoners due for release, with 50 due to be freed between August and November this year. \u201cWe were greatly concerned that measures to protect the public from those men \u2013 while in prison and on release \u2013 were very poor,\u201d the report says."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
