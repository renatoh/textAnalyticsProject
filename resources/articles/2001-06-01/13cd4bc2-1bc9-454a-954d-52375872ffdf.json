A calamity of egos, perhaps? I pity the unfortunate director, Peter Chelsom, having to preside over all the egos at work on this muddled, unfocused comedy of manners that has become a legend for its desperate script rewrites and ruinous schedule over-runs. The \u00fcber-ego is, of course, Warren Beatty, who has consented to play a cute, wealthy, young-looking architect who somehow finds himself cheating on wife Diane Keaton. Support comes from Goldie Hawn and Garry Shandling, who, like Beatty, have that permatan glaze of smugdom and stardom that is the antidote to comedy. The film can't decide if Beatty is supposed to be an unstoppable babe-magnet or an essentially decent monogamist. (I suspect Mr Beatty is trying to have it both ways.) But Charlton Heston and Marian Seldes do a decent job as a crusty old gun enthusiast and his cranky wife."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
