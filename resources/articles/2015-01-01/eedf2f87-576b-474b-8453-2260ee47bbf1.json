Appearing on breakfast television in the US, the Duke\u2019s former wife declined to say if she and Andrew had discussed his encounters with Virginia Roberts, who alleged in a court filing last month that she was forced by Andrew\u2019s friend Jeffrey Epstein to have sexual liaisons with the prince. However she described Roberts\u2019s allegations as \u201cdefamation of character\u201d and associated herself with the official rebuttal made by the royal family. \u201cBuckingham Palace put out a denial,\u201d Ferguson told NBC\u2019s Today, \u201cand we stand by that denial.\u201d \u201cI won\u2019t stand by \u2013 because I know what it feels like to have salacious lies made up about you \u2013 and not support him so publicly, because they are just shockingly accusatory allegations,\u201d said Ferguson, who added: \u201cThe American people know my integrity.\u201d She said that given Andrew\u2019s qualities \u201cas a great father, and a humongously good man, and all the works he does for Britain,\u201d she would not \u201clet him have his character defamed to this level\u201d. She called Andrew \u201cmy best friend and my best ex-husband ever\u201d. Roberts has long claimed to have been forced to work as a \u201csex slave\u201d to Epstein, a wealthy former hedge fund manager who spent 13 months in jail under a controversial plea deal after being convicted in Florida in 2008 of soliciting prostitution from underaged girls. Roberts alleged that she had relations with Andrew at Epstein\u2019s properties in London and New York and on his private island in the US Virgin Islands \u2013 all of which Andrew denies. Earlier this month Buckingham Palace issued vehement denials that the duke had \u201cany form of sexual contact or relationship with Virginia Roberts\u201d and said that \u201cany suggestion of impropriety with under-age minors is categorically untrue\u201d. Ferguson\u2019s latest intervention came as a journal purportedly written by Roberts, containing explicit details of an alleged encounter with Andrew, was published on a US website. Roberts was reported to have written an entry about a 2001 visit with Epstein and his entourage to London, where she said she danced with Andrew at Tramp nightclub before they both left to go to the town house of Ghislaine Maxwell\u2019 \u2013 a friend of both Epstein and the prince \u2013 where she alleges they had sex. Lawyers now representing Roberts said in a statement that while they were \u201caware of the existence of a journal\u201d kept by Roberts, to whom they referred as Jane Doe #3, they did not have a copy of it and were not behind Tuesday\u2019s publication. The attorneys, Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell, argued that the excerpts were \u201centirely consistent\u201d with the allegations filed to court last month and \u201crebut any contention that those allegations are the product of a recent fabrication\u201d. At the weekend an unnamed source described as \u201cclose to the Duke\u201d by the Daily Telegraph was quoted saying Prince Andrew acknowledged his friendship with Epstein had been \u201cfoolish\u201d and that the story had been \u201cdeeply uncomfortable for the Royal family\u201d. Questioned on Tuesday about whether she had asked Andrew about meeting Roberts, Ferguson said: \u201cWe\u2019re not getting into that subject because you need to ask him that, you need to ask Buckingham Palace that.\u201d The government of the US Virgin Islands said that it would be reviewing corporate sponsorship deals after the Guardian disclosed that Epstein had in recent years given gifts of computers to teenage school pupils and funded government events for young children. Epstein used his Virgin Islands-based corporations to fund a summer camp for children with intellectual disabilities, a prize for a school essay-writing competition and Kindle e-readers for a school library. The manager of his firms was the First Lady of the US Virgin Islands. Martin Weinberg, an attorney for Epstein, said in a statement that Epstein\u2019s philanthropy was \u201cheartfelt and decades old\u201d and had \u201conly a single objective \u2013 to help those in need, and in this case, students who in the Virgin Islands are in need of computers and other educational tools that provide them with a real opportunity to learn and succeed\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
