But it\u2019s about as easy to get over Trump as it is to shrug off a cancer diagnosis. With Hillary Clinton archly hinting at her readiness for a rerun of the 2016 election, others are reinterpreting the past either to delegitimise Trump after the event or to prepare for his vindication at the polls next November. A weary, regretful deja vu pervades Crime in Progress, written by the researchers who brought to light the notorious dossier that traced Trump\u2019s grubby dealings with Russian gangsters; the same document described a cabaret act supposedly staged for him by some micturating Moscow hookers, commended by Putin as \u201cthe best in the world\u201d. Simpson and Fritsch hoped the FBI would use the information they provided to indict Trump, though its then director James Comey instead reprimanded Clinton for her insecure email server. They were disappointed a second time by the noncommittal Mueller report. This \u201csecret history\u201d of their persecution by angry Republicans who disputed their findings attempts to relitigate the case. Simpson and Fritsch aspire to be latter-day versions of Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, the reporters who exposed Nixon\u2019s Watergate cover-up: their book opens with Fritsch sneakily foiling Bernstein\u2019s appeal for information, and later Simpson derides Woodward for cosying up to Trump. But the new guys lack the crusading bravado of their predecessors. Their opposition to Trump starts out as a \u201cbusiness opportunity\u201d, not a quest for truth or a challenge to power, and they go to work like conscientious geeks, assisted by a man they call \u201ca human hard drive\u201d and a woman who serves as their \u201cin-house cyber-ninja\u201d. The retold tale is revved up by hyperactive verbs \u2013 Simpson \u201ccracks open\u201d his MacBook, \u201cpops\u201d a beer can, and \u201cshoots\u201d a text message to Fritsch \u2013 and includes a strained homage to the episodes in All the President\u2019s Men when Woodward ventures into an underground car park for creepy confabs with the CIA informant he nicknamed \u201cDeep Throat\u201d: summoned to testify at the US Capitol, Simpson and Fritsch are ushered into \u201ca dimly lit chamber\u201d in the basement where poor lighting gives their Republican inquisitor \u201ca lizard-like appearance\u201d, then sequestered in another office that feels \u201clike a weird terrarium out of a sci-fi movie\u201d. Yet there is no \u201ccathartic finale\u201d to match Nixon\u2019s fall, and the ominous title of Crime in Progress deflates when the authors admit that Trump\u2019s \u201cconspiring with Russia may not be a crime provable in federal court\u201d. Last year an unidentified White House official wrote an op-ed in the New York Times about the efforts of aides to frustrate the president\u2019s most \u201cbatshit\u201d proposals. Trump denounced the article as an act of treason, but because his only means of self-defence is name-calling, he had trouble mocking his nameless detractor. At a rally in Montana \u201cAnonymous\u201d got entangled with \u201cAnomalous\u201d on his flapping tongue and, after some slurs and gobbles that suggested dodgy dentures, the compound word expired in a sibilant whistle. In A Warning the op-ed\u2019s covert author accuses the president of mental instability; I suppose his inarticulacy is the least of our worries. Like Simpson and Fritsch, Anonymous reels through Trump\u2019s outrages all over again, adding a few new charges, among them a scheme to sabotage the rule of law by abolishing federal judges. Though A Warning traffics in scandal, its tone is classically lofty, with tributes to noble Romans such as Cicero and pious epigraphs from America\u2019s founding fathers. Anonymity is presented as a selfless patriotic virtue: the writer challenges Trump on principle, not as a disgruntled individual \u2013 but now that others are openly testifying to Congress, this impersonality could just as well be deemed a form of moral cowardice. A Warning ends by saluting the passengers who stormed the cockpit of a hijacked plane on 9/11, knowing they would die but hoping to prevent the terrorists from reaching their target in Washington. Anonymous, however, is no martyr: he or she hopes to survive. How different is this duplicity from the craven writhings of Mulvaney, who once called the president he now serves \u201ca terrible human being\u201d? On his first day in office, after a squabble about crowd size at his inauguration, Trump demanded a phenomenological adjustment. \u201cTruth and reality\u201d, as Simpson and Fritsch put it, were replaced by Kellyanne Conway\u2019s \u201calternative facts\u201d, AKA falsehoods. \u201cThe Trump story,\u201d adds Anonymous, \u201cis briskly moving into a fictional universe.\u201d Doug Wead\u2019s Inside Trump\u2019s White House goes further, advancing to enraptured fantasy. Wead, a veteran Republican toady, acclaims Trump for \u201cthe magic of thinking big\u201d; his own padded, puffy volume is an exercise in magical thinking. Like a sun king freshly solarised on the tanning bed, Wead\u2019s Trump radiates \u201cbeauty and intellect\u201d. His sons are \u201cwell groomed\u201d, his daughters \u201cstatuesque\u201d, and his consort bends down from her spike-heeled altitude to \u201creach out to the suffering\u201d. While Melania is cast as a stilettoed Madonna, Trump functions as a universal paterfamilias. \u201cIt\u2019s a father thing,\u201d smarms Jared Kushner to explain Kim Jong-un\u2019s attachment to Trump: Kim\u2019s actual begetter was a maniacal despot, so the chubby ogre has chosen a fitting surrogate. Acclaimed by Wead as the creator of his own \u201cimmortal brand\u201d, a lucrative logo that is \u201cetched into the marble of history\u201d, Trump the mass-market Midas dispenses product placements at every turn. Wead, briefly alarmed, sees him press \u201ca big, fat red button\u201d on a table; the command produces one of the dozen Diet Cokes he swills each day, not a missile strike. Having secured the release of an American pastor imprisoned in Turkey, Trump welcomes the former hostage home by offering him a fistful of Tic Tac mints. The pastor kneels to pray and proclaims \u201ca wonderful story of redemption\u201d: lo and behold, the saviour who delivered him from bondage has also cured his halitosis! Wead is equally devout. He marvels at Trump\u2019s \u201cmystical rise to the presidency\u201d, and cites \u201ca privately conducted name-recognition poll\u201d that identifies him as \u201cthe second most famous person on Earth, after Jesus\u201d. Since Jesus is not currently on Earth, Trump probably elbows his way to first place \u2013 and if, by hook or devilish crook, he does get his venal arse re-elected, we might as well start the countdown to the second coming. \u2022 Crime in Progress by Glenn Simpson and Peter Fritsch is published by Allen Lane (\u00a320).
