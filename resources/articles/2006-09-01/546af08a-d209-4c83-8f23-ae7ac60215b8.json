He delineates his subject as a middle-class leisure activity. Yet for 90,000 years, all humans were hunter-gatherers; we have a more earthy and permanent history of foraging in our genes. People's rediscovery of their primeval relationship to the land - the vitality of using one's senses to find food as opposed to the passivity of consumption - expresses what is fundamental to our biology and our identity. Sadly, Mabey now views his earlier intuitions of this as, at best, metaphors, at worst countercultural literary poses. Throughout the period Mabey covers, people across the world took food from the land in the way they and their forbears had always done, not by way of \"rehearsing an ancient rite\" but by enacting a living tradition, often out of economic necessity. Mabey \"has reservations about the whole business now\" and distances himself from the trend he helped foster, denying ever having been more than a casual forager. His portrayal of \"new foraging\" as the mere product of literary and romantic traditions certainly calls its importance into question. If it were no more than this, I would share his fear of hordes of unrestrained foragers descending on the countryside. Yet foraging is no mere metaphor for connectedness, as Mabey suggests, but the means by which species integrate with their surroundings. There's more to it than the aesthetics of the back-to-nature leisure pursuit Mabey describes. Our present ecological crisis springs from being insulated from our surroundings and the effects of our actions. People should forage, precisely because it can be overdone. Immoderate foraging produces immediate environmental feedback, teaching hunter-gatherer lesson one: if you don't take care of a resource, you lose it. The second aim of the Convention on Biodiversity is the \"development of sustainable use of genetic resources\". If we can't get this right in a country of relative opulence, there is little hope for the biodiversity of less prosperous lands. A widespread revival of foraging is a key element in the return to seasonal and local food. Using the land to encourage and harvest edible and other useful wild plants would give the countryside, and the freedom of it, to local communities. This would embody the ecological care of Mabey's suggested foragers' code, but go further: giving land over to encourage wild food would promote biodiversity. The future of land use - as landowners such as the Forestry Commission and farmers no longer find viable markets for their produce - could lie in such ecologically minded, community-based land management schemes. This would be no great innovation, simply a return to the ancient state of affairs of land being held in common. Our cooperative prehistory is well recorded in our genes despite having evaded the writer's pen: we are good for the task.
