With figures expected to show tomorrow that GDP is slowing, Cameron, the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, and the business secretary, Vince Cable, will each address the Confederation of British Industry, presenting a growth strategy to calm nerves. They will counter the argument from the opposition that the coalition has not explained how it will encourage the economy to grow. Cameron will unveil a national infrastructure plan that will set out the nation's requirements for growth, backed by investment of \u00a3200bn already set out in the spending review but also brought in through new private-sector channels. Overall, the strategy will \"transform our fortunes\" after the recession, Cameron will say. The GDP figures are expected to show that growth has slowed from 1.2% in the second quarter of this year to as low as 0.4% in July, August and September, the months after the coalition made its first big announcements on the economy in June's emergency budget. Ed Miliband, the Labour leader, is also due to address the conference today and will warn against a \"laissez-faire\" approach when the economy is still weak. The CBI last night challenged the government to provide more support for business. Richard Lambert, the CBI's director-general, said: \"Having acted fast to tackle the deficit, the government must now focus on how to attract more investment to the UK if we are to create new jobs and grow the economy. The UK needs to improve in the areas that really matter, otherwise other nations will steal a march on the UK as a place to invest.\" The prime minister is expected to say: \"There is one question I want to answer today: where is the growth going to come from? Where are the jobs going to come from? Today, I want to set out what our strategy for growth will mean for Britain. I want to tell you how we can create a new economic dynamism in our country \u2013 so we can build real confidence in our future. To build that new dynamism in our economy, to create the growth, jobs and opportunities Britain needs, we've got to back the big businesses of tomorrow, not just the big businesses of today. \"That means opening up access to finance, creating an attractive environment for venture capital funding, getting banks lending to small businesses again. And in the days and months ahead we will be setting out our plans in all these areas.\" Cameron will unveil plans for a \u00a3200m network of technology and innovation centres over the next four years, which would link universities to businesses, to exploit discoveries. The idea is based upon German Fraunhofer institutes, which have been championed by the inventor James Dyson. Also today Cable will announce plans for the merged competition functions of the Office of Fair Trading and the Competition Commission, and introduce a range of other changes to \"create a much tougher and more streamlined competition regime\". The national infrastructure plan will be unveiled later today. The announcements amount to a co-ordinated attempt by the coalition to counter allegations from business and Labour that it has focused so much on cutting public spending it has failed to design policies to improve the economy. There are particular concerns about where the private sector jobs will come from for the 490,000 public-sector workers who are expected to lose their jobs. The chancellor, George Osborne, was yesterday accused by Britain's new Nobel Prize-winning economist, Christopher Pissarides, of exaggerating the risk of a Greek-style economic crisis affecting the UK economy. In an article for the Sunday Mirror, the professor warned that Osborne's swingeing cuts package was taking \"unnecessary risks\" with the economy. \"It is important to avoid this 'sovereign risk'. But in my view Britain is a long way from such a threat, and the chancellor has exaggerated the sovereign risks threatening the country. Unemployment is high and job vacancies few. By taking the action that the chancellor outlined in his statement, this situation might well become worse.\" Miliband, in his first speech to business leaders, is expected to mount a forensic critique of the coalition's economy policies, claiming that the government has not learned from the recession, and that supporting business does not have to mean adopting a laissez-faire approach. He will argue that the banking crisis should have taught the government the importance of regulation, that the economy needs to become more balanced. The banking system should do more to support small companies, he will say. \"As much as I am worried about the job cuts and pace of retrenchment in the government's deficit reduction plan, I am equally worried about its failure to provide any sort of wider economic policy.\" A source close to Miliband said: \"It's great [the coalition is] starting to talk about it and come round to Ed's way of thinking \u2013 that you need a plan. But as always with the Tories the headline says one thing but the fact of the matters say another thing.\" Clegg yesterday defended the coalition, saying he was sure \"you can't create the most important thing of all \u2013 which is growth, jobs, prosperity for the [UK] \u2026 without first dealing with deficit. There's nothing pro-growth about having this dead weight of debt around our necks.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
