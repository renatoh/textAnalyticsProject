But, even without the pair intonating through team meetings in their respective broad Geordie and abrasive Scouse dialects that even team-mates have said are, at times, incomprehensible, Fabio Capello has admitted that he is still struggling to get the hang of the northern accents in his England squad. The Italian reflected on his progress so far in his adopted country in an interview with Sky Italia last night and, while the clich\u00e9 insists that football is actually a universal language, he conceded that the finer points of some of his players' inflection remain something of a mystery. \"I must admit I have a little trouble understanding northerners,\" said Capello, who hails from San Canzian d'Isonzo in Gorizia, northern Italy, where some of the locals speak Friulian and others even prefer Venetian. \"When we talk about football, the vocabulary is fairly limited. But when we get away from that it becomes more difficult.\" The remark was delivered tongue in cheek with the Italian having grown used to seeing his side inspired by the Merseyside twang of Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney. They have been joined by Michael Carrick, a Wallsend boy, in recent times, with Wes Brown, from Longsight, Manchester, and James Milner, of Wortley in Leeds, swelling the squad's northern contingent. It is unclear whether Capello would count the likes of Gabriel Agbonlahor, a favourite son of Birmingham, or Emile Heskey of Leicester as northern', even if they hail from appreciably further north than Soho Square. England's national coach revealed he will resist ever singing the national anthem prior to games, even if God Save the Queen has had an effect on him. \"I won't sing the national anthem because I feel it is wrong to sing another country's anthem,\" said Capello. \"I do get goosebumps when I hear it, though.\" The Italian has set himself the task of ensuring that opposing teams quake in their boots when the band strikes up pre-match. England suffered only their second defeat under the Italian in the friendly against Spain in Seville, yet Capello's focus remains upon prevailing in their next competitive match, against Ukraine, at Wembley on 1 April. Victory then would see maximum points from five qualification games, leaving the national side well on course to reach the finals in South Africa next year. To achieve that, however, Capello believes the hosts must still learn to intimidate opponents at the new stadium. \"We have had some good results, more so away from home,\" he added. \"But I am very curious to evaluate the team in the next two games [the friendly against Slovakia followed by the visit of Ukraine]. When I was a player, Wembley was a temple of football where it was almost impossible to win, but now it is a place to be conquered. We have to change that.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
