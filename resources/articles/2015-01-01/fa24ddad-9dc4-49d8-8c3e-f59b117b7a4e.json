Dutton dismissed reports of authorities denying detainees food and water as \u201ccomplete and utter nonsense\u201d and \u201cirresponsible\u201d, but said some people might continue protests and attempt to harm themselves. Guards in riot gear reportedly entered the Delta and Oscar compounds on Monday afternoon to end the week-long standoff by removing alleged ringleaders. The situation had grown steadily worse in recent days, with hunger strikes and dehydration said to be widespread. A spokesman for PNG\u2019s government told the ABC that Mataio Rabura, the country\u2019s chief migration officer, entered Delta compound and negotiated an end to the barricade, which allowed dehydrated protesters access to medical treatment. Tony Abbott said the protest in some parts of the centre \u201camounted to a blockade\u201d. \u201cThere was a major challenge to the policy of the government and I\u2019m pleased to say that that challenge has been defeated,\u201d the prime minister said. In an interview on Tuesday, Dutton said he wanted to thank the PNG government for managing the situation in a \u201cvery impressive\u201d manner. \u201cThe PNG authorities as well as Transfield and my own departmental staff I think have acted in an exemplary way, but nonetheless the threat is ever-present and we are monitoring it,\u201d the minister told the ABC. \u201cI think we\u2019re handling it exceptionally well in the circumstances.\u201d Dutton told Sky News \u201ca degree of force\u201d was used to resolve the standoff and the situation remained \u201cvolatile\u201d. Asked about claims by an asylum seeker that he saw guards beating people in Delta compound, Dutton criticised \u201cirresponsible reporting\u201d. \u201cI think there have been reports that have been repeated for example on the ABC around food that\u2019s been denied. That is complete and utter nonsense on the advice available to me.\u201d Dutton said reports of water being denied were also \u201ccomplete rubbish\u201d. Six days ago Guardian Australia published a photo of a sign at the detention centre indicating some of the water equipment had broken down and showers were suspended. There have been subsequent reports about a lack of water. Dutton said on Tuesday food and water was \u201cnot being denied\u201d by authorities, but there had been \u201csome circumstances where ringleaders within the people who are in the processing centre have denied staff access into particular areas for the delivery of food\u201d. Asked if the conflict continued at the centre, Dutton said: \u201cThere will still be some people who refuse to take water or food and will self-harm and we don\u2019t want to see that, but I say to those people that that activity if you\u2019ve been advised by advocates or others to conduct yourself in a non-compliant way \u2026 somehow that that is going to help \u2013 it is not.\u201d Refugee advocates strenuously denied claims first aired by Dutton on Friday that outsiders were encouraging such protests. At the time, Ben Pynt of the advocacy group Humanitarian Research Partners said he was \u201caffronted by this allegation\u201d because he had spent the past week telling people not to self-harm. Information from the Manus Island centre is often contested. Last week, Dutton\u2019s department initially denied a hunger strike was taking place. The opposition leader, Bill Shorten, had called on the government to be more upfront about developments on Manus Island. Dutton said he provided information \u201cas it was available to us\u201d but said releasing details of the operation as it was under way on Monday could have jeopardised safety."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
