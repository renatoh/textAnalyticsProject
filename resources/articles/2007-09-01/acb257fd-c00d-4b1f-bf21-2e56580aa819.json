Ireland. Ranked six in the world. How they see it Victory last autumn over England and four wins in five outings against France plus a desperate desire for international recognition suggest they could roll over either France or the Irish to get into the knock-out phase. The coach Marcelo Loffreda has given his side polish in spite of meagre resources and limited preparation time. Heads for Leicester once the tournament is over. The captain Agustin Pichot, once of Bristol, now of Stade Fran\u00e7ais, is a great leader off the pitch - he was a key mover in a dispute last year with their federation over playing terms - as well as a livewire scrum-half. The linchpin Tipped to be one of the men of the tournament, Juan Martin Hernandez was full-back of the year of the last French domestic season. Brings versatility and inspiration to a side noted mainly for powerful forward play. How they'll play More to their game these days than that forward power and a big boot at No10, but the occasional bit of synchronised grunting won't hurt and Federico Todeschini can kick. Key fact Pichot's name means \"little\" in Occitan, a language spoken in southern France and parts of Spain and Italy. Omen Argentina beat Ireland in their only previous meeting in France, a 1999 World Cup quarter-final play-off.
