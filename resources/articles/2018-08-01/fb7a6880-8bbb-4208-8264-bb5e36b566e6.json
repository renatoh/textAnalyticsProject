In a letter to Romanian president Klaus Iohannis, which was published by Mediafax, Giuliani sharply criticised what he called \u201cexcesses made in the name of \u2018law enforcement\u2019\u201d by Romania\u2019s national anti-corruption directorate. The agency, he said, had used unfair tactics against suspects and intimidated judges and lawyers. \u201cAn amnesty should be given to those who have been prosecuted and convicted through the excesses,\u201d Giuliani said, claiming \u201cmany innocent people\u201d had been jailed. Giuliani\u2019s remarks aligned him with political forces in Romania who last month succeeded in ousting the country\u2019s top corruption prosecutor, who had pursued senior politicians, prompting tumultuous public protests. His letter was written under the letterhead of Giuliani Partners, his private consultancy firm, and did not mention his role as personal lawyer to the US president. Giuliani said in a text message he was acting as a contractor for the Freeh Group, a consultancy run by his friend Louis Freeh, the former FBI director. Freeh is currently \u201cadvising a Romanian defendant contesting his conviction\u201d by the anticorruption agency, according to an interview he gave Forbes last week. The state department moved to distance itself from Giuliani\u2019s intervention. Asked if the US agreed with his remarks, a spokesman said: \u201cRomania until recently has shown considerable progress in combating corruption and building effective rule of law. We encourage Romanians to continue on this path.\u201d The White House did not respond to a request for comment. By then the former New York City mayor\u2019s letter had been criticised by Romania\u2019s ambassador to the US, George Maior, who said Giuliani appeared to be speaking on behalf of Romanians \u201cwho have problems with the justice system\u201d. Asked if he knew the identity of Freeh\u2019s Romanian client, Giuliani said he would defer to Freeh, who did not respond to an email. The ambassador\u2019s response in turn angered the Romanian foreign ministry, which said in a statement his words \u201cdoes not represent the position\u201d of the government. It said Maior was being recalled to Bucharest to discuss his remarks. The ministry also noted that the country\u2019s ambassadors should \u201crefrain from public statements that could negatively affect bilateral relations with other states\u201d. Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, said in his letter he supported legitimate efforts to curb corruption. But he protested repeatedly about what he claimed were recent excesses in Romania. Last month, Iohannis fired the head of the country\u2019s anti-corruption directorate, Laura Codruta Kovesi, who had led an aggressive push to prosecute corruption among the Romanian elite. Earlier moves by the government to rein in Kovesi prompted waves of street demonstrations. Romania scores 48 out of 100 on a perceived government corruption scale measured by Transparency International, where 0 is the most corrupt and 100 least. Romania ranks joint 59th out of 180 countries, alongside Greece and Jordan."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
