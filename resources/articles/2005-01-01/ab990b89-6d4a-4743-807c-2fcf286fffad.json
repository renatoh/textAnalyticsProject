It will be a party of 10-15 friends looking for the usual - bars, strip clubs, activities (whitewater rafting a particular favourite with the groom) etc, but we're all in our late twenties and are not overly keen on the idea of going somewhere too hectic like San Antonio in Ibiza, for example. We're trying to keep costs down so that as many people as possible will be able to come along. If we can get flights and accommodation for less than \u00a3250pp, staying from Friday to Sunday in the middle of August, that would be great. Any suggestions? T Davis, by email While there are established favourites for a stag weekend, you can get what you're after in most cities in Europe. The tricky part is bringing it in at the budget you're talking about and getting the activities included. There are numerous companies who'll organise your stag for you, but by going this route you can effectively forget your budget - there's a price for leaving the stress behind. Trying this in August is also going to add to the price as it's the peak time to be going anywhere so get your bookings in early. If you go to any well-known party city served by budget airlines, the chances are you'll be sharing the place with lots of other stag and hen groups - which may or may not be a bad thing depending on your outlook. Dublin, Prague, Amsterdam, Barcelona and Latvian capital Riga fall into this category. Less well-known is Vilnius, in Lithuania, where you'll find fewer rivals blocking your way to the bar. For an unusual city close to excellent whitewater rafting try Ljubljana in Slovenia - near the great outdoors for rafting, canyoning and hiking by day and there are excellent bars in the city for night-time fun. Flights are with EasyJet. Contact the Slovenian Tourist Board (01373 814233) for more information. New year, New York Two friends and I would like to spend New Year 2005/6 in New York, travelling on 30 December for three or four days. We would be grateful if you could advise us on roughly how much extra we might expect to pay for flights and two or three-star hotels on top of the usual costs. Do you have recommendations on the best ways to spend New Year's Eve in the city? Caroline Blagburn, Solihull This depends on timing. If you book your flights a few months in advance you should be able to secure returns for around \u00a3300 including taxes. Flights won't generally be available yet but book in the spring or as soon as you can. You'll pay high-season rates at hotels and at the lower end the better places will fill up quickly. For best results, use a site such as www.hotels.com and be flexible about where in the city you stay. With luck you should secure rooms for \u00a380 a night. New Yorkers traditionally gather in Times Square to see in the New Year. How much you enjoy this depends on how much you like standing round in the cold with hundreds of thousands of Americans and tourists. A more intimate idea is to scope out a few bars when you arrive and base yourself in one for the night. There'll be a cover charge wherever you go - how much depends on how swanky the bar is - but if you pick the right place you'll be surrounded by New Yorkers and have a wild night. Good areas to explore are Greenwich Village, Chelsea and the Meatpacking District - but do your research and take smart clothes if you're really keen to live it up. NYC Visit is a good place to start learning more about New York City. Don't forget to take ID with you if heading out for a drink. Swimming in Madeira I'm interested in travelling to Madeira in February. Can you provide details on climate, locations for walking and swimming in sea-water pools (is it warm enough in Feb?) and recommend a quiet, friendly small hotel/B&amp;B? Tom Korn, by email Madeira is a gentle destination all year round. In winter, temperatures hover at around 18-20C with mostly dry and sunny weather. The island isn't known for its beaches and the sea water will be slightly chilly, but if your hotel doesn't have a pool there is a lido near Funchal where you can swim. Walking is an excellent way to see the interior of Madeira and its flora - try a guided excursion to the Laurissilva forest, home to rare birdlife. The island is also well-known for its levadas, water channels that criss-cross the island and offer excellent paths to follow. The Hotel Quinta da Penha de Fran\u00e7a (00 351 291 204650), centrally located in Funchal, gets good reviews from travellers. Doubles range from \u00a340- \u00a380. See www.madeiratourism.org for more links. Nightwear by the Ganges I'm going to be in India - mainly Uttar Pradesh - from 20 January. We will tour, and then spend a couple of days in Kathmandu. We will sleep in hotels mainly, but two nights will be camping (rough) on the banks of the Ganges, and one on a train. What weight of sleepwear would you recommend? Nights, I gather, can be cold. Would sturdy cotton pyjamas be warm enough? How will the mosquitoes be? If I need to get out in the night - will they all rush in to my tent? Pam, by email Cotton pyjamas will suffice. The sleeper train is almost certain to be air-conditioned, so that shouldn't be a problem. Mosquito levels depend on location - seek advice from locals when you arrive in each area. Make sure you have a mosquito net to sleep under and keep the tent zipped up. Over to you... readers' feedback In your response to Helen Wilson, who was heading to Norway for a walking holiday (Letters, 9 January) , I'm surprised you didn't mention Den Norske Turistforening, which has a network of excellent huts and lodges in the mountains (www.turistforeningen.no). For even a short trip it pays to become a member, as the charges for members are lower. DNT runs guided walks, as do some specialist UK travel agents (such as www.telemarkskico.com/dnt-norway.htm), and there are useful guide books (see http://cgi.mountaineer.plus.com/review/review2.shtml). Several of the best-known lodges have their own websites - try Spiterstulen and Gjendesheim in the Jotunheimen. Keith Richards, Cambridge \u00b7 We welcome letters.
