As is often the case with proponents of helmet wearing, he resorts to anecdotal evidence of the dangers of cycling without one. I can offer anecdotal evidence of the low level of risk imposed by riding without one, since I commute almost daily into central London by cycle, 13 miles each way, bare-headed or wearing a cloth cap, and have been cycling in London for 35 years. More importantly, most cyclists in the UK prefer to ride without one and yet cycling on the road remains, statistically and self-evidently, a very low-risk activity with a roughly 50% risk of fatality per 15,000 years of cycling life. For various reasons cycling organisations such as the Cyclists' Touring Club are opposed to cycle helmet laws. They have been shown to lower the number of people cycling, when it is understood that the safety of cyclists on the road correlates closely with the number of cyclists. This is surely why the Netherlands, with the lowest rate of helmet use in the EU and probably the highest rate of cycle usage, is the safest country for cycling. Cycling on the road has a low risk of fatality or serious head injury, collision with a motor vehicle representing the most significant hazard and crushing rather than head injury the main cause of fatalities. Despite this, the wearing of helmets is widely represented, especially on TV, as a requirement even in the most benign of circumstances. The depiction of cyclists riding, as most do, without a helmet is a welcome reminder that cycling on the road is not a hazardous activity to be undertaken only while wearing protective equipment but a pleasant means of transport that can be enjoyed with the minimum of constraints.
