As would you if someone had been checking your testicles and teeth. Sheep, by the way, have no front teeth in their upper jaw. Nor, if you were thinking of buying something more exotic, do giraffes. Very few people know this as few can reach that far to check. Victorian Farm Christmas is full of such fascinatingly useless information. It is a spin-off from that winning formula, Victorian Farm. Ruth, Alex and Peter, the attractively down-to-earth presenters, are now working on Edwardian Farm, so don't think any aspect of historical rural life will escape you. The ram was, by the way, a Christmas present for the ewes. Easily identified by their weak, little, pathetic, feminine faces. I found myself sadly distracted by the bowlers. The farm's monocled owner wore a flattened bowler as favoured by Churchill. Alex, representing an honest son of toil, wore a domed bowler designed, I believe, to prevent poachers denting his skull. The sheep expert wore his billycock on the back of his head, suggesting shiftiness. The bowler was a Victorian invention and survived, like a tortoise, about a hundred years. Ruth busied herself making soap (fat, caustic soda and salt boiled up). You realised why Lord Leverhulme became a millionaire and did not grudge him a penny. Dairy maids were the only Victorian farm workers who were consistently clean, and were highly sought after by the gentry for that reason. \"If you see anyone posh, run a mile,\" Ruth warned her nubile daughter, Eve, as they churned the butter. SOS. Has anyone seen Lucas, the murderer, and his bride, Denise, who are honeymooning in the Lakes? They left EastEnders (BBC1) the day that Cumbria went under water. Nothing has been heard of them since. This is disturbingly reminiscent of Benny in Crossroads who one Christmas went up the tree to affix a star. And was never seen again."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
