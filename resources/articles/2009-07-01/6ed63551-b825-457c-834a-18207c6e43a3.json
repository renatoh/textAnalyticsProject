Arthur Balfour and Alec Douglas-Home were better foreign secretaries than they were prime ministers. Jimmy Carter is a more impressive ex-president than he was a chief executive. At a less exalted level Iain Duncan Smith, Conservative leader 2001-03, fits that mould too. David Cameron, a better politician, looks favourably on his endeavours. Today IDS produced another report, Every Family Matters, saying what he was saying before he became party leader: that marriage is a better bet than cohabitation and should be more robustly supported by the state than it is in an era where the struggle to be non-judgmental about people's private lives underpins New Labour policy. What does IDS's latest report propose? Mostly what his post-leadership Centre for Social Justice (CSJ) has repeated in a series of reports which address family breakdown and the consequent problems: poverty, social exclusion and dysfunctional children. Duncan Smith's critics, some of whom turned up for his Westminster press conference, invert the question: cohabitation and easy separation, single parent households and feral adolescents, are chiefly the products of poverty, not the other way around. They have a point, though contemporary Britain's most celebrated dysfunctional child of divorced parents was probably Lady Diana, not Jane Goody. What does IDS's panel, chaired by a smart family lawyer called David Hodson, propose? A detailed series of remedies, some of which social liberals will not immediately want to reject. Agony aunt Mariella Frostrup conceded that too many people entered matrimony with misplaced, starry-eyed optimism which might benefit from a reality check. So couples contemplating divorce should be required to undergo a compulsory three-month cooling off period while they get advice and explore reconciliation, says the CSJ report. Couples thinking about marriage should get advice too, possibly a CD or even a book. The state should fund relationship education via \"family relationship hubs\" (Australia does it), not least because it is cheaper in the long run. Fractured families cost society between \u00a320bn and \u00a337bn a year. Such talk raises all sorts of questions. Who pays upfront? Is it the 21st century state's role to promote marriage, as Cameron repeatedly suggests, without providing more than token financial support? How realistic is such talk in a socially permissive age? Britain tops so many European leagues for social dysfunction that it is sometimes hard to remember \u2013 as the CSJ report does \u2013 that two-thirds of first marriages still survive until death, that most people (84%) value marriage and that married people are happier, richer and live longer than cohabitees and the separated. Such talk puts the Tories in conflict with New Labour politicians such as Harriet Harman, who champions equal rights for cohabiting couples, but a decade of progressive remedies has barely reversed the pattern of family breakdown. Time for the Tories to try again?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
