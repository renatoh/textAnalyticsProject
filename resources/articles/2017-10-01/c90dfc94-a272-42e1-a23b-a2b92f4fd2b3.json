Yes, and proud to be among those upholding Enlightenment values", "bodyText": "Academic freedom is the soil in which knowledge flourishes. The freedom to research, to follow where evidence leads, to argue, to be challenged, to exchange ideas freely and to disseminate the results lie at the heart of academic life. Immanuel Kant captured the spirit that animates universities when he said that knowledge was a process in which human beings dared to know. The great advances in science and medicine over the past 250 years, along with the breakthrough understandings offered by social sciences and the humanities, would have been impossible without this Enlightenment mindset. It is these freedoms, entrenched because of universities\u2019 constitutional autonomy, that have allowed our civilisation to achieve what it has. Yet all this is now under attack. Last week\u2019s clumsy letter from the Tory whip Chris Heaton-Harris, a passionate Brexiter, asking universities for names of staff lecturing on Brexit, along with syllabuses, comes from an opposite mindset of closure and censure. The unstated but obvious message was that too many students and too many academics had not heeded the message of the referendum: we live in a new country where to assess Brexit in any other way but positively is intellectually off-limits because the people have spoken \u201coverwhelmingly\u201d. The defence that the letter was to aid research for a book fooled no one: for what kind of book, pray, is such information necessary? Besides, that should have been in the first sentence of the letter if that was the intent. It took the Daily Mail, coming as it thought to the aid of the criticised Heaton-Harris, to blow his thin cover. Universities were hotbeds of Remain bias, declared the paper; university leaders and academics were abusing their position by arguing to stay in the EU, so brainwashing student innocents. And to ram the point home, Oxbridge colleges were run by \u201cleftie\u201d Remain sympathisers, including one Will Hutton. The strident attack was part of a pattern: three judges, the Mail declared, were \u201cEnemies of the People\u201d because they had ruled that the government had to win parliamentary consent to launch leaving the EU. Liam Fox and Angela Leadsom have criticised the BBC for not getting behind Brexit. Lord Lawson has called for Philip Hammond\u2019s resignation because he risks sabotaging the whole process by not financing preparations for an alternative should the talks fail. The intensity of the attacks betrays the fragility of the Brexit position. A 52% \u2013 48% result is not overwhelming. Few of the country\u2019s key interest groups \u2013 business lobby organisations, trade unions, universities, the City, the security, defence and foreign policy communities, the creative industries and even the property world \u2013 supported Leave. But, more importantly, there is and was little support in Britain\u2019s culture. Britain shares a commitment to Enlightenment values with the European Union. We expect our judges to be independent, our press to be free, facts to be true, science to be evidence-led and our universities to entrench academic freedom. The country of Darwin, Shakespeare and Wilberforce is not instinctively hostile to foreigners in general and Europeans in particular. The hazards of exiting the greatest free trade area in the world to embrace the phantom of \u201c global Britain\u201d, so completing the Thatcherite revolution, require powerful cultural support: it does not exist. There is lack of cultural and economic support for Brexit, which will deepen as the economy craters in the years ahead and rightwing attacks become more strident and menacing. I expect a growing majority to emerge, not just for soft Brexit but to stay in the EU as this reality grows. But as Ivan Krastev argues in his brilliant book After Europe, immigration and the refugee crisis have changed the rules of the game. A significant element in western electorates, particularly among the less well-educated and unskilled members of the white working class, is so fearful about the impact of mass immigration on their sense of identity that Enlightenment values can go hang. There are fertile ground for the populist right everywhere \u2013 from eastern Europe to the American midwest, including the poorer regions of England. Brexit was an anti-Enlightenment project. It was won on lies, unachievable promises and open distrust of knowledge imparted by \u201cexperts\u201d. But crucially, as Nigel Farage always understood, it was also about repudiating the impact of immigration, brilliantly captured in the neutral \u2013 so as not to court any charge of even subliminal racism \u2013 catchphrase \u201ctake back control\u201d. It was a protest by a forgotten, white working class against a status quo underwritten by Enlightenment values. And although it wasn\u2019t overwhelming or decisive, the need to describe it as such springs from the same need that Donald Trump spoke to when he declared that America doesn\u2019t have victories any more. The anti-Enlightenment, pro-Brexit right in league with the white working class could for the first time unambiguously claim the scalp of their liberal tormentors. Thus the viciousness and growing intensity of the witch-hunts against academics, judges and journalists, extending to business people and diplomats, judged to be Remoaners, who contest the victory. But it is a victory that can\u2019t be sustained. Events are going to prove EU withdrawal will be a disaster. And we believers in the Enlightenment tradition will carry on daring to know, believing in the rule of law and defending academic and media freedoms to the last. To do otherwise, giving into threats and menace, is to invite a serfdom of the mind and a betrayal of Britishness. Yet if and when there is a change of heart, and Britain stays inside the EU or its wider architecture, because anything else is wilfully self-destructive, the rage against immigration and Enlightenment values is not going to evaporate. Events, along with the implosion of the Conservative party, may convert a small majority to the merits of staying inside the EU. But to seal the deal, there has to be a credible offer of change to the left-behind, white working class and the parts of the country in which they live and recognition of the vital need to shore up threatened identities. If Remain had done that \u2013 and fought as a cross-party coalition putting Britain and its great values above party affiliation \u2013 it would have won in June last year. If disaster is to be averted, it must learn the lesson \u2013 or leave the field to an increasingly vicious right and decades of fury and self-examination as the country asks how ever it was led to such severe self-harm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
