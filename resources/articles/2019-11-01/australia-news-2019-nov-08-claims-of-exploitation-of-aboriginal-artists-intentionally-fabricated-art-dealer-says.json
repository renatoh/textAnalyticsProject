The dealer, John Ioannou, contacted Guardian Australia through a friend to provide his defence to allegations made against him by the APY artist collective in a letter to the federal ministers for Indigenous Australians and the arts, and the South Australian premier. Ioannou confirmed NT police had visited his residence to speak to the artists after receiving a complaint. He said he believed the allegations were being made against him because he was \u201cthe biggest threat [art centres] face\u201d. The letter that sparked the police visit is signed by 69 artists from APY Art Centre Collective. It alleges that the high-profile artist Yaritji Young was told she had to make paintings to service a $20,000 debt that her son owed Ioannou. Ioannou categorically denied the claim. He said he had nothing to hide and his \u201cbooks are open for anyone who wants to see\u201d. When asked if Young had painted for him this week, and what she\u2019d been paid, Ioannou responded: \u201cWhy do you want to know that?\u201d He said Young had started a couple of unfinished paintings, which he said were not of the quality he was looking for to display in his proposed gallery. Asked to clarify if she\u2019d been paid for that work, Ioannou replied \u201cNo.\u201d Ioannou said three artists had stayed, not at his house but at an Alice Springs hotel paid for by him, for the past 10 days and that they had all left or were about to leave for a funeral. He claimed they were discussing a new gallery he was opening but he later suggested they had painted for him. \u201cI made a proposition to a certain artist here because I\u2019m starting up a business again that will be run through a legal firm,\u201d Ioannou told Guardian Australia. \u201cA lot of the artists \u2013 I\u2019m very well known here \u2013 approach me on a daily basis to do painting.\u201d He said the three artists came of their own volition so they could discuss \u201cpropositions for future work together\u201d and he was seeking legal advice about working with the artists. He claimed under his proposed gallery, which he said would open next year, artists would all be paid 50% of the sale price, transferred directly to their account by the buyer, with statements for transparency. Sign up to receive the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning He said this was to \u201ccounter any claims that I\u2019m somehow exploiting the artist\u201d. He conceded this was not how he had operated in the past as a private dealer. Earlier on Thursday, the curator of Aboriginal art at the Museum and Art Gallery of the NT, Luke Scholes, told ABC radio in Alice Springs that over many years working as a remote Aboriginal community art adviser he had seen unscrupulous conduct by private dealers, including behaviour that was \u201cclose to\u201d kidnapping. Scholes said when he was working at art centres in Kintore and Kiwirrkurra, \u201cprivate dealers would come without the necessary permits and literally sit in their four-wheel-drives at the edge of the art centre fence and wait for one senior artist to finish the day\u2019s work, to be bundled into a car and driven into Alice Springs or elsewhere.\u201d Scholes said the allegations made this week had brought up a feeling of \u201cimmediate distress\u201d that carpetbagging might be returning. \u201cThe rise of this 10 years ago I was very close to, and at the time it felt like a tsunami. It felt like every second shed in Elder St [Alice Springs] was a painting studio for someone,\u201d he said. \u201cThings aren\u2019t quite that bad [yet], but I really do think there is potential for an increase in private dealers and their activities.\u201d He said protecting artists against exploitation was a \u201ccomplex area to legislate\u201d but a parliamentary inquiry and media attention might help educate consumers about how to buy art ethically. He said it was good that art centres were educating their artists about unscrupulous practices. \u201cI see the APYACC as a very engaged group of artists \u2026 in their own art centres and with their own artists. They\u2019re very interested in where their art ends up after it leaves the art centre,\u201d he said. \u201cI have great confidence in the management of the APYACC \u2026 and that, if they do have contracts with their artists, that their artists are signing them with full disclosure.\u201d On Monday the South Australian premier, Steven Marshall, said he was \u201cvery concerned of the potential for artists on the [Anangu Pitjantjatjara Yankunytjatjara] lands to be exploited\u201d and directed Arts SA to convene a meeting to further explore potential solutions to unethical practices. The minister for Indigenous Australians, Ken Wyatt, told Guardian Australia he was \u201cdeeply concerned about reports regarding \u2018carpetbagging\u2019 in Alice Springs and South Australia\u201d, and had asked the National Indigenous Australians Agency \u201cto look into this matter and provide me with an urgent update\u201d. Guardian Australia has attempted to reach Yaritji Young for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
