The 55-year-old had joined the club at the start of the season as Niko Kovac\u2019s assistant coach but was promoted as interim manager when the Croat was sacked on 3 November. Flick earned a deal until the end of the season as permanent head coach in December and has since convinced Bayern\u2019s hierarchy he is the man to lead the team for the next three seasons after winning 18 of his 21 matches in charge. \u201cBayern are very satisfied with Hansi Flick\u2019s work,\u201d said Bayern\u2019s chief executive, Karl-Heinz Rummenigge. \u201cThe team has had a very good development under him, plays attractive football which is reflected in results. We are the only club still competing in all three competitions.\u201d Sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic added: \u201cHansi and I know in which direction we want to develop the team. We believe that Hansi is also the right head coach for the current time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
