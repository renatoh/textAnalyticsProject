But although road rage, air rage, even parking rage are now common, few have become aware of bank rage. I witnessed the wrath of bank rage first hand this week, whilst waiting in line at the Halifax. A customer, angry at being asked to show his passport as identification, started hitting the female branch manager. While she called for the police he continued to rant and rave - at the top of his voice - accusing her of ignorance, racism, rejecting Jesus, and so on. He even threw some born-again Christian literature in her face. The issue was resolved fairly quickly when the police arrived, arrested him and whisked him off. The bank staff took the whole thing in their stride. It's a regular occurrence, they said, adding that one customer told a member of staff that he had a gun and would wait for her outside at closing time. Neither the banks, the banking associations, nor the unions had any figures on how common these attacks are, but all agreed that they are rising and that the culprits are the stresses and strains of 21st century life. \"I wouldn't say we were experiencing a wave of customer aggression, but it seems as if attacks on frontline staff, such as those working in banking, healthcare and public transport, are increasing,\" says David Gamble, from the Association of Insurance and Risk Managers, an organisation tasked with helping companies predict and mitigate threats to their staff and operations. \"It reflects the times we live in. Stress levels are increasing across the board, creating very big problems.\" Bank staff are trained in how to deal with aggravated customers. And the woman I observed kept the situation well under control, saying it's just part of the job and that you learn to deal with it. Interestingly, they felt their colleagues in bank call centres were worse off because when customers get aggressive, it's just them and their earpieces which know so they have to struggle through by themselves. Michael Cook, a spokesperson for the banking union Unifi, agrees that call centre staff probably bear the brunt of customer anger but thinks the banks could go a long way to preventing this anger arising in the first place. \"Banks are very understaffed at the moment, both in the branches and the call centres. As a result, customers are being kept on hold for ages or asked to wait in long queues. \"It makes them angry and edgy and more prone to outbursts. I would advise the banks to bring in more staff and see if that eases the problem.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
