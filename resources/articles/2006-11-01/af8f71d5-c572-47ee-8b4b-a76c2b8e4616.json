Figures obtained by Guardian Money show that leading lenders sometimes charge homebuyers more than three times what they actually pay the surveyors who do the work - or up to eight times in the case of some remortgages. Lenders have also pushed up fees by more than inflation, and profited from house price increases pushing properties into higher bands. This mirrors uplifts in arrangement and exit charges, which have often trebled over 10 years according to Moneyfacts. Harrow West Labour MP Gareth Thomas is concerned about soaring fees. \"Because the valuation is obligatory and consumers have no choice of provider, it's an opportunity for big financial services companies to write themselves a cheque,\" he says. East London-based surveyor Roger Conway used to do a lot of mortgage valuation work, where surveyors check the property exists and is in reasonable order - though this does not stretch to picking up carpets and looking for woodworm in the floorboards. \"Now the fees the lenders pay are too low to do a proper job. But costs to borrowers keep going up,\" he says. \"At the top end of the market I would typically be paid \u00a3160 for a valuation survey on a \u00a31m house, which could cost the homebuyer \u00a3900. I'd rather go direct and sell to those who want more than the basic valuation survey.\" Mr Conway believes the gap is even wider when it comes to higher level homebuyer reports or full building surveys. \"Buyers have a choice of surveyor for all services above the basic valuation. If they knew the real cost and the extent of what I see as overcharging, then they would be in a position to use someone else.\" Some lenders, such as Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester charge \u00a350 to \u00a3100 more if a buy-to-let mortgage is involved. C&amp;G concedes there is no more work involved but says access can be more difficult when a property is tenanted. Often surveyors do not even visit the property. \"When it's a remortgage and the borrower only wants 50% or 60% of the value, some lenders use online databases or a \"drive-by\", where they just check the property is there and basically has a roof,\" says Tony Chewins of MoneyBackMortgages.com, a new online broker which refunds part of its commission. \"Surveyors are typically paid \u00a340 for a \"drive-by\" - and an online search is even cheaper, but many lenders still charge the full fee.\" Mr Chewins also says survey fees have risen significantly over the past two to three years. \"There is no clear pattern other than going upwards. BM Solutions, for instance, has gone up from \u00a3235 in 2004 to \u00a3350 on a \u00a3125,000 property; Nationwide from \u00a3175 to \u00a3325 on a \u00a3180,000 home; and Halifax from \u00a3415 to \u00a3485 on a \u00a3360,000 house.\" Mr Conway, 59, wants transparency so lenders would have to show the underlying costs of services they are providing. \"In 1994, the then Mergers and Monopolies Commission (now the Competition Commission) said lenders should provide full information on the real cost of surveys. But that was withdrawn under pressure from lenders. Since then, nothing. \"There was a code of practice from the lenders but this was largely ignored and has fallen into disuse. The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors, of which I am a member, does not seem interested in the problem.\" MP Gareth Thomas has taken up the matter with the Office of Fair Trading and the Financial Services Authority. \"Each said the other was responsible. The FSA concedes the present system is not transparent but it believes that the difficulty of introducing regulations is greater than the extent of the problem.\" Our tables, which C&amp;G confirms are correct, only apply to its own arrangements. But other lenders have similar charges and often pay the same amount to surveyors. C&amp;G adds: \"The fee we pay depends on the surveyor. Those to whom we provide a large amount of business and training and technological support receive a lower fee. We also pay fees to the software company which produces the reports. So our cost is significantly higher than the fee paid to the surveyor.\" t.levene@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
