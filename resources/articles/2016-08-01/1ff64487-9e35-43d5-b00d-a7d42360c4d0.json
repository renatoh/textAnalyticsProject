And just as the success of homegrown cyclists in London 2012 inspired the country to get out on their bikes, Rio 2016 seems to be encouraging people to seek out their local swimming pools. The Amateur Swimming Association (ASA) said this weekend that it has seen a massive jump in the number of people searching online for their nearest leisure pool during the first few days of the Games, as Adam Peaty picked up Britain\u2019s first gold medal, in the 100m breaststroke, and Siobhan-Marie O\u2019Connor and Jazz Carlin each took silver. British divers Chris Mears and Jack Laugher, and Dan Goodfellow with Tom Daley, also made the medals podium in the synchronised events, while the US swimming phenomenon that is 31-year-old Michael Phelps has astonished and inspired by striking gold again at his fifth Olympic Games. Alison Clowes, the ASA\u2019s head of media, said it had seen 80,000 people use their \u201cpoolfinder\u201d app over the period 5-11 August \u2013 almost double the rate for the same period in July \u2013 and they were getting dozens of phone inquiries too. \u201cWe\u2019ve already seen a boost from our Olympic successes, which is great,\u201d she said. In 2014, more than 2.6 million adults took part in a weekly swimming session in England and Wales, and half of all British schoolchildren regularly visit a pool, making it our highest participation sport, more popular than football or rugby. Nevertheless, Clowes said, there is still work to be done if the success stories from Brazil are to leave a lasting legacy. Many smaller, older pools are being closed and local authority budget cuts are affecting spending levels for important facilities such as swimming pools. Meanwhile, the average level of swimming proficiency among schoolchildren requires improvement. \u201cSwimming is now on the national curriculum for Key Stage One and Two, which is good. But our research shows that 52% of children are still leaving school unable to swim 25 metres unaided, so that\u2019s a concern that we still need to be tackling. \u201cIn general, although a lot of the older pools are coming to the end of their lives and being closed, many of the newer ones actually are bigger, with different uses. So, they\u2019ll have a learning pool, a lanes pool, that kind of thing,\u201d said Clowes. \u201cIn terms of water space, that\u2019s gone up. Birmingham, for example, has closed pools but their actual water space has increased.\u201d But swimming clubs and lane swimmers do regularly complain about the lack of large pools. In Derby, 19 miles from new world record holder Adam Peaty\u2019s home town of Uttoxeter, the city council has closed two pools, one permanently and one temporarily, blaming central government cuts to its budget. Peaty\u2019s own swimming club, City of Derby, still struggles to get its members enough hours in the water. Another Olympic swimmer, Ross Davenport, has criticised the state of \u201cpool space\u201d in Derby, saying club members had to travel into the next county for training. However, ASA director of participation, Nick Caplin, said overall the picture was a positive one. \u201cThe success of our Team GB swimmers in Rio is brilliant and is clearly inspiring people watching at home,\u201d he said. \u201cThe great thing about swimming is that you don\u2019t have to be an Olympian to do it. It doesn\u2019t matter what age you are or your ability, once you are in the water you can have fun playing games, swimming lengths or just relaxing.\u201d \u2022 This article was corrected on 19 August 2016.
