He said the security council had not written the resolution returning the inspectors to Iraq for the purpose of going to war but added that the UN would risk its own \"irrelevance\" if it did not move to disarm Saddam Hussein. \"We wrote [resolution] 1441 to give Iraq one last chance. Iraq is not so far taking that one last chance. We must not shrink from whatever is ahead of us. We must not fail in our duty and responsibility to the citizens of the countries that are represented by this body,\" he said. \"The issue before us is not how much time we are willing to give the inspectors to be frustrated by Iraqi obstruction, but how much longer are we willing to put up with Iraq's noncompliance before we as a council, we as the United Nations say: 'Enough. Enough'.\" The foreign secretary, Jack Straw, who spoke after Mr Powell, said that President Saddam must be \"left in no doubt\" as to the serious situation he now faces and effectively set February 14 as a deadline for Iraq to comply with the security council's demands. \"The United Kingdom does not want war. We want the UN system to be upheld,\" he said. \"But the logic of resolution 1441 is inescapable: time is now very short. The council will have further reports from the inspectors on Friday week. If non-cooperation continues, this council should take its responsibilities.\" A senior Iraqi MP dismissed Mr Powell's presentation as \"lies\". Salem al-Kubaisi, head of the Arab and foreign relations committee at Iraq's national assembly, told the Reuters news agency: \"These are lies and fabrications which have no material proof. They are aimed at creating a pretext for military aggression against Iraq.\" Despite speculation of an \"Adlai Stevenson moment\" comparable to the point in the 1962 Cuban missile crisis when Mr Stevenson, the then US ambassador to the UN, revealed aerial photographs of Soviet missiles on the Caribbean island before a live television audience, Mr Powell instead listed a series of alleged evasions and prohibited weapons programmes. He played the council an intercepted communication between an Iraqi army colonel and captain from January this year containing orders to remove any reference to \"nerve gas\" from previous orders, and said that evidence of evasion was proof that Iraq was spying on the inspectors to hide its weapons programmes. Mr Powell also: \u00b7 Asserted that Iraq \"bulldozed and graded to conceal chemical weapons evidence\" at the al-Musayyib chemical complex in 2002 and had a series of cargo vehicles and a decontamination vehicle moving around at the site. He said this had been corroborated by a human source. \u00b7 Cited informants who claim Iraq is placing rockets armed with biological weapons in the west of the country. \u00b7 Presented declassified satellite pictures that he said were of 15 munitions bunkers. Mr Powell said four of them had active chemical munitions inside. \u00b7 Said Iraqi informants claim that Iraq has 18 trucks it uses as mobile biological weapons labs. \u00b7 Accused Iraq of harbouring a terrorist network headed by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, an \"al-Qaida lieutenant\", with links to the London ricin gang. \u00b7 Played an audio tape between Iraqi military officers purportedly discussing hiding \"modified\" vehicles from weapons inspectors. In the intercept one voice, a junior officer according to Mr Powell, says: \"We have this modified vehicle. What do we say if one of them sees it?\" \"You didn't get a modified ... you don't have a modified,\" replies a voice identified as a general. \"I'll come to see you in the morning. I'm worried. You all have something left.\" \"We evacuated everything. We don't have anything left,\" the junior officer replies. \"This effort to hide things from the inspectors is not one or two isolated events, quite the contrary. This is part and parcel of a policy of evasion and deception that goes back 12 years, a policy set at the highest levels of the Iraqi regime,\" Mr Powell said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
