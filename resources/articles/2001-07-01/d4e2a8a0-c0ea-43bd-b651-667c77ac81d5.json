The investigation follows the unusual circumstances surrounding the surprise collapse of Iceland shares in January. The then trade secretary, Stephen Byers, is understood to have appointed barrister Ronald Lindsay and accountant Peter Thornton as investigators in May, because of suspicion that an offence of insider dealing had been committed during events surrounding the share price collapse. There is no suggestion that a particular individual is being targeted by the DTI. News of the investigation will be welcomed by analysts and investors angered at the surprise drop in shares, which came one month after Iceland co-founder and chairman Malcolm Walker sold a \u00a313.5m stake in the company. In mid-December, shares in the company were trading at 339p, but by early February they were below 150p. The food retail sector is often favoured by cautious investors because it is assumed to be less vulnerable to unexpected share price movements than other industries. Mr Walker, 55, who, along with a fellow former Woolworths employee, founded Iceland three decades ago, is understood to have sold half his stake in the company against the advice of one of Iceland's brokers, Hoare Govett. The broker had warned that such a move risked the ire of shareholders if the company failed to reach sales targets over the crucial Christmas period. One month later the retailer shocked the City by revealing that like-for-like sales through its Iceland stores in the run-up to Christmas had been 5.5% below levels of the previous year. Much of the decline was blamed on the retailer's organic foods only policy. \"Malcolm is hardly a get-rich-quick merchant,\" a spokesman for Iceland told reporters as shareholder anger began to swell. \"He has been with the firm for 30 years. There was no reason at the time he sold the shares to think we would be where we are today.\" Mr Walker, who was on holiday in the Maldives at the time when the Christmas sales figures were released, resigned shortly after his return to Britain. The company has since issued three profits warnings, the last of which, in March, finally lowered the forecast for pretax profits to \u00a340m from \u00a362m for the 15 months to April. Results for the period are due to be announced on Wednesday. Mr Walker is planning to return to the frozen food business with a new venture involving five other senior Iceland executives. This could place him in breach of his Iceland contract, in which he pledged not to open a rival business within two years of leaving the company."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
