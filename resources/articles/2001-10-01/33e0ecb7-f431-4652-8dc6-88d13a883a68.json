In a close 216-214 vote, the Republican-led House passed $100bn of tax relief, which will see the basic rate cut from 27% to 25%, despite Democrat claims that the measures would only help big companies. The vote - largely along party lines - came after hours of debate that reflected the deep political divide on economic policy. The debate contrasted sharply with the patriotic discussions of military action that have characterised Capitol Hill since September 11. \"It officially shatters the myth of bipartisanship,\" said Republican Charles Rangel. Hours earlier, the US president, George Bush, waded into the argument. He urged Congress to take quick action, adding that the tax breaks were needed to bolster the home front in the \"fight against terrorism\". \"Part of the war we fight is to make sure our economy continues to grow,\" said Bush. He went on to praise the bill, which will cost $99.5bn in 2002 and $159bn over 10 years. Republicans argued that tax breaks were the best way to encourage renewed business investment, stop job layoffs and boost consumer confidence in time for Christmas. \"Investment is the driving engine in the economy,\" said House majority leader Dick Armey. \"This bill provides a reward for the risk-takers who create jobs in America.\" Democrats accused Republicans of offering a package that favours the wealthy and big corporations and ignoring the needs of laid-off workers. \"The workers who have lost their jobs get bread crumbs from this bill,\" said the House minority leader, Dick Gephardt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
