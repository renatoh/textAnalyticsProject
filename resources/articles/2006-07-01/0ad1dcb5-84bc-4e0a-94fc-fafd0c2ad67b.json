The first of these was the Aerosvit Foros tournament in Yalta, from which I left you with the current Russian champion Sergei Rublevsky just ahead. after defeating the erstwhile leader Viktor Bologan in the sixth of the 11 rounds. Rublevsky nursed his lead well and at one stage extended it to a full point: but he's a fairly cautious player and a run of three draws left him just half-a-point ahead of Vassily Ivanchuk, going into the last round on Wednesday: in which Rublevsky was Black against Alexander Grischuk while Ivanchuk had White against Alexei Shirov. The first of these was a short but tense draw in which Grischuk sacrificed a piece for two pawns but then presumably got nervous and proposed peace. Meanwhile Ivanchuk pressed to the very end but Shirov just held a theoretical draw the exchange down. The final scores were Rublevsky 7.5/11, Ivanchuk 7, Bologan 6.5, Skakhriyar Mamedyarov, Shirov and Grischuk 6; Liviu-Dieter Nisipeanu and Alexander Areshchenko 5; Ruslan Ponomariov and Sergei Karjakin 4.5; and Andrei Volokitin and Penteala Harikrishna 4. The Indian number 3 (behind Viswanathan Anand himself and Krishnan Sasikiran), Harikrishna had an uncharacteristically bad tournament but did carry off one very pretty combination before losing to the leader fairly dramatically the next day: Shakhriyar Mamedyarov (Black) Penteala Harikrishna (White to play) Although opposite coloured bishops have drawish tendencies in the endgame in the middlegame they tend to lead to very sharp play since neither can defend against the other. Here almost all of Harikrishna's pieces are aimed at the enemy king and he let fly with: 24 f5! To deflect an enemy piece. The equally thematic 24 Bxg7! also won outright, 24...Rxf5 If 24...Bxf5 25 Rxg7+! Rxg7 26 Nf6+. 25 Nh6+! gxh6 26 Qd4 The line-up along the long diagonal is now totally murderous. 26...Ne6 Or 26...Re5 27 Rgxe5 dxe5 28 Qxe5 etc. 27 Qh8+ Kf7 28 Rxf5+ Bxf5 29 Qf6+ Kg8 30 Qxf5 Nf8 31 Qd5+ Qf7 32 Re7! And faced with 32...Qxd5 33 Rg7+ Kh8 34 cxd5 Mamedyarov resigned. Sergei Rublevsky v Penteala Harikrishna Yalta 2006 (round 7) Sicilian Bb5+ 1 e4 c5 2 Nf3 d6 3 Bb5+ Nd7 4 0-0 Ngf6 5 Re1 e5!? This unusual move produces a position much more akin to a Ruy Lopez in which White is very comfortable. 6 c3 Be7 7 d4 0-0 8 h3 a6 9 Bf1 b5 10 d5 In a Ruy Lopez Breyer the bishop would normally go via f1-b5-a4-b3-c3-d3-f1 a difference of four tempi: but then Black would have had to play Nb8-c6-b8-d7 and the bishop would have been committed to b7. 10...Ne8 The prophylactic 10...Rb8 made sense to answer 11 a4 with 11...c4. 11 a4 Rb8 12 b3 For now Rublevsky was able to prevent ...c4 12...Nc7 13 Na3 Kh8 It makes sense to get the king off the white diagonal before playing for ...f5. 14 Nc2 g6 Harikrishna's main problem in this game was indecisiveness. If 14...f5 15 exf5 Rxf5 16 Ne3 Rf8 the e4 square is a good post for White's pieces but Black is certainly fighting. 15 Bh6 Rg8 16 Ne3 Bf8 17 Bxf8 Qxf8? 17...Rxf8 was better 18 axb5 axb5 19 Ra7 Bb7? 19...Rb7 20 Qa1 Nf6 was still quite playable. 20 Qa1 Ra8? Walking into a nasty trap. 21 Rxb7! White now wins at least a rook and two pieces for the queen. 21...Rxa1 22 Rxa1 c4!? 23 Rxc7 cxb3 24 Rxd7 Qc8 25 Rxf7 Rg7 26 Rxg7 Kxg7 27 c4 bxc4 28 Nxc4 and Harikrishna resigned. The Dutch Championship in Hilversum was at one stage keeping pace with Yalta round for round but after the final rest day last Monday they went a day behind. Sergei Tiviakov took the early lead and never relinquished it, though in the eighth round a week a go today, he lost to Jan Smeets while his then nearest pursuer Loek Van Wely was defeated by Edwin L'Ami. The crucial game was in round nine when Tiviakov was Black against Van Wely, who had won the previous six championships straight from 2000 onwards. However, an out of form Van Wely ran straight into a brick wall against Tiviakov's steely defence and quickly self-destructed. This put him out of contention, and while Ivan Sokolov was only half a point behind Tiviakov at the start of the final round, he was defeated by Friso Nijboer while Tiviakov beat L'Ami. So Tiviakov was well clear on a massive 9/11 ahead of Sokolov 7.5 and Nijboer and Van Wely 7. While three of the four top guys (Jan Timman made a disastrous 3/11) finished in front, perhaps the most significant development was the continued rise of the younger generation who are starting to close the gap. Loek Van Wely (Black) Edwin L'Ami (White to play) In this immensely tense position, all the main action was compressed into just three moves: 27 Qa2?! Strictly speaking this natural move seems to be a mistake - instead he should retreat 27 R5a2: but the threat of 28 Rxb5+ was very alluring. 27...Rxf3! Meeting the threat since if 28 Rxb5+ cxb5 29 Qa7+ Kc6 is now possible. 28 gxf3 c2? This isn't bad but 28...Rd2! won by force after 29 Rxb5+ cxb5 30 Qa7+ Kc6 31 Qa8+ Kd7 32 Ra7+ Ke8 33 Qxb8+ Rd8 34 Qb7 Qxa7! 35 Qxa7 c2 29 b4?! 29 Ra8 was enough to draw. 29...c1Q+? Only after this seemingly natural looking move is Black in trouble. Instead 29...Rd1+! 30 Kg2 Qxe5 31 Ra6+ Nxa6 32 Qxa6+ Kc7 33 Qa7+ Kd6 34 Qb8+ Kd5 35 Qa7 Qd4 36 Qd7+ Kc4 37 Qxc6+ Kxb4 was winning. 30 Kg2! Q5c4 If 30...Qxb4 31 Ra6+ Nxa6 32 Qxa6+ Kc7 33 Qa7+ Kc8 34 Rxc1 with a mating attack. 31 Rxc1 Qxa2 32 Rxa2 Na6 33 Rxa6+! Kxa6 34 Rxc6+ Kb7 35 Rxe6 and L'Ami won the ending on move 58."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
