Steer well clear of Woody Allen's Cassandra's Dream, in which Farrell and Ewan McGregor play two cockney brothers hired by their rich uncle (Tom Wilkinson) to murder a business associate. Both need money, one to settle gambling debts and buy a house to please his working-class fianc\u00e9e, the other to pay his way in the property business and impress his middle-class actress girlfriend. Allen has made a succession of excellent films, some among of the best of the past 30 years, but leaving New York for London, he's floundered, first with Match Point, then with Scoop, which has yet to find a distributor here, and now with this. Supposedly a psychological thriller (there's a feeble, last-minute attempt to suggest we're witnessing a Greek tragedy), Cassandra's Dream is a succession of ill-staged scenes, mostly involving static two-shots in which characters look awkwardly at each other as they exchange ill-written dialogue full of clunking exposition, emphasising points by jabbing their fingers. A fine British cast is badly directed, woeful line-readings are retained, Philip Glass's pulsating music is wholly inappropriate to the subject and setting and the great Vilmos Zsigmond's photography is blandly mediocre. I take as much pleasure in writing this as Jed Leland did in reviewing Susan Alexander's opera debut in Citizen Kane."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
