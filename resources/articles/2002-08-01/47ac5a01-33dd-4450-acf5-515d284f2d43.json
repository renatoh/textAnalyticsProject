The necessity of this hit us within minutes of arriving in Antalya airport. The machines dispensing trolleys took euro coins only - forget the Turkish lira, never mind the pound. As the two-week holiday progressed, we realised that the euro has been adopted as a parallel currency to the inflation-stricken lira. This is not only a reflection of the fact that Turkey is aiming for membership of the EU. With the lira fluctuating substantially on an almost daily basis, the euro is a much safer currency for tour operators to quote local excursions in - even if you pay lira for them in the end. You may also get a better exchange rate on euros than on sterling. You may also find, as we did, that the hotel you're staying at suddenly won't accept credit cards. So bring a debit card, which you can use in the ubiquitous cash machines, and make sure you have enough in your account back home, or a good overdraft, to cover your holiday expenditures."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
