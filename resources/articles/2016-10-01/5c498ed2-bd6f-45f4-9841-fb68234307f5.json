As the Patriots fans who invaded Cleveland cheered and chanted his name, Brady waved and smiled before heading into the locker room and celebrating with his team-mates. His eyes only focused forward, he savored every second. He missed this. \u201cI\u2019m back doing what I love to do,\u201d he said. Looking razor-sharp at times and relatively rust-free after serving his four-game Deflategate suspension, Brady passed for 406 yards and threw three touchdowns to Martellus Bennett in his hyped return as the Patriots thumped the Cleveland Browns 33-13 on Sunday. New England\u2019s star quarterback was back much to the relief of teammates and Patriots fans everywhere following a ban for his role in the scandal in which an NFL investigation found that the four-time Super Bowl champion Patriots under-inflated footballs in the 2015 AFC championship game. Brady fought Commissioner Roger Goodell\u2019s ruling for more than a year before he begrudgingly accepted his punishment. And while it appeared he took out some frustration on the Browns (0-5), Brady insisted he\u2019s not seeking revenge. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a time for me to reflect,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no point at looking back at anything. Whether we won Super Bowls or lost championship games or the last four weeks, none of it matters. I\u2019ve just moved on, man.\u201d Brady passed for 271 yards in the first half as the Patriots (4-1) rebounded from a stinging shutout last week at home to Buffalo. Brady threw two short TD passes in the first half to Bennett before hooking up with his new teammate on a 37-yarder to give the Patriots a 30-7 lead in the third. He thoroughly enjoyed his return, even posing like Olympic track star Usain Bolt after a four-yard run to signal for a first down. \u201cI don\u2019t run much, and when I do I get excited,\u201d he said, smiling. Coach Bill Belichick replaced Brady with 6:02 left, greeting him on the sideline with a handshake and pat on the back. The 39-year-old was far from perfect, overthrowing Julian Edelman for a possible long TD, but Brady spread the ball around and showed a nice touch on a few passes, including a floater to Rob Gronkowski for 37 yards in the fourth. \u201cWe hadn\u2019t seen him in a while,\u201d said Edelman, Brady\u2019s team-mate for eight seasons who was not surprised by the performance. \u201cYou train with a guy. You go to camp with a guy. You\u2019ve played a number of years with a guy. To see what he\u2019s gone through, you\u2019re going to get excited.\u201d Following the game, Brady basked in the adulation from the Patriots fans ringing the entrance to the tunnel, Following his news conference, Brady stylish as always in a blue tailored suit, posed for a few photos with fans before he was greeted by friends, including former Browns tight end Aaron Shea, who threw his arms around his Michigan teammate. LeGarrette Blount added a 1-yard score for the Patriots, who all drew inspiration from Brady\u2019s return. \u201cWe were all intense today, all amped up,\u201d said Gronkowski, who had five catches for 109 yards. \u201cTom always brings the ampness to the table.\u201d Unfortunately for the Browns, a rebuilding season is spiraling out of control. Cleveland has dropped seven straight and 14 of 15, and Browns coach Hue Jackson is running out of quarterbacks after rookie Cody Kessler was knocked out in the first half with rib and chest injuries. Charlie Whitehurst replaced him, becoming the fifth quarterback to play for Cleveland in five games. When Brady ran on to the field for New England\u2019s first play, thousands of fans, many wearing his No12 jersey, cheered. At that moment, all was right again from Cambridge to Maine\u2019s coastline. Brady completed his first pass to his favorite target, Edelman, and connected twice on New England\u2019s opening drive with Gronkowski, who sidestepped a couple of tacklers and looked like the indomitable Gronk while bulling his way to the Cleveland one. It was a new beginning, a fresh start for Brady, who found comfort after so many months of angst. \u201cIt was fun to come out and play and fun to win,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
