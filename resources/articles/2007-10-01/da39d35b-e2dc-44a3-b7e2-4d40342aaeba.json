The Abortion Rights group is hosting a special screening of Vera Drake, Mike Leigh's film about a 1950s backstreet abortionist, lest it be forgotten how recently women's reproductive choices were very different. My own mother recalls testifying, as a junior doctor, at an inquest for a young woman who died after soap and water solution injected into her womb found its way into her bloodstream. Meanwhile, the past few weeks in the United States have seen feverish debate among rightwing bloggers over the latest piece of research purporting to establish a link between abortion and breast cancer. The Breast Cancer Epidemic, a study conducted by the London-based Pension and Population Research Institute, takes data from eight European countries and purports to establish that, among seven risk factors, abortion is the most reliable predictor of breast cancer. At best, this is speculative, feeding present facts into a particular economic model and extrapolating a possible future. But even those present facts are dubious. It finds an increase in abortion and in breast cancer in some countries, but there is no data to suggest this is among the same women. Yet the broad scientific consensus is that no link exists, as the Royal College of Gynaecologists confirms in its guidelines. A worldwide meta-analysis published in the Lancet in 2004 showed no positive association, while the world's largest long-term study of women, the Nurses Health Study in the US, reported likewise this year. So it comes as little surprise to discover the Papri study was funded by the anti-abortion group Life, and that the rightwing Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, where it was published, is home to arguments such as: \"The gay male lifestyle shortens life expectancy by about 20 years.\" It may be a relatively unimportant paper, but this is precisely the kind of junk science that has been submitted to the UK government's science and technology committee this week, as it considers evidence around the latest scientific developments in relation to abortion. Eight of the 50 written submissions to the committee allege a link between breast cancer and abortion, five of those from individuals who fail to disclose their anti-abortion bias. But it is the question of time limit - the number of weeks' gestation up to which a foetus can be legally aborted - that will be at the forefront of the committee's minds. The last two years have seen the present 24-week limit under increasing threat, with a succession of 10-minute rule bills put before parliament, doubtless prompted by a handful of well-publicised live births at under 24 weeks, and Professor Stuart Campbell's ultrasound images of a 12-week foetus apparently \"walking\" in the womb (which even Ann Widdecombe has conceded represents a photographic rather than a scientific advance). Last year a Mori poll found that 47% of women wanted the time limit reduced. But the facts are worth restating. Late abortion, at 20 or more weeks' gestation, is rare, at 1.6% of all procedures. One per cent of babies born at 22 weeks survive, rising to 11% at 23 weeks; 67% of those are severely disabled. In the Netherlands doctors do not resuscitate babies born below 25 weeks. And in its submission to the committee, the British Association of Perinatal Medicine states most of its members do not believe the survival of babies born under 24 weeks has improved to such an extent that they see any value in redefining the limit. What are seldom heard are the voices of women who have had late-term abortions. Research by Marie Stopes International in 2005 found many had simply not recognised they were pregnant until an advanced stage. If you are used to irregular periods and weight fluctuation, have no morning sickness, are using contraception or breast feeding, the thought may not occur. Others presented early but faced obstructive GPs or an overburdened NHS. And women's circumstances change. One described how her partner hit her with a baseball bat in the fifth month of her pregnancy. Pro-choice groups are concerned that the focus on time limit will soak up the committee's attention and stall the prospect of a radical overhaul of legislation later this year. A survey of GPs reported in Channel 4's Dispatches tonight finds that two in three support ending the current requirement for two doctors to approve a request for an abortion. The Royal College of Nursing is in favour of allowing nurses to assist early abortions. At a time when more than 500,000 women die annually in pregnancy or childbirth, and the US government is systematically halting funding of family planning programmes in developing countries that discuss contraception and abortion, it is more important than ever that the select committee send a message to the world that women's interests will be put first. Recently in this newspaper Professor Joanna Bourke asked why women are not more angry about the incidence of sexual violence. I would ask the same question about abortion. Why are we not more angry that the right of the most vulnerable women to exercise autonomy over their bodies may be restricted? Why are we not more angry that so many women's lives are lost thanks to an ugly taboo? British women have had 40 short years of choice. Our complacency may end it. l.brooks@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
