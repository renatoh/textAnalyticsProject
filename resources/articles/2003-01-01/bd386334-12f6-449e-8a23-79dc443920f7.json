After a bold display of front-running and precision jumping, Hussard Collonges was found out by the 15lb concession to Truckers Tavern up the long Haydock run-in. Bookmakers were suitably impressed to cut his Cheltenham Gold Cup odds to 10-1, and trainer Peter Beaumont is treading a familiar path, having won the Peter Marsh with his subsequent Gold Cup winner Jodami in 1993. \"That was a smashing run, giving so much weight away,\" said Beaumont. \"We might take him to Leopardstown for the Hennessy Gold Cup in three weeks' time. \"When we won at Haydock with Jodami some said we would leave the Gold Cup behind if we went to Ireland. But we didn't, did we?\" Truckers Tavern had his Gold Cup odds cut to 20-1. But Ferdy Murphy, his trainer, will wait until after next month's AON Chase at Newbury before coming to a final decision. \"I would love to have a crack at the Gold Cup with him at some stage, but I'm not sure if it will be this season,\" he said. There was no doubt about the next race for Flame Creek after Noel Chance's fast-improving seven-year-old had run away with the Champion Hurdle Trial by 13 lengths. It will be the real thing at Cheltenham in March, and Chance is sitting pretty with an ante-post voucher at odds of 66-1 about Flame Creek, who is now as low as 9-1 with Coral. Flame Creek was nearly caught out by a swinging hurdle two out, but recovered quickly to put his stamp on the race. Aintree, rather than Cheltenham, is on the agenda for Howard Johnson's up-and-coming six-year-old, Lord Transcend, who retained his unbeaten record with a gutsy defeat of Deano's Beeno in the Premier Stayers' Hurdle. It Takes Time, Tony McCoy's only winner of the day, had his odds for the SunAlliance Chase cut to 6-1, from 12's, by Coral after beating The Bajan Bandit by nine lengths. At Kempton, there was another smart performance from a novice when Farmer Jack ran out a six lengths winner from Epervier d'Or. This puts Seamus Mullins' chaser right in the Arkle Trophy reckoning and his odds were cut to 7-1. Paul Nicholls' patience with the hard-to-train Young Devereaux paid off when the 10-year-old held on from Seebald in the Tote Exacta Chase. Young Devereaux is in the Queen Mother Champion Chase, but connections are worried about the strain Cheltenham's undulations will put on his fragile legs. \"We've also got Cenkos for that race, so we'll have to wait and see,\" said Nicholls. Nicky Henderson's Non So booked his place in next month's Tote Gold Trophy at Newbury with a decisive victory in the Lanzarote Handicap Hurdle. Stable companion Bacchanal will wear blinkers in Saturday's Pillar Property Chase at Cheltenham, a race which will determine whether he has another crack at the Gold Cup or reverts to the smaller obstacles for the Stayers' Hurdle. \u00b7 Heavy rain has put Wednesday's Hexham card in doubt . There will be a course inspection at 10am this morning. Tomorrow's Leicester card is also under threat and Fontwell will hold a precautionary inspection this morning ahead of today's scheduled card."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
