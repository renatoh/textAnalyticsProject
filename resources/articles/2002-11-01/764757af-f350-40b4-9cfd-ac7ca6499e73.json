In Australia's Red Centre, this is the Aboriginal story of the sunrise. Waiting for the sun to burnish Uluru - the world's largest monolith - with its early morning rays, is an iconic Australian moment. In the pre-dawn, below-freezing chill of the southern hemisphere winter, the flaming torch of the sun is eagerly welcomed. Of course, if rising before dawn seems too frosty a trial, you can always lie back, flick a switch by the bed and raise electronic blinds up a 9ft-wide window. Plump up the pillows, point the remote at the CD player to start the didgeridoo music, make a cafetiere of coffee, or perhaps a buck's fizz from the free mini-bar, and lie back to wait for nature to perform its magic. The new luxury resort of Longitude 131 is the only accommodation with uninterrupted views of Uluru. Ten kilometres away, across the desert - very green these days after three years of above-average rainfall - the rock looms large on the horizon. All 15 of the tented rooms look out to Uluru, although three have views with others in the foreground. (Make sure you specify that you want an uninterrupted view.) Actually, the rooms are as much like \"tents\" as kitten heels are like walking boots. Basically, they're like a posh square marquee at a village fete raised up on metal stilts. However, the walls aren't canvas, they're solid, apart from the front wall facing Uluru which is a large sliding window. The ceiling, supported by a tall central pole, is tastefully ruched white material (not canvas), so it's only when you look up that you feel as if you're in a tent. The rooms, elevated above the spiky spinifex grass and young desert oaks, are a mix of colonial whimsy and sleek modernism: cold stone floors, a king-size bed backing on to a wood-laminate partition that houses the wardrobe and mini-bar with its metal mesh-work doors reminiscent of old-fashioned food safes. The walk-through bathroom has a large, water-wasting rectangular porcelain sink, inspired - according to the person who explained how to control the window blinds and CD player - by the troughs that early white Australians used to water their horses. Each room is themed around an Outback explorer - pioneers of the never-never. Paintings, photographs, chunks of text, old envelopes and other relics are framed and hung like pages from a scrap book. (My room was dedicated to Eddie Connellan, who established an Outback airline.) But apart from the didgeridoo music on the in-room CD and some good books in the little library, there is no reference to the traditional owners of the great rock on to which each room gazes. It is almost as though the developers of this Aus$9 million resort had little regard for the indigenous people, but the company says that the absence of anything Aboriginal is solely because it wanted Longitude 131 to be different from the other hotels in the tourist enclave of Ayers Rock Resort. The company owns all the Uluru accommodation including three hotels (plus apartments and a campsite). And as its other hotels, such as the newly renovated Lost Camel, do feature some exquisite Aboriginal arts, it can perhaps be forgiven for this apparent oversight. And one of the most interesting tours offered by Longitude 131 is a day-trip to an Aboriginal community. Here a local elder will take you on a walking tour along part of the \"seven sisters\" songline. On the way, you learn about local bush foods and hunting styles, and hear the story of a magical man with rather unusual anatomy who took a shine to the youngest of the seven sisters. The highlight is a visit to a cave where the local Yankunytjatjara speakers have painted their family history and legends for the past 20,000 years. Even the earliest paintings are still visible, and the latest, although some 50 years old, seem as vibrant as if they'd been painted only yesterday. In true Longitude 131-style, the tour to the Aboriginal community includes a morning tea stop and smoked-salmon sandwiches in your tucker bag. Indeed, all Longitude 131 activities are a little bit Absolutely Fabulous: there's the evening walk of a gorge in Uluru, which, after much spiritual and peaceful meditation on the glowing colours of the literally rusting rock, turns into a cocktail party when, rounding a corner of the gorge, you are confronted by safari guides in typical Outback hats (sans corks) serving chilled champagne in flutes and proffering canapes on silver platters. The sunset view - also accompanied by champagne and canapes - is from a dune behind the tented resort, where Uluru is on one horizon and the perhaps even more remarkable formation formerly known as the Olgas (now more correctly called by its Aboriginal name, Kata-Tjuta) on the other. Then there's the Sounds of Silence dinner, where diners eat out in the bush (warmed by braziers), on kangaroo and emu with lemon myrtle and other bush foods while a didgeridoo plays in the background. The starry night sky is the draw, and a resident astronomer is on hand to give a theatrical interpretation of constellations from several cultures. It may all sound a little like camping but, while the guides dress like boy scouts, there's not a marshmallow on a stick in sight. Indeed, the food at Longitude 131 - which, along with selected wines, is included in the room price - is superb. Executive chef, David Martin has designed menus including dishes such as goose ballotine with black truffle risotto and a cognac cream glaze, followed by barramundi fish with lemon aspen, layered with yam cakes and Yarra Valley red salmon roe. It's all divine. The set-menu dinners are served communally on long faux-colonial dining tables in the impressive Dune House with its beautifully curved tented ceiling. Vegetarian and other diets are catered for. The roasted vegetables and semi-dried tomatoes, goats' cheeses and polenta are as tasty and fresh as at any trendy Sydney eating place. Nothing is grown locally - it all has to be flown or trucked in. Just one of the incongruities of somewhere that likes to market itself as an ecotourism resort. The resort's environmental manager says that growing vegetables on the site would change the desert ecosystem. Ayers Rock airport was opened in 1984, the same year that the 450km road from Alice Springs was sealed, and these improvements that have seen visitor numbers increase from around 2,000 a year in the 1950s to 400,000 a year now. But it's only an exclusive 30 of those at any one time who will stay at Longitude 131. There are just 15 tented rooms (one of which is wheelchair accessible) designed by the Australian architect Philip Cox. I'm not sure if he ever slept in one though. Perhaps if he did, he would have noticed that a fair amount of glare from the lights lining the path in front of the rooms enters through the frosted glass door. It seemed a shame to be in the middle of the desert - where star-gazing is so enjoyable - and have light pollution spoiling it. But, as well as the superb cuisine, it is the view of the rock from the rooms that redeems Longitude 131 of any niggly design faults. As the ochre-dusted creator's daughter settles down for the night with her flaming torch, she seems to set Uluru alight. More champagne, darling?
