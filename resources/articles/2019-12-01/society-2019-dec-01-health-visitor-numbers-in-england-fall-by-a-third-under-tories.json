As of July this year, there were 6,931 full-time equivalent health visitors in England, says the party, which is a drop of 3,378 since the peak of 10,309 in October 2015, at the end of the national health visitor programme set up by the coalition government in 2011 to boost numbers. The coalition\u2019s programme said health visitors were crucial to ensuring families got off to the best possible start, going into homes before and after births to help, reassure and pick up problems. \u201cGetting this right can affect the child\u2019s physical and mental health and wellbeing, their readiness to learn and their ability to thrive later in life. This matters for the child, their family, local communities, and our wider economy,\u201d said the Department of Health\u2019s launch document in 2011. Funding for health visitors was shifted to local authorities as part of an NHS reorganisation and became another call on the public health budget, which has been affected by significant cuts. In June, the Institute of Health Visiting published a position paper, voicing concern \u201cabout the quality and effectiveness of the service that families are now receiving\u201d. More than a quarter of health visitors (27%) were each responsible for 500 or more children, it said. Labour says its analysis of NHS England data shows that the number of women who did not get a visit at 28 weeks or more of pregnancy increased by more than 6,000 between 2017-18 and 2018-19. New birth visits were delayed \u2013 11% nationally did not take place within the first 14 days. Across England, 15% of babies missed out on their six- to eight-week review last year, rising to 29% in London. More than 23% of children did not get their one-year review within the first 12 months of life, rising to 39% in London. Labour has promised to introduce a further mandated health visit at about three to four months after birth. Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow health secretary , said it would recruit more than 4,000 extra health visitors and school nurses if it got into power as well as put \u00a340bn into the NHS. \u201cYou can\u2019t trust the Tories with our NHS. The Conservatives used to boast of their commitment to increase the number of health visitors, yet we have actually seen health visitors in the NHS cut by a third in over three years, with patchy provision of visits. Babies and women deserve better at such a crucial point in their lives.\u201d Luciana Berger, the Liberal Democrats\u2019 health, wellbeing and social care spokeswoman, said the figures were particularly concerning as the country entered winter, putting more people at risk. \u201cIt is well known that the number of health visitors has fallen under the Conservative government over the last four years. The Conservatives\u2019 policy on Brexit is driving away EU staff from working in the NHS, and has also seen a fall in the number of nurses from the EU joining the NHS,\u201d she said. \u201cThe new nurse tax [visa and health surcharge costs] that the Conservatives are proposing at this election will only make the problem worse. \u201cLiberal Democrats would stop Brexit to support our NHS workforce, introduce an NHS recruitment strategy and invest \u00a37bn a year extra in health and social care.\u201d The health secretary, Matt Hancock, said: \u201cThere are more nurses working in the health service than in 2010, and the Conservatives are investing in our NHS to ensure we have the workforce we need for the future. \u201cA Conservative majority government will deliver 50,000 more nurses and create 6,000 more GPs \u2013 to make sure everyone can get the care and treatment they need faster. \u201cJeremy Corbyn\u2019s plans for a four-day week and for uncontrolled and unlimited immigration would cripple our NHS. Only Boris Johnson and the Conservatives can get Brexit done and focus on delivering for the NHS.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
