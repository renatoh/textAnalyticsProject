We sat on flat stones and slid down the face of the rocks. We did this until our backsides were so sore we could hardly sit down.\" Walking down the grassy slope into a breeze, I came upon it: Mandela's \"sliding stone\". The big granite boulder has an unmissable track worn smooth and shiny by his childhood sport. It is one of the rocky outcrops overlooking the bucolic valley of Qunu, where South Africa's first black president grew up and which, at 93, he still calls home. I had come here on the \"Mandela trail\" in the rolling hills of the area formerly known as the Transkei. I've previously stood in the pokey bed chamber where it is thought William Shakepeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, the grander birthplace of Winston Churchill at Blenheim Palace and the cramped abode where Stan Laurel breathed his first in Ulverston, Cumbria. Thus I could hardly neglect one of the most famous people on the planet, a man who, in South Africa, has been canonised in his own lifetime. Johannesburg alone boasts a Mandela statue in Mandela Square, a Mandela bridge, Mandela house, Mandela theatre and Mandela foundation. Indeed, if he wasn't so authentically loved, such idolatry could look North Korean. When it was recently announced that Mandela's face will replace the Big Five wild animals on the national currency, one columnist described it as \"a bit banana republic\". Have those rocky outcrops in Qunu already been carved out like Mount Rushmore? Not quite. In fact, it's all still rather low key. This is no Disney but rather a sleepy village \u2013 clinic, post office, school, matchbox houses and allotments \u2013 set in a glorious green valley that would make Wordsworth weep. Admittedly, there's a national motorway running past Mandela's peach-coloured, gated mansion, but drivers still often have to brake hard to avoid casual stray cattle (known locally as \"Transkei traffic lights\"). The \"sliding stone\" is to be found at the elegantly designed Nelson Mandela Museum \u2013 but not much else is. When I visited, there was a mildly absorbing exhibition on Mandela and one of his fellow struggle giants, chief Albert Luthuli. But there were no precious documents or objects, and a second exhibition space felt neglected and unfinished. The museum also has conference rooms, dormitories, a computer suite and a restaurant that could not muster a coffee or tea. I glimpsed one man who may or may not have been a tourist. Well, never mind. Mandela spent part of his childhood here as a herd boy practising stick fighting with other youths, but was actually born in the even smaller hamlet of Mvezo, nearly an hour's drive away on a bumpy gravel road in stupendous surroundings. The local chief in Mvezo is the former president's grandson and heir apparent, Mandla Mandela, a controversial figure accused by some of selling the future TV rights to his grandfather's funeral. On a day that a local newspaper claimed that a police warrant had been issued for his arrest on a charge of bigamy, Mandla was not to be seen. But here, in the middle of nowhere, was his \"Great Place\", a cluster of newly constructed buildings in traditional style with thatched roofs. Is there a sign, a shrine, a tour guide to show the way to Nelson Mandela's birthplace? No, but there was a security manager who says something in Xhosa. My interpreter translated for me: \"The community here loves Mandela. If you speak ill of him, they will kill you.\" And Mandela's birthplace? We were walked down a bank to a series of newly built thatched-roof rondavels. A group of workmen in overalls stopped and stared. Finally, standing opposite a kraal, or livestock enclosure, the security manager pointed to an empty rondavel that was indistinguishable from all the rest. \"That is the birthplace. No photographs.\" Alas, archaeological purists should look away now. After years in which the ruins of the original hut where Nelson Mandela was born were preserved, one day Mandla destroyed what was left of the walls and foundations and built a replica on top. Curators back at the Mandela museum were said to be heartbroken. As acts of sacrilege in South Africa go, it's hard to beat. It is rumoured that Mandla will seek to have Mandela buried here too, eventually, a move already causing anger in Qunu. \"He's a silly boy,\" one relative told me. A woman who has known the anti-apartheid hero all her life said: \"Nobody likes what Mandla is doing, but Nelson is very old and doesn't even know it. It's being done without his consent.\" Whether these remote places are ready for the onslaught of American TV crews, British newshounds and the rest of the world's media for that sad occasion, when it comes, is doubtful. Nor it is clear how Mandela-land can remain unspoiled while also attracting the tourists who currently pour money into Mandela's former home in Johannesburg or his old prison cell on Robben Island. On the first page of Long Walk to Freedom, Mandela notes that he was born in 1918, the year that marked the end of the Great War and an influenza epidemic that killed millions throughout the world. \"Mvezo, however, remains a place apart, a tiny precinct removed from the world of great events, where life was lived much as it had been for hundreds of years.\" Set among the hills, valleys and gently flowing river, much of this tranquillity remains. But one day the storm of great events will come here, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
