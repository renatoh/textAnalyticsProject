The National Cyber Security Centre, a branch of the intelligence agency, has launched the suspicious email reporting service with a simple request of the public: forward any dubious emails to report@phishing.gov.uk, and the NCSC\u2019s automated scanning system will check for scam emails and immediately remove criminal sites. \u201cTechnology is helping us cope with the coronavirus crisis and will play a role helping us out of it, but that means cybersecurity is more important than ever,\u201d said Ciaran Martin, chief executive officer of the NCSC. \u201cThat\u2019s why we have created a new national reporting service for suspicious emails \u2013 and if they link to malicious content, it will be taken down or blocked. By forwarding messages to us, you will be protecting the UK from email scams and cybercrime.\u201d The reporting service has been launched after the organisation removed more than 2,000 online scams related to coronavirus in the last month, including: 471 fake online shops selling fraudulent coronavirus-related items 555 malware distribution sites set up to cause significant damage to visitors 200 phishing sites seeking personal information such as passwords and credit card details 832 advance-fee frauds where a large sum of money is promised in return for a set-up payment Some scams prey on the fear of the virus, according to information security experts FireEye: many phishing attacks purport to share tips on how to avoid being infected with the disease, or reports on fellow employees or students with Covid-19, in order to encourage victims to enter their credentials to see the information. Others appealed to a sense of greed. One widespread scam, uncovered in March by the journalist Brain Krebs, employed victims as \u201cmoney mules\u201d: people used to launder the proceeds of cybercrime through their own bank accounts. They were recruited through the pretence that they were helping process donations for a Coronavirus relief fund, and asked to turn a blind eye to the disproportionately large \u201ccommission\u201d they received to \u201ccover their expenses\u201d. \u201cIf you receive a job solicitation via email that sounds too good to be true, it probably is related in some way to one of these money-laundering schemes,\u201d Krebs said. The NCSC has also published new guidance on how to use videoconferencing tools securely, following the rise in \u201cZoombombing\u201d attacks: pranksters taking advantage of lax default settings on the popular video chat app Zoom to invade and disrupt private meetings. It recommends that users not make meetings public, connect only to people through their contacts or address book, and never post the link or password publicly. \u201cIf you are organising the chat for your family or friends, consider using the lobby feature to ensure you know who has arrived,\u201d the NCSC says. \u201cThis is especially useful if individuals are joining the meeting via an unrecognised phone number. Verify participants\u2019 identity when they join the meeting.\u201d At the beginning of April, Zoom\u2019s founder and CEO, Eric Yuan, committed to a freeze on new development while the platform focused on solving the privacy and security issues uncovered after a burst of new users. \u201cWe have fallen short of the community\u2019s, and our own, privacy and security expectations,\u201d Yuan said. \u201cFor that, I am deeply sorry.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
