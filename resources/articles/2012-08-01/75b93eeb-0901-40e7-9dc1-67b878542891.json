The Chelsea captain was given a taster of what lies in store for him during Sunday's Community Shield at Villa Park, when opposing Manchester City fans jeered him from the moment that his name was read out before kick-off. They chanted that he was a racist, they booed his every touch and the levels of hostility persisted until after the game, which City won 3-2, when Terry led the Chelsea team to the podium to receive their runners-up medals. That was the prompt for a further round of chanting. Terry did not react; his features remained stony throughout and Cech, his team-mate of eight years, suggested that his detractors were wasting their time. Terry is not exactly a stranger to terrace abuse. In the eyes of plenty of non-Chelsea supporters, he is Public Enemy No1. \"He's a strong lad,\" Cech said. \"He knows this will go on and on every time we play away from home. I don't think he was surprised and I don't think it will affect him in any way. All I need is for him to be JT and to play well. As long as he does that, everyone will be happy.\" Terry was found not guilty at Westminster magistrates court on 13 July of racially abusing Ferdinand during the Queens Park Rangers vs Chelsea Premier League fixture last October because the senior district judge, Howard Riddle, felt that there was sufficient doubt over the precise context of Terry's words. The Football Association, though, after resuming its own inquiry, has charged Terry with using racially abusive language towards Ferdinand. Terry has denied the charge and requested a personal hearing before an FA panel, although no dates have yet been set. He received good news on a more minor disciplinary matter on Monday when Uefa reduced his three-match European suspension on appeal to two games, with the third deferred for a probationary period of three years. The defender was sent off in Chelsea's Champions League semi-final second-leg at Barcelona for kneeing Alexis S\u00e1nchez in an off-the-ball incident and he missed the final against Bayern Munich. He will sit out the European Super Cup against Atletico Madrid on 31 August but he will now be available for Chelsea's opening Champions League group phase tie this season. Terry's team-mate Branislav Ivanovic could celebrate a greater reprieve. He was sent off in the Community Shield for a reckless challenge on City's Aleksandar Kolarov and he and the Chelsea management staff left Villa Park assuming that he was set for a three-game domestic ban. But due to a little-known FA rule change, which states that cards picked up in non-competitive pre-season fixtures including the Community Shield do not count for suspensions, Ivanovic has been cleared to play in his club's opening Premier League fixture at Wigan Athletic on Sunday. Ivanovic's red card changed the complexion of Sunday's game, with City coming back from 1-0 down to lead 3-1 and Cech argued that there were reasons for Chelsea to be cheerful, despite a fourth successive pre-season defeat. \"You could see that 11 v 11, we competed very well with City and we went 1-0 up,\" the goalkeeper said. \"It's a long season but we have a good squad and we have good numbers so if we have some injuries, we can cope.\" Chelsea are, in Cech's words, a \"changing team\", with some of the older guard, including Didier Drogba, departed and exciting young attacking talents to be integrated. Oscar and Marko Marin were unavailable against City but Eden Hazard, the \u00a332m signing from Lille, started on the left wing. He endured a mixed afternoon but his confidence, on the ball and in front of the post-match microphones, was clear. \"The English game is very fast and I believe it's a perfect style of play for my qualities,\" Hazard said. \"I'm here to play these very intense games. In France, it could be intense for 10-15 minutes and then quiet but here, it is always at the maximum. I was stopped by big [physical] tackles but it was the same at Lille. People always tried to stop me playing hard. But when it's fair, like it was [on Sunday], it's OK. \"I'm pleased with my performance. I can do better, of course, and adjust more with the team but I'm confident. I have settled very well. I have a house now near to the Chelsea training ground and I enjoy my new life. My team-mates are very cool \u2026 great players and nice guys.\" Hazard prefers to play as a No.10, although with Juan Mata and Oscar at the club, he faces stiff competition and opportunity would appear to knock for him on the flank. \"The main thing for me is to play,\" Hazard said. \"I would play left-back if the coach told me to do so. I'm in a big club. I'm the new one in the team and it's my job to adapt myself. I saw more of the ball at Lille in a free role but now, I have to do better playing with fewer balls. I think the title race is very open. The two Manchester clubs seem favourites but Chelsea will have a word to say in this race.\" Hazard's arrival, together with that of Oscar and the promise of a further attacking signing, has fuelled talk of a more expansive style at Stamford Bridge. Cech spoke of playing \"a slightly different way\" but he is sufficiently steeped in the club's methods to know that finding a way to win is the bottom line. \"We will want to play nice football but the manager will want us to win games,\" Cech said. \"If you can be attractive, that's great but if you can't, and you have to win ugly \u2026 It's something we've always known. How to win games.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
