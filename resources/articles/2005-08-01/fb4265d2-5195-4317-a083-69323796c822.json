Headlines such as \"Bra wars\" and \"Storm in a D cup\" have been fun ways to explain the complicated trade battle between Europe and China over just how many millions of garments should be allowed into the European Union each year. In parallel with this European crisis, however, a very similar scenario has been unfolding in the United States. The US has seen clothing imports from China increase by a huge 125% during the first six months of this year. The US, like the EU, has blocked the import of millions of garments. And like the EU, it is the clothing importers that are clamouring for the American government to broker a deal with the Chinese that will allow them to import more cheap Chinese clothes. But that's where the similarities end. Looking at the outrage from retailers over the millions of stranded trousers and bras in warehouses, it would be easy to conclude that the EU was up to its usual pork barrel protectionist tricks. But the agreement hammered out by the EU and China in June is actually more favourable to China than the limits imposed by the US government. Europe and China agreed on voluntary export quota limits of between 8% and 12.5%. The EU says the measures are temporary and merely intended to help the European textile market's transition to the fully unrestricted market by 2008. American negotiators are meeting with their counterparts in Beijing this week to conduct their own round of trade talks. \"The US has always been more of a proponent of free trade than the EU and that means the US administration must seriously consider taking a more relaxed attitude towards China's textile and garments trade,\" says Leon Chik of HSBC. However, both the EU and the US can only impose additional quotas until 2008, when the market will be unrestricted. In reality, the new quotas are merely a peanut in the path of the steamroller that is the Chinese textile industry. China's textile industry is at least four times larger than the second largest textile exporter, Turkey. It attracts the largest number of fabric, material and accessory suppliers. Its factories are enormous and able to create huge economies of scale. It has a vast, cheap labour force. Many agricultural labourers are delighted to give up toiling in the fields and work in a factory instead. It is capable of churning out millions upon millions of garments. The US, however, may end up still in control. The huge market share of Wal-Mart means that it almost always calls the shots with its suppliers. Mass market items such as T-shirts, jeans and cotton trousers are particularly vulnerable to intense price pressure. The Chinese textile industry may be the leanest and meanest in the world, but it still operates on very tight margins. Recent trends towards shorter ordering times and smaller orders put a strain on textile and garment companies since they reduce the economies of scale. Like any other industry, it too will have to adapt to survive. charlotte.moore@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
