Almost four million learners enrolled in FE colleges in 2002-03, an increase of 1% on the 2001-02 figure of 3.87 million. The number of under 19-year-olds increased almost 4%, from 650,000 to 670,000, while the number of students older than 19 rose slightly, from 3.22 million to 3.23 million. Meanwhile, 512,000 trainees participated in work-based learning (WBL) last year. The number of people enrolled on the much-maligned modern apprenticeship (MA) scheme rose by 5% this year, from 213,500 to 224,300, evidence of a shift away from national vocational qualifications (NVQs). Engineering, technology and manufacturing was last year's most popular work-based area (18.1%), with retail, customer service and transportation, and business administration, management and professional courses close behind (14.5% and 12.4% respectively). This is the first year that combined figures for both FE students and WBL have been published. According to the LSC, the results show an overall increase in qualifications gained. Ken Pascoe, the LSC's director of operations, welcomed the news. \"Clearly, the efforts of the LSC and our partners are paying dividends. These figures represent progress on our key targets - for keeping young people in learning and helping them to achieve more, and for attracting adults back to improve their basic skills. \"The skills strategy white paper puts a strong emphasis on universal attainment of NVQ level two by the population. The rising numbers of people in FE show the sector is in a strong position to respond. The move to plan-led funding, will increase the sector's ability to meet the demands we all face,\" he said. \"We are grateful to all the colleges and training organisations who have made this happen; they can take as much satisfaction from these results as we can.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
