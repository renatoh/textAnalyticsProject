While drums were used on the last occasion of a Chinese leader\u2019s visit to the UK to drown out pro-democracy and Tibet protesters, regulations governing the playing of instruments in royal parks mean that they will not be allowed to ramp up the decibels. The drummers are expected to be among those taking part in rival protestsfor the first official visit by a Chinese head of state since Hu Jintao in 2005. Xi and his wife Peng Liyuan arrived late last night at Heathrow airport, where they were greeted on behalf of the Queen by Viscount Hood and by the foreign secretary, Philip Hammond. Hundreds of protesters from the ranks of Amnesty International, pro-Tibetan groups and other Chinese dissident groups are planning to gather in St James\u2019s Park on Tuesday morning before Xi is driven along the Mall to Buckingham Palace, where he is scheduled to attend a banquet. The royal parks policy on protests inside their grounds stipulates that \u201cno entertainment or other performances may take place\u201d. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe royal parks have a long history of accommodating peaceful public protests. We usually only allow protests in Hyde Park but in exceptional circumstances we will consider applications for demonstrations elsewhere providing they adhere to the park regulations. But we must not lose sight that these are public parks, primarily places for recreation, and we must ensure they are managed in a way that caters for all park users.\u201d In addition to the larger groups organised by Amnesty and other pro-democracy organisations, the anti-Xi protests are expected to be bolstered by demonstrations staged by smaller groups such as those representing members of China\u2019s ethnic Uighur population from the restive Xinjiang region. Among those planning to join the protests is Shao Jiang, who was involved in the Chinese student movements during the 80s and who helped to draft a list of demands in 1989 during the Tiananmen Square protests. He told the Guardian that the demonstrations in London were very important but suggested the British authorities had been guilty of \u201cdouble standards\u201d in the past when it came to the policing of such events. \u201cFrom my experience of policing in Britain, there has been a problem. For example, human rights protesters have been told that they cannot use megaphones, but they have allowed Chinese pro-government groups to use drums,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also remember when the Olympic torch was making its way through the streets of the UK ahead of China hosting the games. Protesters were kettled by police, and yet supporters of China were allowed to walk freely.\u201d Joshua Wong, an 18-year-old Hong Kong student leader and pro-democracy activist who is currently in London, said that the protests were important at a time when China was arresting more human rights activists. \u201cWe hope to let Xi know that it is not possible to arrest people all over the world,\u201d said Wong, one of the most prominent faces of Hong Kong\u2019s so-called umbrella movement. \u201cHowever, the most important thing is the attitude of the British prime minister. He needs to raise the issue. Otherwise Xi will continue to focus on the core issue of investment.\u201d Scotland Yard said in a statement late on Monday that it has been planning for the Chinese state visit for more than five months. It added: \u201cWe have been engaging with a variety of groups that have stated their intention to demonstrate during the visit of the Chinese president. Where there are demonstrations, officers from the Police Liaison Team will be on the ground to engage with protestors. An appropriate policing plan will be in place throughout the duration of the visit.\u201d It added that a planned demonstration and a counter demonstration are due to take place near the George VI memorial in St James\u2019s Park, north of the Mall, between 11am and 1pm on Tuesday. Also expected to protest are representatives of Falun Gong, the spiritual sect banned by China in 1999 as a cult and severely repressed ever since. The day before the Communist leader begins his four-day state visit, representatives from human rights groups gathered in the Palace of Westminster for a \u201cstateless lunch\u201d \u2013 held as an alternative to the state banquet the Queen is hosting for Xi at Buckingham Palace on Tuesday evening. The UK director of Human Rights Watch, David Mepham, called on David Cameron to press for reform amid accusations of a further decline in human rights in China. \u201cSince President Xi came to power three years ago, human rights conditions in the People\u2019s Republic of China have deteriorated alarmingly,\u201d he said. \u201cDavid Cameron should speak out strongly and publicly against these abuses, urge far-reaching reform, and press for the release of all those activists, lawyers and journalists so unjustly imprisoned. \u201cThis is a moral duty, but also in our interests. China\u2019s repression, pervasive corruption, its flawed judicial system and rampant impunity \u2013 these are a grave threat to China\u2019s stability and economy. And that matters to all of us.\u201d The gathering was hosted by Labour MP Fabian Hamilton, who is chair of the all party parliamentary group for Tibet. One of the largest groupings of protesters are expected to gather around the Free Tibet campaign, which is demonstrating against China\u2019s long occupation of the Himalayan territory and subsequent rights abuses there. More Tibetans would also protest outside the state banquet, according to Alistair Currie from the Free Tibet campaign. He hailed a promise by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, to raise the issue of human rights with Xi, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s very welcome that it looks like someone is going to be raising human rights directly to Xi Jinping. The UK government says they raise issues in private, but we had a meeting with them earlier this week and they would not commit to anything that was going to happen.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
