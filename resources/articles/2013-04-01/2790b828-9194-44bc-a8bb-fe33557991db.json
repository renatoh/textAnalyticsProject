Earlier, the president was briefed on the draft bill by Senators Chuck Schumer and John McCain \u2013 leaders of the so-called gang of eight who have negotiated the bipartisan legislation. Plans for a major public launch were put on hold following the bombings in Boston, but an outline of the bill was released on Tuesday afternoon. It includes a route to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who have lived in the US since December 31, 2011, as well as anyone who has close family members in the US deported for non-criminal reasons before that date. In exchange, the Senate proposes to tighten immigration at US borders to prevent further illegal entry in future. Measures include building a wall along parts of the Mexican border and calling in the National Guard. \"This bill is clearly a compromise, and no one will get everything they wanted, including me,\" said Obama. \"But it is largely consistent with the principles that I have repeatedly laid out for comprehensive reform. \"This bill would continue to strengthen security at our borders and hold employers more accountable if they knowingly hire undocumented workers. It would provide a pathway to earned citizenship for the 11 million individuals who are already in this country illegally.\" The bill is likely to receive Senate support but must still pass the House of Representatives where some Republicans are likely to be more sceptical. Other proposals include more visas for low skill workers and an end to quotas for a higher-skilled workers \u2013 a measure pushed by the technology industry. There will also be investment to reduce a backlog of up to 20 years for family applications. Obama said the legislation would \"modernize our legal immigration system so that we're able to reunite families and attract the highly-skilled entrepreneurs and engineers who will help create good paying jobs and grow our economy. These are all commonsense steps that the majority of Americans support.\" The publication of the bill follows weeks of backroom negotiations to square off conflicting interest groups such as labour unions and big-business lobbyists, but the proposals retain much of the radicalism outlined by Obama when he first announced it as a second-term priority. By far the most significant impact will be felt by millions of Latino and Asian families already living in the US, particularly the so-called \"dreamers\" \u2013 the foreign-born children of undocumented migrants who have grown up in the US but who currently lack legal status and can be deported at any time. Edward Alden, an immigration expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, said: \"The question is how many of these people will come forward, as they have lived for years being scared of government. It looks like they will because the cut-off is quite generous: they only have to show they have been here since 31 December 2011.\" People deported before this date will be able apply if they can show they have close family members in the US and no criminal record. Once granted the so-called Registered Provisional Immigrant Status, they will not be eligible for welfare benefits but will be able apply to transfer to the existing green card status eventually. \"There is nothing in here that looks like an effort to score political points \u2013 which is often not the case in Washington,\" said Alden. \"It looks like a fair attempt to respond to the different interests.\" Union groups fought particularly hard to limit any flood of new low-wage immigrants into the still-weak US labour market, and make sure that new system of W-visas would not be seen as \"guest worker\" system. The bill proposes that W-visa recipients could eventually become citizens and would have work rights for their family members. The US technology industry has also fought hard for an end to caps for highly skilled migrants, which is said to be hampering employers, particularly in Silicon Valley. The legislation will go before the Senate judiciary committee on Friday, although it remains to be seen whether the House speaker, John Boehner, will allow a sufficient number of moderates in the lower chamber to vote in favour. \"I am optimistic,\" added Alden. \"Republican leaders recognise they have to act on this.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
