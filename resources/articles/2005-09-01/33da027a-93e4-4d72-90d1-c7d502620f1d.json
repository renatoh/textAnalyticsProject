When just about anything is possible, picking where to deploy people and cash can be a risky and perplexing business. But sometimes it is not the new or the most sophisticated piece of technology which gives you the best results, but an inspired editorial idea. One such came out of our sports desk at Guardian Unlimited four years ago and has become one of the most frequently cited favourite items on the site - the minute-by-minute coverage of football, rugby, cricket and sometimes even tennis or horse racing. Essentially the over-by-over should not work. It consists of one or two of our team sitting in the office watching a sporting event on a television set and describing it to the outside world on a rolling report. When audio streaming is now available on most computers, when televisions are increasingly apparent in public places, the idea that anyone would sit and refresh a computer screen as the best way to absorb a commentary just seems a bit daft. But it isn't. Rather like that other surreal sporting triumph - Gillette Soccer Special on Sky Sports, where four men in suits sit and describe what they are seeing on televisions you can't see - the chemistry between the commentators and the audience transcends the action they describe. This summer our ashes over-by-over coverage reached extraordinary heights - on the busiest days the traffic it attracted was higher than the traffic to the front page of our network which, it has to be said, is unheard of for cricket and rare even for the biggest football matches. The commentaries of Rob Smyth, Sean Ingle, Mike Adamson and James Dart spanned all 61 sessions played in the five tests, and gathered our own barmy army of readers. The key to its success is the fact that the written word can deliver more than a linear commentary on television or radio. You can visit a report in the afternoon and scan the morning's play to find the \"WICKET!\" references without waiting for highlights and scoreboards and what's more you can read what it feels like to watch England squeak a crucial test by two runs. And it is of course in the writing. \"Four tests and more snakish twists and turns than Peter Mandelson on the Pepsi Max Big One\" is how Sean Ingle opened his report for the final day of the fifth Test. And then there is the audience. In the spirit of radio's Test Match Special where the sound of Johnners, Aggers, Blowers et al discussing the merits of a listener's fruit cake became as much part of the commentary as the thwack of leather on willow, once the sports team had started minute-by-minute coverage for football the emails started to roll in, and therefore it seemed sensible to roll them into the coverage. Now the erudite discussions of our users - from the migration of all cricket coverage to satellite TV to the rather alarming regularity of Rob Smyth's morning headaches - are a central part of the unfolding narrative. The truth is that the over-by-over is a godsend for the deskbound, and reaches peak popularity during the working day. But it's also clear from our statistics that readers return after a match is long over to relive and savour or check what really happened. With video and audio increasingly available it is tempting to add bells and whistles, but there is something about the simplicity of a sports writer, a television set, a keyboard and a lot of strange people hanging on their every word which has a stripped down simplicity - and I can't imagine us changing that. \u00b7 Emily Bell is editor-in-chief of Guardian Unlimited Guardian.co.uk top 5 1.

Sorry, Mr President, Katrina is not 9/11 The two disasters, says Simon Schama, revealed very different faces of the US How the bloggers saw it ... \"Why is science in the media so often pointless, simplistic, boring, or just plain wrong?\" asked Bad Science columnist Ben Goldacre last week The main reason for this kind of thing happening is perhaps a more general problem with the media: they must entertain or shock their audience. Well-reasoned, balanced arguments, which most science consists of, isn't exciting. Simon Grimshaw at www.funkysimon.com I think the problem is much wider than reporting on science, or even the prevalence of humanities graduates in the broadsheet press. Surely it's also about the pressure in all daily print media to shoehorn the facts into too little space - the better to fit in lifestyle stories and entertainment news - and to file off the rough edges to make the report more accessible at the expense of accuracy and depth. John Robinson at Soreeyes.org Really [the article] ought to be compulsory reading for every news editor and executive editor and editor. And then framed and put over their desks, and re-read occasionally. www.charlesarthur.com Any claim to being correct is seen as merely a means to exercise power over those who claim another truth. Thus it follows that science is a tool of oppressing the have-nots and must therefore be destroyed. There's a huge problem with that project: the pursuit of scientific knowledge, and the technology that derives from it, is creating power. By focusing only on mocking the pursuit of science, the media are denying the knowledge to those who do not make it their living. By limiting the spread of knowledge, the postmodern attack on science in the name of social justice defeats itself. Ted Wade at gametheworld.blogspot.com Tuesday's paper revealed that a Chinese company is using skin harvested from the corpses of executed convicts to develop cosmetics This reminds me of the scene in Fight Club where the two fellas make a run to the plastic surgery clinic to get human fat to make soap with. To me, knowing that there's anything animaly in cosmetics makes me gag. But somehow it's more disgusting to have human in cosmetics than the usual widely used animal ingredients. Triddle at www.veganporn.com The mainland Chinese have a fairly hardnosed \"waste not, want not\" approach to \"bad social elements\". Amnesty International believes around 3,400 people were executed last year, with a further 6,000 on death row. Collagen? Apparently, it is injected to plump up people's lips and flatten out their wrinkles. Very popular in Britain, so they say. misterbijou.blogspot.com So the next time your missus comes home from the clinic and announces that she's had her \"lips done\", don't be quite so quick to jump in there and try them out. chriswheatley.typepad.com Best of the web Over by over After four Tests and more snakish twists and turns than Peter Mandelson on the Pepsi Max Big One, England are 98 overs from winning the Ashes. What price the Aussies chasing 240 off 30 overs to win? 22nd over: WICKET! Vaughan c Gilchrist b McGrath 45 (England 67-2) McGrath gets the tiniest amount of outswing, Vaughan gets the nick and Gilchrist takes a diving catch. Game on! WICKET! Bell c Warne b McGrath 0 Bell goes first ball! McGrath produces an identikit delivery and Bell edges it behind to Warne at first slip. This is squeaky bum time for England. 24th over: England 67-3 (Trescothick 21, Pietersen 0) Pietersen is dropped! Gilchrist gets a touch and it hits Hayden on the knee. 33rd over: WICKET! Trescothick lbw Warne 33 (England 109-4) Warne gets prodigious turn, it stays low and Trescothick is hit in front of off-stump. 37th over: England 122-4 (Pietersen 34, Flintoff 4) More easy singles than Magaluf high street. 38th over: WICKET! Flintoff c and b Warne 8 (England 122-5) Warne takes an excellent catch at ankle height. 51st over: England 182-5 (Pietersen 78, Collingwood 5) That's drinks, and England have one hand on the Ashes. 52nd over: WICKET! Collingwood c Ponting b Warne 10 (England 186-6) Just when England look home and hosed, Collingwood dabs one to Ponting, who takes a desperate catch at silly point. Game on! 57th over: WICKET! Jones b Tait 1 (England 199-7) Tait produces an absolute Exocet which rips out Jones's off stump and sends it tumbling 10 yards behind the wicket. Game on! 63rd over: England 219-7 (Pietersen 104, Giles 5) Pietersen reaches his maiden Test hundred. But Joshua Davis writes: \"You don't need to remind us after each wicket that it's game on. From the burning in our stomachs and the residual taste of vomit in our throats, I think we all know!\" 72nd over England 257-7 (add 6 for their lead; Pietersen 130, Giles 17) Pietersen drives sweet and straight for a regal six, his sixth of the innings. \"Is Pietersen the first person ever to score a Test century with a dead raccoon under his helmet?\" asks Rick Eyre. He's the first South African-born one, for sure. 80th over: England 298-7 (Pietersen 153, Giles 35) Make that an Ashes-record seven sixes in an innings for Pietersen. 82nd over: WICKET! England 308-8 (Pietersen b McGrath 158) \"So let's get this right,\" begins Paul Store. \"After 16 years we have finally defeated a country with only a third of our population, with the help of bad weather. Why is this worth a celebration? Am I missing something?\" Serotonin? 91st over: WICKET! England 335-9 (Giles b Warne 59) How's that for a parting gesture from Shane Warne? For the umpteenth and last time on English soil, he bowls a Pom around his legs with a jaffa that drifted out and ripped back in. WICKET! England 335 all out (Harmison c Hayden b Warne 0) Hayden at slip takes a wonderful catch to give Warne his sixth wicket (40 for the series). He and Glenn McGrath embrace warmly. For the incessant torture of the last 12 years, cheers fellas. ENGLAND HAVE WON THE ASHES! Australia are offered the light. Two minutes later, England are waiting for confirmation the game has been called off, but before that happens some nugget has to leaf through 742,013 pages of the laws of cricket. Umpire Bowden marches out with that other umpire and symbolically removes the bails. We've effing done it! \u00b7 sport.theguardian.com/ashes2005 Blog watch The Berliner is born Sunday 11.09.05, 10:18am The Berliner has been the most heavily planned operation in the Guardian's history, but the vast majority of tomorrow's paper is yet to be written. 10:59 News conference is delayed. The City section are angry that a tale about the Premier League they were working on was published in the Observer (it's our sister paper, but this is war). 11:25 The deputy editor (news), Paul Johnson, is relieved that it's a fairly good news day for a Sunday. I have a feeling that he has got something he is not telling me. I wouldn't blurt, blogger's honour ... 1:20pm The G2 cover story has just been switched from something that was in place on Friday to a newsy piece. Star feature writer Oliver Burkeman looks deceptively unpanicked by the fact that he has to write 2,000 words in three hours. 1:46 Caught up with Richard Norton-Taylor, our veteran security affairs editor, between his 11am deadline (\"the earliest in over 30 years\") on the deployment of UK troops in Afghanistan, and a 2pm deadline on the hosting of one of the world's biggest arms fairs in London tomorrow. 2:08 Foreign editor Harriet Sherwood is worried that the main story, the Palestinian reoccupation of Gaza, is not turning out to be very clear-cut and one on President Bush's visit to New Orleans won't happen until 10pm, way after her first edition deadline of 5pm. 3:10 Brief working lunch with John Carvel, social affairs editor. He's just been doing a tale about happiness (there'll be a lot of that in the new Berliner Guardian). 5:34 G2 dispatched its 36 pages to the printers to a spontaneous round of applause. At the last moment the editor noticed that three huge standing caps (that start each paragraph) read T I T. Meanwhile, foul play is afoot. I apparently gave too much information away about a story Richard Norton-Taylor was working on and the Times has picked it up (is there no honour?). 7:39 The front page has been sent to the printers amid a round of applause. 9:41 The first edition is delivered by the country's highest paid paper girl: Carolyn McCall, chief executive of the Guardian. 10:08 The real inquest begins ... in the Coach and Horses situated almost in the Guardian's backyard beside which the Fleet river - icon of newspapers - still runs (it's underground but you can see and hear it from a drain outside the Coach). Guardian journos as far as you can see. \u00b7 blogs.theguardian.com/editors"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
