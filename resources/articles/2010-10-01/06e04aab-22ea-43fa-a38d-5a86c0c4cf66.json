With only eight weeks to go until Fifa votes on the venues for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, the Leaders in Football event that begins at Stamford Bridge today is expected to be dominated by the race as the crowded field jostles for public profile and lobbies executive committee members. England 2018's chief executive, Andy Anson, will unveil 18 pledges to key constituencies and use them as the basis of a speech in which he is expected to elaborate on the message that a commercially successful World Cup in England can benefit legacy projects around the world. \"The 'Pledges to Partners' highlight some new commitments we are making to Fifa and to its stakeholders and reaffirms others we have made within the detail of our bid book,\" Anson said. \"We believe these commitments provide a clear demonstration of why we would be the best possible partner for Fifa and the global football family. \"They cover every aspect of our bid: passion, diversity, world-class infrastructure, minimal risk, major-events experience, commercial leadership and the creation of a significant global impact. The combination of these factors will lead to the most ambitious, spectacular festival of football imaginable and a lasting legacy of football and social development all around the world \u2013 ours is not a World Cup that will benefit one country alone but is truly a Fifa World Cup for the world.\" The battle for the 2018 World Cup is widely considered to be a three-horse race between the narrow favourites Russia, England and the joint bid from Spain and Portugal. The Netherlands and Belgium are also bidding jointly and the United States remains nominally in the running, although it is expected to withdraw imminently to concentrate on 2022. England's bid team will increasingly try to draw a distinction between Russia, which is highlighting the legacy the event will leave in a country that has never hosted the World Cup, and England's more global focus. Amid rumours about behind-the-scenes negotiations, Fifa has reiterated that deals with those countries and confederations hoping to host the 2022 tournament \u2013 where the favourites are considered to be the US, Qatar and Australia \u2013 are banned. The England bid has continued to work hard in lobbying the 24 members who will decide its fate since a positive inspection visit over the summer. The bid team has delivered a series of one-on-one presentations to executive committee members, and David Beckham, the former England captain, visited Trinidad to highlight the international aspect of its legacy plan. Anson will elaborate on the Football United fund first unveiled as part of the bid book earlier this year. It is seen as the means by which it can deliver development programmes around the world. He will also unveil a new initiative \u2013 called Project 2028 \u2013 which is designed to expand home-grown talent in each of the host cities. The England bid will also guarantee Fifa a minimum profit of \u00a3161m, which is seen as a crucial plank of the argument in austere times and in the wake of more risky World Cups in South Africa and Brazil 2014. \"Fifa can use England 2018 as a launch pad for more direct investment around the global family \u2013 creating not only the greatest financial value but also the greatest social value,\" Anson said.
