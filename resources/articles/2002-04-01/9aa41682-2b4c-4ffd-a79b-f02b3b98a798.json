Raper now wants the Warriors to complete a double of Challenge Cup and Super League Grand Final in the same year. \"We've done it tough over the last five months, but we set our goals and we've achieved one of them today,\" said Raper. \"Everyone kept talking about the pressure but we knew if we worried about it, it would affect us. \"I'm really happy for the club and the town of Wigan. There has been continuous Wigan-bashing, everyone said we have got to win and now we have done that. I think the big monkey is off our backs. People started to call us chokers after the Bradford [Super League grand final] game last year, saying we couldn't play on the big stage. But there's no bigger stage than today. \"I've got to set the target for the guys to be the first to do the double. You've got to keep it in perspective, there's a lot of good sides out there. But I'm confident my guys will get better and better.\" Raper, like Wigan's previous five coaches since the last of their eight consecutive Wembley wins in 1995, has had to contend with the legacy of that unprecedented run of success. That was why the three defeats Wigan suffered in their first six Super League matches this season, following that Old Trafford humiliation by Bradford in October, led to speculation - unfounded, says Raper's chairman Maurice Lindsay - that his job was on the line. So the glee with which both Raper and Lindsay celebrated Saturday's win was understandable, Raper taking added satisfaction from the fact that his father, Johnny, probably the finest loose-forward to have played the game, had flown in from Sydney for the match. Now comes the test of Lindsay's theory that the thousands of fans who have deserted Wigan in seven seasons of summer rugby will return now they are winning trophies again. Indeed, the banks of empty seats at the Wigan end were an embarrassment to such a famous rugby town, the team's performance richly rewarding the loyalists who travelled, and surely leaving the stay-at-homes wishing they had taken a gamble. As Lindsay said: \"I hope they enjoyed it on TV.\" The performance certainly vindicated Lindsay's judgment of players, which has been widely questioned this season as Julian O'Neill, Craig Smith and Jamie Ainscough, his three big-money recruits from Australia, have struggled. On Saturday, when it really mattered, O'Neill recovered from an early howler to set up the decisive second-half try for Gary Connolly, Smith and his fellow prop Terry O'Connor stopped Saints dominating the rucks as they had against Leeds in the semi-final, and even Ainscough made a couple of important defensive contributions late on. Adrian Lam had a terrific game, as he had in the tough semi-final win against Castleford two weeks earlier, while the 30-year-old Connolly also made a huge contribution against his former club with the usual faultless defence in addition to his try. But this Wigan win was driven above all by two homegrown players, who emerged at the back end of the club's recent dominance of the British game and have suffered more lows than highs. Kris Radlinski has been a red-headed rock at full-back, recognised throughout the game as a wonderfully consistent and reliable player. But he is such a solid citizen that even when he turned down a fortune to play rugby union for Leicester and England last summer, it did not create much of a stir. Now, though, he will be known as the man who wore slippers at Murrayfield the day before winning the Lance Todd Trophy, with a string of try-saving tackles belying the fact that he had been in hospital on an intravenous drip from Sunday to Thursday, and still could not walk on the morning of the match until Wigan's doctors drained the puss from his infected toe, then numbed it with an injection. All that was caught on film by Wigan's other hometown hero, Andy Farrell, whose captain's knock even included operating the camcorder at the team hotel. For St Helens, this was a bad day at the office, best summed up by Sean Long's inability to convert any of their three tries, and the anonymity of their stand-off Tommy Martyn, who usually produces something special against Wigan. Saints' coach Ian Millward was philosophical afterwards, saying \"sometimes you need to lose to appreciate things more\". \"We'll have plenty of fire in our bellies now,\" he warned. This result also sets up the rest of the Super League season intriguingly. Meanwhile, on the top deck of the stand, Johnny Vegas had his cans of ale confiscated. It just was not Saints' day.
