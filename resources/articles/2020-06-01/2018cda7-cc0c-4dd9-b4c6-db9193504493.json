Russian military intelligence unit secretly offered cash to Taliban militants for successful attacks on coalition troops in Afghanistan Mississippi lawmakers clear path to remove Confederate emblem from state flag. Voting will begin to remove the current flag from state law and a commission would design a new one without the rebel symbol Florida governor Ron DeSantis says younger people are driving up the Covid-19 numbers in his state. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing it in those groups who are less at risk, but you\u2019re seeing them test positive at much higher rates,\u201d DeSantis said. \u201cI think [ages] 25 to 34 has been pretty close to 20%.\u201d The number of coronavirus cases in Florida rose by 8,530 to 141,075 on Sunday, according to the state\u2019s health department. Miami-Dade county reported more than 2,000 new cases for the first time. The news comes one day after the state established a daily record for new cases with 9,585 reported on Saturday, part of an alarming weeklong trend of 43,784 confirmed cases, which accounts for more than 30% of Florida\u2019s overall tally. As of 9.25am on Sunday, there have been 141,075 positive cases of the coronavirus statewide. The case count includes 138,567 Florida residents and 2,508 non-Florida residents. California governor Gavin Newsom has ordered the closure of bars and nightclubs in seven of the state\u2019s counties, including Los Angeles. Newsom\u2019s order came as Covid-19 cases in California rise. \u201cCovid-19 is still circulating in California, and in some parts of the state, growing stronger,\u201d Newsom said in a written statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why it is critical we take this step to limit the spread of the virus in the counties that are seeing the biggest increases.\u201d Los Angeles county reported 2,169 news coronavirus cases on Saturday alone. \u201cIf we can\u2019t find it in us to follow these mandates, including wearing face coverings and distancing when around others, we jeopardize our ability to move forward on the recovery journey,\u201d Barbara Ferrer, the Los Angeles county health director, said on a statement on Saturday. \u201cOur collective responsibility is to take immediate action, as individuals and businesses, to reverse the trends we are experiencing.\u201d Arizona has set a new high for confirmed Covid-19 cases in a single day. Here\u2019s more from the Associated Press: Arizona health officials reported 3,858 more confirmed coronavirus cases on Sunday, the most reported in a single day in the state so far. It was also the seventh time in the last 10 days that daily cases surpassed the 3,000 mark. The Arizona Department of Health Services also reported nine additional deaths. That pushes Arizona\u2019s documented Covid-19 totals to nearly 74,000 cases and 1,588 known deaths. Some Arizona hospitals have begun activating surge plans to increase their capacity to treat Covid-19 patients as confirmed cases rise and more people seek treatment. Arizona became a coronavirus hot spot following Governor Doug Ducey\u2019s lifting of stay-home orders last month. A reminder that the young and fit can still feel the effects of Covid-19. Rudy Gobert of the Utah Jazz was the first NBA player to test positive for the virus (after an ill-advised decision to touch several reporters\u2019 microphones) in March. His diagnosis ushered in the league\u2019s decision to shut down. Gobert says he will be fit enough to play when the NBA resumes in the coming weeks, but told French publication L\u2019Equipe that he still has trouble smelling, a common side-effect of the virus. \u201cTaste has returned, but [my] sense of smell is still not 100%,\u201d he said. \u201cI can smell smells, but not from far away. I spoke to specialists, who told me that it could take up to a year.\u201d The NBA will resume in a \u201cbubble\u201d at Disney World in Orlando, although there has been speculation whether the rise in Covid-19 cases in Florida could put the restart in jeopardy. Let\u2019s take a little break from criticism of Donald Trump\u2019s response to Covid-19 and instead hear from someone who doesn\u2019t think Mike Pence is doing a good job either. That would be Washington\u2019s Democratic governor, Jay Inslee. \u201cWhen I heard the vice president talk about how things are just hunky-dory, it\u2019s just maddening,\u201d Inslee said on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation on Sunday. \u201cThe situation is critical in many places across the United States and all the happy thoughts and wishful thinking in the world is not going to wash that away.\u201d Inslee did also give his thoughts on the president, by the way. The governor said Covid-19 was far more important than the president defending statues of Confederate generals. \u201cWe need a president who will care more about living Americans and less about dead Confederates,\u201d he said. Inslee added that the president should use the influence he has over his most ardent supporters to help curb the spread of the virus. \u201cIf we can get everyone wearing a MAGA hat to wear a mask, we are going to contain this virus,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the way to open our economy, if we get people to mask up and reopen our economy, that\u2019ll be a good day for everyone.\u201d On Friday, vice president Mike Pence led a briefing by the coronavirus task force in which he did not once recommend that people wear face masks. It seemed that political considerations \u2013 Donald Trump has made statements pooh-poohing masks \u2013 prevented Pence from making the most basic of health recommendations. Two short days later and Pence has (for the moment) changed his tune. The vice president is visiting Texas today to meet with local officials about the state\u2019s growing outbreak. During his visit, Pence has made a rare public show of wearing a mask himself \u2013 and he has now recommended that others do the same. The Texas Tribune reports: Take it from Mike Pence: wear a mask in public. COLUMBUS, Ind. (AP) \u2014 It was a scene Jeannine Lee Lake never would have imagined when she first ran against Greg Pence, Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s brother, for a rural Indiana congressional seat two years ago: an almost entirely white crowd of more than 100 people marching silently in the Pences\u2019 hometown this month, offering prayers for Black people killed by police and an end to systemic racism. Leading them was Lake, who is in rematch against Pence. She is the only Black woman running for federal office in Indiana this fall. The Democrat, who lost badly in 2018 and again faces long odds in the deeply conservative district, has spent much of the past few weeks at events such as the one in Columbus on Juneteenth. In communities across a district that is 93% white, Lake has talked about seeing her children pulled over by police and \u201charassed for no reason.\u201d She has spoken the names of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other Black people killed by police, telling crowds \u201cwe\u2019re here to call for change.\u201d \u201cIn no way, shape or form is 2018 the same as the 2020 race in regard to the grassroots effort and the galvanization of the movement that is now Black Lives Matter,\u201d said Lake, 50. \u201cIt\u2019s just a total shift.\u201d The reenergized movement against racial inequality has amplified the voices of Black candidates, in some cases pushing the political debate over race into Republican-leaning areas. Democrats say they\u2019ve seen a significant boost in fundraising and other engagement for candidates running on racial justice issues, and believe it could help the party flip some Republican-held districts in November. Read further via the Associated Press. In a week that saw the worst day on record for new cases, Trump shrugs as experts warn Americans not to follow his lead, Ed Pilkington reports: A disaster is unfolding in Montgomery, Alabama, where Martin Luther King preached and where Rosa Parks was arrested for refusing to give up her seat on the bus. Hospitals are running short of drugs to treat Covid-19, intensive care units are close to capacity, and ventilators are running short. Between 85% and 90% of the very sick and dying are African American. Amid this gathering storm, the city council met to decide whether to require people to wear masks, a basic protection the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) strongly recommends. Doctors lined up to plead their case. \u201cThis is beyond an epidemic in this area,\u201d said the pulmonologist Bill Saliski. \u201cOur units are full of critically ill covid patients. We have to slow this down.\u201d His colleague, Nina Nelson-Garrett, described watching undertakers carrying out corpses, 30 minutes apart. \u201cSomething as simple as a mask can save someone\u2019s life,\u201d she said. Dr Kim McGlothan recounted how she was frequently stopped by white people asking, \u201cIs the media sensationalizing this, is it really as bad as they are making out?\u201d McGlothan told the council: \u201cPeople don\u2019t believe the hype. Until you mandate masks, we won\u2019t be able to stop this \u2013 we just won\u2019t.\u201d Then a black resident stood up. Six of his relatives had died from Covid-19. His brother was on a ventilator. \u201cThis is not about masks,\u201d he said. \u201cThe question on the table is, \u2018Do black lives matter?\u2019 I lost six of my family to Covid. How would it feel if it was your family?\u201d Read the full piece here: Hello this is Tom McCarthy jumping into the blog and wondering whether everyone has seen the below photo, supposedly of a Trump supporter wearing a face mask as a sleeping mask, making the rounds today? Is this staged? What do you think? US health secretary Alex Azar has warned that \u201cthe window is closing\u201d on the country\u2019s chance to take action to effectively curb the coronavirus, as the number of confirmed cases surpassed 2.5m. The Health and Human Services secretary pointed to a recent spike in infections, particularly in the south and said people have \u201cto act responsibly\u201d by social distancing and wearing face masks especially \u201cin these hot zones\u201d. For a third consecutive day on Saturday, the number of confirmed US cases rose by more than 40,000. In Arizona, cases have risen by 267% so far in June and jumped by a record 3,857 cases on Sunday, the eighth record-breaking increase this month. Overall, US deaths from Covid-19 have surpassed 125,000 with more than 2.5m confirmed cases, according to compiled by Johns Hopkins University, far more than any other country in the world. The fresh surge in Covid-19 cases has been most pronounced in a handful of southern and western states that reopened earlier and more aggressively, with the support of the Trump administration, despite warnings by health officials to wait to see a steady decline in cases. Texas and Florida were among the states that reversed course on parts of their reopening plans last week as cases continue to increase. Appearing on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press program on Sunday morning, Azar was asked by presenter Chuck Todd why the US was failing to tackle the Covid-19 crisis, especially when so many other countries seem to be succeeding. Azar acknowledged the US was \u201cseeing surging in cases\u201d and that the majority of those are among people under the age of 35, which means a \u201clarge number of those\u201d will be asymptomatic, presenting a different challenge for authorities trying to get a grip on outbreaks. \u201cThis is a very serious situation,\u201d Azar said, adding that \u201cthe window is closing\u201d to stop virus spread. \u201cWe have to act, and people as individuals have to act responsibly. We need to social distance, we need to wear our face coverings.\u201d Democratic party chairman Tom Perez has put out a statement following Donald Trump\u2019s since deleted retweet of a man shouting \u201cwhite power\u201d. The president called those appearing in the video \u201cgreat people\u201d. \u201cOnce again, Donald Trump\u2019s actions are simply indefensible,\u201d said Perez in the statement. \u201cAs our country faces a reckoning since the murders of Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and so many others, we are seeking ways to address systemic racism and injustice. But Trump is tweeting a video promoting \u2018white power.\u2019 \u201cThis president tries to claim ignorance, but the consistency of his actions \u2013 on Charlottesville and most recently Lafayette Square \u2013 drown out his vacuous words. We need a president who will heal our nation\u2019s wounds and unite the American people, not a demagogue who tries to divide us through fear and bigotry.\u201d White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere says the president had not heard the \u201cwhite power\u201d shout when he retweeted the video. New York governor Andrew Cuomo says the White House administration is \u201cin denial\u201d about the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cThis is a continuation of the first wave, and it was a failed effort to stop the first wave in the country,\u201d Cuomo said during an appearance on NBC\u2019s Meet the Press. \u201cIf you listen to what the president says, what they said at the White House briefing, they\u2019re saying what they said three months ago. They\u2019re basically in denial about the problem. They don\u2019t want to tell the American people the truth.\u201d Cuomo said the White House\u2019s attitude meant states had created their own responses to the virus. \u201cAnd they don\u2019t want to have any federal response,\u201d he added. \u201cI knew what they were saying: \u2018You\u2019re on your own.\u2019 And it\u2019s not a good feeling, but it\u2019s sort of liberating.\u201d New York, which was once the worst-affected region in the world by Covid-19, has seen a decline in deaths and cases over the last few weeks, and the state is gradually reopening. Five people died from the virus in New York on Saturday, whereas there were nearly 800 fatalities a day in the state at the peak. \u201cWe are on the exact opposite end,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cWe have less than 800 people in hospitals, [the] lowest number basically since we started.\u201d However, as cases rise across the US as a whole, Cuomo said he was concerned the state could be hit hard again and said New Yorkers should wear masks and practice social distancing. \u201cI\u2019m now afraid of the spread coming from other states because we are one country and people travel,\u201d Cuomo said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the infection rate in the other states will come back to New York and raise that rate again.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has suggested Russia may have compromising information on the president. Pelosi said she found the lack of response from the Donald Trump over reports in the New York Times that Russia had offered bounties for Taliban-linked militants to kill US soldiers \u201cappalling\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the Russians have on the president politically, personally or whatever it is, but he wants to ignore [reports of wrongdoing],\u201d Pelosi told ABC\u2019s This Week. When she was asked if she was saying the Russians have dirt on Trump, Pelosi replied: \u201cHow else would you explain his refusal to ignore, again and again, the intelligence that puts right at the Russian doorstep the involvement into our elections, for example?\u201d The president said on Sunday no one had told him about the reports. \u201cNobody briefed or told me, [vice president Mike] Pence, or chief of staff Mark Meadows about the so-called attacks on our troops in Afghanistan by Russians,\u201d Trump tweeted in part. \u201cEverybody is denying it &amp; there have not been many attacks on us\u2026\u201d You can read more on the story here: Some, including Donald Trump, have claimed the rise in Covid-19 cases across the US are due to increased testing. That\u2019s not a view shared by Tom Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control. During an appearance on Fox News on Sunday, Frieden said he could say with \u201c100% certainty\u201d that there has been a true rise in cases, because of a rise in the proportion of positive tests. He also said the recent cases were \u201cjust the tip of the iceberg\u201d. Frieden said he understood why people were growing frustrated by lockdown measures but \u201cthe virus is not tired of making us sick.\u201d He added that he believed that a number of southern states had reopened too soon. \u201cIf you open when cases are still increasing, as many states did, it\u2019s like leaning into a left hook,\u201d Frieden said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get hit hard. And that\u2019s what\u2019s happening.\u201d Former national security adviser John Bolton who, it\u2019s fair to say, is not a close friend of the president these days refused to be drawn on whether Donald Trump\u2019s retweet of a supporter shouting \u201cwhite power\u201d was racist. \u201cIt may be that you can draw a conclusion that he heard it, and it was racist, and he tweeted it to promote the message. It is a legitimate conclusion to draw. It is also entirely legitimate to say he just had no idea what else was in the video other than the Trump sign,\u201d Bolton said during an appearance on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. Trump recently tried to block the publication of a tell-all book by Bolton on the White House administration. Mississippi\u2019s state legislature is expected to take up a bill on Sunday to be proposed and passed to allow for the change of the state\u2019s flag, which contains a Confederate battle emblem in the canton that\u2019s been widely condemned as racist. The state\u2019s House and Senate passed a resolution by overwhelming margins on Saturday suspending the legislative deadlines so lawmakers can consider the bill when lawmakers convene today. As the AP reports: The flag\u2019s supporters resisted efforts to change it for decades, but rapid developments in recent weeks have changed dynamics on this issue in the tradition-bound state. As protests against racial injustice recently spread across the U.S., including Mississippi, leaders from business, religion, education and sports have spoken forcefully against the state flag. They have urged legislators to ditch the 126-year-old banner for one that better reflects the diversity of a state with a 38% Black population. Legislators are expected to start voting Sunday to remove the current flag from state law. A commission would design a new flag that cannot include the Confederate symbol and that must have the words \u201cIn God We Trust.\u201d \u201cThere are economic issues. There are issues involving football or whatever,\u201d Republican lieutenant governor Delbert Hosemann said Saturday. \u201cBut this vote came from the heart. That makes it so much more important.\u201d Mississippi remains the last state in the union whose flag contains the Confederate emblem. It was adopted in 1894, nearly three decades after rebel forces under Robert E Lee unconditionally surrendered to Ulysses S Grant at Appomattox Court House to end the American civil war. Larry Eubanks, who sat outside the state\u2019s Capitol building in Jackson on Saturday, is among those Mississippians who supports the current flag. saying he hopes lawmakers would allow a proposed flag change to be decided by the registered voters. Earlier on Saturday, Republican governor Tate Reeves said he would sign legislation to change the flag if it reached his desk: \u201cThe argument over the 1894 flag has become as divisive as the flag itself and it\u2019s time to end it. If they send me a bill this weekend, I will sign it.\u201d My colleague Tom McCarthy has more on Trump\u2019s \u2018white power\u2019 tweet that has sucked up most of the oxygen on Sunday morning. Cody Keenan, a former speechwriter for Barack Obama, said the tweet was part of Trump\u2019s re-election strategy. \u201cHow \u2018bout we just skip past the kabuki where White House staff emails reporters anonymously to say they had nothing to do with it, every [Republican] senator pretends they haven\u2019t seen it, and just accept that they\u2019re all part of the Trump 2020 white power Covid rally \u2018til the end,\u201d Keenan tweeted. Trump sent the tweet as he faces a difficult re-election bid, which in part involves a struggle to shore up support among his base of white and evangelical Christian voters. Polls indicate that a majority of that demographic has supported protests over the killing last month of George Floyd, an African American man, by a white police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The Floyd protests have launched what could be a moment of reckoning for racial justice, on issues ranging from unaccountable police killings to Confederate monuments to criminal justice reforms to the legacy of slavery to reparations. Yet Trump has leaned into his opposition to the protests, threatening to deploy the US military in American cities, promising stiff penalties for defacing statues, tweeting \u201cwhen the looting starts, the shooting starts\u201d \u2013 a phrase famously used in the 1960s by a Miami police chief long accused of bigotry \u2013 and declaring himself the president of \u201claw and order\u201d. Mike Pence defended his refusal to say \u201cblack lives matter\u201d amid bipartisan calls for police reform following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month, saying he disagrees with the political agenda put forth by leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement. \u201cI really believe that all lives matter,\u201d the US vice-president said on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation when pressed on why he won\u2019t say the phrase. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where the heart of the American people lies.\u201d He added: \u201cWhat I see in the leaders of the Black Lives Matter movement is a political agenda of the radical left that would defund the police, that would tear down monuments, that would press a radical left agenda.\u201d Pence cited the influence of Martin Luther King Jr in his personal life and said that he cherishes \u201cthe progress that we have made toward a more perfect union for African Americans throughout our history.\u201d The vice-president had first declined to use the phrase during an interview on a Philadelphia television station on 19 June, saying instead that \u201call lives matter in a very real sense\u201d. The number of coronavirus cases in Florida rose by 8,530 to 141,075 on Sunday, according to the daily report from the state\u2019s health department. The news comes one day after the state established a daily record for new cases with 9,585 reported on Saturday, part of an alarming weeklong trend of 43,784 confirmed cases, which accounts for more than 30% of Florida\u2019s overall tally. As of 9.25am on Sunday, there have been 141,075 positive cases of the coronavirus statewide. The case count includes 138,567 Florida residents and 2,508 non-Florida residents. White House deputy press secretary Judd Deere has issued a statement on Trump\u2019s retweet, saying the US president \u201cdid not hear\u201d the portion of the video in which one of his supporters yelled \u2018white power\u2019 in an argument with anti-Trump demonstrators. \u201cPresident Trump is a big fan of The Villages,\u201d Deere said of the central Florida retirement community where the video was captured. \u201cHe did not hear the one statement made on the video. What he did see was tremendous enthusiasm from his many supporters.\u201d Florida is seen as a key battleground state in the 2020 election and has been controversially picked as the site of a Trump rally in late August to celebrate his nomination for a second term. Donald Trump has deleted a tweet in which he approvingly shared a video showing one of his supporters yelling \u201cWhite power!\u201d at a group of anti-Trump demonstrators. The US president, or someone with access to his Twitter account, deleted the controversial tweet at 11am Eastern time, more than three hours after it was posted at 7.39am. \u201cThis is really not about the president taking it down,\u201d the famed civil rights attorney and academic Sherrilyn Ifill said on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. \u201cThis is really about his judgment in putting it up in the first place.\u201d US vice-president Mike Pence has attributed the alarming rise in coronavirus cases throughout the United States in part to young people who are failing to follow social distancing guidelines. \u201cWhat is happening here is a combination of increased testing \u2013 we\u2019re able to test a great deal more Americans than we were able to several months ago \u2013 but it also may be indication that as we\u2019re opening our economy up, that younger Americans have been congregating in ways that may have disregarded the guidance that we gave on the federal level for all the phases of reopening,\u201d Pence said Sunday on CBS\u2019s Face the Nation. Pence, who heads the White House coronavirus task force, called off campaign events for this coming week as the states experience a surge in new coronavirus cases, though he will still travel to those states to meet with their governors and health teams. South Carolina\u2019s Tim Scott, the only black Republican in the US Senate, has condemned Donald Trump\u2019s retweet of a video containing a white power message and said it should be removed from Twitter. \u201cThere\u2019s no question that he should not have retweeted it and he should just take it down,\u201d Scott said Sunday on CNN\u2019s State of the Union. \u201cIt was so profanity laced, the entire thing was offensive. Certainly, the comment about the white power was offensive,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s indefensible. We should take it down.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s motorcade has just arrived at Trump National Golf Club in Loudoun County, according to the White House press pool. This marks the 272nd day he spent at one of his golf clubs and 364th at one of his properties since taking office, according to CNN\u2019s running tally. Like yesterday, a group of protesters were waiting outside the club for the US president, including one woman holding a sign that said \u201cI ordered Mary\u2019s book\u201d. Donald Trump is coming in hot on Sunday morning, appearing to approve of a video showing one of his supporters yelling \u201cWhite power!\u201d at a group of anti-Trump demonstrators in central Florida. The embattled US president retweeted a video that he said was from the Villages, a retirement community in central Florida, that showed Trump supporters clashing with protesters. \u201cThank you to the great people of The Villages. The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats will Fall in the Fall. Corrupt Joe is shot. See you soon!!\u201d he wrote. Trump\u2019s health secretary, Alex Azar, responded to the video on CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday morning. \u201cI\u2019ve not seen that video or that tweet, but obviously neither the President, his administration nor I would do anything to be supportive of white supremacy or anything that would support discrimination of any kind,\u201d Azar said. \u2026 and welcome to another day of coverage of US politics, the coronavirus outbreak and all things in between. Confirmed coronavirus infections have surpassed the 10 million mark worldwide. A tally compiled by Johns Hopkins University registered the grim milestone Sunday, after India and Russia added thousands of new cases. The United States reported more than 42,000 new coronavirus cases on Saturday with infections on the rise in 29 of 50 states. Overall, US deaths from Covid-19 have surpassed 125,000 with more than 2.5 million confirmed cases, the most in the world."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
