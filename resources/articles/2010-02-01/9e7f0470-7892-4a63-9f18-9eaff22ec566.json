Takeshis' (apparently the first instalment in a trilogy) is a flat, Fellini-esque wheeze in which our hero takes on dual roles as millionaire film-maker Beat Takeshi and a low-rent grovelling entertainer who looks just like Beat Takeshi. The script swims in tired circles, like a goldfish in a bowl, with nothing to look at but its own reflection in the glass."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
