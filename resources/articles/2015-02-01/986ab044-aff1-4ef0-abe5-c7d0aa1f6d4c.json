If that was the case, these two sides clearly didn\u2019t get the memo, as St George kicked off the newly-expanded competition with a classy and hard-fought win in a game of the highest quality. Intensity, skill and passion from both teams was present in abundance, and it was only the guile of the imperious Benji Marshall that proved to be the difference between two very impressive sides. St George ultimately claimed the first bragging rights for the NRL, with Super League now needing to win the two remaining games of the series to secure glory. \u201cI thought the physicality of the game was brilliant, and to win after just one trial game was very, very good from us,\u201d said the St George coach, Paul McGregor. The Warrington coach, Tony Smith, conceded that \u201cit was the right result, they deserved to win\u201d. He argued that despite some sloppiness there was little between the two sides in what turned out to be Warrington\u2019s first competitive defeat of the new season. The first 40 minutes showed how even the teams were: two tries each, and all of extreme quality. After Tyson Frizell crossed courtesy of a sublime ball by Marshall, Gareth O\u2019Brien scored a wonderful solo try to level it up. St George then edged back in front when Joel Thompson touched down Gareth Widdop\u2019s pinpoint kick, before Ryan Atkins produced a moment of magic to dance his way over the line for Warrington\u2019s second. O\u2019Brien missed the conversion, though, to leave St George 12-10 to the good. The intensity was eye-watering, but it led to some tempestuous and tasty tackles. The vociferous Warrington crowd were incensed when Eto Nabuli caught Kevin Penny high \u2013 and equally sowhen Marshall copped O\u2019Brien with a late one. On both occasions, though, the referee, Ben Thaler, kept his cards in his pocket. The second-half produced just eight points; six of them came for St George to seal the win. After O\u2019Brien had levelled it with a goal from a penalty conceded by Marshall, St George provided the telling blow when Marshall\u2019s banana kick bamboozled the Wolves defence \u2013 but not full-back Josh Dugan, who touched down.
