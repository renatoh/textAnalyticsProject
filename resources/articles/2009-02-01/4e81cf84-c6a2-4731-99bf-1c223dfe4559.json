People: 1. There is a difference, is there not, between drawing a white man (Bush) as a monkey and drawing a black man as a monkey. Suppose a cartoonist were caricaturing an Irishman and a Jew. Drawing the Irishman with a hooked nose and little horns coming out of his head would be one thing. It just wouldn't make any sense. Putting those features on a Jew is quite another thing. I trust you can see the difference. Some of you took umbrage at Bush being drawn as a chimp all these years. Fine, that's your right. It's certainly mocking him. But it's not mocking him on racial grounds. Mockery is not out of bounds. Racial mockery is. I know you're not stupid enough not to know the difference. 2. The Delonas really meant to mock Pelosi as a chimp argument. Oh come on. You're giving him credit for knowing Obama didn't write the bill. I wouldn't grant him that benefit of the doubt. The guy has a history -- a long, long history -- of racist cartoons. If he wanted to mock Pelosi, he'd have done her up as a, what is it you say, totty. Or just accentuated her less fetching features, as he did a million times for Hillary Clinton. 3. I honestly don't remember any racist cartoons about Condi Rice. I see here that a right-wing women's group complained about three cartoons back in 2004. I would say that the first one, which has her saying \"I knows...\", as a latter-day Butterfly McQueen, is probably racist. The cartoonist is Jeff Danziger. He states his case on the page I link to. Judge for yourself. I don't find it convincing. Likening a contemporary black woman to a film character from the 1930s who was, by our standards today, a dreadful stereotype, goes past the line to me. I think the second one is more sexist. And the third one, they just threw in to make it three. I think the left is often guilty of bias against country folk and southerners. I don't like it, and I've written that on occasions in the past. Both sides often go overboard in taking swipes at people on the other side, and I suppose I've done it too. (Some of you will protest that I'm kinda rough on the south sometimes, but that's not southern human beings, of which I know and like many; it's the south's political influence on the history of the country, which I do indeed consider to be mostly pernicious--you know, slavery, Jim Crow, official segregation. They were bad.) But this cartoon was just obviously racist. It's unserious to say otherwise."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
