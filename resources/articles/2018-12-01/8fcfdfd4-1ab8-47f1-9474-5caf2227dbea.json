You might expect confusion, resentment, even betrayal at how he again finds himself on the outside looking in after the briefest of comebacks over the summer but on a chilly afternoon in Gloucestershire there is nothing but positivity from the exiled fly-half. To recap, Cipriani made his first England start in 10 years in their first win in six matches in June but was discarded again for the autumn campaign. It followed his arrest in Jersey but Eddie Jones insisted his latest omission was based on form, all while Cipriani was tearing up trees with his new club, Gloucester. The clamour for Cipriani\u2019s inclusion with England has subsided after a slight resurgence from the side last month and Owen Farrell\u2019s move to fly-half but how he was discarded, not to mention the possibility of his talents never gracing the international stage again, does not sit well with his army of supporters. \u201cThat\u2019s been the same story for six years though, hasn\u2019t it?\u201d Cipriani says. \u201cAnd it hasn\u2019t got to me for six years. I will still go out and do the best I can. It\u2019s not been hard, because I have never taken any position for granted. So whether I played or not I never felt like I was definitely going to be in. You just try to show your character and resilience over time. \u201cIf I\u2019m just thinking: \u2018If I do this and get player of the month\u2019 it becomes a little bit self-obsessed. That\u2019s my philosophy and I\u2019m enjoying that mindset rather than just trying to prove people wrong, because it can also be a battle of your ego \u2013 you\u2019re fighting as opposed to being at peace.\u201d To listen to Cipriani, you almost feel as if he does not understand what all the fuss is about. He recalls his first spell at Wasps when, as a precocious youngster, his impatience got the better of him, but now there is an acceptance of his fate. \u201cShaun [Edwards] would say you\u2019ve got to ask specific questions,\u201d he says. \u201cSo if I wasn\u2019t getting picked I\u2019d go to the coach \u2013 I went to Gats [Warren Gatland] or Geech [Ian McGeechan], and I\u2019d say what do I need to do to get in this team? They\u2019ll give you a list, you go and do it, you\u2019re conscious of it, you make sure you do it in the game. If you get picked, great, that\u2019s him staying true to his word and if he gives you other things to work on, you keep working on them. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got two or three players in a position and they\u2019re all playing well, sometimes you\u2019ve got to go on a feeling and if you\u2019re not on that coach\u2019s feeling, you\u2019ve got to accept it. It\u2019s not like [England] had a bad autumn or anything like that. I thought some of the rugby they played was excellent. So you\u2019ve just got to accept it. \u201cI get it and I guess it\u2019s nice the question is still being asked because I am playing half-decent, so I\u2019ll keep trying to play half-decent.\u201d Not for the first time, he is dealing in understatements. While it must be said Cipriani, at 31, is a Premiership veteran, you only have to look at how Lima Sopoaga is struggling to replace him at Wasps to see the grass is not always greener. Cipriani, however, is thriving in the West Country and victory against Exeter on Friday night would give Gloucester every chance of reaching the Champions Cup quarter-finals. He and Johan Ackermann do not appear the most obvious double act but the South African has not only built his team around Cipriani, he has given him the reins. It is instructive that whereas Jones has publicly explained he dropped Cipriani because he is, in effect, a player more suited to a highlights reel, the man himself cites leadership as the most obvious development in his game. \u201cAt Wasps I was driving a team but it wasn\u2019t necessarily what was wanted,\u201d he says. \u201cI was still trying to do it because I knew hopefully we\u2019d get good results from it. [But] it is an overall leadership role [Gloucester] are very happy to push on towards me. I have learned a lot from a lot of great players and different leaders over time, so hopefully I am doing a fairly good job and my teammates would say that.\u201d What of an England future? \u201cI don\u2019t know. Maybe, maybe. I hope so. I laugh because every question always comes back to the England environment and I get why it does but I\u2019m just loving my time at Gloucester. I don\u2019t sit at home worrying about it. \u201cNo matter what stage of your career you\u2019re at, you want to be challenged, you want to get better and if you feel you\u2019re doing that, you\u2019re going to really enjoy the environment, because you can feel you\u2019re incrementally getting better.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
