And yet, birch hurdles of the type which injured the dual Champion Hurdle winner are likely to be a feature of British (and Irish) jumping for several years yet, despite the padded alternative having been successfully trialled as long ago as 2013. Given racing\u2019s oft-stated commitment to do \u201ceverything possible\u201d to improve horse welfare during races, how can it be that only 13 of the country\u2019s 40 tracks with a jumping programme currently use the most up-to-date hurdle? Cost, perhaps, is one reason: the padded hurdles cost twice as much the old-style timber variety, roughly \u00a3400 per panel versus \u00a3200, and even a small-to-medium track will need around 60 panels, an investment of around \u00a325,000. At Ascot, which installed padded hurdles from the start of the 2018/19 season, it will have been closer to 100 panels. Cost, though, should not be an overriding consideration when safety and welfare are involved, above all at the biggest tracks, like Cheltenham and Aintree, which will also be using timber hurdles at their big Festival meetings. Tracks which have made the switch to padded have been delighted with the results. The reaction at Cork, which became the first Irish track to install padded hurdles from the start of this season, is typical. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled with the feedback,\u201d Andrew Hogan, the track\u2019s general manager, says. \u201cThere have been no reports of the injuries often sustained while jumping the traditional birch hurdles and the horses adapt very quickly to jumping them in the same style as the birch.\u201d And though minor scratches and scrapes are much more common than the hugely unfortunate injury suffered by Buveur D\u2019Air, a cut can still extend a runner\u2019s recovery time after a race, potentially reducing the number of starts it can make in a season. Field sizes could suffer as a result, while at the same time making tracks which do use padded hurdles more attractive to owners and trainers. So why does the number of tracks with padded hurdles seem stuck at 13? Ultimately, the reason that many are reluctant to switch seems to be not so much the scale of investment required as the prospect that an even better alternative is imminent. The British Horseracing Authority is working alongside the RSPCA on a design for the next generation of hurdles, and so courses are holding back from investments of \u00a325k or more in the hope, or expectation, of a bigger step forward in the near future. \u201cThe timber hurdles are generally safe,\u201d Robin Mounsey, the BHA\u2019s spokesperson, said on Tuesday, \u201cand incidents such as we saw with Buveur D\u2019Air are extremely rare. \u201cHowever, we are always looking at ways to make racing safer. The padded hurdles have helped reduce minor injuries like cuts and scrapes to a certain extent, but the data is less conclusive at present on more serious and long-term injuries. The sport is currently looking into the development of a new design of hurdle, alongside the RSPCA, which has the potential to be safer still.\u201d The new hurdle is also expected to have a new colour scheme, as a result of studies which suggest yellow horizontals are more visible to horses than the current orange. The timetable for trials and then introduction of the hi-viz hurdles is still unclear, however, with a full racecourse debut seemingly \u201ca couple of years\u201d away at least. And so it seems that those familiar birch hurdles will be scraping, cutting and, occasionally, seriously injuring horses for some time yet. It is no surprise to find that forward-thinking Ludlow \u2013 and also \u2018Britain\u2019s friendliest racecourse\u2019 according to its website \u2013 made the switch two years ago, but sadly their card on Tuesday afternoon has been lost to the elements after temperatures dropped to -2C overnight. Wednesday\u2019s best bets Speak Of The Devil (3.00) has a decent chance at the sole remaining jumps meeting at Haydock Park, but the most valuable action is on the all-weather, where the Kempton card includes the Listed Wild Flower Stakes. Collide (5.40), who was fifth in an ultra-competitive handicap at Royal Ascot and has had a wind op since his last start, could be the answer here, while Lethal Lunch (5.10) has an obvious chance too at around 3-1. He was poorly drawn last time and never managed to get competitive, but an excellent win at Chelmsford in September gives him every chance off just a 4lb higher mark."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
