The Commons should seek permission from the Queen to hire out the oldest parts of the Palace of Westminster for wedding parties and corporate events to raise money in order to cut the public subsidy on parliament's catering facilities, the House of Commons administration committee said. \"There is a stonking profit to be made,\" said Sir Alan Hazlehurst, who chairs the committee. The authorities should also drag the Commons into the 21st century by introducing made-to-order sandwich bars, more takeaway coffee points, buffets and mid-market pizza, pasta, Chinese and Indian restaurant options to rival the table service fine dining that is used by a dwindling number of MPs. The recommendations will be deeply controversial with some members of the house amid fearing it could become \"Disney-fied\" to attract tourists. Others will be more concerned at proposals to cut opening hours and table service in the restaurants and a proposal to force MPs to share some of their exclusive facilities. Most controversially, the committee, consisting of some of the most experienced parliamentarians, says that if the house fails to adopt its recommendations and save enough money, research should be done to test whether the whole catering and entertainment operation should be outsourced to a private company. Oliver Peyton, whose Peyton and Byrne chain runs restaurants and cafes at the National Gallery, Kew Gardens and the British Library and is a judge on the BBC's Great British Menu, told the committee's inquiry that he would be strongly interested in running parliament's restaurants. The administration committee has been conducting an inquiry into the catering and retail services in the Commons to raise income and cut the \u00a35.7m annual public subsidy in half within three years. The report says some restaurants are overstaffed, but defends the wages of catering staff; they earn more than the industry average but MPs say the Commons should lead buy example and pay staff a proper living wage. Hazlehurst said the committee feared a loss of customers if prices rose in staff canteens. The commons authorities reported a rise in employees seeking permission to instal electric kettles and toasters in their offices to save money. He said the Commons should seek permission from Buckingham Palace to rent out Westminster Hall just four times a year at the cost of \u00a325,000 per occasion \u2013 the Palace of Westminster is officially a royal palace and ultimate permission would come from the crown. This space holds up to 600 guests, making it suitable for corporate events or wedding receptions. The report also suggests the Commons should \"override\" advice from English Heritage to put a souvenir shop in Westminster Hall, the last point visitors see on a tour of the house, in order to increase sales. Better signs \u2013 again against English Heritage advice \u2013 should also be installed to encourage visitors into cafeterias."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
