The party\u2019s disastrous performance in the European elections had reopened a painful debate about a second referendum on any Brexit deal, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission had said it was launching an investigation into claims of antisemitism within Labour. But Campbell wanted to talk about his new podcast. His daughter Grace had been pushing him to work on a series together and the two were keen to promote their new project \u2013 a chatty knockabout entitled Football, Feminism And Everything In Between featuring the likes of Ed Miliband and Rachel Riley as guests. Except that, two hours before we were due to meet, Campbell was thrown out of the Labour party for having voted Liberal Democrat in the European elections. He voiced his bewilderment on Twitter and prompted a scramble on newsdesks across the country. One of the most controversial figures in recent British politics was suddenly back on the front pages. At home in north London, father and daughter fuss over making tea. We sit in a triangle at the kitchen table, Campbell on the left, Grace to the right. Rows blaze online and camera crews take their position outside on the doorstep. Campbell\u2019s phone doesn\u2019t stop buzzing. Every now and then, he scans incoming messages or breaks off to take a call in another room. \u201cYou know in The Thick Of It when Malcolm Tucker leaves [government] and he\u2019s just hunched over working in his kitchen which, by the way, looks freakishly like this one?\u201d Grace waves her hand across the room for emphasis. \u201cThat\u2019s what it\u2019s like.\u201d Campbell scoffs. Tucker, an aggressive media manipulator, was a creation always assumed to be based on Campbell in his years working in government for Tony Blair. These days he says he prefers silence to listening to the Today programme, and despite being acutely attuned to everything on the political agenda that morning \u2013 the polls, the tweets, the breaking developments \u2013 he insists: \u201cI don\u2019t even read the papers any more. I don\u2019t.\u201d At 62, and with 40 years of Labour membership behind him, Campbell seems weary, rather than furious. \u201cThe breach of the rule is in supporting another party and I am very clear I do not support the Liberal Democrats,\u201d he says. \u201cI voted Lib Dem because I support Labour. I\u2019m not a Liberal Democrat. I never will be. I did it because I want the Labour party to do the right thing and this is the only way I can bring that back. I could have \u2013 and this would have merited expulsion \u2013 I could have made hay with it, but I didn\u2019t want to.\u201d To the Labour leadership, it seemed he already had. Last Thursday, Corbyn said the matter was \u201ca question of what Mr Campbell said two days before the election, in which he apparently appeared to be supporting the Liberal Democrats. That is clearly not acceptable\u201d. It remains unclear what Corbyn was referring to. On the record, Campbell disclosed his vote only after the polls had closed, when he was directly asked on air by the LBC broadcaster Iain Dale. But, whatever the trigger, the result came last Tuesday in the form of an email \u201cwith regards from the legal and governance unit\u201d from party HQ. \u201cIf you start expelling everyone who voted Lib Dem in these elections,\u201d Campbell blows a raspberry, \u201cthere won\u2019t be a lot left.\u201d By last Wednesday a movement supporting Campbell had sprung up online under the hashtag #expelmetoo, with party members publicly declaring they had not voted Labour in the European elections. Cherie Blair and former Labour cabinet ministers Charles Clarke and Bob Ainsworth were among them. \u201cI\u2019ve had messages today from people I\u2019ve never had messages from before,\u201d says Campbell, with a shrug. \u201cPeople I don\u2019t expect it from, people that are much closer to [Corbyn] and his sort of politics, but who say one of two things: either, this is really stupid and it will backfire, or secondly, this is no way to treat somebody who has dedicated most of his life to the party.\u201d Grace, 25, born just a month before her father joined Blair\u2019s team, is more forthright. Unsurprisingly, perhaps: their podcast was inspired by a frank radio exchange last year when she ambushed her father live on air over, among other things, his use of the word \u201cbirds\u201d to refer to women. Today, though, she is resolutely loyal. \u201cI\u2019m pissed off about it [the expulsion] and I\u2019ve lost a lot of faith in the Labour party. I am sure [Corbyn is] loving it.\u201d She leans in and rests her cheek in her hand. \u201cIt just feels very personal.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not sure he will be, you know,\u201d says Campbell. \u201cAnd you love Seb [Corbyn, Jeremy\u2019s son].\u201d Still, Grace is upset that many newer members of the party will be gleeful at the news. \u201cMomentum\u2019s tweet was unbelievable,\u201d she says. \u201cA lot of them hate Dad.\u201d Earlier that morning, the pro-Corbyn grassroots movement had tweeted: \u201cAlastair Campbell\u2019s \u2018sexed up\u2019 dossier started the Iraq war and left a million dead. Being kicked out of the party is the least he deserves.\u201d Campbell brushes it off, casually dropping in the fact that Laura Parker, Momentum\u2019s national coordinator, can\u2019t hate him all that much. She delivered a handwritten note asking him for support. To Campbell, it is clear the Labour party is being destroyed and that there are cracks among Corbyn\u2019s senior team. \u201cI\u2019ve had three people in his office today send me messages saying, \u2018What the fuck? I had no idea this was going to happen\u2019\u201d. Campbell\u2019s partner, education campaigner Fiona Millar, left the party months ago after Keir Starmer, sitting at the same kitchen table, promised her the claims of antisemitism within the party would be dealt with within six months. The glacial pace at which the party has moved to deal with the issue compared with the speed at which Campbell was dismissed is an irony not lost on him, but he is unconvinced that there is any coherent strategy behind it. \u201cThey make it up as they go along. They don\u2019t have a strategy, they have a fantasy. Seumas Milne [Corbyn\u2019s adviser] is an old-fashioned posh-boy Stalinist. He\u2019s not really Labour \u2013 he never has been. The idea that he stands up for or represents working class people in the north does my head in. They haven\u2019t got a clue about people like that. They\u2019re not motivated by people like that. So far as they have a strategy, it\u2019s basically to get the Tories to implode, make Brexit happen and try not to get the blame.\u201d Campbell has campaigned vociferously for a people\u2019s vote. Did he ever consider that his endorsement might have been damaging? \u201cI don\u2019t think so. It\u2019s so simple for them to say \u2018Oh Tony Blair, urrghh Alastair Campbell, Peter Mandelson, Andrew Adonis\u2019 but who else is moving the debate? We\u2019ve been out there the whole time. Does Nigel Farage worry about the fact he\u2019s hated by a lot of people? No, he just campaigns.\u201d The EU election results can fairly be taken as a proxy vote on Brexit; nonetheless, Campbell ardently believes a people\u2019s vote could deliver a win for Remainers. \u201cListen, more people signed that revoke petition than voted for the Brexit party \u2026 I honestly believe that if we had another referendum where the choice was to remain in a reformed EU, against a credible, deliverable form of hard Brexit \u2013 which is all you\u2019re going to get now \u2013 then I think we\u2019ll win, and we will win well. I\u2019m so confident of that.\u201d Given the party\u2019s position on the second referendum, does he think Corbyn should stand down? \u201cI\u2019m not engaging on that because they are desperate to say this people\u2019s vote campaign has just been a plot to get rid of Jeremy which is fucking bullshit. The people\u2019s vote campaign is cross party, involving Tories, Lib Dems, SNP, Greens\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s so arrogant to think it\u2019s even about Corbyn,\u201d adds Grace. \u201cAs if he\u2019s this little baby that everyone has to protect because he can\u2019t look after himself.\u201d A standup taking her first show to Edinburgh this summer (title: Why I\u2019m Never Going Into Politics), Grace insists she would still \u201cdefinitely vote Labour\u201d despite her antipathy for the current party leader. Campbell doesn\u2019t confirm that he would \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t say he wouldn\u2019t, either. Does he feel less Labour today? \u201cNo, I feel more Labour because of the responses I\u2019ve had.\u201d What does it mean to him, feeling Labour? Campbell pauses, as if it\u2019s obviously rooted in his DNA. \u201cI\u2019m very tribally Labour. The party represents to me a set of values and principles that are standing up for the right people, and they\u2019re not doing that. \u201cThey can parrot \u2018For the many, not the few\u2019, but they are becoming a party of the few for the few.\u201d DREAM TEAMS Grace and Alastair Campbell ask their podcast guests to pick a six-a-side team, either dead or alive, to change the world.
