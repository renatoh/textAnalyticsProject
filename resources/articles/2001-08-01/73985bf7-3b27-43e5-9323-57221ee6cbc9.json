Twice in the past six months they have voted themselves inflation-busting pay rises. Getting out of bed must be that bit easier for them. Pay rises aside, it's no surprise that Labour is work-obsessed. It spent most of its 18 years in opposition railing against the evils of unemployment as its heartlands were devastated by the decline of heavy industry. That's fair enough considering most psychologists agree that other than the bereavement of a loved one, losing your job is the biggest threat to an individual's mental well-being. New Labour, it seems, is using work as social glue. If we all put our shoulders to the wheel, not only will we have less time to riot but we'll have money to spend which in theory, keeps benefit payments down and the consumer economy ticking over, at least in the rich, developed world. So at the heart of its first term was the New Deal, returning tens of thousands of unemployed people to the workplace. A raft of legislation from the minimum wage to the implementation of the European Union working time directive and the enshrinement of the right to parental leave has dominated the government's agenda. For workers on low incomes, the Working Families Tax Credit was introduced. Welfare payments were scaled back and hinge on people being prepared to work in a bid to force them into the workplace. In addition, wider employee share-ownership schemes were unveiled. The obsession shows no sign of abating. This autumn, Labour will publish a Green Paper to promote more flexibility at work and will roll out its dreadful-sounding Job Centre Plus concept, where personal advisers will be on hand permanently to guide individuals through the career maze. Last month it announced that it wants to provide more childcare and broaden the New Deal to include the over-25s. The government will also seek to give work opportunities to the three groups who find it most elusive - the disabled, lone parents and men over 50 who now constitute the 'hidden unemployed' - people not included in unemployment statistics because they receive other benefits. Europe-inspired measures to combat age discrimination will be introduced by 2006 but could come as early as 2003. Chancellor Gordon Brown's Calvinist streak led him recently to say work was dignified and should be placed at the centre of our lives. It offers the fastest route out of poverty and boosts an individual's self-esteem. Pupils, Brown announced last June, are to be given business lessons to help foster a spirit of enterprise. The government's intention is clear: to eradicate poverty through hard graft. But experts are now asking where we as a work-obsessed nation are heading. Statistics indicate that we derive much of our personal happiness from work. Yet Britons are working longer hours, which is harming families and communities. Increasing numbers of people suffer acute stress at work. It is feared that the retirement age will have to be lifted as our pension contributions may not be enough, compounding the stress further. 'The big question is, What kind of society are we creating?' said Lisa Harker, deputy director of the influential Institute of Public Policy Research. 'It's not been answered. It hasn't been assessed what this all adds up to.' For a clue head to America, the model that Brown is so impressed by. There, similar back-to-work policies and tax credits for the low paid have helped bring teenage pregnancy rates to the lowest levels in 30 years, while the crime rate is being reduced markedly. In the US, sought-after professional fee-earning staff are garlanded with rights and benefits, but essential, low-paid, service workers such as carers have scant benefits.There are many who fear we are heading for the same situation here which would make hollow Brown's claims that there is dignity to be had at work. In the US, more than 10 per cent of the workforce are immigrants, mainly from Mexico, China and Brazil. There are increasing calls in Britain that it would make economic sense for us to allow in more immigrant labour to solve shortages in low-skilled occupations as well as in IT. Already education and health trusts scour the globe for teachers and nurses. In the US, flexible work patterns are fixed by companies, not government. Again there are strong parallels with the UK where Labour is pressing business to introduce flexibility, arguing it makes 'economic sense' and aids staff retention rather than imposing it, as the TUC wants. There is the perception, argues Nick Burkitt of the IPPR, that by placing the workplace flexibility green paper with the Department of Trade and Industry as opposed to the new department of Work and Pensions, the result will be a paper skewed towards the requirements of big business. Richard Freeman, professor of economics at Harvard University, said there is growing evidence that the US work-obsessed culture is showing cracks. Union membership and work dissatisfaction statistics are rising. But work-obsession may be as cyclical as the economy. 'Full employment is social welfare in the US,' said Freeman. 'If unemployment rises and there's indications that it will, how will people fare without a safety net?' With individual workers increasingly responsible for their own welfare, our commitment to work increases out of necessity. But woe betide anyone if that rug is pulled from under you. Best get back to work then. Some work and plenty of play for young number-crunchers 'Young accountants are increasingly showing a spirit of adventure,' says Suzan Lewis, professor of organisational and work-life psychology at Manchester Metropolitan University. Lewis's research indicates that young number crunchers are not prepared to be chained to their desks like previous generations. 'They don't want to work all the time,' she says. 'They want a life.' Lewis detects an increasing counter culture when it comes to work obsession, and that the breakdown of the 'job for life' norm has resulted in a new generation of workers who are not so committed to institutions and the concept of work itself. If accountants, traditionally the most conservative of people, are no longer prepared to put in the hours, maybe in time all employees will throw off the macho working culture. But others are not so sure. A senior partner at a top-five accountancy firm says that, historically, younger workers tend to have their minds focused on anything but their work: 'Young graduates haul themselves in on Monday mornings and on occasions are one notch above a zombie. It takes them another day to come round. But as they gain responsibilities, mortgages and families, they knuckle down and become - dare I say it - just like their parents.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
