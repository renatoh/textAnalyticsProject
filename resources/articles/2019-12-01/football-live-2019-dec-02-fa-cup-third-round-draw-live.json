That was fun. But I\u2019m off to cover the Ballon d\u2019Or. Join me right here to find out who will win this year\u2019s titles of the best male and female footballers on the planet \u2026 And here\u2019s our story, more to follow on that from Jamie Jackson. Here\u2019s the full draw in alphabetical order. Port Vale\u2019s president John Rudge, no stranger to a shock himself - his team beat Spurs once, from memory - is talking of the Manchester City tie. Plum draws: Liverpool v Everton, Wolves v Manchester United, Arsenal v Leeds and Gillingham v West Ham. That concludes the draw.

Southampton v Huddersfield Sheffield United v AFC Fylde Oxford v Exeter or Hartlepool Cardiff v Forest Green or Carlisle Rochdale or Boston v Newcastle Charlton v West Brom Wolves v Manchester United Chelsea v Nottingham Forest Fulham v Aston Villa QPR v Swansea First out: Leicester v Wigan Michah Richards will draw the home team, Tony Adams the away team. Tony Adams has rather dressed down for this occasion, though his jacket does look a tad velvety, though might actually be brushed corduroy. He is promoting this scheme for the third round. Before the draw, we are treated to the traditional sight of Ronnie Radford smashing it in v Newcastle for Hereford United. Craig Elliott, boss of Boston United, has his sights on Rochdale, who his team must beat to reach the next round. Dave Challinor, the long throw king, is manager of Hartlepool and has to beat Exeter. Eastleigh\u2019s chief exec Mick Budny, hope his team can get past Crewe Alex. Jim Bentley, manager of AFC Fylde, is up for the Cup. He is an Evertonian and wants the Toffees in the draw. It seems the draw is not taking place in newly opened The Ardwick, the traditional-style pub that sits within the Etihad exoskeleton but in the Legend\u2019s Lounge, where pictures of Alfons Groenendijk and Alan Kernaghan fill the wall. We are greeted with footage of Manchester City\u2019s 6-0 win in last season\u2019s final. It seems a long time ago; Watford are on their third manager since then. Tim Flowers\u2019 Solihull Moors are playing Rotherham United tonight for their chance to reach the third round. AFC Fylde are the only non-league club definitely in the third round draw. The Magic of the Cup is just about to cast its spell. Against which opposition will Manchester United be televised at prime time? Who gets to play Liverpool\u2019s reserves? Will Manchester City seek to defend the trophy they won last season? After the first and second round shook out all but a handful of non-league teams, true giant-killers are in short supply but there is a big payday out there for one or two lower-division clubs. This year, staged at the Etihad, it will be drawn by Micah Richards, a winner in 2011 with City and still only 31, and Tony Adams, three-time winner, perhaps the greatest Arsenal defender of all and possessor of the curious mid-Atlantic of a late-1980s Radio One DJ. The third round ties take place between 3-6 January.
