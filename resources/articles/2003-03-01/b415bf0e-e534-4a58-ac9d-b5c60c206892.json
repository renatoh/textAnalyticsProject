Aston Villa seem to have found their man but, sadly, he provokes tears of laughter. Peter Crouch made his name at Queens Park Rangers and Portsmouth as a forward whose spindly frame and astonishing height disguised a surprisingly subtle touch and a steely eye for goal but the Premiership continues to prove unwelcoming. Injuries have not helped and, when he took to the field here in search of his first goal of the season, he desperately needed a boost in confidence. The chance came soon enough. Within six minutes Darius Vassell's pull-back rolled towards him as he stood unmarked, 10 yards from goal. His long, thin leg eased back and swung rapidly into the ball's path, sadly arriving some time after it had rolled past him and Lee Hendrie, who was standing boggle-eyed a couple of yards away. Crouch's hopes of an encouraging comeback floated silently into the spring skies along with the sound of 32,000 people laughing. \"I'm happy, the manager's happy,\" Crouch said later. \"If I keep making runs I know it will come. I'm not worried. I believe in my ability; I've done it before and I know it will come in time. I relish the challenge.\" The feeling remains, however, that, if he could not find a goal here when that early chance was followed by several others, each similarly inviting, the challenge may be beyond him. \"He's got to come through the situation,\" Taylor said. \"He's 6ft 7in and lanky, and he's probably had the piss taken out of him since he was a kid but he's got to be confident enough to say, 'This is what I am.'\" It was Crouch's profligacy that stopped Villa from taking a commanding lead from a first half they dominated and in which the home side never looked confident against Vassell's pace and direct run ning. Instead Hendrie's curling 20-yard strike and Vassell's poke under Antti Niemi from Claus Lundekvam's weak back pass proved insufficient protection against Southampton's powers of recovery. Having been 2-0 down at Fulham a week earlier, only to draw with two goals in the last 10 minutes, Saints accepted this latest challenge with gusto. James Beattie lashed in his 20th goal of the season shortly before the break and a much improved second half ended with Ronny Johnsen deflecting a long ball into the path of Kevin Davies, who scored with ease. \"We were outplayed in the first half, I've not got a problem saying that,\" said Gordon Strachan, \"but the second it was like, right, here we go.\" Southampton continue to suggest that Davies, whose contract expires at the end of the season, may still be here at the start of the next but the player himself has all but given up hope. \"I don't think there's any more I can do here,\" he said. \"I've just got to try and keep strong. You never know who's watching, so I've got to play for myself.\" And, if his depressive thinking ever threatens to bring him down, he could look at one member of the Villa team and realise it could be worse. Man of the match: Lee Hendrie (Aston Villa)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
