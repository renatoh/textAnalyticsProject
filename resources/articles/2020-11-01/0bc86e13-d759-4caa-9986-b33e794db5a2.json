The journey has been meteoric and, in many respects, the club are doing their best to make up for lost time. It does not make them immune to criticism, however, with Megan Rapinoe the latest to blast the club\u2019s former disinterest as \u201cdisgraceful\u201d, in an interview with the BBC. Rapinoe is \u201cabout two years too late\u201d, says the United manager, Casey Stoney, with a wry smile, and she is right. The World Cup winner\u2019s remarks mirror the chatter that went on when the club finally announced the launch of a side in 2018, but that talk quietened a little with the unveiling of the highly-respected former player Stoney as manager. \u201cPeople are going have their say aren\u2019t they, it\u2019s a big club,\u201d says Stoney. \u201cIt\u2019s water off a ducks back to me, to be honest. I know why [the club] wanted to do it when they did and that they wanted to do it properly.\u201d Being given a blank canvas, being able to build from the bottom and being completely trusted and supported were all key factors in Stoney joining United. Once she was through the door the club had added significant credibility to their project. \u201cI was so excited and, like most people, was intrigued,\u201d says club captain and former academy player Katie Zelem. \u201cThe thing with Manchester United is that if they\u2019re going to do something they\u2019re going to do it wholeheartedly so I knew that it would be an incredible project. \u201cBefore I had even set foot in the door, when I knew Casey Stoney was going to be the manager I knew they were going for it. I had played with her at Liverpool and knew what she was about, Casey is a winner and whatever she goes into she gives her all. I knew if I was joining I was joining a club that hoped and wanted to be one of the best in a few years\u2019 time.\u201d So far there has been no bump in the road. Season one came with a Championship title and promotion; in season two United established themselves in the WSL, finishing fourth; now, in their third season, they are looking to upset the triumvirate of Manchester City, Arsenal and Chelsea at the top of women\u2019s football. A win and, perhaps more importantly, a dominant display against a formidable Arsenal side last Sunday, allied to a draw against Chelsea at the start of the season, has enhanced United\u2019s title credentials, but Stoney is not letting them get carried away. \u201cYes, it was a big win for us, but that win only matters if we can follow it up, and we think that way about every game, whether it\u2019s a Manchester derby or we\u2019re playing at home to Brighton,\u201d she says. Working for a manager who, win or lose, is not happy can be dispiriting, but it speaks to the drive within Stoney. \u201cI think Casey will let us celebrate when we\u2019ve got a league title in our hands,\u201d Zelem says with a smile. \u201cShe wants the best for us, she\u2019s got high standards and she doesn\u2019t want us to get carried away too soon. The win against Arsenal was fantastic but one game doesn\u2019t define our season and we need to go on and prove that to ourselves.\u201d There is naturally extra spice to a Manchester derby, even if the rivalry is quite a new one. United have suffered two defeats to City in their short history, in the WSL and FA Cup, but a 2-0 Continental League Cup victory has given Stoney and her squad a blueprint for success. Helping fuel their derby fire, and give them a history beyond their official three years in existence, are a crop of players Stoney brought back to the club after they had left the academy at 16 with no senior side to graduate into. Doing that was \u201cmassively important\u201d to Stoney because \u201cthey knew the club better than I did coming in, they know the culture, the history, what it takes, the values. [It was also important] to give them the opportunity to play for the club they trained with as youngsters.\u201d Zelem, a lifelong fan, adds: \u201cWe know how much it means to us. I think as soon as you sign here you quickly learn that too, with all those players around you. Our core of the team already knew each other and had a great understanding too.\u201d Being the underdogs to anyone, let alone a team that did not exist three years ago, is new territory for City. Their forward Ellen White says: \u201cThat\u2019s fine, if everyone wants to put them as the favouritesa relaxed . We concentrate on what we can do, how we can perform, the intensity of our play, and obviously winning three points. \u201c It\u2019s great to have further competition within our league, which pushes everybody in the league to improve and get better and better.\u201d City\u2019s manager, Gareth Taylor, is similarly unconcerned about their neighbours\u2019 rise. \u201cThey\u2019ve invested, they\u2019ve also got two World Cup winners in their squad. You\u2019ve seen a bit of a change in terms of their objectives this season,\u201d he says, and he welcomes a new competitor at the top. \u201cYou want to have real good levels of competition in the WSL, you don\u2019t want it to be about two or three teams.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
