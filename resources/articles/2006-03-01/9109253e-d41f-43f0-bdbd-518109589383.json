The company is understood to be looking at two options: first, a takeover of C&amp;W's British business, valued at next to nothing by analysts, but with a pensions deficit of nearly \u00a3200m. Bankers say Thus would plug part of the deficit, although C&amp;W could make a sizeable contribution, as it is selling overseas operations expected to fetch \u00a3350m. A second option would see Thus take over all of C&amp;W, which includes a lucrative network in the Caribbean. But that would cost up to \u00a33bn and need backing from a private equity group such as Carlyle of the US. Thus, headed by Bill Allan, is not ready to make its move - the sums do not add up for either the company or private equity until C&amp;W's share price falls below 100p. On Friday, the shares were trading at 107p. C&amp;W's prospects look dire. Last week it said it planned to axe 2,000 to 3,000 of its 5,500 British workforce and slash customer numbers by 90 per cent to reduce costs. C&amp;W, like Thus, provides telephony and internet services to businesses, but there is overcapacity and severe downward pressure on pricing. C&amp;W is expected to be ejected from the FTSE 100 index this week, along with Daily Mail &amp; General Trust, whose share price has fallen since it pulled the sale of its Northcliffe regional newspaper division."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
