With an overall fortune estimated at between \u00a3160m and \u00a3200m in the most recent \"rich lists\", Sir Elton was named as the 138th wealthiest person in Britain by the Mail on Sunday and as the 34th highest earner by the Sunday Times. In 1998 he received more than \u00a326m from his companies, Happenstance and J Bondi, according to the latest accounts, while his 1999 US tour grossed $32.5m (\u00a323m). By packing New York's Madison Square Garden for a two-night special last October, touring the UK and gaining income from his back catalogue, his internet site and its merchandising arm, analysts estimate he would have made a similar amount last year. Last night, his management confirmed that his annual income was between \u00a320m and \u00a325m. Yet Sir Elton was warned by his accountants in 1998 that he was in danger of running out of cash, due to excessive spending. He is since believed to have cleared his debts, including \u00a37m to a high street bank, and to have benefited from the increase in value of his property - Woodside, his estate in Windsor bought for \u00a3400,000 in the 1970s, an apartment in Holland Park, west London, a flat in Atlanta, Georgia, and a villa near Nice, France. He is said to spend up to \u00a3250,000 a week on his credit cards, and owns an extensive car collection including four Bentleys, a Jaguar XJ220, a Rolls-Royce Corniche convertible, an Aston Martin DB7, a Ferrari Testarossa, several BMWs and a Mini Cooper. While his love of beautiful things led him to admit in court to spending \u00a3293,000 on flowers in 20 months, it has also garnered him a 2,500-strong contemporary photograph collection, including a Man Ray bought for \u00a3122,500 in 1993 and a work by the Hungarian modernist Andre Kertesz which cost him \u00a3233,851 in April 1997."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
