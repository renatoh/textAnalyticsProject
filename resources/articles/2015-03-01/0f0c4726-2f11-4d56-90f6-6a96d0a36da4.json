Victoria police must apologise for saying she didn't", "bodyText": "Before he resigned as Victoria\u2019s police commissioner in December, Ken Lay spoke about men \u201cneeding to own\u201d the crisis of violence against women \u2013 including the men within his own police force. \u201cWe are constantly misapprehending the nature of violence,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen a woman is jeered, groped, bashed or raped I want you to consider the man who did it, and the culture which encouraged it. I want you to consider why we so ardently place the emphasis on the woman \u2013 why was she there? what was she wearing? \u2013 rather than on the man\u2019s indecent entitlement, grubbiness and criminality.\u201d Surely Lay would cringe, then, at comments made by Victorian homicide squad head, detective inspector Mick Hughes, following the brutal and seemingly random killing of 17-year-old schoolgirl, Masa Vukotic, in broad daylight while she was out walking as part of her usual exercise routine. Hughes\u2019 advice to the community? \u201cI suggest to people, particularly females, [that] they shouldn\u2019t be alone in parks,\u201d Hughes told ABC radio on Thursday morning. \u201cI\u2019m sorry to say that that is the case. We just need to be a little more careful, a little more vigilant.\u201d Despite the interviewer, Fran Kelly, pointing out that, \u201cthis was not even night \u2013 if you want to go jogging, if you want to keep fit, it\u2019s not really practical [advice],\u201d Hughes repeated the comments during a press conference later that day. \u201cWe encourage females to walk together,\u201d Hughes said, adding that it was up to women to take \u201creasonable precautions\u201d to protect their safety. He described the park as an \u201cenclave,\u201d implying it was no place for a woman on her own to be. What exactly is Hughes suggesting? A curfew? At the time Vukotic was killed, at some time before 7pm, it was still daylight in Melbourne. Should women head straight home from school or work and barricade themselves inside? That women\u2019s freedom to go for a walk, or outside after what \u2013 6pm? \u2013 should depend on whether they can find an escort, or whether they have access to \u201csafe-looking\u201d parks? The suggestion is ridiculous, and as baffling as advice on Victoria Police\u2019s own website that advises women living alone that they can \u201ccreate the impression of a male housemate by asking a friend or relative to speak on their message bank service\u201d. Hughes\u2019 comments stand in stark contrast to those made by Lay, his former boss, about how wrong it is to apportion complicity to those who die violently. And it means, yet again, it is necessary to point out what should be obvious. It does not matter what a woman is wearing, where she is, what time of day it is, or whether she is intoxicated or not. Darkness, clothing, living or walking alone can not kill women. But men can, and do. It is up to men not to harm, not women to change their behaviour. The still pervasive attitude that there are certain times of day and places where women should not go, because men may not be able to control their behaviour, is the reason events like Reclaim the Night exist. Despite all the progress on calling out the perpetrators of violence against women \u2013 the announcement of a family violence royal commission in Victoria, the appointment of Rosie Batty as Australian of the Year, and the acknowledgement from men and women in positions of power that attitudes towards women must change, comments like those from Hughes show why the fight is far from over. When someone with considerable influence and power chooses to perpetuate myths about what puts women in danger and who is to blame for that, their status means people are listening. And that\u2019s why Hughes must apologise, and revoke his remarks. He must admit to fundamentally misunderstanding what causes harm against women. He needs to admit he was wrong. He needs to know why women are outraged by them. Mukesh Singh, who was arrested for the 2012 the gang rape of a girl in India, remarked during an interview earlier this month that \u201cdecent girls\u201d would not have been roaming the streets after 9pm, and that \u201chousework and housekeeping is for girls\u201d. It is not unreasonable to expect that society, but particularly those responsible for holding perpetrators to account, strongly reject and denounce views such as those held by perpetrators like Singh. Hughes should not be using language that makes women feel that violence against them is inevitable should they dare try to enjoy the same freedoms as men. So long as authority figures like Hughes and his ilk continue to appropriate blame to women for any harms that befall them, we can not claim to be anywhere near advanced in addressing this crisis. Because a young girl is dead, and we owe it to her and her family to question her perpetrator, to make sure that it is he who is asked uncomfortable questions and held to account for what he was doing in the park that day. Surely, it was men like Hughes that Lay was talking to when he said: I want you to help make indecency against women deeply shameful. I want you to understand that this is not solely a feminist issue. It\u2019s a social issue, a moral issue and a men\u2019s issue. On Friday morning and shortly after this piece was originally posted, assistant crime command commissioner, Stephen Fontana, issued a statement in response to the comments. But far from an apology, he expressed disappointment that Hughes was being criticised. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that some members of our community are so quick to criticise my hardworking members,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIn the last few years Mick and his colleagues have gone to three murders of innocent young women by men completely unknown to them. And no, it isn\u2019t the victim\u2019s fault they were killed \u2013 of course it wasn\u2019t. But in reality these crimes do take place and women are predominantly the victims of these crimes.\u201d No Fontana. The reality is the perpetrators of these crimes are overwhelmingly men. The reality is women are killed every day, in their own homes, in the streets, by their family members, partners, ex-partners and total strangers. And while no one would want to discredit the hard work of Hughes and his team and their excellent policing, that work should not mean women are criticised for calling out harmful comments."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
