The damage is not irreparable and, at 26, the goalkeeper harbours realistic aspirations of playing in two more World Cups. His admirers can also point to his statistics and the fact he has not conceded a goal in his three appearances since the summer. Yet it is a measure of Robinson's diminished standing that his status as England's No1 is now being put down to the paucity of competition, with 13 of the 20 Premiership clubs preferring non-English goalkeepers. Replenishing the public's belief in Robinson promises to be a slow, laborious process and, as he spoke about it for the first time yesterday, it was clear he was stung by the scrutiny. \"Nobody likes to get criticised,\" said the Tottenham Hotspur goalkeeper, who will win his 30th cap in the Euro 2008 qualifier against Macedonia at Old Trafford tomorrow. \"Nobody likes it when bad stuff is being said about them. I'm a human being and I have feelings, just like everyone else. Maybe in certain games I haven't been at my best. But I don't think I have played particularly poorly. There hasn't been a game for England when a goal has gone in and I have thought to myself that it was my fault. So I don't see what I did so badly wrong in the World Cup. \"I always analyse what I can do better and where I can improve. But my record for England is actually very good. I've kept five clean sheets on the bounce and, if you take out the penalty shoot-out against Portugal, I've conceded in only one of the last nine games. I'm aiming to keep that run going now. I want to be recognised as one of the world's best goalkeepers and that will come with time, games and experience. People are asking me all these questions but I conceded two goals in the whole tournament.\" The statistics, however, do not take into account Robinson's hesitancy, in particular when dealing with high crosses, and the frequency with which he did not seem to be on the same wavelength as the team's defenders. A perfectionist might also question his performance in the decisive shoot-out against Portugal when he did not manage a single save despite having worked studiously beforehand on identifying where his opponents were most likely to place the ball. At times, Robinson seemed lacking in self-belief, as if the occasion had got to him and he was afflicted by nerves. Those shortcomings had not been seen prior to the World Cup and they have not been since. The consequence of that, however, is that Robinson must now face questions about whether he is cut out to play at the highest level and the answer to that may not be clear until Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland and, beyond that, the next World Cup in South Africa in four years' time. One of the things in his favour is that there are few goalkeepers who are realistic challengers for his place based on club form. In future years there promises to be a fascinating three-way battle between Chris Kirkland, Ben Foster and Scott Carson but, for now, all three are inexperienced. West Ham's Robert Green is just behind that bunch, Nicky Weaver is still tentatively feeling his way back from several years of injury problems at Manchester City and David James, at 36, does not seem to be in Steve McClaren's thinking. Robinson may have his doubters but he is still very much No1. \"However difficult it was, the World Cup was still a very, very good experience for me,\" he said.\"It was my first tournament as first-choice goalkeeper and it was a lot different to going there as back-up. It opened my eyes about a few things, having the whole world watching, everyone having an opinion on your game, what you have done wrong, what you have done right. But I will learn from it and take it on to the next tournament and, in that respect, it was good for me. I feel I'm a lot stronger for it already.\" Hairy moments Sep 9 2005 Northern Ireland 1 England 0 Robinson's poor clearance starts the move from which Northern Ireland score the only goal of the game.
