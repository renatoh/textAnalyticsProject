Adapted from a play by Cyril G\u00e9ly, this is virtually a two-hander: Andr\u00e9 Dussollier plays Raoul Nordling, the Francophile Swedish consul who sneaks into the German HQ at the Hotel Meurice to try and persuade General von Choltitz (Niels Arestrup) not to carry out Hitler\u2019s infamous order to flatten the city. Largely taking place in a single room, Gely and Schl\u00f6ndorff\u2019s imagining of the encounter is full of adroit power plays, following the Nuremberg trials question of whether to obey orders at all costs Though it\u2019s hard to disguise the piece\u2019s stage origins, Schl\u00f6ndorff\u2019s light touch behind the camera, and the relaxed, substantial performances from the two leads means the film never gets bogged down \u2013 even if it\u2019s somewhat forgiving towards Choltitz\u2019s pre-Paris activities during the German invasion of Russia. Still, a highly civilised piece of work."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
