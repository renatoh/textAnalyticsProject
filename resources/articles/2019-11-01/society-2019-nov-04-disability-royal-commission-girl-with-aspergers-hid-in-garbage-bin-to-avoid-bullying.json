On the first day of the hearings on Monday, Kerri Mellifont, the counsel assisting the commission, highlighted the case of Charlotte*, whose mother said she was hospitalised due to the anxiety caused by her treatment and eventually removed from the mainstream school. \u201cCharlotte has been subject to multiple instances of bullying and violence,\u201d Mellifont said, quoting the mother. \u201cThe resulting anxiety was crippling, even affecting her walking and speech. The hospital wrote to the school with no response.\u201d \u201c\u2018We\u2019ve had such a horrible journey \u2026 it\u2019s almost like because Charlotte\u2019s different, she\u2019s viewed as less.\u2019\u201d Charlotte\u2019s story was contained in a submission to the commission, which Mellifont said was first looking at education and learning because these were key enablers of other rights. A Queensland mother of a 13-year-old girl with Down syndrome was the commission\u2019s first witness at the hearings in Townsville. She became emotional as she recalled how her daughter\u2019s outlook shifted when she reached year two and was placed in a class with a teacher who would regularly yell at her. \u201cHer behaviour went down, really downhill \u2026 especially in the first two weeks,\u201d the mother said. \u201cShe was screaming, slamming doors, she was in her room yelling \u2018sit\u2019, she was hurting the dog, she was hurting me \u2026 She was just totally out of character.\u201d The child quickly became \u201cpetrified\u201d of her teacher, who rejected the mother\u2019s offer to help her with learning resources she\u2019d collated over time and instead said she would do her \u201cown research\u201d. The commission heard the child was forced to sit on a bathmat and to hide the triangular pencils that she needed under her desk from other students. She was not allowed to sit with her peers at lunchtime and was given a \u201cspecial place\u201d with a sign above it that said \u201cL\u201d, the first letter of her name. In one instance, the mother said she witnessed the teacher dragging her daughter \u201cdown the stairs without her glasses on at a pace that [the child] couldn\u2019t maintain.\u201d \u201cThe idea of doing that without her glasses was just terrifying,\u201d the woman said. The woman said that the school\u2019s principal blamed her, claiming the issue was her relationship with the teacher. She moved her daughter after only three weeks. \u201cStudents with disabilities have the right to an education in their community, not somewhere else but where they live,\u201d the mother said.

Bridle told how students with disabilities were kept out of mainstream schools through a process she labelled \u201cgatekeeping\u201d. She said: \u201cThe things that are said to families are either, \u2018we don\u2019t cater for students with this level of disability\u2019, \u2018we won\u2019t have the resources, we can\u2019t ensure that your child will be safe if they enrol at this school. You will find the resources are somewhere else.\u2019\u201d Bridle, whose adult son has Down syndrome, also gave evidence about the use of exclusion and seclusion in schools, as well as cases of abuse. She was aware of one student who was told to sit on a dog mat in case they had a toilet accident. In another case, Bridle said a teacher who admitted hitting a child was defended by the school\u2019s leadership. \u201cBut when the parent approached the school leadership, one of the things \u2026 that were said to her was that he probably didn\u2019t even know he had been hit,\u201d Bridle said. The decision to commence the commission on Monday was the source of frustration among some disability advocates, including the Greens senator Jordon Steele-John, who lives with cerebral palsy. They say people with disabilities have not been given enough time and support to safely and effectively engage with the commission. The royal commission chair, Ronald Sackville, hit back on Monday: \u201cIt has taken more time than we hoped but these services are now in place and the relevant agencies are working hard to deal with the pent-up demand. \u201cUnfortunately there are one or two commentators whose contributions often appear calculated to discourage people from telling their stories to the commission and to increase their levels of anxiety.\u201d The commission has also faced criticism over the independence of two of the commissioners, who have previously served in the public services. It will hold four days of hearings in Townsville this week. *Name has been changed"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
