Victories against New Zealand are clearly not like buses. Ireland gave it the usual lash \u2013 certainly their performance was no comedown from the heroics of Chicago \u2013 but this time they were up against an All Black team in a very different frame of mind. It was a fabulous match, exhausting to watch, even if the script of northern-hemisphere hammering versus New Zealand precision was familiar. But it was controversial too. The All Blacks were angry, with themselves no doubt, and their anger bounced dangerously along the edge of legality. They were penalised again and again, even more than in Chicago when their discipline was appalling. They were lucky to be shown just the two yellow cards. Jaco Peyper, the referee, presided over the maelstrom, with four players forced off within 25 minutes. Ireland had the worse of it, losing Johnny Sexton and Robbie Henshaw from a midfield defence that was always likely to be tested to the full. \u201cI\u2019m really proud of the effort the boys put in,\u201d said Joe Schmidt, Ireland\u2019s coach. \u201cThe hub at 10 and 12 run your game, and I just felt we lost our shape a bit when they went off. At the same time, we put them under immense pressure. But it\u2019s frustrating when you pour so much into a game and don\u2019t get the result. At 14-9, I thought we were in with a chance.\u201d New Zealand were not in the mood to offer up chances. Recently, they have played some of the most sublime rugby the world has ever seen, but here they were not afraid to give vent to their darker side. Regardless, what really set them apart, yet again, was their precision in the heart of the furnace. This Ireland team are on the way back. They will be more than a threat to England when the battle for the north resumes next year, but their precision was lacking at exactly those moments that New Zealand\u2019s was not. Ireland dominated possession, particularly in the second half. Their lineout was given a far sterner test than in Chicago, but the scrum was solid, even dominant. In Tadhg Furlong, they have a new rock to build on. His was one of several dynamic performances. When the moment came, though, the precision too often faltered. Cross reference New Zealand, where Beauden Barrett celebrated his player-of-the-year award with possibly his best performance yet, deadly with ball in hand, but \u2013 get this \u2013 deadly with the boot too. He landed three kicks at goal out of three, none of them gimmes. That they were all conversions, while Ireland\u2019s three from three were penalties, told its own story. New Zealand scored their first try at the end of the third minute, the inevitable culmination of a non-stop exhibition of power and angles from the kick\u2011off that was both brutal and beautiful. Malakai Fekitoa finished it after a cross-kick from Barrett. The challenge had been set. Soon Barrett turned defensive hero, somehow felling rampaging back-row forwards as Ireland hammered at the line. A penalty accrued, but then the controversy ensued \u2013 and the heart was ripped out of Ireland\u2019s midfield. The tackles from New Zealand were flying in from all directions, most of them aimed at the upper chest, the \u201chits\u201d so beloved of the modern game. World Rugby, in their wisdom, have chosen not to deal with the cause of so many head injuries but to come down hard instead on the lottery of the outcomes, their directives muttering darkly about the severest sanctions. Sam Cane became the latest to expose himself to trouble by walloping Robbie Henshaw at shoulder height and catching him in the head. Henshaw was out cold and off. It could have been red for Cane, but that would have meant another game compromised by idiotic directives. Nevertheless, in the current climate, he was incredibly lucky not to see yellow. And three minutes later, Barrett was clean through to the line from a scrum, knifing through the patch Henshaw might have been patrolling. Sexton was agonisingly close to preventing the grounding, but the TMO sided with New Zealand again. Dane Coles was the next to escape with just a penalty, this with the most blatant offence of the lot \u2013 late, off-side, high and without arms on Conor Murray. When Aaron Smith was sent to the bin for a milder version of the same infringement minutes later, Ireland had their chance. They could not capitalise. Instead they lost Sexton \u2013 to another hamstring injury \u2013 and CJ Stander while Smith was gone. Cane, meanwhile, limped off for the All Blacks. Controversial the contest may have been, but it was as furious and compelling as we had dared hope. Ireland besieged New Zealand in the second half. Another yellow was shown, this to Fekitoa for a high shot on Simon Zebo. Again Ireland set up, again New Zealand stood strong, composure deserting the Irish when it mattered. But Paddy Jackson landed Ireland\u2019s third penalty just as Fekitoa returned. The Irish were within a score at last. Then came the dagger. Anton Lienert-Brown and Barrett combined to precipitate a blur of off-loads that sent Fekitoa over for his second. The final pass was contentious, and Rory Best duly contested it, but this time the referee would not refer it at all. The try stood, and the result was secure. The long and the short of it is they are still too good."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
