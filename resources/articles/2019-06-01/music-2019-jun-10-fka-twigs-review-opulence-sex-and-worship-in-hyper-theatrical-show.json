But a show like this, where she pushes both her own body and the boundaries of the stage to their physical limits, proves that after an intimidatingly high-profile breakup and a health scare, she\u2019s going into her second album cycle with a new confidence to do, and be, exactly as much as she wants. The tour, named Magdalene, opens with and returns to excerpts from Mary Magdalene: a new song that meditates on feminine self-love and its part in seduction. \u201cA woman\u2019s touch, a sacred geometry \u2026 Yes, I\u2019m here to open you.\u201d Mary Magdalene has often been (ahistorically) cast as a \u201csinful\u201d woman, a former sex worker, or as Christ\u2019s lover. Historical accuracy aside, evoking the cult of Magdalene makes explicit one of Twigs\u2019 thematic trademarks: sex, in her world, is worship and nourishment, unapologetically filthy and physical, a competition and a crucible. And the Magdalene show is both sexy and holy, a performance where the focus is on lean, gyrating bodies, and the audience mostly stands in quiet respect and awe like a congregation. Twigs has built much of her following on songs that can feel barely there: diaphanous production, shadows and echoes and breathy vocals. After all, what\u2019s more physical, what makes the reality of a body more present to the listener, than the sound of breathing? But now even her voice is taking up more space. Her trademark fragile whisper is as luminous as ever but on several new songs she sings in her lower register, and the effect is more earthly, human even, and not a little menacing. The live show plays with theatricality from the very beginning. Twigs emerges spotlit in front of the heavy red curtain in a black velvet doublet with enormous slashed sleeves and lace spilling out from every edge. She wears little cat-eye sunglasses like an Elizabethan club kid, and opens the show with a kinetic tap routine set to an a capella interplay of precise syllables. Over half a dozen costume changes, her outfits play on opulence, excess, abundance: a voluminous Marie Antoinette gown, a silver bomber jacket, the feathered ghost of a Cecil Beaton megahat. Her dancers wear deconstructed white cotton layers, crop tops with puffy sleeves or doublet-like dipped hems. The first half of the show sees them drift between yards of cloud-printed silky fabric, with hyper-theatrical touches like excessive smoke machine use, some business with masks and, at one point, a sword. It\u2019s a perfect, if occasionally slightly obvious, backdrop to Twigs\u2019 equally silky, vulnerable vocals as she burns through older songs like Water Me, Pendulum and Video Girl. Midway through, the fabric is dropped to reveal three levels of industrial scaffolding, the middle layer holding her band and the top giving the dancers an elevated platform \u2013 handy for this venue, where the stage is often set too low for those under six feet to see much of what\u2019s happening, despite paying $110 for the pleasure. The venue, which presented similar problems for St Vincent fans at last year\u2019s Vivid, received so many complaints on Sunday that they posted an apology promising to consider stage height in future. It\u2019s like we\u2019ve plummeted from the clouds to the underground \u2013 a feeling reverberated in the music, which takes a turn for the earthy and industrial. Some of the routines nod to the conventionally sexy choreography of the RnB music videos where FKA Twigs cut her teeth, all body rolls and sly slouching in perfect sync with her backing dancers, like art-school Aaliyah. The only time her look hints back at the rave-ready, bondage-inspired McQueen costumes of her last 2015 tour is when she takes to the pole at the centre of the stage setup in a glittering two-piece and towering perspex heels. For her comeback single, the spare and wrenching Cellophane, she decided that the song would require a specific style for the visual, so she spent a year adding pole dancing to her repertoire \u2013 but chooses to incorporate it here in a very different mode. To the sound of Lights On, she performs a precise and unshowy routine, lit expertly to let us see the constellations of lean muscles holding her in place, and finishing with a jade \u2013 a difficult inverted splits move \u2013 to the delighted screams of the audience. The main portion of the show climaxes, not to put too fine a point on it, with Two Weeks: the gloriously horny, almost aggressive invitation to a lover to ditch their current lady friend for her \u2013 it\u2019s all teeth, breath, thighs and bodies blooming open like ripe fruit. The ball gown, the creeping menace of the song\u2019s pitched-down hook in the background, and a rain of glitter that explodes over her during its heaving peak is the spectacular release we need, and the curtain closes in front of her, centre stage and beaming. But then she steps out in front of it again to close with Cellophane, with the spotlight back on her and her voice alone. As she sings the final lines \u2013 \u201cThey\u2019re waiting / And hoping / I\u2019m not enough\u201d \u2013 someone well up the back screams a retort they clearly prepared earlier: \u201cYou\u2019re MORE than enough!\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
