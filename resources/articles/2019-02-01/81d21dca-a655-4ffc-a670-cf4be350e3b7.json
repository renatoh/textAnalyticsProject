She gives Cairo \u201cthe packed lunch you didn\u2019t have when you were a little boy\u201d because we all start out in a crazy world where even our lunchboxes are gendered. Then she gets serious. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t I realise?\u201d she asks. \u201cI could have helped you more.\u201d This is a refrain that runs through The Making of Me (Channel 4), a simple, affecting series following nine people, and those who love them, over three years as they transition. It\u2019s both a masterclass in how to be a loving and supportive family or friend to a trans person and how, as the transcendent line from Jill Soloway\u2019s award-winning series Transparent goes: \u201cWhen one person transitions the entire family transitions.\u201d \u201cMy dad\u2019s transgender and he dresses up as a girl,\u201d says 10-year-old Izzy of her father, a mischievous security guard from Sheffield who is transitioning from Rupert to Vicky. Vicky recalls being fascinated by women\u2019s shoes in her mother\u2019s catalogues as an 11-year-old boy and how she suppressed her gender identity for 30 years, got married and had kids until \u201ceventually it came back\u201d. She worries about her deep voice, which leads to constant misgendering, and the impact of everything on her children: \u201cYou feel guilty, like you\u2019re taking something away from them \u2026 ie, a father.\u201d And what does Izzy make of her dad? \u201cHe\u2019s still my dad but we call him Vicky,\u201d she says. Later she is asked if she has advice for other children of trans parents. \u201cI\u2019ve got advice for Vicky,\u201d she says with a grin. \u201cDress better.\u201d In Chesterfield, 56-year-old project manager Simon, whose transgender name is Jackie, is awaiting facial surgery. The plan is to physically transition in the next two years. \u201cAt the moment we don\u2019t know what you are, do we?\u201d says Julie, Simon\u2019s wife of 35 years, who is fabulous and responds to all the transitions that transition brings with love, levity and a load of knitting. Weeks later, they are in hospital waiting for Simon to head into theatre. \u201cWhat if I don\u2019t fancy you after?\u201d she wonders. She\u2019d like him to emerge looking like Tom Hiddleston \u201cbut that would be totally off what you want\u201d. \u201cWho?\u201d Simon asks. It\u2019s a sweet bit of repartee but it also demonstrates the profound and often overlooked changes, in sexuality apart from anything else, that partners of trans people also undergo. Mostly, Julie is up for it. \u201cThe worst scenario would be to lose Jackie or Simon,\u201d she says. Less than a year later, she is helping Jackie weigh pudding rice to decide what breast size to choose. \u201cIt\u2019s more important to be soulmates,\u201d says Julie, knitting again. \u201cWe\u2019ve loved each other for nearly 40 years. That love doesn\u2019t go away.\u201d Cairo, who is having monthly testosterone injections, just wants people to \u201csee who I am\u201d. Men still hit on him. He gets misgendered a lot. \u201cWhat do I need to do to get people to understand that I\u2019m a man?\u201d he asks in frustration. His girlfriend isn\u2019t sure. \u201cI came into this relationship knowing who I was,\u201d she says of how she felt when Cairo came out as trans. \u201cI felt a bit betrayed. Can I be with a man?\u201d By the end, Cairo has been taking testosterone for almost a year, is on his first paid job as a male model, and single. \u201cPeople change,\u201d he says of the relationship ending. \u201cI\u2019m in such a happy place now.\u201d Like other recent Channel 4 programmes about gender identity (Genderquake, Trans Kids, Butterfly), The Making of Me explores trans people\u2019s lives from trans people\u2019s perspectives; the broad spectrum of lived experience so many of the toxic debates and culture wars obscure. Also, thankfully, without showing vast amounts of surgery. This simple approach is respectful and requisite in inflammatory times. One person\u2019s moral panic, after all, is another person\u2019s life. Which isn\u2019t to say the time for discussion is ever over, only that the time for empathy, listening and, well, living, is always now. As Jackie puts it after going to work as herself for the first time and finding a welcome sign in the women\u2019s toilets: \u201cI can just be me all the time. I can be happy.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
