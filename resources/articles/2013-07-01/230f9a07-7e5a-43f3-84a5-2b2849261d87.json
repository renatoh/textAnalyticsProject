Shelvey, a \u00a31.7m signing from Charlton two years ago, has made only 17 Premier League starts for Liverpool and will find his opportunities just as limited in the season ahead given Brendan Rodgers' array of attacking midfield options. Indeed the midfielder, who was capped by England against Sweden last November, has started only two league games this calendar year and is likely to be told he can leave the club when he discusses his future with the manager this month. Norwich, West Ham and Swansea are to consider lodging bids to sign the player permanently though, if Shelvey believes he can still make his mark at Liverpool, the option of a loan move may be more attractive. Holloway took the player for two months in late 2011 and saw him flourish, scoring six goals in 10 starts in the Championship and Palace now hope the chance of regular football at Selhurst Park persuades him to return south. The newly promoted side expect to secure the former West Bromwich Albion winger Jerome Thomas under freedom of contract, have signed Brighton's Stephen Dobbie while Peterborough's Dwight Gayle should become their record signing when he joins for an initial \u00a33.25m, rising to \u00a34.5m, on a five-year contract."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
