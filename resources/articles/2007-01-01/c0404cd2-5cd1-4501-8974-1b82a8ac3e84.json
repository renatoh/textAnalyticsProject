There are also some who come to us at 16 with low self-esteem because for one reason or another something has gone wrong at school. In a class there are usually two tutors and a couple of support staff. The job is varied - as well as support in class, there is personal care, feeding at dinnertime, just being there. We meet and greet in the morning, and we ensure all the students' needs are met so they can access what the college has to offer. Today I'm working with a couple of 16-year-olds and a couple in their 20s. On another day I could be working with someone who is 60. I teach literacy, numeracy, life skills and prep for work. There is loads on offer, including hairdressing and beauty, car maintenance, gardening, cooking and citizenship. It's rewarding seeing people fulfill their potential. You don't always get it right, but that's how you learn. I did a course in Understanding the Autistic Spectrum recently. It has helped me to understand people who are under the autistic spectrum and to recognise their needs. The college is really good at encouraging us to do courses. Most of them are free for staff. I'd like to learn more about dyslexia. If you understand what people see you can help them more in their learning. Hopefully, I will be able to progress this year. I've heard there are a couple of positions coming up that involve more academic responsibility. I would still be supporting the students, but would take on more of a tutorial role, working alongside the tutors. \u00b7 Debbie Brown is a learning support assistant at Castle College, Nottingham"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
