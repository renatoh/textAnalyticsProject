The declaration was made by President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who sacked three Ministers and suspended parliament for two weeks while Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was visiting the United States. The President has accused Wickremesinghe of being too soft in talks which ended nearly two decades of civil war with the Tamil Tiger rebels, who want an independent homeland. She increased the powers of the armed forces, which are said to be preparing for a potential resumption of hostilities by the Tigers. Despite the President's protests that the delicate peace process will continue, the rebels have warned that it may be threatened by her actions. This would again make the country dangerous for visitors. The Foreign Office is not advising people against travelling to Sri Lanka, though it said a return to fighting and terrorist activity could not be ruled out. An official said: 'The vast majority of visits to Sri Lanka are trouble-free but this could change following the declaration of a State of Emergency.' The FO, whose website is at www.fco.gov.uk, repeated its existing advice to Britons to avoid the north and eastern regions, which are heavily mined, especially the Tamil-dominated Jaffna peninsula. Tourism began to recover after the separatists agreed a ceasefire with the government in February 2002 following fighting which claimed the lives of 64,000 people. Previously the war, coupled with the threat of terrorist attacks, had scared off many holidaymakers. 'There has been a 25 per cent increase in the number of visitors this year following the ceasefire, and the cricket matches are drawing people here,' said a spokeswoman for the Sri Lanka Tourist Board. She did not expect rioting or attacks to break out. She said the developments were merely constitutional and would not affect tourism. Travel companies which run trips to Sri Lanka said they were operating normally but monitoring the situation and following Foreign Office advice. Kuoni Travel said its representatives in the capital, Colombo, had reported no civil unrest in the country and said local people's daily activities had not been affected. A spokeswoman said: 'All clients in, or due to travel to Sri Lanka are being updated and reassured that all holidays are operating without disruption. However, should the situation change we will take every action to ensure our clients' safety.' Cox &amp; Kings said that if necessary customers on holiday in Sri Lanka would be brought back, and those due to go would be offered alternative dates or destinations at no extra cost. 'Sri Lanka has been doing very well since the ceasefire, so this is not fantastic. We just hope the country continues to do well,' said a spokeswoman. The England cricketers are due to play their first match in Sri Lanka on 15 November and stay until a few days before Christmas."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
