We all think it is absurd when polls are produced saying that Ulysses is the greatest novel or Sgt Pepper the greatest album, but we find ourselves reading them all the same. So it is with league tables of economic performance. It doesn't really matter a fig where Britain ranks in the competitiveness rankings produced by the World Economic Forum, but we still want to know. Just for the record (and because you're almost certainly curious), Britain moved up four places this year to 11th. Had it not been for our poor infrastructure and inadequately educated workforce, we might even had made it to the top ten, where the Nordic countries dominated the top of the table, filling four of the top six places. Leaving to one side the somewhat spurious nature of comparing inter-country competitiveness, the points made by the WEF about the UK are reasonable enough. As yesterday's unemployment data showed, Britain has a strong record for creating jobs and its economic stability means it is a good place to do business. But beneath the surface of the economy lurk all sorts of weaknesses, from the slow take-up in IT to the woeful state of the railways. But while we've still got a long way to go to catch up with the Scandinavians - no sign there that tax and spend policies are a barrier to growth - we can at least celebrate that we've overtaken the Germans this year (13th) and have left the French (27th) for dead. Buy George There was a moment of excitement on Tuesday week as a formal stock market announcement popped out on Matalan. The family-controlled chain of discount fashion sheds is repeatedly touted as a takeover target for Wal-Mart. In recent months the shares have had more spikes than a Jimmy Choo warehouse as dealers bet repeatedly on the boys from Bentonville striding into Skelmersdale and banging their cash on the counter. But the moment of excitement was just that: a sharp intake of breath and then a long, dull sigh. The announcement, it turned out, was news of an approach received for Matalan's Lee Cooper brand of jeans. The label was acquired three years ago for \u00a345m and is now a loss-making brand which might fetch \u00a325m. This little deal, however, won't stop the speculation about the imminent arrival of the Wal-Martians. The thesis is that WalMart wants Matalan as a showcase for its George fashions. But, sadly, the thesis has more holes than one of George's crocheted ponchos. Asda has no need to buy a chain of out-of-town stores for its popular clothing ranges. It is trialling George on the high street, because that is still where most fashion is bought. Indeed 70% of fashion purchases are still made in town centres and that is the location that Asda chief executive Tony De Nunzio has targeted for future growth. He is also believed to be looking to the high street to expand the group's supermarket business. Asda is effectively prevented from expanding out of town by competition rules, so it is quietly piloting stores of just 15,000sq ft on high streets like Barking in London. If it works there will be more. Forget Matalan. The smart punters should be targeting the high street - a medium sized chain, maybe, for just George. Or perhaps something a little larger, with outlets that could accommodate these foodhalls - and additional space for George. Bach to front Willie (Lord) Bach, the defence procurement minister, flew to Washington last night to lobby Pentagon chiefs and senior Bush administration officials in favour of AugustaWestland as the supplier of the new fleet of helicopters to ferry Mr Bush (or Kerry) from the White House to Camp David and beyond. It's an 11th-hour dash along a path beaten often in the past few months by Tony Blair, trying to persuade the US to buy an Anglo-Italian helicopter for its commander-in-chief rather than an American Sikorski. Bach, we're told, has been promised a firm decision after the elections on November 2, certainly before January's inauguration of the new president. But, in beating the drum for British industry and Westland, now wholly-owned by Italy's Finmeccanica, he may find it a hard sell for an administration bent on pursuing to the hilt Boeing's case against \"illegal subsidies\" for Airbus. Harry Stonecipher, Boeing's boss, has been whispering loud into Bush's ear that the Europeans are mighty keen on pumping state aid into Airbus to knock its US rival out of the skies, but utterly frugal on spending money on their own defence - while encouraging their arms contractors to prise open the lucrative US military market. Also, Bush's team will certainly tell Bach that the UK seems strangely reluctant to cough up the \u00a31bn for new Lynx helicopters for the RAF - built by Westland at Yeovil - though a decision is likely on that too before the new year. We can only wish Willie an interesting 36 hours in the federal capital. But he shouldn't expect a red carpet."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
