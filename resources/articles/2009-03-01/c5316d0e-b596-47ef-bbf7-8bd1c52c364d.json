The Tottenham manager plans to challenge the top four of the Premier League next season, following the path of Villa during the current campaign where Martin O'Neill's men have put pressure on Arsenal for the final place among Europe's elite. Arsenal could be back in fourth place by the time Spurs kick off at Villa Park tomorrow \u2013 and Redknapp feels his club's fierce rivals will eventually finish ahead of Villa. \"I think Villa will just miss out on the top four,\" Redknapp said. \"They have done very, very well and they're a good side, but Arsenal have got players coming back now, key players like [Theo] Walcott and [Cesc] F\u00e1bregas who will make the difference to them. \"I'd love to see Villa do it. It would be good for everybody if someone could break into the top four. Everton have done fantastically well too. They have both pushed the top four and hopefully one of them can make it, but if you asked me to put my life on it, I would go with the big four.\" Redknapp's prediction is unlikely to go down well with Villa fans, who targeted the Spurs boss for abuse while he was at Portsmouth. Earlier in the season a supporter narrowly missed him with a 50p coin but struck Phil Sharp, leaving the assistant referee with a cut forehead. John Billington was given a five-year football banning order after an inquiry into the incident. \"The guy who threw it is a moron,\" said Redknapp. The 62-year-old, when asked if he feared going back, added: \"Not in the slightest.\" Redknapp has been encouraged by the form his side have shown since his arrival at White Hart Lane, with 30 points from 20 games. He wants to aim high next season, adding: \"For us to be where Villa are? Hopefully next year. I would like to be. If you are not looking that way, then what are you aiming for? No good saying 'I hope we finish in the top half next year.' We have to hope for better. \"The size of this club, the potential, the fan base and the money invested, we should be pushing to get up there, shouldn't we? \"On our day, we are capable of giving anyone a game \u2013 we've got good players here and the club has invested heavily in the transfer window in the last few years. We just had an horrific start.\" Redknapp has allowed Adel Taarabt join QPR on loan until the end of the season. \"Harry Redknapp told me Tottenham are not really in a position to give young players like me an opportunity right now, and he said QPR were keen on me,\" Taarabt said. \"He told me to come here [Loftus Road] and show what I can do. As soon as he told me about the move I was interested.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
