The result of the appeal is expected later this summer and while the Board's AGM yesterday highlighted another year of development for the sport which saw increased attendances and record prize-money, Broughton emphasised the \"far-reaching impact in limiting how the industry could progress\" after the European court of justice ruling in favour of William Hill last November. \"Justice Laddie's findings in the recent case against Victor Chandler International encourages us,\" said Broughton. \"The point he made about income to the BHB being for the benefit of those who have a commercial interest in the sport is a very important one.\" He added: \"We always felt that we had fact on our side. Precedent is not great in terms of courts overturning ECJ judgements but you can take it from me that we are optimistic.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
