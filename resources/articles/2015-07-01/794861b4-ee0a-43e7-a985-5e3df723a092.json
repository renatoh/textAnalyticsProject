A prolific author, journalist and screenwriter, Ellis has written speeches for Labor leaders including Bob Carr, Paul Keating and Kim Beazley, but in recent years singled out Julia Gillard for harsh criticism in his election diary Suddenly, Last Winter. \u201cThe news is very bad and I may have months to live but it is more like weeks,\u201d Ellis, 73, posted on his personal blog Table Talk on Sunday. The editor of Independent Australia, Dave Donovan, who publishes Ellis\u2019s regular commentary, confirmed the news was bleak on Twitter on Monday. Ellis\u2019s friend Wendy Harmer told Guardian Australia she admired him greatly as a writer. \u201cBob\u2019s long and passionate love affair with the English language is an inspiration to anyone who loves words,\u201d Harmer said. \u201cEvery line he writes crackles with energy. Every essay and column is stuffed full of ideas, erudition and an exhortation to action. And, after all these years honing his fine craftsmanship, his words still have the same raw power you\u2019d find from a speaker standing under a tree in the Domain. As a performer, the finest compliment I can offer is that Bob\u2019s words are best said aloud.\u201d Journalist Mike Carlton was a fellow cadet with Ellis in the ABC newsroom in Sydney in the 1960s. \u201cI\u2019ve always thought he was half mad, but in the nicest possible way, and I am residually very fond of him,\u201d Carlton told Guardian Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s very sad to hear that he is at death\u2019s door although, given his capacity for lurid exaggeration, he may actually be in rude good health but just a bit bored.\u201d A writer of books, plays, screenplays, speeches and commentary for almost 50 years, Ellis is being treated at Mona Vale hospital on Sydney\u2019s northern beaches. A friend told Guardian Australia Ellis was undergoing more tests on Monday. Ellis has been posting health updates since Saturday when he revealed was waiting for the result of a liver function test and his blog \u201cmay cease altogether\u201d. But not even the shock diagnosis was enough to stop him writing about politics. He continued to blog about his nemesis, the Speaker Bronwyn Bishop, whom he famously stood against in the seat of Mackellar in 1994. \u201cIt is certain she will not go of her own accord,\u201d he wrote of her expenses crisis. He said Bishop had been well on the way to the prime ministership until he \u201cbrought her undone\u201d. Ellis also promised to forge ahead with the launch of his latest book, a \u201cpolitical fiction\u201d called Abbott: The Worst Three Hundred Days, in August if his health permitted. As messages of support poured in, Ellis wrote on Monday \u201cAm feeling a bit crook, and hearing of miracle cures ... There have been many, many lovely messages.\u201d While he has enjoyed acclaimed as an author, a defamation action brought by Tony Abbott and former treasurer Peter Costello against his political book Goodbye Jerusalem (1997) almost broke him and cost the publisher $277,000. \u201cIt cost me the right to address massed rallies at demonstrations,\u201d Ellis told the ABC in 2004. \u201cIt cost me the column on moral issues I had in the Sydney Morning Herald. It cost me status, unbelievable. I had a future before it. I have now, probably, only a past.\u201d He has written dozens of film and television scripts, including the 1992 feature film The Nostradamus Kid, an autobiographical story in which Noah Taylor played a young Ellis in pursuit of a young woman. He also wrote Cactus, Man of Flowers and My First Wife with Paul Cox in the 1990s and won an Australian Film Institute award for the 1978 movie Newsfront. Political strategist and former Rudd adviser Bruce Hawker said he hoped talk of Ellis\u2019s demise was premature and there were \u201cmany more years in the old bloke\u201d. \u201cI think he is unique in Australian political commentary,\u201d Hawker told Guardian Australia. \u201cHe\u2019s a highly opinionated writer who has been around for decades and I think people really enjoy his books on political campaigns. \u201cHe\u2019s the closest thing we\u2019ve got to a Hunter S Thompson, edgy style of writing. \u201cI love Bob\u2019s writing and his darker, sentimental writing is without peer. I hope he just keeps on going for as long as he possibly can and we have a miracle delivery from all this.\u201d The cinematographer on The Nostradamus Kid, Geoff Burton, said Ellis was \u201cinexplicably\u201d attractive to women in his youth despite his dishevelled appearance. \u201cHe had shocking greasy hair,\u201d Burton told the ABC. \u201cIn those days he wore a full-length gaberdine overcoat and for months I never knew what he had on underneath it, if anything. And yet he managed to attract these most extraordinary women.\u201d His marriage to fellow writer Anne Brooksbank, with whom he has three children, has survived despite his admission of infidelity in the late 1990s. Ellis once described himself as somewhere between a philosopher and a standup comedian, both of whom \u201cbring new thoughts in the world\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
