Rapid-play time limits allow anything from three to six rounds to be completed in a day, as against at most two rounds of classical long play.Hotel and venue costs, plus fees to grandmasters based partly on an event's length, currrently form a major part of GM tournament budgets. Odessa's Pivdenny Bank Cup has become an established top rapid event. The top-seeded Vasily Ivanchuk, ranked No4 in the world behind Vlad Kramnik, Vishy Anand and Veselin Topalov in Fide's July 2007 list, fought out first place with Alexander Grischuk, probably the world No1 in rapid play. At the end Ivanchuk had 7/9, Grischuk 6.5, then a gap to Teimour Radjabov and Alexei Shirov 5.5 and Boris Gelfand 5. The former world title challenger Viktor Korchnoi, now aged 76 but still a tough competitor, scored a respectable 3/9 and avoided last place with the stunning trap revealed by White's final move in this week's game.
