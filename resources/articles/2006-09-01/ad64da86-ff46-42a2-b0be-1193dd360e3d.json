It was, of course, a tough post to fill, since only three candidates - the heads of the Commission for Racial Equality, the Disability Rights Commission and the Equal Opportunities Commission - were ever really in with a shout, and the other two wouldn't touch it with a bargepole. So we fully understand Ruth Kelly's need to hire a leading firm of headhunters to find just the right person. And we are most grateful to her staff for getting this firm's fee down from an exorbitant 25-33% of annual salary to 20%, which even on Trev's humble existing per annum of \u00a3150k amounts to a mere \u00a330,000 of all our money. Such astute stewardship of the public finances can, we feel, only bode well for the dear girl's next big job, the revaluation of our beloved council tax. How heartening, in these obesity-stricken times, to learn that Abel Gonzalez's splendid concoction, Fried Coke (deep-fried Coca-Cola flavoured batter drizzled with Coke syrup and topped off with whipped cream and cinnamon sugar), has won first prize for creativity at this week's Big Tex Food Choice Awards. Not even close relatives are safe, it seems, as the War Against Hand-Cream rages: \"All foreign travellers are investigated and go through strict luggage inspection,\" Anat Nairn, a former Israeli security screener, tells Bloomberg News. \"If somebody's really suspicious, you pull everything and his mother out of that suitcase.\" Blame it on easyJet spokesman Toby Nicholl, who brilliantly justifies his company's plan to charge passengers for a second bag by \"the recent explosion in the amount of baggage put in holds\". Back in the dark and desperate days of 2003, when the Tories were at their lowest ebb and the tide was showing no signs of turning, this paper thoughtfully commissioned a hot young ad agency to come up with a campaign that might actually win votes. Their radical new post-political concept was to take any good experience and link it to the Conservatives, and any bad one and associate it with Labour. Thus, a sad-faced woman might appear with the words \"My cat died under Labour\", or a happy chap with \"We won the Cup under the Conservatives\". Simple but brilliant, the winning slogan was: \"It rained less under a Conservative government\". Yesterday Dave Fotherington-Cameron's newly resurgent Conservative party said it had retained the hot young agency in question, Karmarama, to help it design a series of \"innovative campaign projects\", including, quite possibly, its local election strategy. This, it appears to us, is beyond irony. But are we to believe it is an accident that the system devised by the National Consumer Council to allow local government to identify areas where it can be difficult to find healthy, unprocessed food is called the Food Access Radar Toolkit, or Fart? And so to our old friend Mr Brian Coleman, the ever-emollient chair of the London assembly, member of the London Fire and Emergency Protection Authority, president of the Hendon and Edgware District Scouts, deputy mayor of Barnet and - crucially - that council's cabinet member for community safety (despite, oddly, a number of impassioned outbursts against traffic-calming measures in the borough). We are deeply indebted, as ever, to the Barnet Times for the cheering news that Mr Coleman has just been banned from driving for six months and fined \u00a3300 after being caught exceeding a 30mph limit in Borehamwood last January, thus adding three points to the nine he already had on his licence. For shame, Bri. We do not, finally, make fun of people's names in this column. We may, however, en as it were passant, alert you to the fact that the Reuters representative in Khartoum is the excellent Ms Opheera McDoom, and that in the education department of Kent State University, Ohio, there is a graduate research assistant called Mr Wang Dong. diary@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
