Last year the interest in the reality show dropped by half after the first week, but this time the programme's appeal is increasing. In Hitwise's top 100 for the week ending June 5 only BBCi's weather centre was ahead of Big Brother, which occupied the number 2, 23 and 81 slots. Hell's Kitchen was at number 30. So what has caused the sudden interest in the programme when only 12 months ago, critics and pundits were writing it off? Hitwise's general manager Simon Chamberlain thinks it is because the housemates are more interesting than they were last year. And, of course, many more people have the internet and particularly broadband in their homes than they did 12 months ago. Peter Cowley, head of interactivity at Big Brother's producer Endemol, agrees with Chamberlain: \"Things are going on in the TV show that influence the traffic to the website, and it was built as that feedback loop in the first place. So the casting this year we think is much better, creating more conflict or, I'd guess, titillation in some of the relationships going on in there.\" And there has been a lot of talk about titillation this time around. Much of the coverage in the runup to the start of the series was about sex and whether there would be any on screen. Such speculation overlooked the fact that unless the censorship laws changed pretty radically the clear answer would be no, not overtly on a popular television programme. But that still left the teasing prospect of a little more leeway on the web. Anyone left wondering will have to pay to find out. For the first time, the Big Brother website is carrying extra content exclusive to the internet, and if you have not paid for it you are taken to the RealNetworks website and offered the opportunity to hand over some money. Thereafter behind-the-scenes documentaries will be released to you at the rate of one a week, for example, as well as other bits of extended footage. This is likely to increase year-on-year as long as the show continues to be a success, although some will hanker after the days of the first series, when there were free webstreams all the time. There are free extras as well. There are a lot of websites following Big Brother, but Endemol believes the way to maintain loyalty to the official Channel 4 site is to offer stuff the competition can't. \"We wanted to create a bit more value this year,\" says Cowley. \"We have good access to the family and friends of the contestants and we get them a couple of times a week writing small columns, or doing webchats with the evicted housemates, and we probably haven't used that enough in previous years.\" Casting remains central to the programme, however, and in spite of Kitten dominating the opening week, Cowley believes the remaining people will create enough sparks to keep the punters tuning in and logging on. \"There are enough stories in the house: Michelle and Stuart having a bit of a love-in, and Stuart not quite sure what's going on, Ahmed and Marco arguing, there are lots of sort of subplots going on which is the way Big Brother should work.\" It is, he says, just like a soap opera - you watch lots of plots unfold. Which, given that soap operas are supposed to reflect real life, is probably reasonable enough. If it has been good for Endemol then it is also good for Channel 4. \"We're averaging around 4m page impressions a day,\" says Andy Grumbridge, managing editor of interactive at the channel. And the rest of channel4.com benefits. \"It extends our reach, so if you've got the pure Big Brother fan coming in they will see the breadth and depth of all the other stuff. They're very likely to click on 4Entertainment or 4Dating, for example.\" It is, of course, no coincidence that these microsites address the same demographic as Big Brother. \"One of the things we're very pleased about is that this year more than any other year we've got a host of relevant items on the site - 4Car, 4Homes are all being cross-promoted from Big Brother. Every year we've seen a rise in traffic to channel4.com post-Big Brother, and it never quite goes back down to where it was before.\" This was even true last year, when the Big Brother website lost half its viewers during the first week. It would be premature to start talking about trends - in 2003 many people said the format was finished. Then, in the runup to the latest series and Hell's Kitchen, articles abounded about how the entire reality TV market was dying, which it patently isn't. According to Hitwise's figures, channel4.com/bigbrother is more than holding its own and is 54% bigger than the previous year; a 770% increase in internet visits from the opening day until the middle of the second week augurs well for future projects. Cowley says there's more money to be made out of internet sites built around TV programmes: \"There's been a huge uptake of broadband and a lot of broadband ISPs and their customers are looking for good, rich content to illustrate what broadband can do,\" he says. \"And if you're a big fan of a show like Pop Idol, Big Brother or Fame Academy, I think those customers may watch more online than they would on television. It's a smaller market than the TV market but we're willing to invest our time and effort into this sort of area - in the next two or three years there will be even more, where you can catch up with shows you've missed or watch exclusive bits on broadband.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
