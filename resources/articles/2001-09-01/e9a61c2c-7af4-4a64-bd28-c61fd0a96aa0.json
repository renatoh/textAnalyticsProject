Lucas Neill equalised with a header for Blackburn two minutes from time but a debut goal from Rod Wallace, who scored with a flashing header only six minutes after emerging as a second-half substitute, helped Bolton leapfrog Leeds. Though Bolton have acclimatised to the Premiership with surprising vigour, it has almost gone unnoticed that Blackburn too have shown signs of good health on their return to the top-flight. Tottenham have already been beaten here, Manchester United came perilously close to a similar fate, and with a touch more fortune Graeme Souness's side could have started last night with a significantly better points tally. At the end of the season, however, Blackburn will not want to reflect on what-ifs. They had the better of the opening half, in terms of possession at least, but seldom displayed the penetrative edge to get behind a Bolton side that had yet to concede an away goal this season. Bolton, in fact, have nurtured a formidable record away from the Reebok stadium, establishing a club record with 14 victories on their travels last season. Yet they seldom emerged as an attacking force throughout an erratic first 45 minutes and were relieved to see Alan Mahon, with a ballooned shot, and Corrado Grabbi, with a missed header, squander the best two chances of the half. Given the history between these two clubs, not to mention some recent tetchiness in their First Division quarrels, the placid nature of the game was a disappointment. Damien Duff, perhaps the Premiership's most in-form player, continued to drive Blackburn forward in a much-improved second half but his excellent supply of crosses from the left flank was too often wasted by his colleagues and when he himself went through, just before the hour, the winger scuffed his shot tamely wide. Such profligacy may prove costly in the long run and there is certainly a case that Grabbi, the \u00a36.75m summer recruit from Ternana, has done little as yet to justify his price tag. The Italian wears No21 to show how many goals he accumulated in finishing as Serie B's leading scorer last season. Blackburn can only hope they don't have to reserve the No3 jersey for next season. Bolton, meanwhile, already have the comfort of a cushion against the threat of relegation."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
