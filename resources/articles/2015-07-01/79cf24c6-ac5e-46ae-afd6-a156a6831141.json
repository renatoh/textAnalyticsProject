The Spaniard was afforded a mixed reception on his first return to north London last April following his \u00a327m transfer from Barcelona to Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s side during the previous summer. Yet, as the 28-year-old gears himself up for more of the same, he believes nothing can detract from his time playing for Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, who helped establish the midfielder as one of the finest in Europe before he moved to the Camp Nou in August 2011. \u201cWhatever it is, it is. The love I have for that club will never change whatever happens and what is the most important is what I have with me are the memories,\u201d said F\u00e0bregas, who spent eight years at Arsenal. \u201cThe rest doesn\u2019t matter. I have great memories, love and respect for the club. You will never hear anything bad from me about them. \u201cOf course, it is not the most important game but we want to win and compete. It is a big game, a London derby at Wembley in front of all the fans \u2013 it\u2019s a nice competition to play in. Even if it is a pre-season game you still want to win. We are not worried that they might be fresher than us \u2013 they started 10 days before us \u2013 but we are competitors, we will want to win and it will probably be a great game.\u201d Mourinho, who finally sold the full-back Filipe Lu\u00eds back to Atl\u00e9tico Madrid for \u00a316m on Tuesday just a year after signing him, has cast aspersions on those who believe Wenger has been the frugal spender the Frenchman would like people to believe, yet the truth remains that both clubs will arrive at Wembley on Sunday with only minimal changes to their squads this summer. Petr Cech will start against his former club while the Colombia striker Radamel Falcao, on loan from Monaco, is set to feature for Chelsea. \u201c[Manchester] United already spent last year, Arsenal last year too. We spend, [Manchester] City maybe less, then now they spend again,\u201d added F\u00e0bregas. \u201cThey all want to compete and it will be for sure very difficult to retain the Premier League. There are four or five teams who can win it. We will see what happens but we know we will have to fight again. \u201cPeople will say United, City, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea \u2013 there will always be divided opinions. What we have to do is to the maintain the levels of last season because all the teams will be better and that means we will better so we can compete against them to do well.\u201dHe added: \u201cIt has been important for us to get started again. We know we are one of the teams who started later than others, most of the teams started earlier but I think the method we use for training is the right one to try and compete all season. We have a good squad. Let\u2019s see if a few players come in but we are happy with what we have and we will try and compete until the end.\u201d Meanwhile, Chelsea\u2019s other new arrival, Asmir Begovic, is looking forward to beginning his career in west London despite knowing the prospect of dislodging Thibaut Courtois is a daunting one. \u201cIt was tough decision for the fact that I had a lot of ties and good relationships with Stoke City after five and a half years and it was difficult to leave it behind,\u201d said the Bosnian, who was a prime target for Mourinho following Cech\u2019s move to Arsenal this summer. \u201cI want to test myself against Thibaut \u2013 he\u2019s one of the best goalkeepers in the world \u2013 but I believe in myself. Hopefully every time I can show everybody what I\u2019m all about and ultimately help this team. We all have to play our part at a club like this. \u201cFor me it was more of a challenge to try something different. I think I was at that stage where I want to test myself against the best and that\u2019s ultimately what I\u2019ve come here to do. Even after the first week you can see the quality here and how they can improve you with the levels and demands here.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
