I have a varied and extensive CV at the moment and I don't know how to make it work to my advantage. I have jumped from one short term contract to another, mainly in events management and marketing and administration. I think I am confusing employers and come across as though I can't stick at anything, and as though I don't know what I want. This is partially true as I find it very difficult to commit to one industry or vocation. Shall I just have multiple CV's? Please advise! A Before we get on to the problem of how best to present your CV I think you have to discover your true vocation. Though, in the modern economy, it is no bad thing to be able to drift into different types of jobs. Your working pattern involving events management, marketing and administration have some tenuous links where you have been able to use your range of skills to get short term contracts. However, perhaps it is time to take stock and find the work that is compatible with your whole personality and the work that you will enjoy. This is not that difficult to suss out. Start by reading and re-reading Nick William's inspiring book, The work we were born to do: find the work you love, love the work you do\" (ISBN: 1862045526, Element Books, \u00a312.99). The book is aimed at anyone who is seeking to change work, get re-inspired or is simply seeking direction. The author offers his readers a chance to explore how to bring more creativity, integrity, fulfilment and fun into your work. He has identified twelve principles of the work that each one of us is born to do. He shows how we can activate these principles to amazing effect and use them to be who we truly are, whatever the stage we have reached in our working lives. The book details the author's own personal journey through the joys and challenges of major life change, including several case studies of people who have created the work they were born to do. As for enhancing the appeal of your CV, there is no lack of experts to help you sex up your document. The one web based outfit that has caught my eye is www.imagecv.com/CVManual.htm. The website will show you how to make reading your CV an enjoyable experience for the prospective employer. There is a handy CV writing manual that explodes the traditional one or two page CV myths, to show you how you can write a CV that has all the detail required, but which still remains catchy. Other useful links: The Prospects site covers CV's and covering letters, interview tips, online applications and a very useful self-assessment section covering aptitude tests; personality assessments and employer self selection tests. Highly recommended. The University of Cambridge careers site offers useful guidelines on writing CV's, covering letters and filling in application forms and includes a list of dos and don'ts, common spelling mistakes and useful action words. On the high street, most local councils run Information, Advice and Guidance (IAG) partnerships, a network of local organisations offering information, advice and guidance on careers and learning to all adults who live or work in the area. This is part of a government initiative that has been set up to offer adults free and impartial information and advice on all aspects of learning and work. It is a completely free service that provides personal advice on careers and learning by telephone, email or in a face to face interview. Your local reference library should have the details of your nearest IAG centre."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
