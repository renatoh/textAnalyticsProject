It was a dramatic finale to a compelling game. \"The driving lineout was pretty much their one weapon,\" said Dai Young, the Wasps director of rugby. \"They didn't try or need to play any other way.\" In any other walk of life you would have called it bullying. Northampton scored four tries \u2013 for only the third time this season \u2013 and all four of them came from those driving mauls. Wasps were shown three yellow cards for the various ways in which they tried to stop it. In the end, their best policy was to bring on the artillery. Joe Launchbury and James Haskell, fresh from England duty, were introduced early in the second half and made quite an impact, as did Taulafo and Tom Lindsay. Wasps had turned the game round to enter the final quarter with a five-point lead after Elliot Daly's brilliant try inthe corner. But they fell foul of the referee's whistle, conceding five penalties in the last12 minutes, all but two of them harsh. Sadly, the most important, the fifth, looked fair, with Billy Vunipola in front of Joe Simpson when the scrum-half cleared in the 78th minute. Northampton set up one last, unashamedly unsubtle assault on the Wasps line. It proved successful, with Hartley helping to drive Christian Day through some flimsy fringe defence for a last-minute try, which Stephen Myler converted for the win. Afterwards, Young became the latest coach to disapprove of the way David Rose handled a match \u2013 although Jim Mallinder, Northampton's director of rugby, inevitably, thought Rose was rather good. \"There's no point throwing stones at the referee,\" said Young. \"It doesn't change anything. I don't think anyone in the stadium ever felt we were going to be allowed to get out of our own half. \"Going into the last 10 minutes I always felt a penalty was going to come from somewhere to make sure we ended up inside our 22.\" So it did, but a word in young Vunipola's ear might not go amiss, either. To be off-side was one thing; to carry on stubbornly and needlessly chasing was another. It would have been a remarkable achievement for Wasps to have won the game, bearing in mind the snow and wind and the power of Northampton's maul, but they nearly pulled it off. They played the more eye-catching rugby and scored two stunning tries. Daly's was the better, but on any other day Tom Varndell's effort from 60 metres out would have been talked about long after the final whistle. The beauty of this game, though, is the variety of ways it can be played. Here was a clash of two of them. It was the brawn that won out. \"It is tough,\" said Hartley, the man of the match and scorer of Northampton's third try, just before the break. \"With the driving maul you've got to stop it at source. Once it's got up a head of steam there's no stopping it and you have to commit to pulling it down or coming in at the side. The ref was on our side because we were so strong there.\" The win keeps Northampton in the fourth play-off spot. Wasps, meanwhile, are seven points adrift of them. But for that last-gasp try they would have been level. Cue the dramatic reactions.
