Having tied up the final loose ends on its domestic rights deals and finalised the outstanding overseas deals in Russia and Albania, the Premier League will have banked more than \u00a33.3bn from its media contracts at home and abroad, even once all expenses are factored in. That is an astonishing increase on the \u00a32.7bn achieved last time, particularly given the context of a global recession, with overseas rights as the main engine of growth. But don't expect too much triumphalist talk from Richard Scudamore \u2013 the chief executive is under pressure from clubs not to highlight the windfall for fear of triggering another round of the wage inflation that has contributed to ruinously stretched balance sheets at the KC Stadium, Fratton Park and elsewhere. From a regulatory point of view, the Yahoo deal also helps the Premier League by giving it another substantial media group other than Sky on its roster of rights holders, alongside ESPN and the BBC. The media regulator Ofcom, currently facing Sky's lawyers in a Competition Appeal Tribunal hearing to determine whether its decision to force the pay TV broadcaster to cut wholesale prices for Sky Sports should apply straight away ahead of an appeal, is threatening to look afresh at the way the Premier League structures its rights auctions. Chester rising from ashes On a pivotal day for fans hoping to establish a new football club in the city in the wake of Chester City's sorry demise, Cheshire West and Chester Council will this morning hear from two consortiums hoping to take over the Deva Stadium. In a Dragons Den style scenario, fan's group City Fans United will present their vision for a new club first before Fodbold Selskabet, a Danish consortium previously associated with a takeover of Chester City, do likewise. Representatives of CFU \u2013 which has signed up more than 1,600 members \u2013 hope the fact that they will arrive with a business plan that includes pledges of support from local sponsors and a vision for 100% fan-owned club will swing the decision their way. The council does not have long to decide, given that the FA deadline for registering the new club is the second week of May. The new \"phoenix club\" will probably have to begin its clamber back up the football pyramid in the Unibond League. Bar\u00e7a's 'no' to equality Barcelona have said they are \"diametrically opposed\" to calls from 26 clubs in the top two Spanish divisions to share their TV revenues more equally. Ahead of last night's Champions League tie, the club responded vigorously to those calling on them and rivals Real Madrid to reconsider the system that allows each club to sell their own TV rights and thus reinforces their dominance. All of which makes it even more intriguing that Ivan Bravo, Real Madrid's director of strategic affairs, was seen meeting Premier League executives in London this week. He was understood to be seeking more information on how the Premier League's collective model works \u2013 presumably in order to gather ammunition to help him maintain the status quo in Spain. Modi tweets up the heat It's clear what suspended IPL chief Lalit Modi has been doing with the time he now has on his hands. Since he was enveloped in the growing controversy surrounding the competition earlier this week, Modi has been tweeting more frantically than ever. Given that his use of the social networking site was partly to blame for getting him into trouble in the first place, that might not be entirely wise. Alongside an avalanche of tweets engaging his followers in a series of trivia questions about this year's edition of the IPL, he also revealed yesterday that he planned to write a tell-all book."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
