Hong Kong\u2019s leader, Carrie Lam, has staked her authority on pushing through the legislation, vowing not to back down during a week in which protests have convulsed the city. She has compared demonstrators who were pelted with rubber bullets and teargas to spoilt children. But one of her senior advisers, an influential pro-Beijing politician, said on Friday the bill would have to be delayed, while a senior Chinese diplomat attempted to distance Beijing from the law. Bernard Chan, a top aide to Lam, admitted he had underestimated the opposition of the business community to the new law. \u201cI think it is impossible to discuss [it] under such confrontation. It would be very difficult,\u201d Chan told RTHK radio. \u201cAt the very least we should not escalate the antagonism.\u201d Michael Tien, a pro-Beijing legislator, also called for a delay in a long Facebook post in which he said the \u201cbloody conflict\u201d of recent days had left him \u201cheartbroken\u201d. \u201cI hope the government will delay the discussions of the bill at the Legislative Council,\u201d he said, adding that a delay should be seen as responsible politics rather than a sign of caving in to pressure. Lam has not made any statements since Wednesday\u2019s crackdown on protesters. Another opposition march has been called for Sunday. The legislation was ostensibly proposed to allow the extradition to Taiwan of a Hong Kong man accused of murdering his girlfriend on the self-governing island. Lam says she has promised the woman\u2019s family justice. But the bill\u2019s many critics say it is a dangerously open-ended piece of legislation that will destroy the foundations of Hong Kong society by allowing China to target political enemies and try them in China\u2019s opaque courts, where the conviction rate is as high as 99%. The end of a judicial \u201cfirewall\u201d around the city would put businesspeople as well as dissidents at risk, and the plan has caused widespread unease inside Hong Kong. There have even been rare strikes to support protesters in the street. Taiwan has expressed worries that the law undermines its own sovereignty and has pledged not to use it. That effectively removes Lam\u2019s main justification for passing the legislation, which critics say was always really aimed at satisfying Beijing. In a sign that Chinese authorities may now also be concerned about the growth of public opposition in Hong Kong, China\u2019s ambassador to the UK attempted to distance his government from the law. He said in an interview that the bill had not been introduced at China\u2019s request, although he stopped short of calling on Lam to drop the legislation. \u201c[The] Beijing central government gave no instruction, no order about making [the] amendment,\u201d Liu Xiaoming told the BBC.. \u201cThis amendment was initiated by the Hong Kong government, it was prompted by a murder case in Taiwan.\u201d A group claimed to be organising grassroots support for the extradition law abruptly cancelled plans for a media briefing and march on Sunday, RTHK reported. Safeguard HK claims it has more than 900,000 signatures on a petition backing the law, but said it would no longer organise a march \u201cto avoid possible conflicts\u201d. Critics say the number of signatures on the petition has been artificially boosted. Not all support for the legislation has evaporated. Regina Ip, a hardline politician and former security bureau chief, was among those insisting the government should press ahead. Opposition protesters said it was far too early to claim victory. \u201cI\u2019m not sure [Chan and Tien] are concerned about the public demonstrations,\u201d said a student who asked to be named only as Mandy. \u201cThey are just worried about their own interests and now they think those may be under threat.\u201d Hundreds of people joined a \u201cmothers against extradition\u201d demonstration near the city centre on Friday, a show of commitment as some of the bill\u2019s backers waver. \u201cWe still have hope,\u201d Mandy said of efforts to halt the bill. \u201cIf we keep faith, it may still happen.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
