The British Biochemical Society (BBS) is pleased to announce that it is accepting \u00a3113,000 from the Monsanto Foundation - the philanthropic arm of the giant American GM company - to \"provide new resources in support of secondary school science\". The cash will go to the SciberBrain website (SciberBrain.org), from which teachers are invited to download genetics master classes for their budding boffins. The BBS is quite confident that the information will be balanced, and that it will tackle \"some of the key ethical issues in the UK science curriculum for 12- to 16-year-olds\". Sadly, Eco Soundings cannot assess its content yet because the promised site is still being updated. Watch this space."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
