The sacked Real Madrid coach informed United of his decision last night and hopes to fly to Manchester this week to finalise a two-year contract. Two weeks after being sacked as coach at the Bernab\u00e9u, Queiroz will take the place of Walter Smith on the backroom staff. Smith's contract expired on Monday, the Scot having worked alongside Ferguson during a difficult three months that saw them eliminated from the Champions League and surrender the title to Arsenal, although they did remove the Gunners from the FA Cup and go on to win it. Ferguson had been monitoring Queiroz's position for weeks, since it became apparent that the former Portugal and South Africa coach would be sacked by Real at the end of their hugely disappointing season. As well as finishing only fourth in the league, meaning that, like United, they will have to play in next season's Champions League qualifiers, Real set an undistinguished club record in losing five successive league matches. Queiroz's recruitment from Old Trafford a year ago was subsequently described as a \"mistake\" by the Spanish club's president Florentino P\u00e9rez. Ferguson, however, has never lost faith in the Portuguese, who has also been linked strongly with a move to Tottenham. In an impassioned defence of his former assistant recently, Ferguson even argued that Queiroz should be absolved of the majority of blame for Real's poor season. Ferguson, presently on holiday will link up again with Queiroz for United's pre-season tour of the United States. The Paris St-Germain coach Vahid Halilhodzic has underlined the club's determination to maximise their profits from the sale of the Argentinian defender Gabriel Heinze, who is wanted by United. Taking his cue from comments by the club president Francis Graille on Monday, Halilhodzic said: \"We are now waiting for Manchester to make a bid. We are determined to sell Heinze as expensively as possible because he had a big season, probably his best season. He is also well paid at PSG and he has got a very big potential. Why should we sell at a low price? \"On the pitch Heinze is a fighter, he is a winner, but in life he is rebellious. It was not easy every day with him but I am the coach and I don't have to justify my choices. There is no problem; I know how to do the job.\" Inverness Caledonian Thistle are to appeal after failing yesterday in their attempt to join the Scottish PremierLeague, falling just short of the votes needed to gain promotion. The First Division champions required eight votes from the 12 top-flight clubs but received seven. Their bitter disappointment meant joy for Partick Thistle, who clung on to their SPL status. It is a painful experience for the Highland club after agreeing with Aberdeen to share their Pittodrie ground next season to meet top-flight criteria."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
