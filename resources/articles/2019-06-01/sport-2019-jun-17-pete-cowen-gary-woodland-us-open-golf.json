The Yorkshireman took over full-time coaching duties for Gary Woodland at the end of last year. Brooks Koepka, who ultimately failed to catch Woodland at Pebble Beach, has been a long-term Cowen pupil. \u201cI did the warm-up with Gary and he said that he had never felt more at ease with his swing,\u201d Cowen said. \u201cThat\u2019s my job done then. Off to the airport. It\u2019s like a racehorse trainer. You do your work on the gallops, then you can\u2019t do anything when they\u2019re racing.\u201d Woodland understandably credits Cowen as a key influence on the ending of his major drought at the age of 35. \u201cPete\u2019s been amazing for me,\u201d the new US Open champion said. \u201cHe\u2019s not really a teacher; he\u2019s a coach. He tells you: \u2018This is the gameplan. This is what we\u2019re going to do.\u2019 And then it\u2019s up to me to go out and do it. \u201cHe sent me an unbelievable text on Sunday morning that had nothing to do with my golf swing or technique. He said: \u2018Every man dies but not every man lives, and you live for this moment.\u2019 He knows what to say and when to say it. We\u2019ve been working on the full swing only since December and I\u2019m hitting it as good as I ever have.\u201d Cowen\u2019s approach to Woodland is fascinating. In the early stages of their alliance \u2013 Woodland had previously been under the tutelage of the now retired Butch Harmon \u2013 Cowen became irked by regular cries for help from the Kansas City native. Woodland\u2019s background in college basketball, it seemed, was a professional hindrance. \u201cI did tell Gary that I didn\u2019t want him ringing me and texting all the time for answers,\u201d Cowen said. \u201cI told him that he has to take responsibility for his swing and really get to understand it because, if he needed to fix it during a round, then he has to do it on his own. \u201cAll great players can do that, realise what is wrong and be able to make the fix. That has been the biggest thing with me and Gary, making him understand his swing and, as soon as you do understand that, it also relieves the pressure. \u201cGary was into team sports when he was young and was always into that environment of being told what to do. He was still stuck in that mindset, couldn\u2019t work it out for himself. Golf is an individual sport. He was lost when things started to go wrong. There was no coach on the sidelines, bellowing at him what to do. He is 35 now and the penny has dropped.\u201d Woodland\u2019s three-shot triumph in California meant Koepka could not secure his third US Open title in a row. Still, he has become the third player since the Masters was played \u2013 along with Ben Hogan and Tiger Woods \u2013 to finish second or better in four successive majors. \u201cThis will motivate Brooks even more, getting so close to history like that,\u201d Cowen said. Cowen can lay claim to one of the most continuously successful coaching careers in Britain, which for some time has covered both sides of the Atlantic. Earlier he focused mainly on the European Tour as Lee Westwood, Darren Clarke, Graeme McDowell and Henrik Stenson started to make their name. \u201cThey started playing more and more in America and I got exposed to the American players and they got exposed to me,\u201d Cowen said. \u201cThey like hearing it in simple terms. \u201cI was going to retire a while ago but I can\u2019t retire now with this chapter going on, can I? I was looking down the leaderboard thinking, \u2018I coach him, him, him and I\u2019ve worked with him, him, him in the past.\u2019 In the top 15 I think I\u2019ve worked at one stage or the other with about 12 of them and nine of the top 11. \u201cI don\u2019t really care about the recognition thing. It\u2019s about the players, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s brilliant helping someone like Gary reach his ambitions. \u201cThe US Open is like the Open to us. Pebble is a good place for me; my first major was with Graeme in 2010 there and now my most recent major is at Pebble. It\u2019s been a hell of a decade.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
