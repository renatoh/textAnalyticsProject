Most experts seem to think the Bank of England's decision on Thursday to raise interest rates to a five-year high of 5% will help to cool the housing market. However, the property market has a habit of not doing what people expect it to. Upmarket estate agent Savills is in the camp that believes this week's increase will not have much impact on the property market (some won't be at all surprised that an estate agent would take that stance). \"We think interest rates would have to rise to around 6.5% before house price growth would start to slow,\" says Yolanda Barnes, director of research at the firm. It examined the disposable income remaining after housing costs (including mortgage repayments) and basic spending, and found that the surplus available for luxury spending, and additional spending on housing - what it dubs the comfort cushion - \"is still high\". Savills predicts that UK house price growth will average 7% per annum over the next few years. There was a very different view from new homes website SmartNewHomes.com, which branded the 0.25% rate hike \"a dangerous decision\" that could prove extremely detrimental to the market. It says the increase \"will see even more first-time buyers priced out of the market\". By contrast, first time buyers' advice website FirstRungNow.com reckons the increase should impede house price growth, allowing aspiring first-time buyers a greater chance to buy a home. Halifax reported on Thursday that house prices jumped 1.7% in October - lifting the annual rate of growth to 8.6%. But it reckons that price inflation \"may slow in the coming months\". Nationwide building society will in the coming weeks issue its predictions for house price growth next year. However, bear in mind that in recent years the experts' predictions about where the housing market is going have tended to be too cautious. In August, Nationwide raised its house price growth forecast for this year to 5% from its previous prediction of 0%-3%. Even that new 5% forecast is now looking conservative; a few days ago Nationwide said the annual rate of price growth was now running at 8%. \"Mortgage repayments will be rising in December and we are expecting a cooling of the market in January,\" says Fionnuala Earley, its group economist. Some might be surprised to see that the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors - which includes many estate agents - welcomed the rate rise, which it says will help to cool the housing market and at the same time promote wider economic stability. \"Today's interest rate rise, together with possibly one more in early 2007, should help to produce a 'soft landing' for the housing market, giving rise to a more stable market environment for buyers,\" it adds. The Council of Mortgage Lenders, representing the banks and building societies, says the rate rise \"might mark the start of a cooling down in the housing market as we approach the new year\". It adds that a modest increase in mortgage costs \"will help to maintain a sustainable environment\". r.jones@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
