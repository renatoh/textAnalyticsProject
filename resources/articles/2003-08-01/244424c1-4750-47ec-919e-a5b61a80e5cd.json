Explains How It Caught 'Blaster' Author\", except it hasn't. It has caught an 18-year-old kid who created a variant that renamed the executable to teekids.exe ... and hosted the t33kid.com site on his own PC. In other words, a completely clueless 18-year-old kid. USA Today has a mug-shot and a much more interesting piece on the \"6-foot-4, 320-pound\" high school student who \"had no other hobbies besides computers, and idolized Bill Gates,\" according to a friend of the family. (This is presumably why he added anti-Gates and anti-Microsoft profanities to his Blaster variant.)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
