First they say the banks will be closed on Monday, now for the whole week.\u201d Pouleminou, who works in the finance department of a shipping company, said she had tried the local branch of her bank, Alpha, but \u201cthey had nothing left. Empty. So I\u2019m here. I\u2019m taking out the limit \u2013 600 euros, it is here. But they say after midnight it will be 60 euros. That\u2019s why there\u2019s a queue\u201d. While Greece\u2019s government announced on Sunday night that the country\u2019s banks would not open on Monday, that capital controls would be introduced and limits set on withdrawals, there was no official confirmation yet of what those limits would be. But there were at least 70 people queuing outside this one branch, and most National Bank branches on the way back into town had similar lines. As their debt-laden, all-but-insolvent country \u2013 and the eurozone \u2013 entered uncharted territory last night, it seemed plenty of Greeks were taking no chances. \u201cI\u2019m not taking out all I have,\u201d said Stathis, 58, who described himself as a private sector employee. \u201cBut the government has just said the banks will stay shut for a week, so I\u2019m here to take out what I need for that \u2013 maybe a couple of hundred euros.\u201d He was quite clear about who he though was responsible. \u201cWe should never even have tried to negotiate,\u201d he said. \u201cWhatever the government did, I think we would probably have ended up exactly where we are right now. This whole thing has been planned, from the start, by the Germans.\u201d Yannis, a postgraduate finance student, was more phlegmatic. \u201cI just want to withdraw what I can now,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s far from clear to me when we will be able to take money out again. I\u2019m aiming for 300 euros \u2013 enough for at least a week, I hope.\u201d But he said he had no idea what would happen after that. \u201c[Prime minister Alexis] Tsipras says he\u2019ll be able to go back to Brussels in a better position after this referendum, and reopen negotiations with the institutions from a position of strength,\u201d he said. \u201cBut nobody knows if that will be the case. Nobody knows anything, in fact.\u201d Anna, 63, a pensioner, wanted to make clear she was not standing in a bank queue just before midnight because she had panicked. \u201cLook,\u201d she said. \u201cI had no cash, and I obviously need some. My pension has just been paid, and I\u2019m here with my neighbout to take some of it out. Not all of it \u2013 just some. That\u2019s all. I\u2019m not scared, not in the least. We\u2019ve seen worse, here. We will come through this.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
