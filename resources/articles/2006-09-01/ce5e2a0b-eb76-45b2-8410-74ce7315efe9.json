It's not an entirely new idea: Rob Ellis and Piotr Kurek have made nice pieces this way, and Karlheinz Stockhausen sells boxes for about \u20ac300 a throw. Schott conjures up a wealth of associations, from Indonesian gamelans to Steve Reich, with tracks such as tuneful remixes of Ligeti's Po\u00e8me Symphonique (for 100 metronomes). A Bear is Trapped is like a beginners' class for mbiras; Will You Gamelan For Me and Happiness Nuggets are like prepared piano sonatas; The Sad Panther employs backwards recording to make a gothic soundscape. Occasionally, it's possible to spot the tune. Charles's Birthday Card recalls a lullaby in the uneasy way a Hans Bellmer assemblage might remind you of a toyshop. This is a remarkable project, but Colleen's compositional personality isn't quite strong enough to balance out the album's conceptual single-mindedness: at 38 minutes, this is too much box and not enough music."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
