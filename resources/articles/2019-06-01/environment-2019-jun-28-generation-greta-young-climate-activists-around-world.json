Young people have protested en masse before \u2013 millions marched against the Iraq war in 2003 \u2013 but this child-led uprising is happening with unprecedented momentum on a global scale. The urgency of their protests reflects the very narrow window of opportunity left to make positive change. We are already living outside the climate parameters that first gave rise to humans, and the world\u2019s leading climate scientists agree that we have only 12 years to limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5\u00b0C. Still, most governments are not doing enough to stay within these limits as set out by the United Nation\u2019s 2015 Paris agreement. The complexities of the climate crisis have become highly politicised, but young people are able to cut through the noise. As Jamie Clarke, executive director of Climate Outreach, explains: \u201cClimate change is the most politically divisive issue in America, more so than gun control and abortion. But young people have the social freedom to say it like it is.\u201d UK Youth Climate Coalition\u2019s Jake Woodier believes that climate strikes are reconfiguring the political sphere. \u201cChildren who historically don\u2019t have a voice in politics are really thrusting their opinions into the public domain,\u201d he says. \u201cWe are seeing thousands of incredibly intelligent and articulate children who are grasping the severity of the climate crisis better than adults in power.\u201d Here, seven young people who are doing just that, explain where their passion comes from. \u2018It\u2019s frustrating that we have Trump, a climate denier, heading our government\u2019 Dylan D\u2019Haeze, 16, Washington state, US This autumn, Dylan releases the fourth environmental documentary in his award-winning series, Kids Can Save The Planet. \u201cFilm-making empowers me because I can visually show problems and solutions in a way that is much easier to comprehend,\u201d says Dylan, who directs, narrates and films his documentaries. With the next US election just 17 months away, his latest film, about voting and civic engagement, is a timely call to action for a new generation. \u201cIf you elect people the world really needs into office, then the world will change.\u201d According to Dylan, the main hurdle is trying to convince the government and big corporations that climate change is a serious problem. \u201cMost of them just want to make quick bucks instead of thinking what the world is going to look like for the next generation,\u201d he says. What does he think of Trump? \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that we have a climate denier heading our government \u2013 that is two steps backwards from where we need to be right now.\u201d It was ocean pollution that first struck him when he travelled through California three years ago: \u201cThe plastic debris we saw on beaches really scared me, and my mum suggested that instead of being afraid, I could do something about it,\u201d says Dylan, who is home-schooled by his parents, Dawn and Kevin, both film-makers. \u201cAt first I felt helpless, but then I started discovering solutions that were actually really simple, like carrying bamboo cutlery and taking beeswax wrap to the deli to avoid clingfilm,\u201d he says. Dylan and Dawn are now planning the ultimate home-schooling road trip in the run-up to the 2020 election. For six months, they will drive an electric car from their home on Orcas Island off the west coast, across America to Washington DC, filming as they go. High-profile mentors, including actor and environmentalist Ed Begley Jr, musician Moby and Cowspiracy\u2019s Kip Andersen will join Dylan along the way. He will interview leaders spearheading green initiatives, youth activists from the nationwide Sunrise Movement and pioneers developing renewable energy. As he travels, he will present his latest film in high schools and colleges, and speak in city halls and state capitals, asking people to make, on camera, a commitment to positive change. \u201cIt will be really powerful,\u201d Dawn says. \u201cYoung people have to be engaged \u2013 there\u2019s no other option.\u201d kidscansavetheplanet.com \u2018Our weather is not normal. Mudslides are washing away our homes\u2019 Yola Mgogwana, 11, Cape Town, South Africa \u201cI see the effects of climate change every single day,\u201d says Yola, from her home in Khayelitsha, one of Cape Town\u2019s impoverished townships. \u201cOur weather is not normal \u2013 one day it is hot, the next day it\u2019s raining heavily. It\u2019s a huge problem for farmers, and mudslides wash away houses, leaving poor families without homes.\u201d Eighteen months ago, Cape Town experienced its most severe drought in a century. Residents\u2019 water consumption was limited to 50 litres a day and the city was just weeks away from \u201cday zero\u201d, when taps would run dry. \u201cFor me, that was a big sign that we need to change our ways and stand up for nature \u2013 because our government wants to profit from the environment, instead of implementing policies that protect it,\u201d she says. In January, Yola began volunteering with the Earthchild Project, which integrates environmental education into classrooms and communities. \u201cOur mission is to monitor our school\u2019s food, water and electricity usage, and encourage other learners to reduce their consumption.\u201d The school\u2019s organic vegetable garden helps feed pupils, and a worm farm transforms food waste into compost, so the children learn how to conserve resources. \u201cEvery school should make environmental education part of their curriculum. Climate change is a foreign topic to my family \u2013 without this club I would be in the dark,\u201d says Yola, who takes inspiration from the Zulu word \u201cubuntu\u201d, meaning \u201cI am, because you are.\u201d In March, Yola spoke in front of 2,000 young people in Cape Town, and she presents talks at neighbouring schools. \u201cI want to show the world that we, as black youth from Cape Town\u2019s under-resourced communities and townships, do care about the climate \u2013 because we are the ones that get affected the most.\u201d Her plea to the South African government is to take urgent action. \u201cWe will not accept a life of fear and devastation. The crisis is now. People are dying.\u201d earthchildproject.org \u2018Michael Gove seemed interested, but politicians have so many things on their plate\u2019 Amy, 15, and Ella Meek, 13, Nottinghamshire, UK Sisters Amy and Ella are on a mission to encourage people, businesses and schools to adopt a \u201cplastic clever\u201d approach to reducing single-use plastics. Three years ago, they learned about the UN\u2019s 17 Global Goals for Sustainable Development while being home-schooled. Shocked by the impact that plastic pollution has on marine wildlife, they decided to do something about it. They founded their child-led campaign, Kids Against Plastic, and in April 2018 they presented their first TEDx talk. \u201cKids can have a really powerful voice when they find something they are passionate about \u2013 but the key is to be educated about it in the first place,\u201d argues Amy, who wishes the school curriculum focused more on environmental issues. Plastic pollution is tangible and ubiquitous, but it\u2019s only the tip of the iceberg. The girls explain that to make every one-litre single-use plastic bottle of water, one-sixth of its capacity of oil is used. \u201cThe wasteful production of single-use plastics is so interconnected with the consumption of fossil fuels and global warming, and learning about these problems really opened our eyes,\u201d Amy says. \u201cA youth movement in Bali called Bye Bye Plastic Bags, set up by two girls our age, really captured our imagination back in 2016,\u201d recalls Ella, who now reports on environmental issues for FYI, a weekly news programme on Sky Kids. \u201cI always wanted to be an environmental TV presenter, so it\u2019s great to think others might be inspired by the features they watch on the show.\u201d As two of 250 British #iwill ambassadors for youth social action, the sisters recently met the environment secretary, Michael Gove: \u201cHe seemed interested in what kids like us are doing, but politicians always have so many things on their plates, so it can be hard to get them involved,\u201d Amy says. \u201cWe are lucky that our MP, Vernon Coaker, and Gedling borough council have helped us to push change in our local area by installing water fountains and insisting that all vendors at council events adhere to the plastic clever policy (for instance, by using a returnable cup deposit scheme). Often, councillors and politicians are surprised to hear two schoolgirls stand up and talk to them \u2013 young voices get their attention and that has a powerful impact.\u201d Last December, the education secretary, Damian Hinds, urged schools to become single-use plastic-free by 2022, something the Meek sisters are excited about. But they still have concerns over the government\u2019s 25-year environment plan. \u201cWe worry that there\u2019s no sense of urgency. By 2042, we\u2019ll be middle-aged \u2013 it\u2019s frustrating and scary,\u201d kidsagainstplastic.co.uk \u2018Living near the bush, there\u2019s a real risk of our houses burning down. It\u2019s scary\u2019 Harriet O\u2019Shea Carre and Milou Albrecht, both 14, Castlemaine, Victoria, Australia Bush fires are Milou and Harriet\u2019s biggest worry. The teenagers experienced 46C (115F) days last summer, and January 2019 was the hottest month recorded in Australia, according to the Bureau of Meteorology. \u201cThe fire danger is really high. There\u2019s a real risk of our houses burning down because we live right near the bush. It could be deadly. It\u2019s really scary,\u201d Harriet says. \u201cAll we want is a safe climate; we don\u2019t want money or power, and we haven\u2019t got any ulterior motive. We simply want our futures. How can you tell someone that they don\u2019t have the right to live on and appreciate this planet, and be safe?\u201d Milou and Harriet started the Australian school climate strike in November 2018, together with their friend Callum Bridgefoot, 11. \u201cSeeing Greta Thunberg leading school strikes in Sweden was really powerful \u2013 that\u2019s what inspired us. Twenty of us started striking for climate action outside our MP\u2019s office and it quickly escalated,\u201d Milou explains. Weekly strikes now take place in more than 65 towns and cities across Australia, involving tens of thousands of young people, demanding 100% renewable energy by 2030 and no new coal, oil or gas projects. In February, seven other young activists joined Harriet and Milou in Canberra to present their demands to Bill Shorten MP, then leader of the opposition Labor party. \u201cMeeting us face-to-face was a clear sign he is taking us seriously,\u201d Harriet says. \u201cBut we haven\u2019t had an adequate response \u2013 we want to see a real plan for change in policy.\u201d \u201cAll the scientists agree that we\u2019re right about climate change, so it\u2019s difficult for people to find fault in what we are doing,\u201d Milou says. In response to trolling comments on social media telling them to stay in school, Harriet and Milou insist that striking at the weekend would lack impact. \u201cThe people leading our country don\u2019t want to listen to us \u2013 they want to shut us down,\u201d Harriet says. \u201cWe can use our civil disobedience to capture the government\u2019s attention. If they want us back in school, politicians need to start acting.\u201d Milou says their families are behind them: \u201cThey are supportive of what we do because they love us \u2013 they would rather have us alive and uneducated than dead and educated.\u201d schoolstrike4climate.com \u2018If you are 2C above normal, you feel very ill. So imagine how the planet will feel\u2019 Lilly Platt, 11, Zeist, the Netherlands As Lilly walks to and from school, she litter-picks, often collecting up to 400 pieces of rubbish. She started four years ago, shortly after she and her family moved to the Netherlands from London. She was learning to count in Dutch with her grandfather and as they walked, they counted 91 pieces of litter within just 15 minutes. \u201cMy grandpa told me how plastic on the ground eventually makes its way to the ocean,\u201d she says, \u201cso I decided I had to do something about it. We picked it all up and took a photo to post on social media.\u201d After that first pick-up, Lilly started researching plastic pollution and was horrified to read about the oceans\u2019 \u201cmicroplastic soup\u201d. \u201cPlastic pollution just shows that we consume too much,\u201d Lilly says. \u201cWe all need to feel responsible. Think about how much CO2 we have produced since the Industrial Revolution. Just think how many animals have been killed for needless reasons and how many trees have been chopped down for nothing but greed.\u201d She believes that all schools need to educate students about the climate crisis, and that politicians need to pay attention to scientists and strikers. She has been striking outside the town hall in Zeist since September 2018. \u201cListen, think and open your eyes and see what you have been doing to the world,\u201d she says. \u201cWhat happens to your body if you are 2C above your normal temperature? You feel very ill, so imagine how the planet will feel. We want world leaders, including Trump, to stay aligned with the Paris agreement, reduce carbon emissions and keep within 1.5C of global warming. Polluters must pay.\u201d Follow @LillysPlasticPickup on Facebook.
