The character who was famous for \"beaming up\" his colleagues onto the Starship Enterprise was a Scottish engineer. No one disputes that fact about him, but the question of where exactly he was born is far more contentious. Two weeks after the death of the actor who played Scotty in the cult TV series, James Doohan, four Scottish places are lining up to commemorate the character he made famous. Aberdeen, Linlithgow, Elgin and Edinburgh have all claimed Scotty was \"born\" in their town, with each having its own reasons. Linlithgow, West Lothian was the first to stake a claim, saying one of the script writers DC Fontana clearly stated Scotty was born there. The deputy council leader, Willie Dunn, said the town was considering a museum in the town centre. Mr Dunn admitted though that Scotty did move to Aberdeen later in his life and the granite city has quickly claimed its place in Star Trek history. The local Star Trek fan club said he was born in the city's Constitution Street. Pam MacDonald, who is Aberdeen council's education and leisure committee convenor, said: \"He (James Doohan) was said to have modelled his accent on an Aberdeen one. \"We would not have a normal statue, but it might be a kids corner tourist attraction with Disneyland-style figures,\" she said. Elgin in Morayshire's case is based on an interview Mr Doohan gave in the 1970s, in which he said Scotty came from \"Elgin near Aberdeen\". Councillor Alastair Bisset told The Scotsman newspaper a plaque in the town was being considered. Finally, Edinburgh can also put forward an argument for a strong Scotty connection. The website Scifi.com has listed Scotty's birthplace as \"Edinburgh, Earth\". Lesley Hinds, the city's lord provost, told The Scotsman: \"All the best people come from Edinburgh.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
