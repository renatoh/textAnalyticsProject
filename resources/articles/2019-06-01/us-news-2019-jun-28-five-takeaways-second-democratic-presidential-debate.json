Here are the five big takeaways: 1. Joe Biden takes incoming fire It was the big question: how would the former vice-president and current comfortable frontrunner fare once he finally got in front of the cameras flanked by rivals, some decades his junior? Until Thursday night, Biden had kept public exposure to a minimum. But there was nowhere to hide under those brutal TV lights, and at the end of two hours Biden came off stage looking decidedly more worn than when he entered it. He began sure-footedly. His opening words were \u201cDonald Trump\u201d \u2013 a pointed reminder that Biden\u2019s main claim to the nomination is his conviction that he is the candidate to unseat the US president. \u201cDonald Trump thinks Wall Street built America. Ordinary working-people Americans built America,\u201d he said. But then it started slipping. That carefully arranged mannequin of dependable Joe, the politician who gets the job done, the friend and deputy to Obama, started sliding. Biden came across as diffident, tentatively raising a finger when he wanted to speak \u2013 a manner that had even the NBC News hosts baffled. He spoke most passionately about what he had done in the past, rather than what he dreamed of doing in the future. Asked to state the one big reform he would push in his first term as president, he replied: \u201cThe first thing I would do is defeat Donald Trump.\u201d An older guy who doesn\u2019t get the question, let alone answer it. At worst, Biden started to look the one thing that he must avoid to retain his frontrunner status: like a man watching the world spin beyond his control. 2. Kamala Harris seizes the day If Biden looked rattled, he had Kamala Harris to thank. From the start of the debate , she had the feel of a politician who had fire in her belly and wind in her sails. It\u2019s been a while coming. Harris has struggled to articulate her vision, and has been criticized for her record as California\u2019s former top prosecutor. But on Thursday she turned that around, transforming her law enforcement credentials from a vulnerability into a weapon. \u201cAmerica does not want to witness a food fight; it wants to know how to put food on the table,\u201d she admonished the other nine candidates on stage like naughty children as they squabbled. Then came the one-liner that will probably go down in the annals alongside \u201cSenator, you\u2019re no Jack Kennedy\u201d. Harris already had Biden against the ropes over his recent statements about the \u201ccivility\u201d of having worked productively in the US Senate with notorious racial segregationists. They got things done together, Biden had argued, including in opposing federal bussing of children to desegregate schools. \u201cI do not believe you are a racist,\u201d Harris opened while addressing the former vice-president. You knew from the chill that crossed Biden\u2019s face that history was in the making. \u201cIt\u2019s personal, it was hurtful, to hear you talk about the reputations of two US senators who built their careers on segregation,\u201d she continued. Biden stiffened. And then the killer lines: \u201cThere was a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate their public school and she was bussed to school every day. That little girl was me.\u201d We\u2019ll have to wait to learn whether the exchange was the beginning of the end for Joe Biden\u2019s presidential hopes. But we already know that this is the beginning of the beginning for Kamala Harris. 3. The great generational divide There are exactly 40 years separating the youngest candidate on stage \u2013 Pete Buttigieg, 37, and Bernie Sanders, 77. And it showed. Much as they tried to project their experience and strength, Biden and Sanders found it difficult to hold the line. Eric Swalwell, a congressman from California, 38, broke the taboo subject by announcing it was time to \u201cpass the torch\u201d. \u201cI\u2019m still holding on to that torch\u201d, Biden replied. Buttigieg alluded to the generational issue more subtly \u2013 as Buttigieg tends to do, asking viewers to \u201chelp me deliver that new generation to Washington before it\u2019s too late\u201d. 4. A good night for \u2026 Kamala Harris, obviously. Pete Buttigieg. The mayor of South Bend, Indiana was challenged over his handling of the recent fatal shooting in his town of a black man by a white policeman who had his body camera turned off. He weathered the storm. Buttigieg admitted that South Bend\u2019s police force remains disproportionally white \u201cbecause I couldn\u2019t get it done\u201d. He added: \u201cI am determined to bring about a day when a white person and a black person driving a vehicle feels the exact same thing when they see a policeman \u2013 a feeling of safety not fear.\u201d Gun violence as a debating issue. Swalwell said he would ban and then buy back every assault weapon in America; Buttigieg, leaning on his status as the only war veteran on stage, said that guns were \u201ctearing us apart\u201d; Harris promised to take executive action to ban the importation of assault rifles. 5. A bad night for \u2026 Joe Biden, obviously. Bernie Sanders, who looked as though he were stuck in the same old groove. And the also-rans. There have been plenty of moments over these past two nights when nobody seemed to be able to remember why certain individuals were even on stage. Were they gatecrashers? That thought came forcefully on Thursday night with the two jokers in the pack \u2013 Andrew Yang, a former tech entrepreneur, and Marianne Williamson, a bestselling author of self-help healing books (typical title: 21 Spiritual Lessons for Surrendering Your Weight Forever). What was Williamson doing talking about love being the way to defeat Trump?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
