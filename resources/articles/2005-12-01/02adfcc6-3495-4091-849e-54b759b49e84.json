Chris Mullin, a former minister for Africa, told the Guardian that as a result Britain is morally obliged to help them. Bisher al-Rawi, an Iraqi who had lived in Britain for nearly 20 years, and his friend, Jamil el-Banna, were seized in Gambia in 2002 while on a business trip. The British government should take responsibility for their fate, Mr Mullin said. \"It may not have a legal obligation but it has a moral obligation given that we played a part in putting them into Guant\u00e1namo Bay,\" he said. \"They will rot there until someone pulls their finger out.\" Mr Rawi and Mr Banna were held by British security and intelligence officers for three days before being released, he said. The officers then tipped off the Americans about their whereabouts. The two businessmen have always said that British agents were complicit in their abduction at Banjul, the Gambian capital. Now a former minister responsible for Africa has backed up their claims. Mr Mullin, MP for Sunderland South, was sacked from his post as foreign minister after the general election in May. The Foreign Office has refused to comment on the cases. Mr Rawi, whose family fled from Saddam Hussein's Iraq after his father was arrested, was seized by the CIA in Gambia in November 2002 and secretly flown with Mr Banna to Bagram base in Afghanistan and then to Guant\u00e1namo Bay in Cuba. He has told a US military panel he was recruited by MI5 after September 11, 2001, because he knew Abu Qatada, a Palestinian refugee described by the security services as al-Qaida's spiritual ambassador in Europe and awaiting deportation to Jordan where he is wanted over alleged terrorist offences. Mr Banna, who also knew Qatada, is a Jordanian-Palestinian national who was granted refugee status in Britain 10 years ago and has five children, all British citizens. He is now acutely ill. The two men say they were flying to Gambia to help set up a peanut processing plant. They are among five British residents held at the US camp in Cuba who the government says it cannot help because they are not British citizens. Mr Mullin is a founder of the all-party parliamentary group on \"extraordinary renditions\" - the term describing the illegal and secret transfer of suspects to interrogation camps. Andrew Tyrie, Conservative MP for Chichester and chairman of the group, said last week he expected that the parliamentary intelligence and security committee - which takes evidence in secret - will question MI5 and MI6 officers about British involvement in the CIA flights."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
