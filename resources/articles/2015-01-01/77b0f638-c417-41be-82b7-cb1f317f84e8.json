January boasts a wealth of sayings, proverbs and rhymes, which were coined to help our ancestors work out what kind of weather was likely to occur during the coming 12 months. Many relied on the time-honoured belief that whatever the weather is like now, in the next season it will be the opposite. Thus a good number of proverbs suggest that warm or fine weather at the beginning of the year is bad news, especially for the coming harvest. For example: \u201cIf grain grows in January, it will be a year of great need\u201d, \u201cJanuary flowers do not swell the granary\u201d, or the deeply pessimistic \u201cJanuary warm, the Lord have mercy!\u201d A lack of snow in January is also bad news: as it is then likely that there will be a freeze-up in March or April. But the most intriguing belief is that \u201ca green January makes a full churchyard\u201d. This is based on the perfectly reasonable notion that cold weather kills germs, while mild winters allow them to spread. In the days before antibiotics, even a common cold could turn into a more serious, even fatal infection. So we should perhaps hope for typical winter weather. In the words of one wise but anonymous French forecaster: \u201cA cold January, a feverish February, a dusty March, a weeping April and a windy May, presage a good year\u201d. @stephenmoss_tv"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
