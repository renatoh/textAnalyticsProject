How old should a sibling be before you leave them to care for a younger brother or sister on their own for an hour or so? When our children were 11 and eight I left them in the garden while I drove to the station, 10 minutes away, to meet my husband. On returning home we were greeted by our daughter with, \"I've stopped the bleeding and treated for shock and he's lying on your bed.\" I'm not sure whether the moral of this is don't leave them or leave them, but make sure they are keen Guides or Scouts. (In case you are wondering, the eight-year-old had fallen into a recently pruned rose bush covered in enormous thorns.) AC, by email Well, I'm 11 and I think I would be ready to look after my three-year-old brother for an hour or so on my own. So do my parents; but they also say that it's illegal to do so until I'm 13 so, of course, it's never happened! NW, by email Please, please, please, NEVER leave one child in charge of another. As the eldest of three, I was expected to look after my brother and sister while Mum and Dad worked or partied. I hated every moment. Both bro and sis played me up, threatened to tell our parents if I was angry, and used emotional blackmail in order to do as they pleased. Even now I resent \"looking after\" them (I'm 46). With my three, I asked them to care for each other if I was ever not at home. No one in charge, everyone to take responsibility for their own behaviour, and no worries of punishment if \"rules\" were broken. Carol, by email Surely it would depend on the age of the babysat? My 12-year-old nephew can be left for an hour with his 10-year-old sister if there is an adult he can call on (ie can get to him in 10 minutes or so) if things go wrong. He is, however, too young to look after my one-year-old in the same situation. LP, on the talkboard I babysat the whole summer holidays after my GCSEs when I was 16 for a two-year-old and a four-month-old. All day, 8am to 6pm. I was fine. The weird thing is, I seemed to instinctively know what to do then more than I did with my own son. The two-year-old was a handful and quite jealous of the baby. He also, rather disconcertingly, took to calling me a \"bloody cow\" when I disallowed certain things. TI, on the talkboard I'm 34 and I panic when left alone with my two-year-old niece. It's more about the person than the actual ages, within reason. MD, on the talkboard It's entirely different with siblings. Sometimes a kid will take an order from a stranger that they won't from an older brother or sister. VW, on the talkboard My best friend from school is 15 years older than her only sibling and babysat her from birth so frequently that a number of people actually thought the baby was hers. HG, on the talkboard I am fairly sure there is a law about this, isn't there? I think it says that kids have to be 14 before they can be left in their own care, and 18 before they can act as carers. DB, on the talkboard According to the CAB: There are no legal restrictions on the age of a babysitter, or the child being cared for. However, the parents of the child being cared for are responsible for it, and if it's harmed while in the care of a babysitter under 16, they would have to have a good reason for leaving their child with the babysitter. Over 16 a babysitter can be charged if they harm or neglect a child they are babysitting. TG, on the talkboard Our kids (10 and seven) have been left to their own devices at home for up to three hours and seem to manage OK. They seem less inclined to fight if we are not around, lacking an audience, I suppose. They are now permitted to go out to the park by themselves, and usually return more or less intact. Little buggers brought a kitten back with them the last time, which we have been compelled to adopt! MK, on the talkboard The NSPCC has a page on leaving children on their own on its website. No legal age but you have to be sensible and have reasonable protections in place (having the neighbours aware of it, leaving emergency numbers, kid aware of what to do in case of fire or accident, etc). UB, on the talkboard I am always aware when my neighbours leave their kids at home by themselves. Usually because they can be heard quite clearly trying to kill one another through the wall. HG, on the talkboard Any answers? Went to another funeral this week, and it's got me thinking about what I want for myself and what I could cope with in terms of a close loved one's funeral. Anyone got any experience or ideas about non-religious funerals, or ones that weren't people crying silently or mouthing their way through The Lord's My Shepherd?
