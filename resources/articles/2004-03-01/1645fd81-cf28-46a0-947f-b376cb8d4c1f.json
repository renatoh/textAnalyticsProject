It is one of 15 projects in a six-year programme to transforming the fortunes three deprived former tin mining towns: Camborne, Pool, and Redruth. The programme was put forward by CPR Regeneration - a government-backed company charged with coordinating investment in this five-mile urban strip. The company said the programme would create an estimated 2,500 jobs and almost 1,000 new homes as well as office space, better transport and other leisure facilities. Under the plan, indoor surfing will come to Pool in a \u00a325m new leisure complex. Unveiling the plan, CPR Regeneration's chief executive, Tim Williams, said: \"This will be a fantastic place to work and play, where the legacy of Cornwall's industrial past is rejuvenated and serves the needs of the future.\" Under the plan, Redruth will get a new \u00a36m \"signature\" development to help tackle the housing crisis for local people in the county. Camborne's town centre will also get a \u00a33.8m makeover. CPR Regeneration is one of the government's 15 urban regeneration companies set up in the last four years in Britain's most deprived areas. Barry Manning, the chief executive of Kerrier district council, said: \"Camborne, Pool and Redruth has long been recognised as an area needing concentrated support and in CPR Regeneration we now have a champion than can pull sources of funding together and attract new investment.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
