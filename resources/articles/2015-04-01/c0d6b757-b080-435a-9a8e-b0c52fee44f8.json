However, the historic sitcom character, notoriously single but for the cat referred to routinely as \u201cmy pussy\u201d, could easily act as chief witness in Mirren\u2019s accusation that the sexism of the 1970s was \u201cworse than the 1940s or 50s. It was horrible.\u201d Are the 70s guilty as charged? Mirren was passing judgment in an interview in a national newspaper last week. In the 1970s, she was in her 20s and 30s and her extraordinary talent had become obvious; she was seen as a posh hippy bohemian not least because of her tattoo \u2013 then, a sure sign of the subversive counterculture and not the kite mark of the masses as it is now \u2013 when she made an appearance on Michael Parkinson\u2019s television chatshow. He asked how someone in their 20s, so \u201csluttishly erotic\u201d, could be regarded as a serious actress: wouldn\u2019t her \u201cbig bosoms\u201d detract from her performance? Forty years later it might seem like an Alan Partridge parody but then it was far from unusual, and gave Jimmy Savile his cover. \u201cThat decade, after the sexual revolution but before feminism, was perilous for women,\u201d Mirren said last week. \u201cMen saw that as a sort of \u201cOh fantastic! We can fuck anything, however we like, whenever we like. They\u2019re up for grabs, boys!\u201d Mirren is right that the rules of carnal engagement had altered, equality had yet to catch up and decades of conditioning for men and women clung like giant barnacles on behaviour, hampering real change. The pill had \u201cliberated\u201d women, so men no longer had to pay the price for sex with a shotgun marriage and a lifetime as a breadwinner. The flight from commitment had begun. Yet, at the same time, women who did \u201cgo all the way\u201d were still deemed \u201cbikes\u201d, a cause for alarm. In 1973, Erica Jong wrote the very funny and perceptive Fear of Flying. Married woman Isadora Wing goes to Europe in search of the \u201czipless fuck\u201d \u2013 commitment-free sex. Today, to some, that may seem like the formula for the average good night out. Then, it was revolutionary. Wing is confounded by men who refuse to understand the terms of this new egalitarianism. She says: \u201cIt was the same old jargon\u2026 the same old fifties lingo in disguise. There is no such thing as rape. You ladies ask for it.\u201d Confusion reigned to the point that it was assumed that, in bed, what women wanted must be the flipside of what men desired: how wrong. The clitoral orgasm was revealed. \u201cThink clitoris,\u201d women were instructed, but as they didn\u2019t want to upset their husbands (if they were heterosexual), and females were, and are, inclined to blame themselves, the 70s saw a flood of \u201chow to\u201d manuals. The Joy of Sex et al, arguably unread by those who had most to learn, all became bestsellers. The sexually assertive woman was timidly validated, but she was still in a daze. Jane Firbank was then a twentysomething editor of the monthly sex magazine Forum. She fell into bed because, she said, \u201cI was so overwhelmed that someone wanted me. It never occurred to me to say no.\u201d At the same time, in Ruth Carter Stapleton\u2019s The Gift of Inner Healing, the good wife was one who greeted her husband, home from a hard day\u2019s work, as if he were Jesus. In contrast, in the 1977 hit film Looking for Mr Goodbar, a woman who likes one-night stands meets a grisly death, while the coverage of Peter Sutcliffe\u2019s crimes as the Yorkshire Ripper reinforced the message that women paid a price if they transgressed from traditional \u201cfeminine\u201d behaviour. Mirren is right on the impact of the sexual revolution, but wrong on chronology. The 70s was the decade when feminism took hold \u2013 and perhaps that\u2019s why sexism became still more marked. Ms magazine was launched in the US and Spare Rib in the UK. Germaine Greer\u2019s The Female Eunuch asked of her readers: \u201cThe old process must be broken \u2013 what will you do?\u201d She also said that she didn\u2019t go much on \u201cPom\u201d lovers. One had suggested: \u201cLet\u2019s pretend you\u2019re dead.\u201d It was the decade in which the first women\u2019s strike for equality in the US was held (26 August 1970). \u201cDon\u2019t cook. Starve a rat,\u201d was one slogan. The private had become public. Helen Reddy won a Grammy for the song I Am Woman. And in Britain, legislation was passed to tackle discrimination and enforce equal pay, while refuges to help those fleeing domestic abuse mushroomed, as did rape crisis centres. Paradoxically, at a time of burgeoning female liberation, it was also the reign of Mrs Slocombe, a popup from a naughty 50s postcard with a nasty injection of patronising \u201cknow your place \u201c misogyny. (One that, as Mirren suggests, also saturates the words \u201csassy\u201d and \u201cfeisty\u201d). Mrs Slocombe, played by Mollie Sugden, appeared in the popular BBC sitcom Are You Being Served? It encapsulated the weird whirlpool of changing social attitudes, challenges to male power and female doubts about the value of sexual liberation that failed to deliver independence, freedom from domesticity or a route to female desire. Slocombe, a divorcee with wigs of changing hues, was portrayed as being sex-mad but unthreatening to men because she was over 40, and therefore obviously out of action. Each week, she was ridiculed for her age, appearance, weight and love of her \u201cpussy\u201d. In one scene, Captain Peacock, a retail colleague, beckons her. \u201cI do not respond to a man\u2019s finger,\u201d she says. In the 70s, this sexist nudge, nudge, wink, wink humour was endemic in comedies such as The Benny Hill Show, with its dirty old milkman pursuing very young women who, for some unfathomable reason, would run around suburbia in bikinis. On the Buses featured the shortsighted, less than glamorous Olive, who was the butt of all the \u201cface like a back of a bus\u201d jokes. The Carry On films happily gorged on innuendo and Barbara Windsor\u2019s body parts. It was an era of dim dolly birds and \u201creal\u201d blokes. \u201cSpread your legs, enjoy maximum leg-room in the new Pontiac Star Chief\u201d read one US magazine ad, not uncommon in its tone. It passed as normal until the cumulative impact of legislation, changing social norms and a sense of vigilance was sharpened. Today, that vigilance is further honed by social media in sites such as The Everyday Sexism Project. In the 70s, even while Mirren and many other women put up with misogyny or risked accusations of a sense of humour bypass, lessons were being learned. In Saturday Night Fever (1977), for instance, Tony Manero, the king of the dancefloor and clerk in a paint store, courts his girlfriend Stephanie by trying to rape her in the back seat of a car. Stephanie resists and dumps him. She has a life of her own: female aspiration was overtaking matrimony as a goal. As Barbara Ehrenreich wrote in The Hearts of Men, even in the 70s \u201cboyish in Brooklyn is boorish in more sophisticated boroughs\u201d. The 70s saw machismo in the cinema writ large: Taxi Driver, The Deer Hunter, Rocky, and Blue Collar \u2013 but there was defeat, not defiance in the air. Since then, sexism in Britain has been reduced or driven underground. Men like Parkinson weren\u2019t even aware of the offensiveness of their behaviour; they had lived so long in their own world. Now, some males, like a young Mirren in the 1970s, are objectified, belittled, stereotyped and ogled not for what they do but how they look. Forty years ago, it was demeaning. It still is \u2013 even for Poldark. It\u2019s equality, but not of the sort that counts."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
