The DOC \u2013 Beautiful But Deadly (1989) An intriguing anomaly in Dre\u2019s back catalogue. You could call Beautiful But Deadly a belated attempt to jump on the Def Jam rap-rock bandwagon, but it\u2019s smarter than that. Its distorted guitars are based not on heavy metal, but psychedelic soul: Eddie Hazel\u2019s stellar turn on Funkadelic\u2019s Maggot Brain provides the blueprint. Either way, it rocks. 19. Truth Hurts ft Rakim \u2013 Addictive (remix) (2002) Addictive was a track that turned into a nightmare: an uncleared sample of Indian artist Lata Mangeshkar by original producer DJ Quik led to a $500m lawsuit and an injunction to prevent it being broadcast or performed. Dre\u2019s remix is still fabulous: Indian flutes, sitars and vocals fighting for space with high-drama synth stabs. 18. The Lady of Rage \u2013 Afro Puffs (1994) While the Lady of Rage\u2019s moment in the spotlight was brief, it produced one indisputable classic. Afro Puffs takes Dre\u2019s post-Chronic sound down a dark and sinister alley \u2013 heavy, atonal bass, oddly creepy percussive clatter, high G-funk synths wailing off-key \u2013 while Rage offers a surprisingly woke lyrical stance for a Death Row artist, covering body positivity and Afrocentric beauty. Willow Smith has claimed the lyrics \u201cchanged my life\u201d. 17. TI \u2013 Popped Off (2012) By the time Popped Off slipped out on TI\u2019s mixtape Fuck Da City Up, Dre\u2019s production work was becoming sporadic, his attention presumably consumed by the Beats company that would make him a self-proclaimed billionaire. But Popped Off is a low-key reaffirming of his skill: a huge beat and sample snipped from Kool and the Gang\u2019s Summer Madness turned into an epic fanfare. 16. NWA \u2013 Express Yourself (1988) Dre\u2019s handful of mid-80s productions for the World Class Wreckin Cru showed promise, but NWA\u2019s Straight Outta Compton was something else. Express Yourself\u2019s use of the bouncy Charles Wright original was a masterstroke, both commercially minded and at odds with NWA\u2019s relentlessly grim subject matter: even the relatively benign lyrics here are filled with violence. 15. The Game \u2013 How We Do (2005) There was a marked decline in the quality of MCs Dre worked with in the early 00s: 50 Cent wasn\u2019t anything like as talented as Eminem, and the Game wasn\u2019t anything like as talented as 50 Cent. How We Do\u2019s success rests on Dre\u2019s spare, gripping production: a spindly hook endlessly repeated over old-school 808 beats. 14. 2 Pac \u2013 California Love (1996) In 1996 Dre wisely fled Death Row, a label about to go horrifyingly out of control, but not before producing one final anthem. Like Blackstreet\u2019s No Diggity, which Dre worked on incognito, California Love is powered by a piano riff \u2013 this one sampled from Joe Cocker\u2019s 1972 track Woman to Woman. He also paid homage to funk pioneer Roger Troutman, whose talk box provides the hook. 13. Bilal \u2013 Fast Lane (2001) In the aftermath of Eminem\u2019s vast success, Bilal made for an unlikely Dr Dre collaborator: a \u201cconscious\u201d neo-soul artist, affiliated to Questlove\u2019s Soulquarians collective. But Fast Lane is amazing: the Curtis Mayfield-esque vocal and lush harmonies crashing against a sinister Dre beat, decorated with an eerie, shimmering organ and crawling analogue synth. 12. Dr Dre \u2013 Forgot About Dre (1999) He is effortlessly out-rapped by Eminem \u2013 whose spectacular guest appearance was later lauded by Kendrick Lamar as the best verse on Dre\u2019s album 2001 \u2013 but the producer\u2019s bullish recounting of his achievements is lent weight by how good the music is: the perfect expression of 2001\u2019s chilly, bare post-G-funk sound. 11. 50 Cent \u2013 In Da Club (2003) After the dazzling invention and technical brilliance of Eminem, Dre\u2019s next superstar protege was a backwards step, with tired gangsta cliches exploiting a lurid backstory. That said, 50 Cent sold millions, and at their best his collaborations with Dre have a creepy power. In Da Club is as about as bleak and omnious-sounding a party-starting banger as it is possible to imagine. 10. Dr Dre \u2013 Talking to My Diary (2015) The closing track of Dre\u2019s 2015 album Compton sounded remarkably like Dre bidding farewell to his career as a rapper. If so, it\u2019s a great soundtrack to the end credits: flurries of strings sampled from Fran\u00e7ois de Roubaix\u2019s Dernier Domicile Connu (also the source for, of all things, Robbie Williams\u2019s Supreme) and live horns, including an exquisite jazzy solo. 9. Eve ft Gwen Stefani \u2013 Let Me Blow Ya Mind (2001) Despite Dre\u2019s protestations, Let Me Blow Ya Mind demonstrated how adaptable to pop 2001\u2019s sound was. The beat could have been on that album, Eve\u2019s rap is suitably tough, but Gwen Stefani\u2019s chorus is the perfect sweetener: it became a global smash. 8. Dr Dre \u2013 Lil\u2019 Ghetto Boy (1992) Easily overlooked amid The Chronic\u2019s bigger hits, Lil\u2019 Ghetto Boy is the album\u2019s emotional centre. In place of NWA\u2019s furious screw-you nihilism, it feels equivocal, thoughtful, even troubled by the cycle of street life it depicts, a mood embodied by the mournful Donny Hathaway sample that provides its chorus. 7. Eminem \u2013 My Name Is (1999) It\u2019s de rigueur to point out that the sample on My Name Is was played by Chas and Dave; more important is how brilliantly Dre uses it. In contrast to G-funk\u2019s slickness, it sounds slightly ungainly, jerky and off-kilter; even \u2013 as Dre suggested \u2013 \u201cannoying\u201d: the perfect backdrop for Eminem to introduce his disturbing Slim Shady character. 6. Dr Dre ft Snoop Doggy Dogg \u2013 Deep Cover (1992) Dre\u2019s post-NWA solo debut was a ferocious statement of intent. As a rapper, he\u2019s upstaged by Snoop, but it\u2019s all about the beat, which turns a sample from Sly and the Family Stone\u2019s joyous Sing a Simple Song into something ominous, overlaid with a double bass and off-key horns. Big Pun\u2019s 1998 version of the same rhythm, Twinz, might be even better. 5. NWA \u2013 Real Niggaz Don\u2019t Die (1991) NWA\u2019s 1991 album Efil4zaggin is so unremittingly unpleasant that its actual sound gets overlooked: what price skilful beats next to lyrics as foul as those on One Less Bitch? Nevertheless, the beats are a quantum leap on from Straight Outta Compton, as shown on its opening track: a vast, potent patchwork of samples, including a fabulous hook snatched from white funk-rockers Rare Earth. 4. Snoop Doggy Dogg \u2013 Who Am I? (What\u2019s My Name) (1993) All the singles taken from Doggystyle are brilliant: the first might be the best. An imperious updating of the cluttered sound of P-Funk, Who Am I?\u2019s sound is thick with George Clinton samples, its bassline elastic and supremely funky, its grinding, squealing synths adding a hint of unease. That it ended up on a Money Supermarket advert tells you a lot about Snoop and Dre\u2019s journey from folk devils to beloved institution. 3. Dr Dre \u2013 Still DRE (1999) Dre\u2019s late 90s were rocky: early releases on his label Aftermath were coolly received, rumours abounded regarding his failure to follow up The Chronic. But the album 2001 was a swaggering return. Still DRE sounds supremely confident: there\u2019s virtually nothing to the track beyond one insistent sample and the occasional synth flutter, but it\u2019s utterly addictive. 2. Dr Dre \u2013 Nuthin But a G Thang (1992) The single that introduced the world to G-funk via Dre\u2019s patent blend of 70s soul samples \u2013 in this case Leon Haywood \u2013 and analogue synth tones (the trademark \u201cfunky worm\u201d whine was created on a Moog). Its brilliance, as here, lay in the contrast between the sound\u2019s warm nostalgia for the music of childhood and the harshness of the lyrics it supported. 1. Mary J Blige \u2013 Family Affair (2001) The video for Family Affair features a brief cameo by its producer: with a broad grin, Dre lifts his arms in triumph. As well he might. It might seem wilfully perverse to pick one of his poppiest productions as his greatest, but Dre\u2019s snappy adaptability to different artists and eras has always been among his strongest skills. And besides, Family Affair is just a no-further-questions moment of perfection, such a fantastic, irresistible single as to disarm any criticism. Its construction is simple \u2013 an unrelenting two-chord piano line, staccato strings and the occasional subtle synthesised whoosh supporting one of Mary J Blige\u2019s most economical and understated vocals and the most earworm-y of melodies. The cumulative effect is undeniable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
