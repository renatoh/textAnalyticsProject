I was flicking through the travel section of the Guardian this morning dreaming of places faraway and a damn site warmer than here, where the lake is frozen over, when I saw an extract of your adventures. I'm in my first year at York University and had a year out with 10 months travelling around Australia last year. I spent four months in Sydney, travelled anti-clockwise around the coast and came back again for two weeks before flying out on the day the Olympics started. The last place I stopped was in Byron Bay for 10 days to attempt to learn to surf while staying at the local campsite at Clarke's beach. I'd needed to get to Sydney pretty fast and so was chuffed when some guy called Shaun had placed an advertisement up saying he needed a driving/petrol share for a straight 10 hour drive through the night to the Blue Mountains. Shaun had been visiting his son for the weekend and had to be back at work on Monday morning. After I'd done a three hour shift at the wheel stuggling not to nod off we got to his house at 5am where he said we could stay for a couple of days for $15. When we got there he just showed us the three bed 'dorm' and when we got up the next day the house was deserted. The cooking gas had run out, we had no food and outside there was just a bunch of smashed up cars and two big dogs. Nice. We spent the day smoking out the house trying to start a fire and drinking Milo. Then Scott got back from an early morning trek. Is this the same guy? He was about 40, American, and never stopped talking. I can't believe Shaun has let him stay there this long as he annoyed the hell out of him and us. 'So, is Scotland an Island?', 'Do you guys get American movies in England?', ' What's the difference between the UK and Great Britain?', 'Is John Major still the prime minister', and on and on. Shaun was a nice guy but he seemed overworked. He cooked us food on the fire when he got home and advised us to spend the night sleeping on the floor in the living room as it was so cold. We decided to head to Katoomba the next day as it rained constantly and was freezing at that time. Shaun didn't have a car then and when he slept in and missed his lift to work the next day we too had to trek down the train line. Sorry to talk at you about something you've already done but your account of Katoomba and Shaun's house really made my day. I hope all goes well for you, and it'd be great to know if we've got the same Scott. See you later, Michael."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
