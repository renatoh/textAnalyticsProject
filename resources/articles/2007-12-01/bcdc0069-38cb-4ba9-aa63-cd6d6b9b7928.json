Liverpool's captain was keen for the France striker to sign in the summer before he left Arsenal for Barcelona. \"I sent him a few text messages seeing if he fancied it,\" he said. \"I would have loved to have seen him in a Liverpool shirt, just like the supporters would have. But he wanted to play for Barcelona, so you had to respect that decision. However he's got a lot of respect for Liverpool. He speaks well about us.\" Gerrard said they had become friendly as a result of the mutual respect built up by playing against each other. \"One day we swapped numbers and ever since we've been sending each other text messages, had phone calls, we support each other and stuff,\" he said. \"It is really flattering when a player at that level gives you a bit of praise.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
