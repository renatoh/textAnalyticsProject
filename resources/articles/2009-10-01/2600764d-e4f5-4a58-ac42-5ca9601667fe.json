Of course, it is still big names that will attract the bulk of the audience. Here you get Kate Mosse, Val McDermid, Jimmy McGovern and Fay Weldon. Gentlemen of a certain age will find it hard to resist afternoon tea with Joan Bakewell and the festival bows out with a weekend dedicated to exploring the short story, including tales inspired by Darwin and the Smiths. Various venues, Thu to 25 Oct, manchester literaturefestival.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
