To call it floating would be too easy. The most prolific player in grand slam tennis history morphs across the court. This athletic grace and fluidity have been the foundations of his success across all the big four championships. They have now brought him six Wimbledon titles. His feline smoothness earns comparison with the most naturally elegant performers in world sport \u2013 the young Muhammad Ali or Sugar Ray Leonard in boxing, say, or Zinedine Zidane on a football pitch. But these physical gifts would be a narrow kind of beauty without the additional virtue of psychological strength he demonstrated so decisively in a match that lasted 4 hours 16 minutes and produced a fifth set of 30 games. To proclaim Federer as the greatest of all tennis players is statistically straightforward and morally necessary. As Andy Roddick finally began to tire in the match that refused to end, Federer turned beyond pure natural talent to something more primeval: the refusal to yield, the compulsion to prevail that allows those with a special knack for playing sport to go on and become champions. This is not once but 15 times in his case because he has now gathered half a dozen Wimbledon trophies, five from America, three from Australia and one from France, where Rafael Nadal's early exit this year opened the door for him to complete the set. In one swoop here yesterday he returned to world No 1, where he had been for 237 weeks before Nadal deposed him, and cut loose from Pete Sampras, a fellow 14-times grand slam title winner who flew in specially to watch his Swiss heir go one better. Sampras joined a Royal Box front-row Brains Trust of Bjorn Borg, Manuel Santana and Rod Laver, with Ilie Nastase riding shotgun one row further back. They gazed at a pageant of endless tennis that featured much ragged play but also transcendent fortitude on both sides of the net. Roddick, Andy Murray's nemesis, became a grander player in a match-up that seemed to offer him no hope of an escape from Federer's thumping head-to-head superiority. The American had lost 18 of his 20 encounters with the Swiss nonpareil, so why should this be any different? Many of us exercise a deep prejudice against players who can fire down first serves consistently at speeds in excess of 130mph. We suspect them of trying to destroy the game with sniper tactics. This year, though, Roddick played probably the most creative tennis of his undulating career and should in no way be disparaged as a big-serving bully who tried to overwhelm a more artistic player. Only in the 77th and final game of this Hundred Years War of tennis did Federer break Roddick's serve. The fifth set had lurched into its teens (it finished 16\u201314) before Federer made his adversary crack. Aesthetically this was one of the least distinguished title-winning sets of his 15. An awkward truth, which seeped out again yesterday, is that Federer's precision rate is dropping on a court he has dominated with only a single interruption since he beat Mark Philippoussis in 2003. Nadal beat Federer here last year in a fifth set that was a mere blink by comparison: 9\u20137, that one finished. There were signs back then that his reign was faltering. Some consigned it to sepia. Many in yesterday's exhausted 15,000 crowd departed with the sense that Federer is not the monarch he was in 2007, when he beat Nadal, and that only his deep reserves of cunning and stubbornness allowed him to out-last Roddick, who threw his racket aside and sat crumpled in his court-side chair when the futility of his effort hit home. Sampras said he thought Federer \"could get to 18 or 19 [grand slam titles], potentially.\" He praised his usurper's \"effortless\" style and enthused: \"He's smooth, he's a great athlete, he's a great mover.\" All this is obvious even to the untrained eye, yet, in two consecutive All England Club finals, Federer has been dragged to the furthest frontier of his powers. His virtuosity is making emergency calls to his courage for support and it only adds to his lustre that the response is always positive. The first time Roddick lost to Federer in a Wimbledon final, in 2005, he went down 4-6, 7-5, 7-6, 6-4, which offers a minor sign of how the two have moved closer together. Federer's four-set win over Nadal in 2006 turned into a five-set affair in 2007 and a gruelling defeat 12 months later. He is still only 27 but after 15 grand slam wins it hardly shocks to see his subtlety no longer destroying opponents by itself. In the final quarter of his super-productive career winning comes slightly uglier, without so much of the gasp-inducing improvisation of 2003-2006, when he won nine of the 16 grand slam titles. \"He doesn't get enough credit for how much he toughs it out. Because he's so effortless people don't see it,\" Roddick said. If Nadal returns with pain-free knees, and Murray continues his evolution, another raid on the obduracy bank will be necessary if Federer is to match the record of seven Wimbledon titles, held jointly by Sampras and, tenuously, William Renshaw from a more genteel age. He could be excused the bespoke white post-match jacket with \"15\" emblazoned on the back, however gauche it was, because excellence on this scale entitles the dandy to wear whatever the hell he wants. It is a curious digression of Federer's career, however, that he has chosen to keep reminding himself what an iconic player he is, with wardrobe flourishes that reinforce his legend to himself. It may not be insecurity so much as a circling of the psychological wagons to ward off the thought of it ever ending. Sampras looked about as good as men's tennis was ever going to get, until Federer came along and added grace under pressure, until he married pluck with beauty. \u2022 This blogpost was amended on 6 July 2009.
