Ticket sales over the weekend will ensure a crowd of around 80,000 at the national arena in a united show of defiance after the terrorist atrocities in Paris. Didier Deschamps\u2019 team had been playing against Germany at the Stade de France when the venue was targeted by suicide bombers. Their entire 23-man squad, including Lassana Diarra who lost one of his cousins in the attacks, have travelled to London. England\u2019s players had watched events unfold on television after their friendly defeat by Spain in Alicante, with Rooney among those who had immediately sought to contact club-mates and friends in France. Nine of Deschamps\u2019 squad play at English clubs, with another four having previously graced the Premier League. \u201cIt was shocking, sickening, hard to watch,\u201d said the Manchester United striker. \u201cWe knew, watching it all unfold, that there would be a chance the game might not be on. We were happy to do whatever was decided, either way, but I\u2019m pleased the game\u2019s on. \u201cPlaying it shows France is demonstrating to the terrorists that they\u2019re standing strong against them, and we have to support that. Sometimes, when bad things happen, football is the place where you feel most comfortable. Their players might be taking that into consideration. This will be a great night of togetherness for everyone to see. It will show the terrorists that the world will go on and stand against them.\u201d The FA, having liaised with the government and the Metropolitan police, spent the weekend in talks with the French Football Federation over whether to proceed with the fixture, with the FFF president, No\u00ebl Le Gra\u00ebt, having made clear the desire to go ahead with the game. \u201cI\u2019m not surprised, given the way London reacted to 7/7,\u201d said the FA\u2019s chief executive, Martin Glenn. \u201cWhen all liberal democracies are attacked in this way, they want to react by triumphing over terror, so I\u2019m not surprised the French wanted the game to go ahead as planned.\u201d Security around the fixture will be significantly stepped up \u2013 there were armed police standing in the mouth of the tunnel at Wembley as the France players went out to train on Monday \u2013 with Kensington Palace having confirmed the Duke of Cambridge will attend \u201cout of solidarity to the people of France\u201d. David Cameron is also expected to be at the match. There will be armed police around the ground and more mounted officers present, with gates to open at 6pm and all bags to be searched on entry to the stadium. The players will wear black armbands in memory of the victims while Rooney and the France captain, Hugo Lloris, together with the referee, will lay a floral tribute on the pitch before the kick-off. The words to La Marseillaise are to be emblazoned across the screens in the stadium in the hope the whole arena sings the French national anthem, which will be sung after God Save The Queen. \u201cWe want to properly respect the occasion,\u201d added Glenn. \u201cIt\u2019s a game of football, and a very public commemoration of the feelings we have after the tragedy. But the fact we\u2019ve sold more tickets over the weekend [fewer than 100 tickets have been returned in the wake of Friday\u2019s atrocities] suggests people want to show their solidarity. The match will have massive global significance. It\u2019s the first big public event since Friday and the eyes of the world will be on Wembley, not just those of English people. It\u2019s important to do something to demonstrate terrorism can\u2019t win.\u201d It will be a youthful England after Roy Hodgson lost Fabian Delph \u2013 who has complained of fatigue after recent hamstring trouble \u2013 on Monday to swell the list of absentees to 17. The Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Ryan Mason has joined the squad, with the manager considering handing at least five players aged 22 or under a start and offering the Spurs pair Dele Alli and Eric Dier their full debuts. John Stones, Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling and Ross Barkley are also in the manager\u2019s thoughts to begin the game, though the uncapped Manchester United winger Jesse Lingard, who was called up on Sunday, will be on the bench. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a normal game of football, we can\u2019t deny that,\u201d Hodgson said. \u201cA lot of the focus around this game will be on the occasion, the importance of everybody in the world showing we are not going to let the terrorists win. \u201cBut of those players on the field many will be quite young, making debuts even. We mustn\u2019t forget that it\u2019s an important moment for them and we want them to enjoy playing football. \u201cI hope that, when the whistle goes, it\u2019ll be about football: the French trying to beat us and us them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
