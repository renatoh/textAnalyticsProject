From its very outset, her career has revolved around the trappings of extreme wealth, from the ultra-privileged children of the Los Angeles upper-crusters in her early exhibitions to a pair of nouveau-riche homebuilders for her 2012 documentary breakout The Queen of Versailles. She\u2019s fascinated with the grotesquerie and garishness of new money, watching from a clinical remove as her subjects expose the most tacky, contemptible, pathetic sides of themselves. She\u2019s renowned as a chronicler of the morally deformed, a diagnostic for the deleterious effects that a swollen bank account can have on the brain. So, why do these people keep agreeing to let her shoot them? What possessed Imelda Marcos, the former Philippine first lady and resurgent political operator, to sit for Greenfield\u2019s latest and perhaps most damning portrait, The Kingmaker? \u201cImelda Marcos is incredibly aware of the profile she puts forward,\u201d Greenfield says firmly over coffee at a Manhattan hotel. \u201cIn the film, I tried to include the parts that show her art-directing the world around her, moving the sheets and arranging her photos, so that we can see her in this presentational state.\u201d All manner of articles about the dynastic family, many of them harshly critical, hang framed on the walls of the palatial Marcos estate. It\u2019s just one in a handful of canny symbols in Greenfield\u2019s new feature, a telling encapsulation of the mentality shared by her subjects as they hoist themselves by their own petards. Regardless of whatever light they might be seen in, they\u2019re just glad someone\u2019s looking. Another one of these \u201cperfect metaphors\u201d first brought Greenfield into Marcos\u2019s orbit and began the project that would expand in scope and ambition to become The Kingmaker. She read a Bloomberg story by the British journalist William Mellor about a quixotic idea Marcos had while on safari, to bring an ark\u2019s worth of the savannah\u2019s animals back to the Philippines and create an island haven for them as a miniature African getaway she could visit whenever she pleased. As it fell into disrepair and the ousting of the Marcos regime left it fully abandoned, it became something like an Ozymandias statue, warning all those looking upon her works to despair. \u201cI was interested in the contradiction between her personal charisma and its terrible consequences,\u201d Greenfield says. \u201cThe animal island was how I get into the story. It was something she just did because she thought it\u2019d be lovely for the Philippines, intending to treat the animals well, then cut to four generations of inbreeding later, they\u2019ve lost all funding and everyone else has been left to pick up the pieces \u2026 This was the ultimate extravagance: depopulating an island of its indigenous population just to bring in animals from Africa. It was a strange, unnatural Jurassic Park.\u201d She continues: \u201cI thought there would be two strands, the first being her coming back to the Philippines as a congresswoman, and the animal island as part of her legacy. It was going to be a historical tale, stuck in the past. What shocked me was how it came rushing into the present.\u201d There\u2019s a perceptible shift in the winds about halfway through The Kingmaker, as Greenfield realizes her true focus. The first hour plays out not unlike The Queen of Versailles or its follow-up Generation Wealth, a cataloguing of the one per cent\u2019s obscene excesses and the pathologies undergirding them. But the film shifts into a far more urgent, high-stakes register as Marcos attempts to guide her son Bongbong into the seat of the vice-president in 2016, and assists with the current tyrant Rodrigo Duterte\u2019s rise to the presidency. What begins as a peek behind one woman\u2019s gilded curtain pivots into an embedded reporter\u2019s coverage of a power grab with unsettling resonances to the ascent of Trumpism. \u201cWhen I began, Bongbong didn\u2019t have a chance in hell of winning the election,\u201d Greenfield recalls. \u201cAs he became the frontrunner, I realized [Imelda\u2019s] rewriting of history was taking hold. It wasn\u2019t until Duterte won that I really saw the return of this sort of dictatorship and the movie got an ending. The moral of the story became that those who can\u2019t remember history will certainly repeat it.\u201d Marcos displayed what Greenfield calls \u201ca strategic purpose and effect\u201d in her creative relationship to her own record. While her husband\u2019s administration waged a campaign of terror against the country\u2019s poorest citizens for two decades, she hoarded capital obtained through possibly illegal means and put a smiling face on their crimes against humanity. She\u2019s now going all in on revisionism, as if the body count can be erased with a single Orwellian declaration that perception matters more than truth. \u201cIn the very first scene, when Imelda walks into her living room with the Picassos and asks if her tummy looks too big, I asked her to look at my camera,\u201d Greenfield explains. \u201cShe says, \u2018I should look at you?\u2019 and I say yes, and then she just doesn\u2019t. I wanted to show immediately that there\u2019s a tension between who\u2019s really controlling the story. She\u2019s an unreliable narrator, and I\u2019m allowing her to talk. The key was to check in with others \u2013 truth-tellers. I did feel a journalistic obligation, as well as an obligation to history, to make sure the audience knew that Imelda\u2019s version of events was not the only version.\u201d The most affecting moments come when Greenfield ventures into the villages to speak with survivors of the brutal Marcos policies, which frequently employed rape and other violence as intimidation tactics. For the documentarian, speaking with these women and witnessing the strength with which they revisited their trauma underscored the crucial human toll that Marcos took. \u201cI tried to show [Imelda\u2019s] humanity, which comes out more when looking at her early life. She was born an orphan, made a life for herself, lived through her husband\u2019s constant cheating,\u201d Greenfield admits. \u201cBut she\u2019s responsible for terrible things. For Imelda, over the years, it wasn\u2019t clear whether she was just the wife or really part of it all. This film confirms that she had agency, and that she has it now.\u201d The film levies a bruising indictment against Marcos from within her direct proximity, a broadside clarified over a five-year editing process that gave Greenfield ample time to think about the efficacy of her actions. She accepted that while her work would be unlikely to wield any sway with Marcos herself \u2013 someone inviting a camera crew to follow her every move isn\u2019t prone to self-reflection \u2013 it could still have a vital utility. She couldn\u2019t pierce Marcos\u2019s manufactured reality, but she could show it to everyone else. She\u2019ll print the legend, and make sure to clearly label it as such. \u201cIf she saw this movie, and she hasn\u2019t yet, she\u2019d probably be fine with everything she said,\u201d Greenfield muses. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t be surprised, she was right there, fully aware of what she was saying. Now, that we talked to survivors of her regime \u2013 that, she wouldn\u2019t like.\u201d The Kingmaker is out in the US on 8 November and in the UK on 13 December"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
