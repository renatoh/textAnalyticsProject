That much was clear on Tuesday when the former world No1 Luke Donald said the stipulated number of events to retain a European Tour card should be scaled back. Donald is one of a batch of US-based Europeans who must play 13 straight or co-sanctioned European Tour competitions to remain a full member and thereby be eligible for Ryder Cup selection. Difficulty over that commitment has been pointed out in the past and is pertinent this week. Henrik Stenson, Sergio Garc\u00eda and Ian Poulter are skipping the Tour\u2019s flagship event, the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth. Donald has offered alternative reasoning, though. \u201cI think it would be nice to see a reduction in the number of counting events needed for the European Tour,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would encourage some other players from around the world to become members of the European Tour. I don\u2019t think it would affect the number of events I would play necessarily but it would encourage certain players, even US guys, to join this tour and grow this tour. \u201cAt this point Brooks Koepka is a good example. Through being a European Tour member he got a lot of success out of it, did very well. He became a PGA Tour member, obviously being American, and I think having a number of 13 events as a minimum, being allowed only three or four releases [from the PGA Tour] \u2013 just simply the math doesn\u2019t work. \u201cThere\u2019s some room for improvement there and I think, ironically, minimising the number of events would actually strengthen the Tour.\u201d Donald\u2019s compatriot, Paul Casey, has opted to commit himself entirely to PGA Tour golf and Donald admitted: \u201cWith my world ranking sliding I\u2019d have to seriously consider something like that next year if it doesn\u2019t get any better. If you\u2019re not in the majors and world events, to play both tours, you\u2019re just thinning yourself out too much or you would have to play 30, 35 events for the year. \u201cSo that\u2019s something I would have to consider. I haven\u2019t even got close to thinking about that yet but I would dearly love to continue being a member of both tours and obviously to have the chance to play in the Ryder Cup.\u201d Donald\u2019s current ranking is a surprisingly low 60, which points perfectly towards the importance of a week back on home soil at a tournament he has previously won. \u201cI would say there have been moments on the course where I\u2019ve been very down, disappointed and frustrated, all those words. Anyone who plays this game knows how difficult it is,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s some things on the line that I haven\u2019t had to worry about in the past. Staying in the top 60 for the US Open, getting in the top 50 for the Open, I\u2019m obviously aware of these. I don\u2019t want to have them be too much of a focus. The focus has to be on doing what I can to be ready each week and being prepared.\u201d The American Ryder Cup player Patrick Reed has belatedly withdrawn from both the PGA Championship and next week\u2019s Irish Open."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
