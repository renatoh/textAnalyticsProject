The 35-year-old, who sells out stadiums with his standup routine, tells radio presenter Kirsty Young on Sunday's Desert Island Discs on BBC Radio 4 that the criticism and scorn have spoiled some of the highlights of his career. \"I go to the British Comedy Awards and, you know, quite a few people were making jokes at my expense,\" he says. \"It just made me feel awful, because I am there with my wife and she has gone out and bought a dress. And it is my big night and I won, and yet the overriding experience was that of nastiness. For what reason, I don't know. I don't know what I was doing \u2013 just making people laugh.\" During an interview in which he discusses his showbusiness childhood, McIntyre says the loss of his father, a former writer for the Kenny Everett Show, spurred him on in the world of comedy. Choosing tracks including the Steve Miller Band's Abracadabra and Nat King Cole's Smile for his desert island stay, McIntyre admits he had few friends as a boy or young man. \"I never felt like I belong to anything \u2013 to any groups of friends. I never really had that,\" he said, explaining he is happiest alone on stage. Young asks the comedian how he feels about the \"derision\" of his fellow performers, quoting Stewart Lee's description of McIntyre \"spoon-feeding his audience warm diarrhoea\". \"I think it comes with the territory,\" McIntyre replies. \"I can't say it is water off a duck's back; that I am so thick-skinned it doesn't matter. I can just say that's [how it is]. It did come as a shock at the beginning, I can't deny that.\" The strength of his rivals' resentment when he started to become famous after 10 years on the comedy circuit was bewildering, he says. \"Everything was going so well, but that came, certainly at the beginning, with an amazing amount of hostility. Because I would never be rude about somebody else in my profession, we are all doing the same thing, we are just trying to make somebody laugh, and I have my audience and other people have their audience.\" The comedian also denies industry rumour that he has a team of writers working on his material. \"I don't have any writers. I never get a laugh with somebody else's jokes. I can't do it justice.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
