The latest incident in a horrifyingly long list of killings by Rio\u2019s police \u2013 which is far higher than that of any US city \u2013 has prompted outrage among favela residents and civil rights activists. The five victims from the Morro da Lagartixa community \u2013 all aged 16 to 25 years old \u2013 were reportedly out celebrating a first paycheck on Sunday when the police peppered their car with bullets. Family members said police gave no opportunity to surrender. \u201cWhat happened there was an execution,\u201d said Jorge Penha, the father of one of the victims. \u201cEverything I planned in my life has collapsed. They need to pay for what they did.\u201d M\u00e1rcia Ferreira told local reporters that her son Wilton Domingos Jr was still alive when she arrived at the scene, but police refused to take him to a nearby hospital emergency unit and then threatened her and her daughter with a rifle when they tried to approach. Locals claimed police tried to make the killing look like self-defence by placing a gun inside the car. The five childhood friends were buried on Monday. Protesters held a demonstration the same day. Some carried a Brazilian flag riddled with 50 bullet holes \u2013 the same number fired at the car \u2013 and the name of the victims: Wilton Domingos Jr , Roberto Penha, Carlos de Souza, Cleiton de Souza and Wesley Rodrigues. Investigators charged three officers with homicide \u2013 Thiago Resende Barbosa, Marcio Alves dos Santos and Antonio Filho. A fourth \u2013 Fabio da Silva \u2013 has been detained for fabricating evidence. Their commander, Lt Col Marcos Netto, was also dismissed. It was the second recent controversy surrounding his unit following the shooting last month of two men on a motorbike by a police sergeant who mistook their hydraulic jack for a rifle. Rio security authorities said the punishments were the result of stricter discipline to try to stem the violence. But the city \u2013 like Brazil as a whole \u2013 has one of the worst records in the world for killings of and by police. Between January 2011 and October 2015, 2,510 people were killed in \u201cself-defence\u201d actions by the city\u2019s police \u2013 an average of 1.4 deaths per day, according to the newspaper Extra. Overwhelmingly the victims tend to be young, black males from poor communities in the north of the city such as Iraj\u00e1. Silvia Ramos, a social scientist and Coordinator of the Centre for Studies on Public Security and Citizenship, welcomed the punishments and admission of failure by senior officers as an improvement on the empty excuses made by the authorities in the past. But she said the police needed to address more fundamental problems of inequality and the different mentality of officers in conflict areas. Unlike the pacification programs in favelas in the richer south zone of the city, she said police in the poorer northern zone feel they are in a war zone. \u201cIn these conditions, police think that opening fire on a car is valid. They would not do this in the rich areas of the city. It\u2019s a police model that coincides with a certain side of Rio,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to consider this as an individual problem of four police officers; the entire model of policing is to blame.\u201d Ant\u00f4nio Carlos Costa, the head of the Rio de Paz NGO, agreed that the police should be understood as well as punished. \u201cWhat happened is that they saw a car full of black people who fall into a category of those who are \u2018\u2019killable\u2019 in our society,\u201d he said. \u201cThe military police are not well prepared. They are not mature enough to deal with the situation in Rio, which is one of the most complex in the world. They lack supervision and are abandoned. They are victims and perpetrators at the same time.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
