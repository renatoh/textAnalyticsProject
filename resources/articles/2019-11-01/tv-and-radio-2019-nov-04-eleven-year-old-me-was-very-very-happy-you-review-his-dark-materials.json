You review His Dark Materials", "bodyText": "\u2018It brought back the feeling of reading the books\u2019 I can only recollect the books vaguely as I read them over 15 years ago, but the first episode brought back the feeling of reading them, which is the highest praise I can give. Well done to all involved \u2013 I am genuinely excited for the rest. TKStoker \u2018Stick with it \u2013 it\u2019s about to take off\u2019 I can understand why Philip Pullman is so enthusiastic about this adaptation. This first episode set the scene for me, remarkably similarly to how the book did. To some who don\u2019t know the books, this may seem a slow start but stick with it, it\u2019s about to take off and then it won\u2019t stop. funky_rascal \u2018I didn\u2019t think it was perfect, but they got much more right than wrong\u2019 I was incredibly nervous about this when they announced it, and only cautiously optimistic when the trailer aired. The books were honestly life-changing for me growing up, and after the godawful 2007 film I\u2019d concluded the story was basically unfilmable. Looks like I was wrong! I didn\u2019t think the first episode was perfect, but they got much more right than wrong. Dafne Keen, James McAvoy and Ruth Wilson are all superbly cast, and I thought they handled Roger\u2019s story perfectly. nineteeneightythree \u2018There was some terrible acting\u2019 Clunky expositionary dialogue can be forgiven due to the nature of the extraordinary fictional world being created, but there was some terrible acting \u2013 and as for that music \u2026 Just for once could a BBC drama allow its viewers to think for themselves? No way was this a five-star adaptation. SaintVespaluus \u2018I loved the film version, but this was much better\u2019 Near perfect. I was particularly impressed with how they showed Lyra\u2019s delivery to Oxford, Asriel\u2019s explorations and other short, informative and well written scenes. They added background and context without too much exposition or going the whole Peter Jackson\u2019s The Hobbit route of hours of extra historical detail. I loved the film version but this was so, so much better. I only hope that the team behind this complete the trilogy, as the greatest disappointment in the film was that the plug was pulled on the project. skausmaus \u2018It could easily be the best adaptation of any book ever\u2019 If the rest of this series continues in this fashion, it could easily be the best adaptation of any book ever. Pauliesonne \u2018Completely brilliant\u2019 I thought it was incredible. My only slight criticism was lots of scenes where you couldn\u2019t see the character\u2019s daemon \u2013 they are such an important part of the books and the choice of animal always fitting to personality, and Pullman always made a point of telling you about every character\u2019s daemon when first introducing them. Felt a bit like the BBC were skimping on costs! But otherwise, completely brilliant and I will be so happy if it finally gets the wider audience and appreciation it deserves. Orchida \u2018The dialogue and delivery seems stilted\u2019 While I admired Pullman\u2019s obvious intellectual clarity and breadth of vision, I did struggle to complete the books. The imaginative scope was undeniably breathtaking, but the prose I found jarringly clunky at times, the storyline sometimes overwrought. Strangely, I feel the same about this BBC production. Scrupulous detailing and high production values notwithstanding, the dialogue and delivery seems stilted and stagey, which makes the narrative experience again a bit uninvolving and less than the sum of its aspirational parts. I\u2019ll continue to watch, but I fear that for me it will be reliving a less than exhilarating experience. styxanstanes \u2018I\u2019ll be there for the whole thing\u2019 I\u2019ve just watched it on the iPlayer and enjoyed it thoroughly. I did try reading one of the trilogy (presumably the first) some years ago but couldn\u2019t really get into it \u2013 this treatment, however, is excellent and I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll be there for the whole thing. Of course, it\u2019s meant for children but I suppose I\u2019ll cope, somehow, despite \u2018celebrating\u2019 my 80th birthday in January. geoff1940 \u2018I was happy to be transported back to Lyra\u2019s world\u2019 I was 11 when the first book came out and honestly it was life changing. Had always enjoyed reading but this was challenging and immersive \u2013 I\u2019d never read anything like it before. It set me on a path to reading so many more interesting and varied texts and even inspired me to study English at university. I even became known at the local book shop for hounding them for the release date of the second and third books, which ended up landing me a Saturday job there when I was 15. You get the picture ... I thought tonight\u2019s programme was just amazing and 11-year-old me was very, very happy to be transported back to Lyra\u2019s world.
