Horrible dog flag \u201cShurrup Yew Ye Tick was a meme!\u201d says Tom from Dublin. \u201cTick is Irish slang for someone saying you\u2019re silly or something. It\u2019s like: \u2018Shut up you tick.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s nobody\u2019s dog, it\u2019s just a meme!\u201d his friend Andy, also from Dublin, says. We\u2019ve all learned something about Irish internet culture circa 2015, but the dog is frankly terrifying. 4. Space invader with a baseball bat \u201cWe play in a softball league and our team is called Base Invaders \u2013 it\u2019s a pun!\u201d says Steven from London. Great pun, but possibly the most extraordinary thing about Steven\u2019s flag is that there are at least five softball players at Glastonbury. Apparently it\u2019s \u201chuge\u201d. 3. Dave Grohl on a stick \u201cWhy have I got Dave Grohl on a stick? Because he was headlining two years ago and I\u2019m too lazy to change it,\u201d says Ryan from south Wales. Can Ryan\u2019s friends find him with a flag so small that it\u2019s the size of a human head? \u201cI\u2019m 6ft 2in, so that\u2019s quite high up when my arm\u2019s stretched.\u201d 2. PIG!!! flag Sharon Dainton from Melbourne in Derbyshire has been coming to Glastonbury since 1986. \u201cIn the old days, I used to carry a pig on a stick flag so my mates could find me. Then one year, there were 15 pigs on sticks so I had to rethink. Now \u201cpiiig\u201d is a catchphrase among my friends. 1. Traffic cones Catherine Caddy and her mates have come from London to Glastonbury as traffic cones for no other reason than to have a laugh. \u201cWe\u2019ve been stopping traffic,\u201d she says, \u201cand letting the tractors pass!\u201d The flag, which features three cones with her face on, reads: \u201cSees tickets, buys tickets.\u201d This is because she was extraordinarily lucky, managing to buy tickets for all 18 of her friends. So the flag is a homage to Catherine and her supernaturally fast internet connection. She wins for sheer tenacity and dedication to the cause."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
