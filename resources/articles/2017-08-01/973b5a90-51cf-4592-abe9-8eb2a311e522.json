Trump has received bipartisan criticism for sparing Arpaio, one of the most divisive law enforcement figures in the US, possible jail time for defying a court order to stop racially profiling Latino people. During a joint press conference with the visiting president of Finland, Trump insisted of Arpaio: \u201cHe\u2019s done a great job for the people of Arizona. He\u2019s very strong on borders, very strong on illegal immigration. He is loved in Arizona. I thought he was treated unbelievably unfairly when they came down with their big decision to go get him right before the election voting started.\u201d Last November, Arpaio, a hardliner on illegal immigration, lost his bid for a seventh term as sheriff of Maricopa County, which contains Phoenix, as many Latino voters backed his opponent. When Trump pardoned him last week, the White House released only a perfunctory two-paragraph statement by way of explanation. At the press conference, the president seemed to imply that the noise generated by his supporters was a factor in his thinking. \u201cWhen I mentioned him the other night, you saw the massive crowd we had,\u201d he said, referring to a rally in Phoenix last Tuesday. \u201cPeople went crazy when I said, \u2018What do you think of Sheriff Joe?\u2019 or something to that effect.\u201d Trump said he had anticipated Monday\u2019s question and proceeded to read, from some prepared notes, a list controversial pardons and commutations by previous presidents. It included Bill Clinton\u2019s pardon of the commodities trader and fugitive Marc Rich, who was wanted for tax evasion and whose ex-wife donated to the Clintons, and \u201cdangerous criminals\u201d such as the Weather Underground member Susan Rosenberg. He continued: \u201cYou\u2019ve heard the word leaker. President Obama commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, who leaked countless sensitive and classified documents to WikiLeaks, perhaps and others. But horrible, horrible thing that he did, commuted the sentence and perhaps pardoned.\u201d The Arpaio pardon was announced last Friday night as Hurricane Harvey closed in on Texas with heavy winds and severe flooding. But Trump rejected accusations that he was hoping to bury the news, claiming instead that he announced the pardon then because he knew people would be watching. \u201cIn the middle of a hurricane, even though it was Friday evening, I assumed the ratings would be far higher than they would be normally,\u201d he said. Trump also continued to insist that Mexico would pay for his long-promised border wall. \u201cOne way or the other, Mexico will pay for the wall,\u201d he said, arguing that, while the project might initially be funded by US taxpayers, \u201cultimately\u201d Mexico would pay through reimbursement. Trump recently threatened to force a federal government shutdown unless Congress provided funding for his wall. He said: \u201cI hope that\u2019s not necessary. If it\u2019s necessary, we\u2019ll have to see.\u201d Yet again he seemed reluctant to criticise Russia, which borders Finland. Asked if Russia poses a security threat, he replied: \u201cI consider many countries as a security threat.\u201d He repeated previous comments hoping that Washington could eventually \u201cget along\u201d with Moscow. Facing the first major natural disaster of his presidency, Trump said he would visit Texas on Tuesday and return on Saturday. \u201cThere\u2019s probably never been anything like this.\u201d He promised an aid package for recovery will come \u201cvery quickly\u201d, adding: \u201cThe real number, which will be many billions of dollars, will go through Congress.\u201d At one point during Monday\u2019s press conference in the East Room of the White House, president Sauli Niinist\u00f6 agreed to a question from a Finnish journalist who Trump mistakenly thought had already asked one. Trump said: \u201cAgain? You\u2019re going to give her the same one?\u201d Niinist\u00f6 replied: \u201cNo, she is not the same lady, they are sitting side by side.\u201d The journalist interjected: \u201cWe have a lot of blonde women in Finland.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
