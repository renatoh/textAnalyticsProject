It happened so rarely in the 70s it felt almost naughty, like seeing a naked mannequin in a shop window, or hearing an actor on the telly say \"scrubber\". In kids' football, scorelines of 15\u201312 were the order of the day, but grown-ups were parsimonious when it came to goals. As a child you recognised this as a sign of maturity, further proof that adults were sensible, hard-working, self-disciplined and dull. They spent the huge sums of money they controlled on food and furniture instead of blowing it on spud guns and sherbet flying saucers, and when they played football they considered a goalless draw a job well done. An adult way of winning was 2\u20131; 6-2 was altogether infantile. As a consequence there was something vaguely subversive about a First Division side hitting five. It suggested a world gone mad, a puerile carnival of the bizarre. When the BBC teleprinter spluttered out a result in which a team had hit six it was so astonishing the machine spelled it out in parentheses, for disbelieving eyes. When Middlesbrough beat Sheffield Wednesday 8\u20110 in 1974 you half expected the sky to turn pink and to see crowds dressed in Dickie Davies wigs throwing Mattesson's sausage baps at passing priests. It hadn't always been like that, of course. In the 70s older folk often spoke of the goal feasts of the distant past. \"One time Boro v Sunderland at Ayresome Park finished five each,\" my grandfather used to inform me at least three times during every Middlesbrough game we attended, uttering the words with the sort of wistful wonder with which people during the days of rationing spoke of bananas and cream cakes. On the field it was Stan Lugg and Frank Spraggon, the football equivalent of pilchards and turnip jam. The early indications this season are that we may be returning to the days of primary school wonder. In the 1972\u201373 First Division season teams hit five goals or more nine times in 462 matches. The biggest tally was the six Leeds put past Arsenal. So far this season teams in the Premier League have got halfway to double figures or beyond six times in 66 matches. Top-flight football may be entering its second childhood. This is all very exciting, if a little bit rich for older stomachs. However, you can't help wondering whether it indicates value for money in the defensive areas. After all, back in the 50s, if you wanted a centre-back you got some big bald bloke with no teeth to do the job in return for a dry place to sleep and some clean straw. Nowadays you have to pay \u00a3100,000 a week for the same shoddy service. Ron Atkinson used to talk about defenders who relished doing the \"ugly\" things. Currently it seems most defenders not only shy away from the ugly, they singularly fail to embrace the plain things and turn their noses up at the \"not bad looking in certain lights if you're on holiday and had a bit to drink\" things, too. In fact there are quite a few defenders who faced with a Lily Cole-like nonchalant backheeled clearance will simply shrug and mutter, \"Nope. It's not doing anything for me, I'm afraid\". Zonal marking gets much of the blame for the current goal glut. Zonal marking is one of those phrases that nobody seems able to say without a tone in their voice that suggests they are rolling their eyes heavenwards in despair. You feel certain it is just the sort of thing to get Jeremy Clarkson's goat, and that Richard Littlejohn believes you couldn't make it up. Any day now Gary on the M6 will be texting 5 Live in response to some incident that marks a new lamentable low in \"Brown's Broken Britain\", with the words, \"This is yet another example of zonal marking gone mad, Victoria. When will the government sit up and listen to the people of Britain?\" Such is the mounting phone-in/pundit outcry against zonal marking that it is surely only a matter of moments before tabloids start running stories claiming \"Barmy Brussels bureaucrats\" are about to make zonal marking compulsory, while forcing purveyors of good old-fashioned English man-marking to relabel their product: \"Football close-watch with sweat and elbows defensive deterrent substitute\". Maybe the haphazard defending we seem to be seeing really is the fault of zonal marking. But I can't help wondering if it isn't football's response to a new role as part of the entertainment industry. Goals are to football what explosions are to Jason Statham movies \u2013 the more the better. Is it possible that coaches are subliminally bowing to the pressure? Responding to the consumer demand for goals by apparently telling their players that the best way to defend corners is to stand around looking vaguely uncomfortable, like somebody who's arrived at their spouse's office party only to discover she's been delayed at a meeting? Or is that idea, like so many final scores this season, a bit on the childish side?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
