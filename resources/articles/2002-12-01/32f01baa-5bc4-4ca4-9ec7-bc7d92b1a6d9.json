I can picture you now, among the discarded wrapping paper, looking at all the books people thought you'd like. That one about the boy and the tiger. The biography of the diarist. The long-winded politician's life of Churchill - what on earth possessed you to ask for that? No, this was the book you wanted: something big, inexhaustible, indisputably great. Of course, if you're a Bellow fan, then either you have this book or the collections in which its stories already exist. If by some oversight you haven't, then you will be putting the paper down about now and heading off to order or buy it. So for the remainder of this space, I should be trying to make a case for Bellow, for the benefit of those who have managed to evade him, or have yet to be convinced (or, as in the case of one of Penguin's own employees, those who have not heard of him but imagine instead that there is a writer called \"Paul Bellow\"). As James Wood says in his introduction - an excellent commission, by the way - \"Bellow's stories seem to divide into two kinds: long, loose-edged stories, which read as if they began life as novels... and short, almost classical tales, which often recount the events of a single day.\" Both, Wood points out, use a kind of stream-of-consciousness which owes something to Joyce, but not as sternly; they are friendlier than that, demand less marvelling at the technique. There can still be something terribly intimidating about Bellow. Those are the two correct subdivisions of his shorter works, but it could have been put another way: that the first of two kinds of Bellow stories are, indeed, the short, classical tales, in which the narrator recalls an incident or a period in his early life, growing up in the Depression as a first- or second-generation Jewish immigrant in the mid-west of America. The paterfamilias has endured unspeakable privations in escaping from a ruined, infernal Europe to end up wherever he is, with sad, brown eyes flecked with gold, and lines down the face that have something to do with having been inoculated by an ancient Russian doctor with the serum from a tubercular cow. The boy struggles with not only his circumstances but his own yearning, insatiable intellect. \"I couldn't have thought it then, but I now understand that my purpose was to interpret this place. Its power was tremendous.\" That's from \"Something to Remember Me By\". The place is of course Chicago, and in this case what brings him down to earth with a crash is having his clothes stolen by a prostitute, and having to make his way back to his \"Old Testament\" father in borrowed or rather stolen clothes. Elsewhere the narrator has to wrestle with his criminally inclined father to retrieve a valuable item the latter has stolen from trusting benefactors (\"A Silver Dish\"). These stories are indeed classical, powerful, with the intellect confining itself to memorable description and acute perception. Of a woman's big bust: \"Woody's imagination had investigated this.\" But with the longer story, the novel-in-brief, the imagination has evolved into something more powerful. It still investigates breasts; but not just breasts. In \"What Kind of Day Did You Have?\", Victor Wulpy, the celebrated intellectual, exists on a plane so rarefied and exclusive that we feel rather stupid and clumsy in his presence. Even those dismissed as dullards and second-raters are way above us. We notice with something like gratitude the private details Bellow gives us, like Victor's habit of absent-mindedly teasing out his scrotal hairs as he lies back on his hotel bed and talks to his mistress. His heroes' minds are rarely absent, but full-on, eternally engaged, and it can be exhausting. We tend only to meet such minds in, well, in the pages of Saul Bellow fictions. But you should not even think of being put off by this kind of thing: Bellow's intelligence is truly humane, inclusive and generous; unlike so many other writers one can think of, he doesn't treat you like an idiot or write down to you. He offers you a hand up, or a ladder constructed of astonishingly accurate prose. Climb up it and you have a view of the human world like no other. This book is indispensable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
