Distin is out of contract at the end of the season and his situation has alerted several Premier League clubs to his potential availability. David Moyes, however, is keen to extend the central defender's stay on Merseyside, with the veteran's form and lack of injuries impressive since a \u00a35m arrival from Portsmouth in 2009, and talks have progressed on another 12-month extension. Distin's fellow defender Phil Jagielka committed his future to Everton until 2017 last week and the club have also lined up a new deal for midfielder Leon Osman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
