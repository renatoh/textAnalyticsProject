Help!", "bodyText": "I am frightened that I'm becoming a hermit. I'm a retired woman, still lively and healthy and very happily married. There is, however, a nagging worry in my life: for reasons that I do not understand, I no longer want a social life outside my own family. I enjoy a casual chat with acquaintances I meet in the street or while out shopping, but I dread being invited to parties or to dinner with a group of other guests, and I am filled with horror when people invite me to stay with them. It's not that I suddenly dislike my friends - far from it - but I no longer seem to need them or have the energy to spare for them. The sad truth is that I'm much happier when they do not get in touch. I feel guilty and miserable about this. What is the reason for it? Am I the only person who feels like this? Is there any way I can change my curmudgeonly outlook on life? What's wrong with being solitary? When I was growing up, the word \"loner\" had some positive connotations - independence, being a free spirit - but it is now used to describe, at best, a trainee serial killer. I used to accept most invitations, but eventually I realised that \"normal\" amounts of socialising made me miserable, so I stopped forcing myself to do it. I found that the friends I value most are quite happy to see me and my partner now and again, since some are also quite solitary and the more sociable ones have other friends to amuse themselves with. Your problem is that you feel \"guilty and miserable\", but some of us are naturally solitary. Those who are more gregarious don't understand this and tend to be insulted if one doesn't want to see them every 10 minutes. Have a list of plausible excuses ready for such people, so they are not hurt by your turning down invitations, and enjoy what you like doing best. Consider the predicament of people who need constant social interaction - I tend to pity them since they're so unable to entertain themselves. Pascal said that \"All the trouble in the world comes from Man's inability to sit quietly in his room.\" I feel grateful for being so self-reliant. KB, London Live as you want to live I feel exactly the same as you and I am only in my late 30s. When people invite me out for a drink, the first thing that enters my head is whether I will be able to get out of it - the difference between you and me is that I really don't view this as a problem. I like going out to dinner or the cinema with my husband and spending time with my family. I remember looking at my parents when I was about 17 or 18 and wondering why they hardly ever went out. Now I completely understand. Going out and socialising is a means to an end for many people - if you are young and looking for a partner, for example, it's often the only way to meet someone. But I think a lot of us just grow out of this, so don't feel guilty about it. It is your life and you should live it how you want. LW, London Check that you are not depressed I am a 57-year-old woman and while I remain sociable and outgoing at work, as soon as I get home, the shutters come down. I am gradually coming to the conclusion that it is perfectly OK to be like this and that unnecessary sociability is not all it is cracked up to be. At this age, I believe that I've had enough small talk. Fortunately, my husband is very understanding and, as long as I make an effort now and then, he is quite willing to pursue his own lively activities without me. However, I would recommend that you check that you are not depressed and that you have enough interests and enthusiasms to sustain you in your retirement. To prevent myself from becoming a total hermit (tempting!) I endeavour - not always successfully - to do the following. I host a small gathering once or twice a year and gratefully accept the occasional similar invitation to keep in touch with people. Over the winter I sing in a choir, and about once a month find a good film to go to with friends. These have the advantage of being enjoyable, interesting things to do but have minimal necessity for mindless chatter. Other than this, when the family are not around, I am happy to be left alone with my dogs. Name and address withheld Friends are important - keep them My wife of 20 years has gradually developed a similar attitude to yours. She used to really enjoy socialising and was entertaining company when we were out together. She is very lucky to have an unusually loyal group of friends because she rarely returns their calls and tries to avoid social interaction at all costs. Whenever she is obliged to go out, she gets cranky and withdrawn at the idea of being with other people, but despite that she resents my reasonably active social life. The received wisdom is that it's positive to engage with friends, as it stops one ruminating and is generally good for the spirits; it also helps to ensure life doesn't become too dull. On a more pragmatic note, it's sensible to have a network of friends outside the family; it may be upsetting to contemplate but what are you going to do if your husband predeceases you? Name and address withheld Examine your fears I'm guessing that if you were really happy about the situation you find yourself in, you wouldn't be asking this question. Horror seems an unusually strong reaction to being invited to stay with friends. Perhaps you should examine your fears. My mother went through a long period of agoraphobia and for some time claimed to be quite happy in her own company. Eventually, she took herself off to get some counselling and, after a short spell of cognitive behavioural therapy, was soon venturing out again. Now she has a very lively part-time volunteer job and a range of friends she has made through the various courses she is involved in. NP, St Leonards, Australia What the expert thinks Stop criticising yourself so harshly. There is no rule that dictates how much social interaction an individual should undertake. We are all different, and the amount of social mixing that feels right to one person may not suit another. Also, as personal circumstances change, it is quite likely that we alter how we balance our time between family and friends. You are happy to chat with friends you meet when you're out, and you feel comfortable when you're spending time alone with your family. You only become distressed when asked to mix with other people in a more formal situation - in particular, with larger groups or in unfamiliar surroundings - or when you think you may be asked to do so. Your problem, therefore, is not that you are actually doing anything wrong or that your behaviour needs changing, but that you believe your attitude is in some way unacceptable or abnormal. You also suggest that you have changed with regard to your sociability. Is this transformation simply an exaggeration of earlier habits, or does it represent a radical departure from the way you used to interact with others? That is, have you always preferred to meet with friends individually or in small groups, and to socialise in places you know well? If so, then your current preferences could well be part of a normal progression. As we get older, many of us find it increasingly difficult to \"screen out\" competing sounds. As a result, it becomes more and more of a challenge to focus on what another person is saying if the conversation is carried out in a noisy atmosphere: for example, in a crowded room, or with music or traffic noise in the background. It is also normal to become more certain of our priorities as we mature, and to choose to spend a greater amount of time with those people who matter most to us. Many people - although definitely not all - prefer more familiar environments and routines, rather than the adventurous lifestyles they enjoyed when they were younger. The progression towards a quieter and more reflective way of living is a normal part of ageing for many people. On the other hand, if your refusal to accept social invitations feels out of character, and if it's based on fear or self-loathing - that is, you're afraid to leave home for long or to venture to unfamiliar places, or you feel that your presence or what you have to say isn't worth offering - then it would be wise to challenge your attitude. If you are worried that you are becoming uncharacteristically forgetful or too easily disorientated and that this might mean you are developing serious memory problems, see your GP. It is quite common to become concerned about memory loss but, happily, such worries are usually unfounded. Your GP can refer you to a specialist who will help you determine whether your concerns have any basis. If you feel you have nothing interesting to offer others, you may be suffering from depression. Again, your GP can help. Overall, what you want to achieve is self-acceptance, rather than some arbitrary standard of social interaction. Which in any case, does not actually exist. Linda Blair Next week: Only the sex is stopping me ditching him I'm 20 and have been with my boyfriend, who is 21, for more than a year. However, for most of that time we have had little to talk about, few interests in common and I find him irritating. All this points to the obvious conclusion that I should finish the relationship, but when we have sex, I feel close to him again and the strong affection for him that this arouses makes me reluctant to leave. He likes me very much and is expressively content to be with me. He is clever, supportive and a good person with decent prospects - so he's quite a catch in that respect - but our relationship is not quite right and hasn't been for a while. He is my first boyfriend and I had my first sexual experience with him. However, I have cheated on him several times, always after having had a drink. I like knowing that there is someone thinking about me, who will give me physical affection when I want it, but is this a good enough reason to stay with someone? I did try to finish the relationship, but he didn't want us to split up, so we stayed together. I am still young, so part of me thinks there is no harm in staying with him, but I'm worried that I'm missing out on the chance to find someone else, although I'm now sceptical about ever finding \"the one \". I'm also terrified that I'll end up in an unhappy marriage. \u00b7 Private Lives appears every Thursday. You are invited to respond to this week's main problem.
