Those who like to mix professional sport with amateur jurisprudence will be disappointed to note Hamilton has accepted the verdict against him, but no doubt delighted that West Ham are fighting back. The next stop for the London club is, apparently, Lausanne, home of the Court of Arbitration for Sport to appeal against the Tevez ruling, although not before the wise heads at the CAS take care of other business, of which there appears to be plenty. The debate over the law and its place in sport is an old one and is, by and large, settled, with the consensus being that other than in the most exceptional - ie. self-evidently criminal - cases it is best if sport regulates itself. This is a sensible state of affairs although it has left some sports with a problem, especially in an era when there is so much at stake financially. It is against this backdrop that the dispute over Carlos Tevez's period as a West Ham player during the 2006-07 season and the impact (or otherwise) he had on Sheffield United's relegation from the Premier League came before an arbitration panel headed by Lord Griffiths, a specialist mediator in the world of insurance and commerce. He is also a former president of the MCC and former captain of the R&amp;A. There is no doubt Lord Griffiths is a distinguished lawyer, and also that he has an interest in sport, but it does not change the fact that he and his fellow panel members had no right to reach a decision based on this crucial assumption: \"We have no doubt that those [Tevez's] services were worth at least three points to West Ham over the season and were what made the difference between West Ham remaining in the Premier League and being relegated.\" How could they say this? On the basis of the evidence provided by the former Sheffield United manager Neil Warnock, who said yesterday: \"West Ham's lawyers used my book against us and picked out passages where I said a referee had cost us here, or a mistake there, but the tribunal obviously agreed with me when I said that Carlos Tevez had been instrumental\"? Or that of the man from the Daily Telegraph, who insisted Tevez's performance against Manchester United (he scored in a 1-0 victory) was the reason the London club stayed up yet in his report named goalkeeper Robert Green as man of the match? This isn't to say that either of these witnesses were wrong, only that they were no more able than Lord Griffiths to state with certainty that Tevez was worth more than three points to West Ham, and that he was therefore the reason the club avoided relegation. This conclusion might sit uncomfortably with Sheffield United fans, not least because their club is justified in arguing it was wronged - if not by West Ham, then certainly by the Premier League, which failed to impose a tougher penalty after its myriad obfuscations when asked to explain its dealings with those who owned the Argentinian's playing rights. It might also grate with those who view arbitration panels as a necessary buffer between sport and the law courts. Without Lord Griffiths and his ilk, the only place left for an aggrieved party is the Royal Courts of Justice, it could be argued. Such fears can be easily countered. The problem is not arbitration, but the failure of those who arbitrate to understand that in sport some things are unknowable or at least cannot be measured beyond the boundaries of speculation. The precise contribution of an individual to a club over the course of a football season is one of those things. Van Commenee shows an uncommon touch Charles van Commenee's appointment as the new head coach of UK Athletics has been universally welcomed. He is, by all accounts, smart, committed and tougher than a 50p sirloin. Apparently, he reduced Kelly Sotherton to tears after she won bronze at the 2004 Olympics, calling her a wimp for failing to win silver. I'm not sure this is much of a recommendation, but we will let it pass as long he continues to display the humanity shown when he was questioned about Dwain Chambers. \"He has served his sentence, he is more than welcome back in the team. Everybody who serves their sentence is welcome,\" he replied. Chambers was a drugs cheat but his treatment at the hands of the athletics establishment - and the law courts - is one of the great sporting hypocrisies. Most people believe the sprinter's best days are gone, but at least he will now have the chance to compete in a sport he is clearly devoted to. Wenger's secret cannot be put into words The most successful sports psychologist, and one of the most interesting characters, I have ever met is a Belgian fellow by the name Jos Vanstiphout, who has made a tremendous living tending to the needs of golf professionals, despite having no professional qualifications in the field of psychology, only the lessons learned from a varied life which has seen him sing lead vocals in a Belgian pop band and sell classified adverts for a newspaper company. Vanstiphout's list of clients includes some of the best, not least Ernie Els, who has relied heavily on his advice. Their record together speaks volumes, although it has never been able to extinguish my natural scepticism for sports psychology. There is even less chance of that happening now after the publication of the \"secret\" motivational document apparently circulated by Ars\u00e8ne Wenger to the Arsenal squad. Stick together, the document implores, along with other banalities, the majority of which you might pick up if you spent 10 minutes watching the Oprah Winfrey Show; display a positive attitude, always want more, and so forth. If Wenger believes these personal affirmations are essential to the development of a top-class player then who are we to doubt him, although his document does appear to have omitted a rather more essential requirement for those who want to succeed at the Emirates: be very, very good at football. What did Triggs do to end up in the doghouse? Those who haven't noticed before that Roy Keane is not an especially sentimental man may have heard that the Sunderland manager has got a new dog. \"A German shepherd,\" he announced proudly. But what of Triggs, the labrador who was Keane's faithful companion during the turbulent years at Old Trafford? \"I'm taking the lead role, as you'd expect, the German shepherd has taken over and he's second in charge. Poor old Triggs is at the back,\" Keane revealed. Poor old Triggs indeed. Now he is no longer top dog in the Keane household, maybe there is a lower division manager out there who would sign him on a flea transfer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
