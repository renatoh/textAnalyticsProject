Yesterday, Sven-Goran Eriksson stressed the need to appoint a senior coach to assist him before the team returns to action in February. However, he feels compelled to adopt a new policy and will not select a club manager again. The vacancy arises because Steve McClaren has decided to devote himself solely to Middlesbrough, a similar decision to the one previously taken by Peter Taylor, who was then with Leicester City. \"We lost Peter and Steve for more or less the same reason,\" Eriksson said. \"It was too difficult to concentrate on both jobs. If I take someone who is working with a club, I don't think it can be a manager. You have to take a coach, because a manager has a lot of other problems and even when the players are not there he has commitments.\" If he turns to the club scene, Brian Kidd, of Leeds United, would come into consideration because he has worked with the England squad in the past. The well-regarded Sammy Lee, at Liverpool, would also receive consideration and has experience of the current international set-up. Eriksson is not, however, ruling out a full-time appoint ment. Conjecture continues that Stuart Baxter, the Scot in charge of the England Under-19 team, is a leading candidate. By the same measure, David Platt, who is in charge of the Under-21 team, will also be scrutinised. The sense of order was firmer before the resignation of Adam Crozier as chief executive of the FA two weeks ago. He had originally intended to create an obvious line of succession. \"I guess he had some thoughts about that when he took me into this job,\" Eriksson said. Now, however, the Swede will appoint someone who may never possess the stature to replace him. He promises consulation with virtually everyone, including the England players, but also states that he already has \"names from all over\" in mind. Although he would not be specific, Eriksson has ruled out assuming the extra duties himself. \"I have learned since I came to England that when you don't do the tactical work every day you can observe much better while standing off the pitch,\" he said. \"It's an English idea because normally when you are in Italy or some other country you go out doing the coaching as well.\" He is hardly a man for tantrums, but the numerous alterations at the FA have left him bemused. He signalled as much, remarking wryly that he would talk to the technical director \"if we have one\". There has yet to be a long-term replacement for Howard Wilkinson, who decamped to Sunderland last month. When not reviewing the time-consuming topic of lost staff, Eriksson's attention was drawn to Steven Gerrard's lost form. \"I was surprised by G\u00e9rard Houllier's comments,\" he said of the Liverpool manager's scathing criticisms of the midfielder. \"I am sure he thought a lot about it and did it to achieve something.\" Eriksson may talk to Gerrard if he judges the episode has affected him, but the 22-year-old had already told the head coach, at the time of the matches with Slovakia and Macedonia, that he was \"playing bad football\". Neither that nor the future of David Seaman, the veteran goalkeeper, exercised Eriksson much, since there is no England game until February, when the friendly with Australia precedes Euro 2004 qualifiers against Liechtenstein and Turkey. This week's pampering and socialising, with wives and partners invited, continues until tomorrow and Eriksson presents it as a morale-building exercise. There will be some training and a presumably doleful viewing of a video of the draw with Macedonia. The Swede also proposes to discuss events at the FA with his players, although he assumes they do not care about them. The squad's audience at Buckingham Palace this evening might give him a chance of a conversation with someone who might be interested in the departure of his ally Crozier. Apparently, the Queen takes a keen interest in the \"dark forces\" at work in the land."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
