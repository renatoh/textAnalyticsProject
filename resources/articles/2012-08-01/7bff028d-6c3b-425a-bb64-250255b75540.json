Facial hair? Testicles? Being part of the group that invented both concentration camps and drum solos? Thanks, but no thanks. Sure, women comprise 70% of the world's poor and two-thirds of its illiterates. Granted, the pay gap here in the UK isn't set to close for another hundred years. But apart from tiny details like those, being a lady is a pretty sweet deal. Anyway, this is a fashion column, right? Let's keep it light! Like us girls at our most valid. There is one thing I have always envied about the opposite sex, however. It's a particular aesthetic that is prevalent \u2013 dominant, even \u2013 in men's fashion, but that are rare in women's: quietly clever clothes. Clothes like Whistles, Sessun, Preen, By Malene Birger; clothes that are stylish but not trendy, understated but not too serious, with an accent on craftsmanship. In short: fashion that is thoughtfully created, chosen and worn. Men have their pick of labels meeting these criteria, but the best of the bunch is Folk, founded in 2001 by designer Cathal McAteer. The clothes are beautifully made and full of subtle, clever touches that please the wearer every time (I couldn't help wondering whether it was Folk's attention to the tiniest details that led the wardrobe department on Sherlock to choose so much of it for Martin Freeman's Dr Watson). My other half is a fan of the brand and, coveting his purchases, I have long bemoaned the lack of a women's equivalent. No more \u2013 Folk women has just launched. The debut collection has the easy luxury of the men's line, but is even more fun. There's a canvas-cotton tux jacket in navy, a midnight-blue slouchy silk evening dress with built-in bracelets, a red drawstring waist dress, inventive knits, covetable coats and lovely shoes you can actually live your life in. This is forever fashion, so doesn't come cheap, but when so much womenswear is vapid \u2013 either ornamental or judgmental (created to \"show off\" our \"good bits\" or cover up the \"bad\") it's a refreshing alternative. I don't want to shout too much, since McAteer describes Folk as \"a quiet brand\u2026 inspired by arts, crafts and beautiful materials\", but I can't help thinking it's time women were offered the option of wearing something that reflects what we think, or just the fact that we do. There's nothing quite so ugly as stupidity, after all."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
