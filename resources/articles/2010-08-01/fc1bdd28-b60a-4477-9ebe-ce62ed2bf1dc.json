The Great Defender Michael Mansfield has had to apologise to one of his own former clients and rewrite his autobiography after mistaking the man for someone else. Apologies from top barristers, not normally given to human fault, are rare enough to be treasured, and Mansfield \u2013 who is not universally revered at the bar or necessarily held at his own estimation \u2013 has had to issue a ripe one. He referred in his Memoirs of a Radical Lawyer to defending one John Bowden, accused of the Camberwell murders, \"a series of particularly grotesque and gruesome killings [involving] carving up homosexuals and winos\". Bowden was a \"south Wales lad turned bad by drink and unemployment\". Unfortunately Bowden was convicted the previous year of a single murder, nothing to do with Camberwell. Even murderers have feelings. There's been a prolonged correspondence. Oh dear: Mansfield says the \"entirely unintentional, mistaken recollection ... will be corrected\". He's also had to write to the parole board to tell them of his mistake. You may be able to hear a small cheer from former witnesses whose claims of forgetfulness the great man usually excoriates. \u2712A vehement spat in which no love is lost rumbles on following the appearance of the Islamophobic English Defence League alongside members of the Zionist Foundation supporting the state of Israel at recent demonstrations. Tony Greenstein, an activist supporter of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign, accuses Jonathan Hoffman, co-chair of the ZF, of having strange bedfellows in the EDL, some of whom enjoy making Sieg Heil salutes and have links to the BNP. The two groups were apparently present at a demo supporting Israel following the Gaza flotilla imbroglio, and turned up again last Saturday outside the Ahava beauty store in Covent Garden, to counter a demo by those opposed to trade with Israel. Hoffman is outraged at the slur on his impeccable record of opposing the BNP, but he does admit the EDL do turn up to ZF protests. \"There is no link between us,\" he says. \"We live in a free country, we can't control who demonstrates on the streets. People on the left think nothing of demonstrating with people who support Hamas and other terrorist groups. Greenstein is just mischief-making.\" But he has asked the police if they can provide a separate pen for EDL supporters in future. \u2712Poop, poop! Make way for cost-cutting communities secretary Eric Pickles in his new chauffeur-driven \u00a370,000 Jaguar XJ, replacing the \u00a320,000 hybrid Toyota Prius that was good enough for his predecessor, John Denham. An online campaign has started to repossess the car, sell it in a public auction and use the proceeds to fund community groups suffering from Pickles's cuts. Only eight signatories so far, but it's early days. \u2712Reassuring to know after the conditions imposed for Tony Blair's book signing next month that Profile Books, publisher of Decline and Fall, the second instalment of former Labour MP Chris Mullin's diaries, have issued a statement advising that \u2013 unlike Blair \u2013 Mullin will not be banning cameras, issuing wristbands to those queuing to meet him, refusing to sign dedications or limiting customers to two copies each. Nor are there plans for a deluxe \"Bible\" edition with complementary bookmark for use in faith centres, the Mullin Foundation of Neasden states. After the well-merited and widespread praise for the first part of Mullin's diaries last year, it's perfectly possible that he will outsell the Dear (former) Leader as well. \u2712Here's Nick Clegg's most recent tweet, dated 11 June: \"Good luck to England in the World Cup\". Wonder what he's doing these days? \u2712Spotted, by a Guardian spy on board an easyJet flight to M\u00e1laga: Princess Beatrice. Things must be getting tight at home. When do you think her dad, Prince Andrew, will start flying by budget airline and save the taxpayer some money?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
