In a statement, Thanet district council, which owns the port of Ramsgate, said it had temporarily halted live animal exports with immediate effect after the dramatic events on Wednesday. The council, which has made no secret of its desire to see the trade disappear from its port, said that, while the suspension was temporary, \"its lifting will depend on the construction of suitable facilities\". It added: \"Providing the facilities will depend on the cost of building and running such a facility, and also whether it is a priority of the council in comparison with other issues.\" Ian Driver, a councillor and campaigner against live exports, said: \"I would say the animal exporters shouldn't hold their breath. The council has much more important priorities than supporting a barbaric trade.\" Ever since May 2011, when a former Soviet tank carrier by the name of Joline moved its trade along the south coast from Dover to Ramsgate, dozens of protesters have turned out every week to call for an end to the trade, which they say is unnecessarily cruel. The RSPCA has kept up the pressure as well, carrying out lorry inspections along with officials from the government's animal health agency to check animals were being carried on their journeys in acceptable welfare conditions. But it was the debacle of Wednesday which prompted the council to move on the issue, as sheep from a lorry stopped at the port had to be shot on the advice of the RSPCA, The organisation's chief executive Gavin Grant met government ministers on Thursday morning to press for a ban. According to the RSPCA, 41 sheep from the lorry had to be shot due to severe lameness, two were put to sleep due to injuries, and two others were accidentally drowned during the unloading process. The lorry carrying the animals was stopped on Wednesday morning and declared unfit to travel due to faults in the vehicle. The RSPCA said the lorry had also been declared unfit to travel last month. Council leader Clive Hart said: \"Thanet district council recognises that live exports are a lawful trade, but we are also conscious of our responsibilities regarding the welfare of animals passing through our port. We are saddened to see animals arrive at our port in this condition and it underlines the need to implement EU regulations strictly in order to avoid any suffering caused to the animals.\" The council had previously sought legal advice over the exports, but was told it was obliged to act as a \"free port\" under the 1847 Harbours Act. Philip Lymbery of the charity Compassion in World Farming hailed the move, adding: \"We now look to Defra to finish it off, once and for all. We call on Defra to take permanent action to stop the live animal export trade reopening, in Ramsgate or anywhere else.\" The government says it is also opposed to the export of live creatures and would prefer to see animals slaughtered as close to where they are reared as possible, but cannot impose a nationwide ban on the trade due to EU legislation. Campaigners warn that, without a blanket ban, the trade could move elsewhere in Britain."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
