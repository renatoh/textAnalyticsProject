That gives Mascherano enough time to get booked for a nasty lunging tackle. A minute later, the game is done and the Super Cup is theirs. 90 min: We\u2019ll have three minutes of added time. Barcelona look less than thrilled. Suarez feels his leg again. Let\u2019s hope they don\u2019t lose Neymar and Suarez (although if there\u2019s one man who can play up front on his own...) 88 min: Good news: Suarez is no longer injured. Bad news: he just got booked. 85 min: More good news for Barcelona, Suarez pulls up with what looks like a strain. He stays on the pitch for now though - Barca have used all their subs. 83 min: Deulofeu runs at Sergio Ramos and panics him very slightly. It\u2019s enough to win a corner. A corner that Barcelona waste. 80 min: Real trot up and win a corner. To celebrate they take off Kroos for Ceballos. 76 min: Barcelona have dominated the last 10 minutes: but Real Madrid have let them dominate, happy to rest up on their comfy four-goal cushion. Suarez goes down in a heap. It\u2019s safe to say the Real Madrid fans are not sympathetic. Alba comes off for Digne. 73 min: Mascherano clips Benzema on the heel and the Frenchman hobbles around for a bit. He should be OK to continue though. Messi then sends the ball over the bar. Theo comes on for Asensio. 70 min: Suarez hits the post! Messi\u2019s shot from distance is saved by Navas, and the ball rebounds to an unmarked Suarez, whose header smacks the foot of the post. \u201cI\u2019m guessing Paul Fitzgerald (48 minutes) didn\u2019t watch much of last season,\u201d writes Lee Purchase. \u201cRonaldo scored 10 goals in the quarters, semis and final of the Champions League; against such teams you won\u2019t always have it as easy as this and he\u2019s the ultimate big-game player (and averages over a goal-a-game). Laughable how people say Ronaldo makes Madrid worse, no matter how slick they look tonight.\u201d 68 min: Real are Barcelona-ing Barcelona at the moment, keeping possession as their rivals chase the ball. 65 min: Alba slides a ball across goal but Sergio Roberto is a metre or so from connecting and pulling one back for Barcelona. Real have reduced their intensity a little. 62 min: Casemiro comes on for Kovacic. 60 min: The sub Semedo\u2019s cross is met by a glancing header from Suarez but he can\u2019t direct it past the excellent Navas. Semedo is busy at the other end of the pitch a minute later, scrambling the ball clear. 58 min: A replay off Benzema\u2019s shot earlier shows Ter Stegen didn\u2019t know much about his save: it ricocheted off his shoulder. Messi has come into the game a little more in the last 10 minutes. 55 min: I missed a sub earlier: Pique came off for Semedo. Looks like he had an injury. Back on the pitch Benzema thrashes a shot that Ter Stegen gets in the way of. 52 min: Benzema gallops forward but is stopped by Mascherano. Barcelona aren\u2019t really looking like they\u2019re scoring four goals anytime soo... and Messi hits the bar. He wanders into the box and thrashes the ball on to the underside of the bar but it bounces out to safety. That sums up Barcelona\u2019s night so far. 48 min: Suarez is in the box and pulls the back across goal. Navas is excellent again too get to the ball and smother it. \u201cSpare a thought for the fallen,\u201d says Paul Fitzgerald. \u201cPoor Ronny must be wondering what many Real fans have suspected in the last year or two; that this team not only probably don\u2019t need him but that they might also be better without him.\u201d 46 min: Barcelona come out in their revolutionary 4-0-2 formation. They had one (1) shot on goal in the first half. Maybe they can make manage two in the next 45 minutes. Who knows? Joseph Lam does raise a very good point: Real were excellent rather than Barcelona being abject in the first 45 minutes. You shudder to think what they\u2019d do to Arsenal or Liverpool\u2019s defence. Joseph Lam weighs in on Valverde: \u201cWe should probably cut Sr Valverde some slack here. He hasn\u2019t exactly been helped by the dithering of Barcelona\u2019s board in recent summers, not just the last. Forget Neymar or Verratti, a player like Thiago (!) would have brought some stability to this side. Turan, Gomes and Paulinho don\u2019t exactly strike you as heirs to Xavi and Iniesta, so it\u2019s no wonder that Kroos and Modric are walking over Barcelona\u2019s midfield. \u201cAlso, it\u2019s no good scouting out good talents if you don\u2019t develop them. You\u2019ve go to credit Zidane for giving game time and guidance to players like Casemiro, Nacho and Vazquez (I exclude Asensio, because that kid is truly something special), who could easily have been lost in the swamp of players at Barcelona. That has been the fate of players like Douglas and Digne; that is also how they lost Thiago. \u201cLet\u2019s also not forget that this is quite possibly the best Real Madrid side ever (apart from that 1950s/60s one perhaps). They could conceivably steamroller any side in Europe at the moment. The scariest thing about the game so far is that they\u2019re crushing one of the top sides in the world (let\u2019s be honest, in spite of all this criticism, Barcelona would probably still beat any team in the EPL) without a certain someone.\u201d Half-time emails: \u201cThis could be the magical Spanish 5-0 if Barcelona are not careful,\u201d writes Ruth Purdue. \u201cThey are being battered. Can you explain to me where the midfield is? Or what Suarez is doing?\u201d I actually think Suarez has been one of their better players: he at least appears to have some kind of plan. As for the midfield, it doesn\u2019t exist as of present. Real have strolled past Mascherano and Busquets. Kelvin is high on Modric. \u201cIt is amazing to see Barca being played off the pitch. Modric is some player, isn\u2019t he? And to think he was voted the worst signing of the season in his first season at Real. Shows you how much the fans know.\u201d Half-time: The ref takes pity on Barcelona and whistles exactly on 45 minutes. Lionel Messi does not look happy. 43 min: I\u2019ve counted at least three examples of showboating so far from Real that would count as excessive against a pub team. They\u2019re out to humiliate their opponents as well as beat them. 41 min: Here\u2019s Peter Van: \u201cIn response to Jo Ashdown (27 min): yes, it is too early to talk about firing Valverde. Two games, come on! But Jo is on to something. This IS the most dreadful Barca team I can remember. Instead of blaming Valverde, I\u2019d blame whoever is in charge of hiring their scouting. Why have Madrid discovered brilliant players such as Vasquez or Asensio while Barcelona can only come up with Andre Gomes/Umtiti mediocrities?\u201d Yep, that was coming. Barcelona have been powerless to stop Real going forward. Marcelo crosses and Benzema peels away from Umtiti. The Frenchman then crashes a shot into the corner. This could get ugly for Barca. Or should I say uglier. 36 min: Modric spins round and fires off a pass mainly because he can. Having said that, it goes straight to a Barcelona player. But Real have won this, so why not humiliate your opponents while you can? 33 min: Vazquez again! He\u2019s free in the area and curls his shot past Ter Stegen but it smacks off the post and to safety. 31 min: A lovely first touch from Vazquez to control a long pass from Marcelo and he bears down on goal like a slightly less good Gareth Bale. He finds Kroos but the shot is awful. A few seconds later Vazquez is at it again, forcing a corner with a tricky cross that Benzema just fails to connect with. 27 min: The knives are out for Valverde already. Here\u2019s Jo Ashdown: \u201cIs it too early to call for Ernesto Valverde\u2019s resignation? True, he inherited a decaying team, got no real reinforcements and lost arguably his best player. But you have to go back to the pre-Guardiola era to see such a listless, aimless Barcelona. I\u2019d say these supercup performances are even worse than those tonkings at PSG and Juventus last season. Am I being too unfair to suggest Sr Valverde is in over his head\u201d You\u2019re being unfair, Jo. Give him another 48 minutes at least. If Barcelona haven\u2019t scored by then, he has to go. 24 min: Asensio has another chance to score after Benzema holds up the ball well. But his shot is deflected out for a corner. Which ends a pretty good run: 21 min: Real surge forward and Marcelo sends a cross-shot across goal that beats Ter Stegen. There\u2019s no one to tap it home, but it almost goes in anyway, just missing the far post. 19 min: Real Madrid are sickening: not only are they brilliant going forward, Navas has also been great in goal. No great saves yet but he\u2019s been out quickly to snuff out any chances created by Barcelona. 17 min: Of course, no sooner do I say Messi has been quiet than he slaloms his way past a few players and nearly scores. It takes a quick reaction from Navas to stop him: the keeper rushes out and gets the ball away. 15 min: Barcelona are getting back into this game - in that they\u2019re not all pressed back on their own goalline anymore - Gomes chests the ball down and starts to spin round to shoot. But the whistle goes for handball. Messi has been very quiet. 12 min: Marcelo indulges in some ridiculous trickery down the left but his cross fails to find a team-mate. Then at the other end, Suarez slides the ball back across goal - an empty goal too after Navas rushed out - but there\u2019s no support. 9 min: Real continue to press. The positives for Barcelona are that they have plenty of time to come back and ... that\u2019s it. They do have an attack of sorts but it peters out without a shot on target. 7 min: Maybe PSG should have bought Asensio instead of Neymar: he would have been a lot cheaper. If Real go on to win this game with ease, it will leave Barcelona feeling pretty flat going into a new season without You Know Who. It\u2019s all Real early on. Benzema scampers out to the wing to deliver a cross, which is blocked. It\u2019s Real who look like the team chasing the lead so far. And there they go! It\u2019s a fantastic strike from Asensio, whose dipping, curling shot from distance gives Ter Stegen no chance. 3 min: Barcelona only have to score three goals tonight to win. And, of course, that opens them up to Real counter-attacks: and Madrid have one early on. Modric picks up a cross but his shot is deflected to safety for Barca. 1 min: And we\u2019re off. Barcelona get us started in front of a full-house of 78,000. \u201cLike Trump, did Ronaldo also claim that both sides were to blame for his shove on the referee?\u201d asks Peter Oh. They do have similarities: the weird tan, the magnificently rippled torso, the attention to their hair, the weird obsession with a rival for power. Ronaldo is way less likely to cause a nuclear war, mind. We have some warm-ups. Gareth Bale, by the way, starts the game on the bench. Asensio and Vazquez will be your Madrid wide men this evening. Real will, of course, be without Ronaldo tonight after he got a little pushy with a referee in the first-leg and was banned for five games. Ronaldo, like Donald Trump, doesn\u2019t know when to keep his mouth shut and is VERY unhappy about the whole situation. Unlike the president though, he doesn\u2019t believe there is blame on both sides. Although to his credit, Ronaldo is not an apologist for Neo Nazis. Here he is on his ban: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to stay quiet in this situation, five matches! To me it seems exaggerated and ridiculous, this is what you call persecution! Thanks to my team-mates and to the fans for the support.\u201d Your teams tonight, courtesy of footballing minnows Barcelona FC (they have their own Twitter account! Whatever next?): Tom will be here shortly. In the meantime, why not find out what Cristiano Ronaldo is unhappy about: Cristiano Ronaldo has called his five-match ban for pushing a referee \u201cexaggerated and ridiculous\u201d and claims he is being persecuted after failing to have the sanction overturned on appeal. During Sunday night\u2019s Spanish Super Cup 3-1 first-leg victory over Barcelona, in which he had scored, Real Madrid forward Ronaldo reacted badly after being shown a second yellow for diving by match official Ricardo de Burgos Bengoetxea, shoving the referee in the back. A Spanish football federation (RFEF) committee has now dismissed an appeal, meaning Ronaldo will miss Wednesday evening\u2019s Supercopa return leg against Bar\u00e7a and upcoming La Liga games against Deportivo La Coru\u00f1a, Valencia, Levante and Real Sociedad. Ronaldo reacted angrily on social media, writing in an Instagram post on his official page: \u201cIt\u2019s impossible to stay quiet in this situation, five matches! To me it seems exaggerated and ridiculous, this is what you call persecution!
