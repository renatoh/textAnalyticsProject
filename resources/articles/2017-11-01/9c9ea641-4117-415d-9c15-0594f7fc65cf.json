The Brazilian\u2019s replacement, the Danish youngster Andreas Christensen, performed impressively as Chelsea moved to within a point of United, albeit still nine from Manchester City at the top. The 17-year-old midfielder Ethan Ampadu, who has yet to feature in the top flight, had been included instead among the substitutes. Asked afterwards whether David Luiz had a future at the club, Conte said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. He has to work really hard, otherwise they are on the bench or in the stand.\u201d The Italian was subsequently asked to clarify those comments, and added: \u201cIt\u2019s very simple, no? Very simple. The coach has to make the best decision for the team and tonight the best decision for the team was to play with Christensen and to have, on the bench, [Ethan] Ampadu. Another young player. A really good player for the present and the future. \u201cMaybe in the future I can decide a different way or continue in this way. That\u2019s normal. I must take the best decision for the club, not for a single player. It\u2019s only a tactical decision. It\u2019s normal. This can happen to every one of my players, if I see they are not in good form. It\u2019s normal. I repeat: I have to put my face to every situation and then sometimes to make important decisions. Today I did this and I think Christensen played a massive game. I was very happy for this.\u201d David Luiz\u2019s omission came only a few weeks after Conte had described him as his best defender at the club. \u201cBut it can change, it can change,\u201d he said, with the Brazilian having been omitted from the final training session before United\u2019s visit. He had clashed with Conte over his early substitution during the Champions League home game with Roma last month. The Brazilian must now prove he warrants inclusion in the side that travels to West Bromwich Albion after the international break by impressing in training over the next fortnight. The Italian praised his team for playing \u201cwith great energy, with great passion, with great enthusiasm\u201d to record a third successive Premier League win and erase some of the painful memories of the midweek capitulation in Rome. There was disappointment for his opposite number, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, on his latest fruitless return to Stamford Bridge, with the Portuguese left to contemplate falling further behind in the title race. . \u201cWe are worried [about the gap] but there are 18 teams more worried than us because we are second,\u201d he said. \u201cEight points, in the Premier League, is not the same as eight points in the Portuguese league, La Liga, the Bundesliga. Here, there\u2019s still a lot to play [for]. I hope, I feel, I think, I wish that in the busy period of late November, December, beginning of January, I think probably we are going to be at our maximum strength with Paul Pogba, Marcos Rojo and Zlatan Ibrahimovic back. So, probably, we can be on a high.\u201d The United manager had waited to shake hands with Conte near the mouth of the tunnel after the match, only for the Italian to celebrate instead on the pitch with his victorious players. \u201cYou want me to go and chase him in the middle of the pitch?\u201d added Mourinho. \u201cI was there. I shook hands with the people who were there. I think one of them was his brother, the assistant, so I feel that by shaking the hands of his brother and the other assistants that I did my duty. I cannot go and run to chase him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
