In New Hampshire, frontrunner Donald Trump questioned what the US gained from the deal, in which four American-Iranian dual-nationals were released and seven Iranians held on sanctions violations were released or pardoned. \u201cThey\u2019re getting seven people, so essentially they get $150bn plus seven, and we get four,\u201d the billionaire said. \u201cI\u2019m happy they\u2019re coming back, but I will tell you it\u2019s a disgrace they\u2019ve been there so long,\u201d he continued. Senator Rand Paul, who opposed the deal in Congress, took a measured tone in an interview with the Guardian, calling the release \u201ca hopeful sign about the agreement\u201d and \u201ca sign that we need to continue to try to see if negotiations will work\u201d. A US official confirmed to the Guardian that Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian, pastor Saeed Abedini, Nosratollah Khosrawi-Roodsari and marine veteran Amir Hekmati were released. In exchange, the US offered clemency to seven Iranians facing trial or convictions, the official said. A US official told Reuters Iran released a fifth captive, student Matthew Trevithick, separately. Paul called Abedini, who has been held since September 2012, \u201can incredibly brave man to believe so strongly in Christianity, willing to risk imprisonment for it\u201d. Texas senator Ted Cruz also celebrated the release of Abedini on Twitter, saying: \u201cPraise God! Surely bad parts of Obama\u2019s latest deal, but prayers of thanksgiving that Pastor Saeed is coming home.\u201d The releases coincide with the lifting of economic sanctions and the unfreezing of some $100bn in assets under the terms of the nuclear deal negotiated between Iran and several nations, including the US, in July 2015. The deal passed its final hurdles in the US Congress in September despite steady Republican opposition. In exchange for Iran dismantling much of its nuclear infrastructure, the agreement lifts crippling economic sanctions on the oil-rich nation. Senator Marco Rubio, answering questions after a town hall event in Iowa on Saturday, said so-called prisoner \u201cswaps\u201d had \u201ccreated an incentive\u201d for governments around the world to take hostages. \u201cGovernments are taking Americans hostage because they believe they can gain concessions from this government under Barack Obama,\u201d Rubio said. New Jersey governor Chris Christie, also in Iowa, echoed Rubio\u2019s concerns. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to swap prisoners,\u201d he said. \u201cThese folks were taken illegally in violation of international law and they should have been released without condition. But you know, the Iranians have treated this president with disrespect for years and he continues to take it.\u201d \u201cRemember the last time we had Iranian hostages,\u201d Christie added in a statement, referring to the 1979 hostage crisis. \u201cAs soon as Ronald Reagan took the oath of office those Iranians returned our citizens immediately because they knew if they didn\u2019t they would have to face the strength of character and the wrath of Ronald Reagan.\u201d Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson said he was \u201cvery pleased\u201d by the release and \u201coverjoyed for the families and friends\u201d of the former prisoners. Carson did not comment on the prisoner deal, but did condemn the \u201cdisastrous\u201d agreement on Iran\u2019s nuclear program. \u201cThe fact remains that President Obama\u2019s nuclear agreement with Iran is fatally flawed and gravely jeopardizes the national security interests of the American people,\u201d he said in a statement. Rezaian, who had been serving as the Tehran bureau chief for the Washington Post, was taken into custody by Iranian officials in July 2014. In October 2015, an Iranian court convicted him of several crimes, including espionage and \u201cpropaganda against the establishment\u201d, in a closed-door proceeding widely criticised by the US government and press freedom organizations. Rezaian, born in California, is a dual citizen of the US and Iran, although Iran does not recognize dual nationality for its citizens and treated Rezaian as an Iranian. Mike Huckabee, the former Arkansas governor who is hovering near the bottom of the polls, released a statement that asked why it took the US so long to secure the prisoners\u2019 release. He also compared sanctions relief for Iran to \u201cwriting a $150bn check to Adolf Hitler before WWII hoping he\u2019ll behave\u201d. Huckabee added praise for Abedini: \u201cWell done Saeed! You are a faithful servant! And welcome home!\u201d Democratic presidential candidate Senator Bernie Sanders also addressed the release in a statement, saying: \u201cThis good news shows that diplomacy can work even in this volatile region of the world.\u201d In a statement, Hillary Clinton \u2013 the Democratic frontrunner and a former secretary of state \u2013 said: \u201cI am greatly relieved by the safe return of American prisoners from Iran. Their families and our country have waited and prayed for this day to come.\u201d Clinton added that the nuclear deal with Iran was \u201can important achievement of diplomacy backed by pressure\u201d, and said: \u201cThese are important steps that make the United States, our allies and the entire world safer. I congratulate President Obama and his team, and I\u2019m proud of the role I played to get this process started.\u201d Clinton also noted that \u201canother American, Bob Levinson, still isn\u2019t home with his family\u201d and said \u201cthe treatment of our navy sailors earlier this week was offensive\u201d. \u201cIran is still violating UN security council resolutions with its ballistic missile program,\u201d she added, \u201cwhich should be met with new sanctions designations and firm resolve.\u201d Additional reporting by Ben Jacobs, Sabrina Siddiqui and Alan Yuhas"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
