My parents never tried to influence me. They just let me decide for myself and Bosnia was just inside my heart. All the Bosnia players are like this. Miralem Pjanic was brought up in Luxembourg and played football in France but he always wanted to play for Bosnia. The people have a strong mentality.\u201d Besic ought to be up against one of his compatriots in Edin Dzeko at the Etihad on Saturday evening, except that the Manchester City striker has been out of the team through injury just at the time when the Everton player has been handed a run of first-team games through the unavailability of James McCarthy. \u201cI have never played against Edin and it looks like I might not get the opportunity this time,\u201d he says. \u201cHe helped me make up my mind about coming to England but, even though he is only in Manchester, I haven\u2019t managed to see him since. He told me I would probably do well in England but I would have to be patient. He said it is the best league in the world but I might not get first-team chances right away. Now I am here I can see what he means. \u201cI always fancied a move to England. I like the style of play but I don\u2019t believe I have produced anything like my best yet, only around 50% so far. In this league I am prepared to be patient, though. I have come from a smaller league to a team where players have played over 200 Premier League games so I have to wait for my chance. But I do feel I am getting better. I am getting used to the pace of the game as well as getting stronger through gym work. \u201cWhen I came to England I could see that I was a little bit skinny compared to others, so I am trying to build up weight and strength. I think it might be next season before I am really at my best.\u201d The \u201csmaller league\u201d to which Besic refers was not in Germany but in Hungary. He has not always been as patient as he now seems, or as philosophical about not getting a game every week, and his time at Hamburg came to an abrupt end when he went to see the manager about not being picked. Besic is keen to play down suggestions that Torsten Fink grabbed him by the throat and threw him out of the dressing room, which was how some German newspapers reported the incident, but the upshot was more or less the same. The player\u2019s Hamburg career was over. \u201cHe didn\u2019t grab me. It was just a conversation but a fairly final one,\u201d he says. \u201cI was not happy about not playing. I could have stayed but I wanted to go. I went to see the manager about not getting selected and said if he didn\u2019t like me I would go. That is all. It wasn\u2019t like it was described in the papers.\u201d To achieve his goal of playing every week Besic decided he would need to drop a level or two \u2013 \u201cSometimes you have to take a step back to move forwards\u201d \u2013 which is how he ended up at Ferencvaros. \u201cI was confident in my ability but for my development I needed to be playing every week,\u201d he says. Moving to Hungary worked for him because he gained World Cup selection, even though he had been playing as a central defender for Ferencvaros and Bosnia used him as a No6, the defensive midfield role he currently occupies. \u201cWhen I first started out, aged eight, I was a No10,\u201d Besic recalls. \u201cBut when I was 16 coaches started putting me further back down the field because they could see I was aggressive. I enjoy tackling. I like the physical side of the game. I was a centre-back for five or six years. The World Cup was the first time I played as a No6.\u201d It was the World Cup, nonetheless, that got Besic noticed. Roberto Mart\u00ednez says he had been tipped off about Besic while the player was still at Hamburg but first studied him properly playing for Bosnia against Argentina. \u201cHe marked Messi out of the game in the first half,\u201d the Everton manager says. \u201cHe is a young man with incredible potential but he has been playing in different positions in different leagues. He needs to have one position and work on that.\u201d That is Besic\u2019s intention, too, and he cites Mart\u00ednez\u2019s enthusiasm as the main reason he chose Everton. He had other offers after the World Cup, including interest from Swansea. \u201cI knew literally nothing about Everton but after speaking with the manager I decided this was the club I wanted to join,\u201d he says. \u201cI think I might have been playing for Basel now without the World Cup. I had been talking to them before going to Brazil, but after the tournament there was suddenly interest from England, Spain and Italy.\u201d Besic did not have the most comfortable of Goodison debuts, not only losing 6-3 to a rampant Chelsea but also being directly responsible for the final goal with an ill-advised backheel in his own half. \u201cMistakes can happen in football, all you can do is try to correct them,\u201d he says. \u201cI hadn\u2019t given a goal away for two years, then on my first time in England I lose the ball and Chelsea score. I made a mistake against Tottenham, too, because I thought I could head the ball back to the goalkeeper, but I know I must not let it affect my confidence. The manager has said nothing about either mistake. He just wants me to carry on training and learning.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
