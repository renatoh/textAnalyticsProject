Moffett's resignation caught the sports minister Richard Caborn and other administrators by surprise and follows an intense few months for the head of Sport England. According to some sources Moffett, who was headhunted for the post from Australia, has been suffering from depression and been unable to acclimatise to life in England. Moffett announced his decision to step down yesterday afternoon. He said he had decided to go in six months' time because he felt by then he would have completed his work reorganising Sport England. Moffett had extensive experience of sports administration in Australia, lastly as chief executive of the National Rugby League, and was seen as the ideal candidate to lead Sport England into a new era of financial accountability following problems over Wembley and the building of a national athletics stadium. However, there is bound to be speculation that Moffett was unhappy with Sport England's future level of government funding and that other issues soured relations with Westminster. His decision comes at a difficult time for the organisation, formerly the Sports Council, after Trevor Brooking stepped down as chairman last week without a successor appointed. Sport England said yesterday that by the time he leaves in the spring Moffett will have finished his restructuring work. Moffett said: \"Ninety-five per cent of my job will have been completed by the time we move into our HQ in the spring. I have put in the place a modernised sporting body ready to lead the sporting future of this nation. I have and will continue to enjoy my time at Sport England but an agent of change only has a certain shelf life. \"Some time ago I decided that I had the right management team and structures in place and that next year would be the time to hand over the reins. I am supremely confident that the majority of tasks required to deliver a new Sport England will have been achieved by next March.\" Caborn and his superior Tessa Jowell said in a joint statement: \"The news came as a great surprise. David has led Sport England extremely effectively since his appointment and has played a major role in refocusing the organisation to meet the needs of the sporting community in the future. David's help, support and advice has been of great benefit to us since his arrival. His enthusiasm and can-do mentality will be missed.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
