Finland-based LK Products makes antennas for mobile phones and counts Nokia among its major customers. Last year it had sales of \u00a350m, down 17% year on year and profit dipped to \u00a33.6m from \u00a311.2m. Yorkshire-based Filtronic plans to use the cash raised to pay off its \u00a344m worth of long-term debt, in a move that will wipe out extensive annual repayments and free up cash to invest in the underlying business. Filtronic will earn further cash depending on the performance of the business. Technitrol will pay Filtronic \u20ac1 for every \u20ac1 of revenue LK Products makes over \u20ac85m in the year to the end of May, 2006."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
