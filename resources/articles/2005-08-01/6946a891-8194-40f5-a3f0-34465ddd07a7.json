Murdoch announced last week that a 'poison pill' arrangement designed to prevent rival Liberty Media from increasing its 18 per cent stake in the group will be extended by two years. Analysts described the move as a 'slap in the face for corporate governance'. Now America's most powerful corporate governance consultant, Institutional Shareholder Services, has come out strongly against the plan. A spokesman for ISS, whose clients include America's most powerful investors, told The Observer: 'It is definitely not best practice. It's not a good thing for shareholders. Unless the pill is put to a vote, shareholders [are] likely to withhold re-election of the incumbent directors'. ISS is currently seeking discussions with News Corp and is likely to makes its recommendations to shareholders next week. It is expected to advise them to abstain or to vote against the re-election of News Corp directors at the company's AGM in October. That would be an embarrassing vote of no confidence in Murdoch, who is battling to keep the company in family hands. The 'poison pill' arrangement was put put in place last November to prevent Liberty Media, controlled by John Malone, from mounting a hostile takeover. ISS has mobilised shareholders before, often with spectacular results. It helped to remove controversial Disney chief executive Michael Eisner, who left after a shareholder campaign. A News Corp spokesman said: 'We haven't had any complaints from shareholders. We'd be happy to talk to the ISS.'"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
