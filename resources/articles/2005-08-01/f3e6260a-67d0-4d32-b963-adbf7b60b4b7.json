Farid Bamouhammad, 37, a convict on day release, seized the women on Wednesday, along with his two daughters, who were set free after a few hours. On Thursday, he appeared at a window with one of the women, brandishing a pistol near her head. Bamouhammad was also armed with a grenade, but police said no shots were fired and no one was injured during the operation. More than 20 police officers raided the building at about 3.30am. Some entered through a ground-floor cafe while others burst through the window of the first-floor apartment. \"Both women are in good health,\" a public prosecutor told reporters later. Police said Bamouhammad had been upset at child care arrangements while he was serving time for violent offences, including a hostage-taking incident in a suburban hamburger restaurant that also involved one of his daughters."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
