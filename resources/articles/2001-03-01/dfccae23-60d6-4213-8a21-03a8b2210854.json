It signalled the end of policies that preferred people with learning disabilities to be \"out of sight, out of mind\", and brought forth the beginnings of care in the community. Today, with the launch of the government's new white paper, Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century, I believe we have the power to bring about another fundamental phase of change. The establishment of the Disability Rights Commission (DRC) last year is strong evidence of the development of an increasing understanding of the rights of disabled people. Now we face the challenge of grounding the concept of rights in people's day-to-day experiences of public services. This is the first time people with learning disabilities have been consulted formally, in a fully accessible way, on a review of national policy. The diagnosis of what's successful and what's failing, therefore, has a credibility that comes from experience. It's also important because it recognises the need for government to forge a long-term partnership with service users and their families to bring about improvements. New funding for advocacy services, one of the defining elements of the white paper, will help bring this about. Together with the proposal for a national framework for person-centred planning, this has the power to transform the role of individuals and their families so they are no longer passive recipients of bog-standard services. I believe this paper will go some way towards resolving several perennial problems. One of the most intractable of these is the basic right to housing. Charity Mencap estimates that there are at least 25,000 people with learning disabilities who are not appropriately housed, and many live at home with elderly parents who struggle to support them. Some, even today, are still living in old, long-stay hospitals. There needs to be at least an extra 6,000 housing places a year if we are to give those over the age of 25 the choice of leaving home. The modernisation of day services will also require radical solutions. More than 20,000 people do not have a day centre place, and charging and eligibility criteria can be prohibitive. This can mean no opportunities for support outside the family or direct carer, no opportunities to socialise or acquire new skills, and nothing to do, all day, every day. This cannot be tolerated if we are to realise our vision of social inclusion. I am delighted the white paper will also be supplemented with a carer's paper. Carers not only need direct help they also need up-to-date information about where to get support and what's available. I am thrilled the government is planning to develop a national learning disability information centre and helpline, in partnership with Mencap. Families as a whole can feel socially excluded if they have a learning disabled son or daughter, and this is an important step in tackling social exclusion. I want to express my gratitude to the government for this white paper. I am optimistic that people with learning disabilities will have their own voices heard and that strong local leadership will reduce the isolated struggles of families to get the right services. Most importantly I am optimistic that the political will exists to deliver real change. But it is vital that real, effective action is taken at local level and that this action is backed up with appropriate funding. This is the only way to guarantee people with learning disabilities have the choices, the opportunities and the respect they are entitled to. \u0095 Lord (Brian) Rix is president of Mencap"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
