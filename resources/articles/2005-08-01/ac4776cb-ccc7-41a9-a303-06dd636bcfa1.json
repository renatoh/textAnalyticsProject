It was to be about the jargon that grows and spreads and now infests every corner of our lives - politics, commerce, the law, and the grisly-named \"lifestyle\". It was too much like hard work, and so having accepted the money I failed to write it. Later I wrote another book for S&amp;S, and that sank without trace, though at least my debt was paid off. Anyhow, round about the time I was failing to write the book, the American suits who run the publishers fired Nick, no doubt using some verbal dross about \"outplacement\" or \"having to let you go\", a phrase which implies a courteous dinner party host pretending he doesn't want his guest to leave even at 2am. So he wrote the book himself, and very good it is too. Robson publishes it later this year and I recommend it. I also wish I had got round to writing it. One word I would have included is \"community\", which used to mean a group of people living in the same place, such as Ambridge, or a monastery, and now simply means \"any group of people who have something, anything, in common\". Ludicrous recent examples have included - I heard this one on Radio 4 - \"the heterosexual community\", so referring to around 95% of the population, and, at Westminster, \"the settled community\", as opposed to travellers. This would mean about 99.9% of the British people. Clearly it's just an easy way of saying \"people who aren't travellers\" or \"people who aren't gay\". But does anyone ever say, \"We ought to give them a hand, after all, they are members of our heterosexual community\", or \"Are you off to the settled community's annual fete?\" \u00b7 One kind of jargon I do like is professional chat. It's so unselfconscious. Take the way that barristers refer to their cases as if they had committed the crimes, and take on the persona of the people they're representing. The other day a friend overheard a group of briefs on the tube saying: \"I'm off to Kingston for an indecent exposure\" and \"Of course, your deformity will be an advantage with the jury\". Or you hear people saying: \"I've got a good one; I'm down for a contract killing at Lewes ...\" \u00b7 Today is the 60th anniversary of the atom bomb attack on Hiroshima. I went there a few years ago and of course I went to the museum devoted to the bombing. There I read the fairly candid admission that Japanese scientists were also working on an atom bomb, and would presumably have used it if the Americans hadn't got there first. It is a very affecting place, as you would imagine, and one of the exhibits is a large model of what the city looked like just after the bomb had dropped, centred on Ground Zero. I was gazing at this when suddenly a large and noisy group of Japanese women descended upon me, shouting and gesticulating. I thought that perhaps they imagined I was American and wanted to harangue me for what my countrymen had done. But it was all right. They just wanted me to photograph them in front of the model. It must still exist somewhere: a picture of half a dozen women, laughing and smiling in front of a simulacrum of their ruined city and its atomised citizens. \u00b7 My daughter is about to read English at university, and a book on her reading list is called Narratology, by a Dutch academic called Professor Mieke Bal. I can't understand a word, but if I have a glimmer of what it's about, I'd say that people do cling to their narratives, the plotlines that define our lives and our experience of the world. When I was a lad, the British narrative was about a wise and heroic people who created the greatest empire the world had ever seen. We ditched that some time ago. More recently, Alastair Campbell and Tony Blair created a narrative about the Major government, which was incompetent and venal. They even believed it, which was why they found the realities of government so difficult. Meanwhile the Irish republican movement has always clung to its own narrative, which was about evil, imperialist Britain refusing to give up an inch of the Irish soil it continued to defile. That's why when, in 1969, the army went into Northern Ireland to defend the Catholics, they had to recreate the old plot by having the British turn on the native Irish, an outcome they achieved by killing a few soldiers. Then there had to be a reason why the British were still there, even though Ulster has cost us dearly and brings us nothing whatever in return. They came up with \"strategic needs\", as if London had to hold on to Derry to guard against a fearsome threat from Iceland, or the Canadian navy. The much-loved narrative clung to the view that the unionists were merely misled Irish folk who would willingly join a united Ireland as soon as it could be wrung from the clenched fists of the British. The fact that the unionists would rather see the place destroyed than join a united Ireland did not fit into the plot, and so could be safely ignored. If the republicans had only realised that the real struggle was for the hearts and minds of the 1 million Protestants, who knows what might have happened over the past third of a century? As it is, the Prods didn't fit in the storyline, so that notion was never pursued. \u00b7 Since the London bombings, lots more people cycle around the place, which I suppose is a good thing. Though I don't know which is more annoying: those who race down the pavement, swerving past just before you realise that they are bearing down on you at 20mph, or those who bossily ring the bell to signal \"get out of my way, pedestrians!\" The other day I was waiting, with another pedestrian, to cross Millbank, near the Commons, at a crossing with lights. The green man appeared, we stepped off the kerb, only to jump back again as a cyclist, head down, tore through the red. If we hadn't leapt back one of us could have been badly hurt. I just had time to shout \"red light!\", and he can't have been in so much of a hurry, since he had time to stop and yell, \"fuck off!\" At this point I get lots of letters saying that this represents a small minority of cyclists. All I can say is that recent experience suggests it is not such a small minority."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
