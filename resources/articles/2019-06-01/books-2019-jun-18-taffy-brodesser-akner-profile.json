For Taffy Brodesser-Akner, whose first novel, Fleishman Is In Trouble, she wrote while working as a writer at the New York Times magazine, the anxiety of leaving behind fact and transcript was alleviated by the knowledge that at least no one was going to yell at her for hurting their feelings. Not that Brodesser-Akner specializes in hatchet jobs. Her profiles, most famously her deep dive into the world of Gwyneth Paltrow last year, are generous without giving her subjects a free ride. A profile many years ago of the TV anchor Don Lemon, in GQ, was gently satirical without being cruel. At the end of last year, a recalcitrant Bradley Cooper was given the benefit of the doubt by Brodesser-Akner, and the space, quietly, to hang himself. In the case of Gwyneth Paltrow \u2013 with whom, says Brodesser-Akner, she spent so much time that by the end \u201cit started to get embarrassing\u201d \u2013 the piece treated the Goop empire with seriousness, while still providing Paltrow\u2019s critics with enough ludicrous details to carry on hating her. \u201cYou can make fun of it all you want,\u201d says Brodesser-Akner, who went into the project sufficiently open-minded to have converted, these days, to using Paltrow\u2019s zillion-dollar face creams. \u201cBut it\u2019s not good to send someone into a story who\u2019s just disgusted. I think the ambivalence is what people react to.\u201d We are in a cafe near the 43-year-old\u2019s house in New Jersey, 40 minutes from New York. Brodesser-Akner lives here with her husband, Claude, a journalist, and their two children, eight and 11. The novel came about in a burst of frustration after Brodesser-Akner was knocked back by her editor when she suggested doing a long reported piece on the state of divorce, which at the time all of her friends seemed to be going through. \u201cShe said we don\u2019t really do that sort of thing any more. I pulled over into a Pain Quotidien and wrote the first 10 pages of the novel.\u201d Fleishman is in Trouble follows the story of Toby Fleishman, a man in his early 40s whose marriage to Rachel has collapsed. Newly single, he is trying to have a sex life while also earning enough money to meet his ex-wife\u2019s idea of a fulfilling existence and making sure his children get to camp on time. It is a funny critique of the intoxicating life of the recently separated \u2013 specifically those of Brodesser-Akner\u2019s generation, who married before the advent of dating apps and who, upon divorcing, have a weird time adjusting to the new dating economy. (Kissing a new person after a long marriage is, observes Fleishman, akin to \u201cthe strange feeling of taking ice skates off after wearing them for hours and walking on plain ground\u201d.) It is also an acute portrait of the dynamics of upper-middle-class Manhattan in which everyone is equally hideous. Fleishman is whiny and smug; his ex-wife, Rachel, a wealthy talent agent who talks to her husband as if he is her executive assistant, is neurotic and vile; their friends are mercenary. The novel is otherwise populated by the kinds of terrible people who run around in slogan-based gym wear (sample selection: But First, Coffee; Brunch So Hard Rachel; Eat Sleep Spin Retreat). It goes without saying, meanwhile, that the private school scene on the Upper East Side is the seventh circle of hell. What redeems Fleishman from being a depressing read is the sympathy and humour with which the characters are treated. Everyone is disastrous and everyone is human, and the writing is so sharp that one finishes the novel somehow feeling warm towards them all. It is also an excavation of the odd phenomenon of wealthy people who cannot be happy. The \u201cpoor person\u201d in the novel is, in fact, Toby Fleishman himself, a successful doctor who makes almost $300,000 a year \u2013 an enormous amount of money relative to the average, and peanuts in relation to the hedge-funders he and his wife hang out with. His wife is embarrassed by his lack of ambition and the fact that he can provide neither a summer house, nor school fees for two kids, nor anything much beyond everything they need and nothing they actually want. At some point, Fleishman is asked pityingly by one of his banker friends what he would say if his kid came to him and told him he wanted to be a doctor. In fact, this is a question Brodesser-Akner used to field herself when she lived in Los Angeles \u2013 a city in which writers don\u2019t enjoy much status. \u201cI was writing for the New York Times and people thought it was a mommy blog,\u201d she says with a laugh. Her interest is in the radical realignment of wealth in a city where, for example, anyone earning less than a million a year is within range of a private school\u2019s financial aid scheme, and doctors are nowhere near the elite. \u201cThese were people who went to medical school in the 1990s and thought they were going to have a good life,\u201d she says. \u201cI guess I wondered if there\u2019s any industry where you could live a whole lifetime without the ground shifting under your feet in such a profound way.\u201d It was while living in Los Angeles in 2004 that Brodesser-Akner met her husband. She grew up in an orthodox Jewish household in Canarsie, Brooklyn, and had lived all her life in New York, studying at film school in the city before graduating and getting a job at a soap opera magazine. She went on to work at MediaBistro, GQ and the New York Times, eventually moving to California for a spell simply to experience another part of the country. Unusually, after marrying, Brodesser-Akner and her husband combined their names. (She is Akner; he, Brodesser). Even more unusually, after converting from Catholicism to Judaism, he volunteered to be circumcised in advance of the wedding. As Brodesser-Akner told the New York Times wedding page at the time, \u201che was drugged, but the amount of Xanax I was on rivaled it\u201d. \u201cHe\u2019s a very rare guy,\u201d she says now, with a laugh. The name thing had been his suggestion; she had merely said that if and when they had children, she didn\u2019t intend to have a different name from them. \u201cMy parents are divorced \u2013 my mother\u2019s divorced twice \u2013 and it was always sad to me that we had different last names from the person who was raising us. I said to him you can do whatever you want, but my kids will have my name; do you want them to have your name, too?\u201d When this all happened 13 years ago, changing his name was \u201can act of extraordinary generosity\u201d, she says, although \u201ca lot of my [female] friends who are having babies now, their children are just getting their names and the husbands are not. I love it.\u201d It is the kind of shift in social dynamics that Brodesser-Akner is very good at documenting, although her concern, when starting the novel, was that as all journalists know, life is much stranger than fiction. \u201cThe thing about people is that they\u2019re so bad at being consistent,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd that is the joy of writing about them. What if you can\u2019t make that up? That\u2019s the anxiety I had.\u201d Fiction-writing entails less wear and tear than journalism and is in some ways easier on the nerves. You have a certain amount of power as a journalist, but you are also forever being told to sod off. When an interview subject refuses to honour their end of the transaction, stonewalling or giving single-word answers, she tends to \u201cfreak out internally. And I try to smile. I always have a few questions that you can just ask any time. A good one is \u2018what did your childhood bedroom look like?\u2019 An early mentor told me that. It forces them into a relaxed state of reminiscence.\u201d There are some subjects who cannot be redeemed, however. This is what happened at the end of last year when Brodesser-Akner interviewed Cooper, a man laboring under the delusion that what readers of the New York Times magazine wanted from him was an interrupted 5,000-word lecture on A Star Is Born. He gave Brodesser-Akner nothing and in the end, all she could do in the article was show her workings, describing how her efforts to get him to behave like a human fell flat, and eventually resorting to that journalistic measure of last resort: the meta piece. It was awful, she says, although not as awful as some. \u201cThere was a time with Nicki Minaj where I said, \u2018Please, just let me interview you; I have some questions for you, maybe you\u2019ll like them.\u2019 She fell asleep! It was my first story for GQ \u2013 all I had ever wanted was to write for GQ, and they gave me Nicki Minaj, and she was very hostile to me at first, and then she fell asleep.\u201d In the end, says Brodesser-Akner: \u201cI wrote 4,000 words about what I would\u2019ve asked her and how I kept trying to wake her up.\u201d Gwyneth, we know, was not like this. Brodesser-Akner had wanted to interview her for ever and had gone on a long campaign to secure the interview, assuring Paltrow she would take her seriously as a businesswoman, which she did. (And rightly so). She didn\u2019t let her off the hook. I remember reading the piece and not liking Paltrow much more than I had going into it. I also wondered if, when the piece came out, she had felt betrayed. The story quoted from Dr Jen Gunter, Paltrow\u2019s arch-nemesis who likes to point out the ludicrous and occasionally dangerous implications of, for example, suggesting underwire bras might cause cancer. In fact, says Brodesser-Akner, Paltrow liked the piece, posting it on her Instagram and letting it be known that she found it broadly flattering. Didn\u2019t she flinch at the paragraphs detailing Goop\u2019s appalling lack of fact checking? \u201cOh my God, no! She was like, you bet we don\u2019t do fact checking! It\u2019s part of her revolution. And don\u2019t you always find that the thing you\u2019re horrified to ask is the thing people really stand by?\u201d What Brodesser-Akner hadn\u2019t anticipated was what reporting on the story would do to her own psychology \u2013 the terrible Stockholm syndrome that can descend when you spend too much time with a subject. \u201cThere was a time in the middle when [Paltrow] became scared of me and my intentions. And after having gotten along so well, it made me so angry. But the anger was embarrassment that, oh, I thought we were getting along. Awful. I mean, I never hated her. I really liked her. And I thought she was so talented. And the thing that people hate \u2013 \u2018Ugh, she\u2019s just so privileged\u2019 \u2013 how can you hold against her? It\u2019s OK to be born wealthy. It\u2019s very lucky. And also most of the people I know who were born privileged are incredible fuck-ups. They can\u2019t figure out a goal or a motive. She [Paltrow] works so hard.\u201d Did people get mad with you for not being more critical of her? \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t hear any of that. I hope that I made a compelling case. And the thing I determined was that it was not about how I felt about her; it was about how I felt about myself in her reflection that was the issue. And it was unbearable to me. I\u2019ve never been happier to be done with a story, to go back to being an average person as opposed to the least graceful person in the room, the least successful person in the room. I\u2019m a fine successful person, but next to her ... \u201d By the end of the story, even Paltrow\u2019s posture struck Brodesser-Akner as a rebuke. When she asked Paltrow how she managed to keep her back so straight, \u201cshe was like, \u2018You think so?\u2019 She\u2019d never considered it. And then I was even more upset! If you can have that posture without thinking about it? I don\u2019t even know what species you are.\u201d The bottom line is you can\u2019t be friends with these people; above a certain altitude, not even their friends can be friends with them. \u201cThese are people who no one makes requests of any more. They think they\u2019re having a friendship, but they\u2019re not.\u201d Still, very occasionally the celebrity class system breaks down \u2013 and it\u2019s extremely exciting for everyone. A couple of years ago, Brodesser-Akner flew to London to interview Tom Hiddleston and afterwards was papped in the street hugging him goodbye. The Daily Mail ran the photo under the headline \u201cTom Hiddleston caught bidding farewell to a mystery brunette\u201d, whereupon Hiddleston rang Brodesser-Akner in agony. \u201cHe said, \u2018I\u2019m so sorry. Tell your husband I\u2019m horrified.\u2019\u201d She bursts out laughing. \u201cAnd I said you should not be horrified! It\u2019s the best week of our lives!\u201d Sometimes, the person with soft power on the sidelines does go to the ball."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
