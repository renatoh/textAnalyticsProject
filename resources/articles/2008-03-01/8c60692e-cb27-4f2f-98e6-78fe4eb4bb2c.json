If you agree with a scenario remotely resembling the one I suggested earlier today - basically, that Clinton needs to do very well in the next three states to (a) build momentum and (b) argue that Barack Obama is tanking - then we ought to decide what \"very well\" means. In the five latest polls, according to realclearpolitics.com, she averages a 16.6% lead. We are still nearly a month away from the voting, of course, but polls like these tend to establish the conventional wisdom. Then you always adjust downward a little on the assumption that matters will tighten up as the race gets more intense. So let's say - adding of course an asterisk, since things could change - that a fair expectation is that she should win Pennsylvania by about 12 percentage points. So, now that we've set the bar, we examine the three possible outcomes. Outcome one: Clinton wins by around 12%. I'm going to assume that 1.4 million people vote (about 800,000 voted in 2004, and this one should produce much higher turnout). This would be about a 200,000-vote margin and would, according to Slate's now world-famous delegate tracker, give Clinton a net gain of 16 delegates. In this scenario, she continues forward. She gets a slight push among the superdelegates but she's still far behind in the popular vote (around 500,000). Nothing fundamentally changes the dynamics of the contest. North Carolina and Indiana, which vote on May 6, become the new showdown states. Outcome two: Clinton underperforms, and wins the state by seven or eight percentage points. That would be only about a 108,000-vote margin, and around 12 delegates. That will amount to a kind of victory for Obama, because the main storyline in that case will be that he survived the Jeremiah Wright mess and still holds an insurmountable lead. Outcome three: Clinton wins huge, by 18 or 20 percentage points. Then, the contest in my view becomes a whole new ballgame. That's a 280,000-vote margin, which I think will get a lot of eye-popping reaction on the cable channels on election night. It will also mean a gaudy 30 or 32 delegate-gain. In that case, all these arguments the Clinton campaign has been making about Obama's unelectability - which in my view have been debatable - suddenly start looking a lot more serious. Superdelegates will be very, very nervous about an Obama who only mustered 41% of the vote in Pennsylvania. As you can see, then, there's a world of difference between outcomes two and three. Outcome two, Obama is still on his way to the nomination. Outcome three, Clinton not only has life, but is realistically positioned to end up as the nominee after all. I lay all this out because from what I can see so far, Clinton is campaigning hard in Pennsylvania, and Obama is hardly campaigning. I'm writing this after lunch on Monday, and Clinton has had two major events in the state today - a speech on the economy at the University of Pennsylvania and a women's event in the Philly suburbs. Obama is taking a short vacation in the Virgin Islands. Granted, there's a month to go. But so far, it looks like the Obama campaign isn't planning on competing that hard in the state, at least in terms of events (with more money than Croesus, he is running lots of ads, apparently). The risk of competing hard is evident. If Obama puts a lot of work into Pennsylvania and still loses by 15 percentage points or so, then he's opened himself up to even more credible attacks about his weakness in swing states. But it seems pretty obvious to me that the risk of not competing is greater, because a 20-point loss - which is possible - is pretty much his only ticket to defeat. Me, I'm a believer in the long pass. What I think Obama ought to do is go into four or five white ethnic enclaves across the state and have town hall meetings and answer every question they want to throw at him: Wright, his wife's boneheaded comment about her (lack of) pride in America, you name it. Talking never hurts. He'll get points for showing up at least. More than that - this is the sort of thing Obama is supposed to do. A \"new kind of politics\" never meant to me that he could never say anything negative about an opponent. That's ridiculous. But it does mean that he should try to shatter the mould a bit, and not just do the safe things. Uniting the country, if he is to live up to his claim for himself, means going into hostile territory and talking to people who are not his natural allies. That actually is the kind of leadership the country desperately needs. For more blogs on the US elections, click here."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
