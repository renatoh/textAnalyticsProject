Beijing's oldest hotel is immensely proud to have been chosen as the Spanish champions' temporary home, but its staff have brought their cameras to work in order to take pictures of only one prestigious guest. On the pavement outside, it is the same story with more than a thousand screaming, waving locals, many of them women, greeting the team bus as it arrived from the airport at midnight on Thursday and then braving smog yesterday afternoon to watch Real head off for a training session. And their favourite player? Well a dozen came up with the same answer. \"Everybody in China, and women especially, loves David Beckham because he's so good looking, he's got blond hair and he's a fine man; he loves his wife and family, and Chinese people like that,\" said Carol, a tour guide. \"Women here also like him because he's quite feminine.\" And what about his football. \"We hear he's very good ...\" It is pointless explaining that, if the poster in the lobby reflected a footballing meritocracy the England captain would cut a smaller figure than Luis Figo, Zinedine Zidane or Raul because, in Chinese eyes, Beckham seems much more than a mortal. How the egos of the other Real players are coping with this is anybody's guess but, negating the impression that Beckham was bought primarily as a cash cow, the club's press officers have become so fed up with the whole circus surrounding their latest signing that they are refusing to co-operate with the sizeable journalistic contingent that has arrived from Britain. Yesterday, for instance, we were invited to a conference attended by Real's coach Carlos Queiroz, Raul, Ronaldo and Beckham, along with a couple of the Chinese players they will face today, only to be informed we were forbidden from asking any questions. Each man would, instead, speak spontaneously and so they did, spouting a few platitudes about how nice it was be in Beijing - until it was Beckham's turn. \"The press conference is over; there will be no more talking,\" declared a PR officer as a bemused-looking Beckham was ushered out of a banqueting hall where, 20 minutes earlier, his arrival had been greeted by stirring music and a series of drum rolls. At least the whole charade was in keeping with the spirit of a hotel built 100 years ago during China's Boxer Rebellion, the Boxers being a group of xenophobic rebels violently opposed to foreigners and missionaries who briefly seized control of Beijing. Throughout his non-speaking role in the banqueting hall Beckham, who might have benefited from a translator, sat silently and blank-faced, his diamond earrings glinting in the spotlights, as Ronaldo and Raul nudged each other and giggled like schoolboys. As Beckham said to reporters at their Kunming training camp earlier in the week, the sooner he can learn Spanish the better. \"It's going to be difficult, though,\" admitted Beckham, who will at least benefit from beginning life at the club in a familiar role. Queiroz has strongly indicated that he will play the man he coached at Old Trafford last season wide on the right. This means Figo being relocated on the left flank but, rather than seething, the Portuguese winger has probably done more than even Steve McManaman to make Beckham feel comfortable in his new environment. It is perhaps no coincidence that Figo is particularly close to Queiroz, who coached him through Portugal's youth ranks, and it was at Figo's Madrid villa that Queiroz agreed the deal that elevated him from Manchester United's No2 to Real's coach. Sir Bobby Robson, who was surprisingly succeeded by Queiroz as coach at Sporting Lisbon, was among many who were astounded by Real's hiring of a coach who in a peripatetic career has not enjoyed any significant managerial success. Indeed, some strongly suspect Queiroz was hired largely to help ease Beckham's settling-in period. If results go awry, it is not inconceivable that the other players - almost all of whom were upset at the sacking of the popular Vicente del Bosque - may blame the Englishman for upsetting the applecart. Beckham's presence has already affected their daily life. Players who had hoped to join a tour of Tiananmen Square and the Forbidden City yesterday saw their visit cancelled at short notice after club officials feared police could not prevent Beckham being mobbed by fans. They were deprived of seeing where the emperor's 127 concubines once lived in the gargantuan palace complex staffed by 220 eunuchs. To locals the Forbidden City seemed, until fairly recently, a landmark representing conflicting values. On one hand it symbolised all that the cultural revolutionaries believed to be wrong with China, but it was also seen as a fount of Chinese civilisation. Now, though, with the government accruing heaps of US dollars from tourists passing through it, any lingering contradictions seem to have been comfortably resolved. It is to be hoped that the apparent clash between Beckham the iconic marketing weapon and Becks the team player can be settled just as happily."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
