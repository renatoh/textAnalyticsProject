It was half-time of a World Cup group match between England and South Africa on 14 September 2007 and deep in the Stade de France Jones looked on in fascination as the Springbok players took charge. \u201cIt was incredible,\u201d he told me when we revisited the scene while working on his autobiography. \u201cThere I was, surrounded by great Springboks I had been up against as a coach for years. I felt very lucky and, also, amazed at the ups and downs of life as a rugby coach. Four months before a lot of those same players had given me and the Reds a real beating in Pretoria. It still seems strange to think how it all worked out.\u201d Jones was South Africa\u2019s assistant coach when they won the World Cup in October 2007 and yet, in early May that year, his Queensland Reds were beaten 92-3 by the Bulls in Pretoria in a Super 14 game. \u201cWe took the lead with an early penalty,\u201d Jones remembered, \u201cbut the Bulls went on the rampage. Everything went for them. Nothing went for us. \u201cWe threw the dice and played extravagantly. I thought it was the only way we would get something from the game. I wanted us to have a real go and score a few tries. They tore us apart.\u201d The Bulls scored 13 tries and Jones lost his job with the Reds. Twelve years later, he is coaching England against South Africa in the World Cup final on Saturday. Yokohama is a long way from Pretoria. But Jones has always been phlegmatic about that humiliation. \u201cI\u2019ve suffered worse losses than 92-3,\u201d he said with a rueful grin. \u201cAt Tokai University we were once beaten 110-0. We then lost 75-0 in the very next game. But that was Japanese university rugby in the 1990s. This was Super 14 rugby and so it stung to get hammered like that in Pretoria.\u201d The Springboks certainly regarded the Bulls game as an aberration in Jones\u2019s stellar career and plans were made to entice him into their World Cup camp. Eight weeks before South Africa played England in Paris, Jones was appointed as the Springboks\u2019 technical director and the effective No 2 to the head coach, Jake White. It was an inspired decision because Jones offered tactical acumen and vast experience that calmed the camp. They already had great players \u2013 Bryan Habana, Fourie du Preez, Victor Matfield and Bakkies Botha had been part of the Bulls team that crushed the Reds \u2013 but Jones offered them something different. He was incredibly shrewd and mentally tough. The Springboks were also taken aback by his candour. John Smit, who captained the Springboks to victory in that World Cup, told me about the startling impact Jones had on the squad. \u201cHe watched our first session and I thought we looked pretty good as we showed him some of our best moves. Afterwards, I asked him: \u2018What do you think, Eddie?\u2019 He gave that little smile of his and said: \u2018It wasn\u2019t bad, mate, but if I were giving you a score out of 10 I\u2019d say it was about a four.\u2019\u201d Smit laughed. \u201cI thought he was joking. But he said: \u2018Yeah, there\u2019s a fair bit to work on.\u2019 We were surprised but we were really interested.\u201d Jones enjoyed the memory while stressing his seriousness. \u201cThey deserved little more than a four because of their talent. I didn\u2019t care if they were offended. I went through some set moves and showed the Boks how I would do things differently. They must have liked it because Jake asked if I would consider becoming their technical adviser on the eve of the World Cup. I was so excited I said \u2018Yes\u2019 on the spot. It became one of my greatest experiences in rugby.\u201d By the time they reached Paris, Jones felt an integral part of the Springbok setup. At half-time against England, South Africa were leading 20-0. Jones described it as the most dominant performance he had seen against defending world champions and he felt privileged to have moved from the disaster of Pretoria to the masterclass of Paris. \u201cBut then it got really interesting. South Africa were so much better than England it felt as if they could end up winning 100-0. So the players made a surprising tactical decision. They were ready to let England have as much ball as they liked in the second half so that the Boks could practise their defence. \u201cThis was a sign of an intelligent team who knew they were going deep into the tournament so, rather than chasing a huge score, they decided to sharpen their defence for tougher battles. It showed me the South African mentality. They absolutely love making big hits. England had much more of the ball in the second half but the Boks still won 36-0.\u201d After a player-led regrouping, England somehow made it to the final against South Africa. The Springboks won a much tighter match, 15-6, and numerous players in their team have told me that they don\u2019t believe they would have lifted the World Cup without Jones. Du Preez, their scrum-half and one of their best players, was the most emphatic: \u201cHe got us right tactically and the calmness he gave us was vital. Jake White would have struggled without Eddie.\u201d Jones played down the plaudits. \u201cI believe the Boks would have still become world champions. I saw myself as being like the guy who comes in after a new house has been built and he takes care of the small details \u2013 sorting out minor issues and adding a gloss of paint to a very solid structure. \u201cJake did feel the pressure and he was nervous but he coached really well. I helped most by taking some of the pressure off him. I had coached Australia to the World Cup final four years earlier and I could pass on the lessons I had learned about preparation and tension.\u201d That squad shredded the stereotype of the South African player. They were the opposite of unimaginative hulks who clobbered anyone who got in their way but could be outsmarted by more thoughtful opponents. Jones told me often that only his Brumbies team, who won the Super 12 in 2001 and included the Wallabies George Gregan, Stephen Larkham and Rod Kafer, could rival the 2007 Boks as the most intelligent squad he has coached. Jones is under no illusions while preparing England for the final on Saturday. Rassie Erasmus, the Springbok head coach, \u201cis canny and very bright. He\u2019s a real thinker\u201d. Jones knows he will have to work hard to outwit Erasmus \u2013 while also steeling his players for a massive physical assault. Over the years he has had his share of scrapes with the Springboks. In August 2003, after his Wallabies had beaten South Africa by 20 points in Brisbane, Jones called the Springboks \u201ca disgrace to international rugby\u201d. Botha, the great lock whom Jones coached four years later, was banned for eight weeks for foul play while the prop Robbie Kempson was suspended for a month after a high tackle. Jones was incandescent: \u201cIt\u2019s a deliberate tactic from the Springboks and it puts a slur on the game. They need to have a good look at themselves, because that sort of rubbish should not go on.\u201d Yet 2007 bolstered his innate respect for South African rugby culture. He spoke openly to me, a South African, about his affection for the country and Springbok rugby. \u201cFor me, the two greatest rugby nations in the world are New Zealand and South Africa. As an Australian I\u2019m never going to be given the opportunity to coach in New Zealand and so when I got the chance in 2015 to take over the Stormers, in a city as beautiful as Cape Town, I was excited. There is so much raw talent in South Africa, especially in the Cape with a blend of black and white players. I was flying after my first session with the Stormers.\u201d At that point Ian Ritchie, the Rugby Football Union chief executive at the time, arrived in Cape Town to persuade Jones to leave the Stormers. After England\u2019s disastrous home World Cup, and with Jones having just used his inside knowledge of South Africa to inspire Japan to a famous victory over the Springboks, Ritchie was desperate to secure the Australian as England\u2019s new head coach. \u201cI was very happy in Cape Town but the England job was intriguing,\u201d Jones said. \u201cIan and I met at a fancy hotel on the Waterfront. We were in a room with a beautiful view of Table Mountain. \u201cI made a joke when Ian asked if I was interested in coaching England. I said: \u2018Well, mate, who wants to swap Cape Town for London?\u2019 But the England job was too big a challenge to turn down. Leaving South Africa, and the Stormers, was still hard.\u201d Four years later, as Jones leads England into the World Cup final he always told me they would reach, it seems fitting that the opposition should be South Africa. He has already won the tournament with the Springboks and masterminded the greatest shock in World Cup history through an intricate game plan that enabled Japan to beat South Africa in 2015. \u201cIt\u2019s always brutal against the Springboks,\u201d he once told me. \u201cBut they\u2019re smarter than you think and I never underestimate them. I also know that coaching South Africa is the hardest job in world rugby. The politics are complicated. But, under Rassie, the development programme is working and they\u2019ve got many outstanding black players there on merit. They will get stronger and stronger. But it\u2019s my job now to make sure England are always a step ahead of South Africa. They\u2019re a great rugby country \u2013 but I always want to beat them.\u201d My Life and Rugby by Eddie Jones, with Donald McRae, is published on 21 November by Macmillan"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
