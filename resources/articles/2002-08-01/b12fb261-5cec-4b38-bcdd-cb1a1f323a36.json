It was a repeat of last season when Reading put the Hammers out of the League Cup after a penalty shoot-out. Royals striker Jamie Cureton, who is likely to start on the substitutes bench at Derby on Saturday, scored a hat-trick for the Berkshire side - who trailed 2-0 after 19 minutes. Freddie Kanoute and Jermaine Defoe put the Hammers in front but two strikes from Cureton plus goals from Darius Henderson and Phil Parkinson eased Reading 4-2 ahead at the interval. Cureton tucked away a 51st-minute penalty for Reading's fifth before Joe Cole and Titi Camara made the scoreline more respectable. Reading started the game with just four players likely to make Saturday's starting line-up, while West Ham changed all 11 of their starters before the end of the match. Crystal Palace 1 - 1 Charlton Matthias Svensson grabbed a second-half equaliser as Premiership Charlton claimed a draw from their pre-season friendly with former landlords Crystal Palace. Svensson volleyed home Paul Konchesky's corner on the hour to cancel out Dougie Freedman's early opener. Earlier Freedman had given Palace the lead when he rose to meet Danny Granville's curling free-kick into the area. Both sides had chances to win the game with a Konchesky shot rattling the crossbar the closest either came. Luton 3 - 2 Southampton Joe Kinnear's Hatters came from two goals down to beat Premiership Southampton at Kenilworth Road. Chris Marsden tapped in the only goal of the first half after 25 minutes to give the visitors the lead and when Jo Tessem flicked in a second after 57 minutes, Gordon Strachan's men looked likely winners. But Kevin Nicholls pulled a goal back two minutes later following a Kevin Nicholls free-kick, then nine minutes from time Andrew Fotiadis tied the scores after Howard had won the ball in the air. And with six minutes to go the Division Two newcomers were celebrating a morale-boosting success when Holmes swept in the winner from the edge of the box. Adrian Forbes was carried off on a stretcher, while Thorpe also went off injured soon after scoring to take the shine off a good night for the home side, but Dundee United goalkeeper Alan Coombe, on trial at Kenilworth Road, excelled in the home goal. Bradford 1 - 1 Middlesbrough Dean Windass struck a stunning late equaliser to deny his troubled former club Bradford victory over Middlesbrough in their friendly at Valley Parade. Windass fired home from 20 yards less than two minutes from time as to earn a draw for a Middlesbrough side that fielded a different XI in each half. The Bantams had led since the 10th minute of their final pre-season game courtesy of an Andy Gray goal. Boro new boys Geremi and George Boateng both featured in the first half. Rochdale 0 - 6 Man City Manchester City picked up another morale-boosting pre-season success with a convincing 6-0 win at packed Spotland. The game was delayed 30 minutes due to crowd congestion, but the Premiership newcomers wasted little time in getting into their stride with Chris Shuker opening the scoring after seven minutes. The youngster then turned provider to make it 2-0 four minutes later when his corner was headed home from eight yards by Lucien Mettomo. Darren Huckerby then tapped home a third before Laurent Charvet made it 4-0 before half-time. Shuker then wrapped up a fine night for City by setting up Vicente Vuoso for the fifth and then completing the scoring himself."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
