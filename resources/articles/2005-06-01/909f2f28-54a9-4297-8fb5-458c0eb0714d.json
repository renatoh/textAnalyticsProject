But if a third consecutive home defeat for the Warriors is followed by a Widnes victory over London on Sunday, that once-unthinkable prospect will become unavoidable. With two teams going down this year to allow the entry of Les Catalans from Perpignan next season, Wigan would then be only two points clear of the second relegation position, and with a trip to Leeds tomorrow week, followed by the Challenge Cup quarter- final at St Helens eight days later, there are no easy games on the horizon. \"It is a bit of a culture shock for us,\" admitted Terry Newton, the Great Britain hooker who has reluctantly inherited the captaincy after the departure of Andy Farrell and the loss of Kris Radlinski for up to two months because of a hamstring injury. \"It's tough being a Wiganer at the moment, but as Wiganers say, we have to keep going wi'yed down.\" Wigan's problems are summed up by Millward's need to rush Liam Botham into his squad tonight, after Leeds released him from the remaining six months of his contract. Danny Orr returns at stand-off after his hamstring problem, allowing Kevin Brown to switch to full-back to replace Radlinski, with Chris Ashton, an 18-year-old debutant, on the bench. Hull are aiming to return to third after losing their last two games. They announced yesterday that the former Wigan back-row Chris Chester, who is still recovering from injury, has signed a two-year contract but their form stand-off Paul Cooke is still considering an offer which includes a testimonial season. Wakefield and Salford, two of Wigan's potential relegation rivals, have games against Super League's top two tonight, although Trinity could complete an unlikely double over Leeds after their win at Headingley on Easter Monday. Salford, who have suffered six consecutive defeats since their last win, face St Helens, who have beaten Leeds and demolished Bradford 66-4 in their two matches under Daniel Anderson, although Paul Sculthorpe, Darren Albert and Nick Fozzard are out. New Zealand have promoted Anderson's former assistant Brian McClennan, the son of the former Saints coach Mike, for the Gillette Tri-Nations series against Great Britain and Australia this year. Andrew Johns has received a shock recall to the New South Wales squad for the second match of the State of Origin series against Queensland next Wednesday. The Newcastle Knights scrum-half replaces Trent Barrett, who was injured in training, even though he returned from a broken jaw only last weekend. Hull Kingston Rovers have suspended their coach, Harvey Howard, for failing to cooperate with a club investigation into \"a number of allegations relating to his conduct and duties as head coach.\" Howard, a former Widnes, Leeds and Wigan and Brisbane Broncos prop, took over only last autumn and Rovers are currently third in the LHF National League."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
