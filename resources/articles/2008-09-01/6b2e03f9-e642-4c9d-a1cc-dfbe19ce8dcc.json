When the half-millennium-old Tiananmen Gate was found to be falling down in the 1960s, it was secretly replaced with an exact replica, in a successful conspiracy involving nearly 3,000 people. Starting here, the authors fan outwards in a fascinating cultural mapping of modern Beijing. Here are ring roads that resemble \"successive reworkings of the old city wall\"; here is the district for \"saw-gash CDs\" (imperfect discs dumped by western record labels on the Chinese market), where the young bob for Sex Pistols albums. A few false notes sound, with jejune references to \"the flow of spirit, or qi\" through the city, and the occasional enfilade of theory to say something obvious, but the book is a useful street-level corrective to received ideas. In particular, its interviews with citizens - an ex-policeman, scavengers in plastic-bag mountains, luminaries of the art scene, caf\u00e9 owners who dream of being film directors, members of a kind of granny Neighbourhood Watch scheme - are wonderfully humane."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
