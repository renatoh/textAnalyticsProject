Bruce Fiver here, from the land where the Shelias bang like a dunny door in a storm. That's ex-penal Australia for you drongos at the back. I've got a free five minutes to tell you about our papers gloating over our sporting prowess. So let's get started, shall we? \"Australia 3 Easybeats 1: Socceroos crush England in historic win,\" the straight-as-you-like Sydney Morning Herald yabbered. \"First it was the cricket, then the Davis Cup tennis and now Australia has stunned England in one of the biggest upsets in soccer history.\" And the West Australian was pretty stoked too, proclaiming: \"Kewell on fire as England in ashes\" - as anyone who saw him fly like nectar from a shaken tinny past Rio Ferdinand would surely agree. And what did your fellas make of last night's massacre? Well, in a word: garbo. The Sun called it a \"total and utter shambles\", the Daily Mail thought it \"as humiliating a night as the English game has suffered in half a century or more\" and the Football Association reckoned it was \"deeply frustrating\". Which is why those jackaroos at the FA have decided to ask Premiership clubs to do their bit for friendly internationals \"to boost England's chances of winning a major tournament\". To react to that in strident Strayan, what a load of f%$\u00a3**g b**%*$\u00a3$ \"Non-competitive matches matter as well,\" the FA's David Davies droned on to TheFA.com today, his voice as dry as a dead dingo's donger. \"It is not sufficient to only think about England in May and June, and somehow believe magically we can win major tournaments in that way.\" And, strewth, there was more of this dirge. \"That's why, with the Premier League and the League Managers' Association, we are hosting what may be a series of discussions with managers from top clubs.\" Just the sort of thing to turn your team into world-beaters, I'm sure you deadbeats will agree. ROY THE BOY It's been a busy week for Royston all right. On Sunday, he took Triggs for a walk and did a word search. On Monday, he spoke to his publishers about the paperback and beat up some punks while playing Vice City on his PS2. On Tuesday, he had to stay in all morning waiting for the gas man. Oh, and he quit international football again. Well, it'll make a nice new chapter, won't it? On Wednesday, he took it easy, had cheese-on-toast for lunch and watched Countdown. And today, he heard that Manchester City had decided not to pursue any legal action against him for that tackle on Alfie Haaland. It's not been a very busy week for Alfie Haaland. He doesn't care what day it is as each one is dispiritingly the same. He mopes around the house, depressed at the thought he will never play top-class football again. But today, things got even worse when it was confirmed that he won't even be able to play for City again. The club have decided to terminate Alfie's contract! \"We have taken a very difficult decision to give Alfie his proper notice,\" read a notice giving Alfie his notice. But even as Haaland lay writhing in agony, City came back after him like a raging Royston. \"The necessary medical and consequential legal advice has been carefully reviewed,\" read a two-footed City statement before jumping in with a crippling punchline. \"It would be difficult for Manchester City to take action on medical grounds. Manchester City will not be pursuing any legal action arising out of the tackle.\" But it's not all bad news, because for the next six months Alfie can still hang around with his old mates. \"Of course during that period he will be a player at the club still and free to use the facilities.\" So at least he can seek consolation in a cup of instant Kenco from the vending machine. QUOTE OF THE DAY \"All the players at Real Madrid, with one exception, are completely involved in working for the team. The only player who is different is Ronaldo\" - Real Madrid coach Vicente Del Bosque goes in for a spot of unconventional motivational therapy on Tuesday. \"I wasn't criticising Ronaldo, absolutely not. I was just stating a fact\" - Del Bosque tries his hand at damage limitation today. LEICESTER LOOK TO DITCH CITY MONICKER In football, rebranding campaigns are usually undertaken for the most cynical of reasons. Arsenal, for example, redrew their fabulous gothic cannon just so they could shaft local street traders trying to scrape a living by selling the odd large flag. But sometimes, just sometimes, clubs have more noble motives. Take Leicester City, whose new chairman Jon Holmes has hit upon the grand idea of changing the club name to Leicester Fosse. It's a two-fold nod to the history of the club: Fosse was the club's original name up until it went into liquidation in 1919; and it's the Latin word for gutter, which is exactly where the Foxes were less than a month ago. \"I want to institute a debate as to the club name,\" said Holmes this morning. \"The club has been reclaimed by the community and I want to give the community the chance to tell us what their club should be known as. The more I thought about returning to the name the more sensible it seemed. City is the name of 15 clubs in the league and the likes of Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa are unique.\" Hmm ... debate ... community ... chance ... sensible ... thought ... something about this statement tells us that Holmes hasn't got the hang of what being a football chairman is all about yet. THE RUMOUR MILL Those plucky triers at West Brom - currently on work experience in the Premiership - have renewed their interest in long-time transfer target Artim Sakiri, after the left-sided player rejected a contract extension with CSKA Sofia. Look out though Gary, Bolton are also in the hunt. Coventry City have taken Blackburn striker Matt Jansen on loan until the end of the season. And finally, hats off to The Express's Harry Harris, whose column - Ahead of the Game - is living up to its name today. Check this out for astonishing foresight: Harry, whose strapline is 'Setting the sporting agenda', reckons doomed West Ham's youngsters Jermain Defoe, Joe Cole and Michael Carrick could be targets for other clubs! And you'll never believe this - Harry reckons the Hammers are anxious to hang on to them! Now that's what we call investigative journalism. NEWS IN LENGTHS Portsmouth captain Paul 'The Merse' Merson has confirmed he will take up the second year of his contract. \"I looked at my age and thought 'I'm 35 next month,'\" said Merse, welling up. \"I thought I was past it but the last two games have made me realise I still have a lot to offer,\" he added, before breaking down and heading off to listen to a remix of Whitney Houston's So Emotional. Leeds midfielder Eirik Bakke will be out for up to eight weeks after a scan revealed ankle-ligament damage. On the plus side, Lucas Radebe could return for Sunday's FA Cup fifth-round clash with Crystal Palace, while Nick Barmby, who damaged his Achilles in November, played for an hour in last night's reserves game while David Batty played the full 90 minutes. The Republic of Ireland's new manager Brian Kerr may have got off to a winning start last night, but Hibs goalkeeper Nick Colgan has revealed a worrying defect in the new boss's armoury. Having been promised a substitute appearance, Colgan almost missed out on his second Republic of Ireland cap when Kerr forgot he was sitting on the bench. He was eventually given the nod to replace Dean Kiely late on in the 2-0 defeat of Scotland. \"I had a glance at Packie [Bonner],\" said Colgan, \"and I think he gave Brian a gentle reminder on my behalf.\" It must be nice to be valued. TONIGHT'S TV AND RADIO Five: Jonathan Pearce's Football Night (12am) Last time on Would Like to Meet, we left Nick facing a tough V-Day decision: Cosmo or Caroline? Dutch Football (12.40am) Fortunately, the Fiver family have rallied around to help Nick decide. And a couple have merely emailed in to cause mischief. \"I raise Desperate Caroline and Vulture Cosmo three sheep and a see-you-see-me internet video hook-up,\" says Simon Bird, somewhat unhelpfully. Argentinian Football (2.15am) \"I think I can offer a better solution to Nick's problem,\" says Brian Burke, much to our relief. Sky Sports 1: FA Cup Classics (6.30pm) \"Clearly what Nick needs to do this Friday is drown his sorrows, and what better way to do it than in a posh London Hotel with a total stranger?\" Spanish Football League Review (7pm) Er, yes, Brian, we think we'll leave that one there. In any case, Nick has made his bed and now he's going to lie in it. \"My girlfriend and I earlier decided that we would still go to the hotel 'as friends',\" he says to the collective groan of self-respecting men everywhere. Football League Review (8pm) However, there may yet be some hope for our Caroline. \"She sounds like a dream come true for my friend Richard Kemp, who like Caroline enjoys football, is at a loose end on Friday and is no great fan of Ipswich as a Yorkshire-based Canary,\" writes someone called North-East Corner. Sport on Five with Ian Payne (7pm) Caroline is spoiled for choice. A chap called Dan, who also dumped recently, writes: \"If Caroline's kind offer isn't accepted by Nick I would be happy to take her out for dinner, although I don't think I can stretch to a night at the Mayfair Hotel.\" TalkSport: Football First, Second and First (7pm) Maybe Caroline will choose to show pity on Ben Hendy from Southampton who writes: \"I'm 26, work in cancer care, smoker (nice irony), GSOH, willing to spend far too much of my salary on a g/f, relatively attractive, male-pattern baldness still at a stage where I can disguise it.\" Newstalk 106: Off the Ball with Ger Gilroy (7pm) What should Caroline do? Email the.boss@theguardian.com and help her decide."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
