Ramsey scored in each half in victory against Hungary and Giggs is adamant there is further room for Wales \u2013 who reached the semi-finals of Euro 2016 under Chris Coleman \u2013 to grow. \u201cIt is a special, special night,\u201d he said. \u201cThe lads have showed great determination and quality and a never-give-up attitude. They deserve all the plaudits. \u201cThere was no room for error and the quality and concentration they have shown, they deserve it. It is one of the greatest nights of my life. I achieved a lot as a player but it\u2019s different as a manager, the pressure you are under, and you are helpless as a manager. I was never nervous as a player but as a manager you are. Come game day, it is out of your hands. \u201cAs a player, you want to play in major championships. My first memory of a major championship was the 1982 World Cup. It\u2019s different as a manager. This is different. \u201cIt feels amazing \u2013 the group of players I have got and my staff. I am a relatively young coach and I could not have done it without my staff. Together we did it. As a player, basically you look after yourself. You are quite selfish. As a manager you have to manage everything, so it\u2019s a completely different kettle of fish. This is just the beginning. We have seen a lot of young players over the last 18 months and they can get better.\u201d Giggs was effusive in his praise of Ramsey, who scored his first Wales goals since September last year \u2013 a first-half header from a Gareth Bale cross followed by a close-range finish two minutes after the interval. \u201cWe have missed him,\u201d Giggs added. \u201cWe have some very good players but they don\u2019t grow on trees \u2013 players who make the difference. Aaron was the difference.\u201d Ramsey said: \u201cWe had the best time of our lives in France so we wanted to make sure we really got it this time, having missed out on the World Cup. It was a big effort and I missed a lot of this campaign but it was all worthwhile and to chip in with a couple of goals is amazing. We inspired a nation last time out [at Euro 2016], so we wanted to do it again.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
