With results declared for 98 of the 120 constituencies being contested, the ruling Zanu-PF had taken 62 seats - enough for a majority in the 150-member parliament, where 30 MPs are appointed by Mr Mugabe. Mr Tsvangirai's Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) had won 35 seats. Mr Mugabe gained stronger support in the countryside for his seizures of white-owned farms, but observers fear that voters in isolated and sparsely populated rural constituencies are also more easily intimidated than those in the towns. \"We do not accept that this represents the national sentiment,\" said Mr Tsvangirai. \"The government has fraudulently, once again, betrayed the people. We believe that the people of Zimbabwe must defend their vote and their right to free and fair elections.\" The MDC went into the election holding 51 seats, but admitted that it could end up with only 40. Some observers expected Zanu-PF to gain a two-thirds majority in parliament, which would allow Mr Mugabe to rewrite the constitution unopposed. Mr Tsvangirai said his party would do more than simply appeal against the result in the courts, which the government has packed with sympathetic judges. But he would not say what action it would take. Previous attempts at protest have been violently crushed by security forces and members of the ruling party's youth militia. The MDC has avoided confrontation in recent years. The US said the voting process had been tainted. \"The election process all along has been tilted in favour of the government,\" said Richard Boucher, a spokesman for the state department. Controversy surrounded the election of Mr Mugabe's nephew, Patrick Zhawao, a Zanu-PF candidate, in Manyame constituency, south-west of Harare. Election officials announced on Thursday night that about 15,000 people had voted. They then said yesterday morning that the total turnout was 24,000, and that Mr Zhawao had received more than 15,000 votes. \"I won. I was leading. Suddenly I hear about 24,000 votes, and I don't know where the extra 10,000 came from,\" said the losing MDC candidate, Hilda Mafudze. \"It is the first example of what we are going to start seeing from here on.\" As Zanu-PF supporters carried a mock coffin representing the MDC through the constituency, election officials refused to comment on the discrepancy in their figures. The officials said they doubted there was any rigging. Before the voting, Mr Mugabe changed electoral law to allow army officers, largely loyal to the ruling party, to serve as election officials. Opponents of Mr Mugabe drew comfort from the fact that his party had failed to recapture Zimbabwe's cities. Iden Wetherell, a senior journalist with two of the last remaining independent newspapers, said: \"The youth, the educated, the skilled are in the cities. They are the future of Zimbabwe and they have rejected Mugabe again, against all odds. They are completely alienated from him.\" An MDC source said the party had not decided what to do next: \"This is crunch time. What can 40 seats in parliament do? We know that taking the legal route, challenging the elections in the courts, will lead nowhere. Do we call people to mass action? That is difficult to do.\" Following international pressure to hold a legitimate election, Mr Mugabe allowed the MDC to campaign and hold rallies in the run-up to the vote. Opposition supporters suffered less violence than in previous election campaigns, but in some rural areas MDC voters were denied access to state-controlled grain supplies. Tactics used to fix the poll included inflating the voters' roll with \"ghost voters\" and denying the MDC access to state-controlled media. An independent monitoring group, the Zimbabwe Election Support Network, said up to 25% of those who tried to vote had been turned away because their names did not appear on the electoral roll or they failed to present proper identification. State electoral officials said about 10% of voters had been turned away from polling stations. Turnout was about 42%, compared with 48% in the 2000 general election."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
