For the righteous, it is probably hell. And no sport affords its leading lights more time to dally with the devil than cricket. Every year the best players spend up to three months at a time a long way from home on tour. The Caribbean, Australasia, Africa and the Indian subcontinent - none is at the end of the District Line. The opportunities to play a few shots are there on a nightly basis, and some people forget to pack their halos. There is also the 'while the cat's away' factor, which must encourage its own anxiety. When they return, it's back to six-days-a-week travelling up and down the country with their counties or playing in a home series, as well as the welter of one-day games. It's a wonder they don't all end up in the divorce court. There is no parallel to this pressure in modern professional sport. Compared to the marriage-breaking schedule of cricket, football, with its five-week World Cup every four years, provides far fewer excuses for players to sin or be sinned against; rugby league and union tour hard and fast - a major criticism of the last Lions tour was that it was too short and intense, allowing little time for the traditional socialising; the Olympics last two-and-a-half weeks; grand-prix drivers compete on an international circuit but have breaks between events; tennis players and golfers ditto (America's Ryder Cup players even bring their wives as part of the entourage, dressing them identically - which must make wife-swapping precarious). Cynics will observe that some rascals need considerably less time than three months to fall from the heights of fidelity. The more deeply cynical will say time away from home might save some marriages. Either way, as practically a year-round job, what we like to call the summer game brings with it more strains and temptations than any other sporting occupation. The list of high-profile cricketers who have experienced relationship troubles (of whatever kind) in recent years is a long one: Graham Gooch, Dominic Cork, Mark Butcher, Darren Gough, Michael Slater and Graham Thorpe, who has decided, for the second and apparently final time, not to tour Australia this winter. At least the England and Wales Cricket Board are more prepared than they were to address the problems of separation. When Peter May famously invited his then fianc\u00e9e, Virginia, to join him on the 1958-59 tour of Australia, he was accused of abusing his privileges as captain. When Nasser Hussain's wife, Karen, joins him on the Ashes tour, she will stay on in Australia to have their second child. England's age of relative enlightenment started two South African tours ago, when the ECB paid for partners to join the players. So keenly did wives and girlfriends take up the ECB's offer that the team manager John Barclay was heard to mutter after arranging the arrival of yet another wife: 'I've turned into a travel agent.' When England next toured South Africa, in 1999-2000, Thorpe made himself unavailable, and received a sympathetic hearing from the selectors when he said he needed a rest after 10 consecutive winters away. But no amount of understanding by the management could help poor Thorpe this time. Very few players knock back an Ashes tour, still the ultimate test for English cricket, and to weaken the battalion is not looked on kindly, whatever the understanding response of Duncan Fletcher and Hussain. Thorpe, at 33, might struggle to establish his credentials next summer, which would be a great pity. He would seem to be in turmoil after the breakdown of his marriage (the decree nisi was granted last week) and Thorpe wants to spend as much time with his children as he can before his wife emigrates with her new partner to South Africa. Is Thorpe doing the right thing? It would be ridiculous to say he should put a mere game before his family. Yet, in one way, England's most naturally gifted batsman of recent times might come to regret turning his back on what he does best: playing Test cricket. It defines him, gives him purpose. If there is calm in his life, it is likely he finds it these days at the crease. Indeed, after he came home from the India tour to try to sort out his marital problems, he rejoined the England team in New Zealand, scoring the fourth fastest double century in the history of the game. And, when he returned after his self-imposed break at the end of the summer, he scored a century in Surrey's final game. It was instructive to listen to Thorpe's Surrey captain, Adam Hollioake, talking recently about how the death of his brother, Ben, in a car crash last March affected his cricket and, more importantly, his outlook on life. He'd been tempted to quit the game, he admitted, but decided that, after a few months away, he would carry on. He has used cricket not only as a tribute to Ben but as a release from grief. 'If I'd given up the game,' he told me, 'it wouldn't have been because I was running away, it would have been because I had more important things to do, like looking after my family.' Yet he played on with an attitude seemingly at odds with his personal circumstances - and certainly rare in professional sport. So freely and fiercely did Hollioake bat that he led the county to victory in the championship and scored 718 runs in only 12 innings, easily the best strike rate in the country. Along the way he hit 24 sixes, more by far than anyone else in the championship and a clear barometer that he was at ease with himself. He added an emphatic full stop to his season with a career-best 208 against Leicestershire last weekend. Hollioake said that, at 29, he had reverted to how he played in his youth, when he played for enjoyment rather than money. Now he has managed the hardest trick of all: he does both. As he put it, he just gives the ball 'a good old-fashioned clout'. If the selectors had wanted to try something imaginative, they could have done worse than name Hollioake as Thorpe's replacement instead of Robert Key. The form he is in, he could have done something outrageous in Australia. Those who know Thorpe well - and his two captains know him better than most - say he too is a self-contained individual who doesn't give cricket more attention than it warrants. He is not obsessed. That is mainly due to his ability, because there have not been many crises in his playing career. Some time ago he said in an interview with a BBC website: 'If you are struggling and think you are going to fail with the bat then it is better to be positive rather than think you are just going out to bat and trying to save your neck.' If Thorpe does come back, it might help to go with that option, to rediscover the uncomplicated satisfaction in cricket that has so transformed Adam Hollioake's game - and his philosophy on life."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
