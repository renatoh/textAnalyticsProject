A jury at Southwark crown court said in a note to the judge that it had not been able to reach a unanimous verdict on similar charges facing Bailey's former boss, AIT executive chairman Carl Rigby. A third defendant, former sales director Alistair Rowley, was acquitted. All three faced two counts of making a misleading statement to the stock exchange - an offence that can be prosecuted by the Financial Services Authority, the City watchdog, under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Bailey was found guilty on one count of recklessly making a misleading statement to the stock exchange. He was acquitted on a more serious count of knowingly making the misleading statement. The statement at the heart of the case, issued on May 2, 2002, stated that AIT 's profits for the year to March 31 were in line with market expectations of \u00a36.7m. During the trial, counsel for the FSA claimed the statement relied on revenues from three contracts, worth \u00a34.8m, that had not been subject to binding agreements. Within weeks of the statement, AIT issued two negative trading updates that prosecutors said were responsible for wiping \u00a393m, or 94%, off the firm's market value. The jury was also told of three side letters, sent to AIT customers, which were allegedly not shown to AIT's auditors. Prosecutors claimed the three critical contracts had been \"effectively undone\" by these letters. After two days' deliberation, the jury yesterday sent a note to the judge saying: \"We have reached unanimous decisions on two of the defendants but cannot do so on the remaining defendant. Your directions would be greatly appreciated.\" The judge asked jurors to continue seeking a unanimous verdict. Deliberations will continue this morning."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
