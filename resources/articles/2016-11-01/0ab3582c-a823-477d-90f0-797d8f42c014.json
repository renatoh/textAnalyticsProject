Hugh Davies QC said in a letter published by the home affairs select committee that the inquiry\u2019s leadership must provide a clear public explanation of what the allegations were, how they were investigated and what has been done to identify and address future risks. Davies was the only lawyer who commented publicly on the events that have rocked the national inquiry over the past two months, following a request from the committee for written evidence on the departure of a series of high-ranking legal experts. \u201cIt is in the public interest that [the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse] IICSA succeeds,\u201d Davies said, and greater clarity on the allegations of sexual assault at the inquiry\u2019s London headquarters would promote the chances of that. All the other lawyers who have left, including the former lead counsel Ben Emmerson QC, his deputy, Elizabeth Prochaska, and another counsel, Toby Fisher, cited confidentiality to the inquiry as a reason not to comment to MPs. The chair of the inquiry, Prof Alexis Jay, refused to waive that confidentiality. Emmerson was suspended in September and then resigned. Two weeks earlier, Prochaska left the inquiry. Since then, a number of other lawyers have left. Davies, who left the inquiry in 2015, said the lack of any explanation about allegations made by a junior member of staff against Emmerson left \u201can impression that, rather than investigating \u2026 IICSA has reached a de facto compromise agreement \u2026 and ended the investigation\u201d. The committee report said the allegations involved claims that Emmerson sexually assaulted an inquiry worker in a lift. He denies the allegations. Davies\u2019 testimony was released as MPs on the committee published a critical report on the troubled investigation, and called for robust action to deal with the allegations and restore public confidence in the inquiry. Yvette Cooper, the chair of the committee, said the inquiry\u2019s response had been \u201cwholly inadequate\u201d. Robust action was needed to restore public confidence, including the appointment of an external person to investigate the case. \u201cGiven that the inquiry was set up to challenge institutions for covering up internal problems or ignoring abuses of power, it is crucial that it shows it has a robust and transparent approach to dealing with problems of its own,\u201d she said. Cooper stopped short of supporting calls from fellow Labour MP Chuka Umunna for Jay to step down in favour of a senior judge, but, she said, \u201cthe inquiry needs to get back on track \u2026 it is too important to be sunk by problems \u2026 urgent action is needed to sort them out.\u201d She criticised delays in setting up the Truth Project and holding public hearings, which showed a \u201csignificant weakness\u201d in engaging with survivors. Cooper called for the inquiry to appoint a new counsel as a priority and to consider splitting its work into two strands; a forensic, lawyer-led investigation to establish the truth about past institutional abuse, and a second strand looking at thematic issues around child protection. The report was published as a person from the survivors panel, which was set up as part of the inquiry, called for it to be allowed to get on with its job. Chris Tuck said she had suffered vicious trolling on social media by some survivors that was hard not to take personally. \u201cThe few people who want this inquiry disbanded are robbing the victims and survivors \u2026 of the opportunity to finally have their voices heard,\u201d she said. Davies said that despite confidentiality issues he was able to comment in the interests of transparency on the allegations of bullying and sexual assault matters that had been in the public domain. When taken together, they left a negative impression, which was compounded by unofficial briefings from inquiry sources in the media that undermined the alleged victim\u2019s account. \u201cI would criticise any failure by an institution to act, and IICSA must expect to be judged by the same standards it will doubtless set for others,\u201d he said. \u201cIICSA will investigate and make findings on institutions that have put reputational advantage ahead of a duty to investigate, including the use of compromise agreements with the subject of disclosure. If that is what has occurred here, the reputational harm to IICSA is obvious. If it is not, it is in IICSA\u2019s interests to correct this impression.\u201d Any disclosure of bullying or sexual assault relating to the conduct of a senior member of staff towards a more junior employee, whether it was a formal complaint or not, amounted to abuse of power, he wrote. \u201cHistory demonstrates that, where bullying or other abuse reflects an imbalance of power between individuals, it is more likely to be repeated,\u201d he added. Jay said in a statement: \u201cWe recognise that the past few months have been difficult for the inquiry, and for the victims and survivors who have placed their trust in it. I am personally sorry for any unnecessary anxiety the inquiry may have caused to victims and survivors during this transitional period.\u201d She said the inquiry would appoint an external senior legal figure to review some of the issues raised in the committee\u2019s report."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
