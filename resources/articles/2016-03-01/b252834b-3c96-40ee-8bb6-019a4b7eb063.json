Luqman Onikosi, 36, was studying at the university when he was diagnosed with hepatitis B in 2009 \u2013 the same disease that led to the deaths of two of his brothers. He has since developed cirrhosis, a chronic liver disease. The protesters feel the university, where Onikosi was completing a master\u2019s degree before his leave to remain in the UK was rejected, could do more to save him from deportation. Deporting him would amount to a death sentence due to his poor health, they said. After completing his BA at Warwick University, Onikosi landed a job with the Nigerian embassy in London but could not continue working when his condition worsened. Losing his visa, he applied to remain on medical grounds. As he waited for the decision, which was eventually rejected, he raised fees to study for a master\u2019s at Sussex University, near Brighton, through a crowdfunding campaign. While completing his dissertation for the MA in global political economy, his second appeal to remain on the grounds of human rights was rejected. The university then revoked his student status on the direction of the Home Office. A student spokesperson for the occupation said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t really any medical doubt he would die through total organ failure without proper treatment. We just can\u2019t believe the Home Office are doing this to him. We are outraged.\u201d Due to his condition, his liver function requires regular monitoring, which cannot be done in many parts of Nigeria. If his leave to remain had been approved, he had hoped for a life-saving liver transplant. \u201cWe felt the university [was] just doing exactly what the Home Office said,\u201d the spokesperson continued. \u201cA member of the student community is being deported to his death. Universities aren\u2019t powerless. They are huge institutions. We are shocked that our university is willing to stand by and watch as a student dies. \u201cHe could be deported at any time, so we felt we had to take radical action now. We\u2019re planning to stay until the university listens to us. To leave any earlier than that would be abandoning Luqman. We have to stay and fight.\u201d A university spokesperson said: \u201cWe understand the group of students are supporters of Mr Onikosi, a former student of the university. The students are currently based in a conference room in one of our buildings. \u201cWe are, and have always been, very sorry to know of Mr Onikosi\u2019s illness. The status of Mr Onikosi\u2019s visa is a directive from the Home Office and the university is not able to influence that decision in any way.\u201d Speaking to the Independent in February, Onikosi urged the government to see him as \u201can equal human being\u201d. \u201cI\u2019ve paid international student fees and taxes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe British government does not see me as human but as dispensable.\u201d A larger demonstration is planned by the students at 1pm on Thursday at the university."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
