The loosehead prop damaged it in the 44th minute of the thumping victory over the French and his fitness is a concern with their grand slam eliminator against Wales coming up on Saturday week. Having hobbled off the pitch Vunipola was later seen with an ice pack strapped to his left ankle and England will continue to assess the 28-year-old before confirming the extent of the injury. Eddie Jones will hope that, with an extra week to prepare for the trip to Cardiff, Vunipola is available, not least because of the vastly impressive performances he has produced against Ireland and France. In Dublin he was voted the official man of the match after making 27 tackles and 11 carries against Ireland in a performance described by Eddie Jones as \u201coutstanding\u201d. He was similarly prominent against France and, while Jones has Ellis Genge and Alec Hepburn in the wings, Vunipola\u2019s absence in Cardiff would be a colossal blow. He missed out on the autumn internationals with a calf injury but his return to the starting XV along with his brother Billy and Manu Tuilagi has been a key part of England\u2019s transformation during the Six Nations. Indeed the scrum-half, Ben Youngs, believes that England are playing better now than they have at any stage in Jones\u2019s three-year tenure. \u201cFrom what I remember since I\u2019ve been involved with Eddie, yes,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably not higher intensity, just more consistent within it. Maybe that\u2019s maturity, personnel. It\u2019s certainly happy out there at the moment and I think you can probably see that from 1-23, when guys are out there, they\u2019re thriving and absolutely loving what they\u2019re doing. We are going to embrace and enjoy the big two-week build-up to Wales. We have a few days to get away from camp and spend time with the families. Then, when we get in on Wednesday, we will build it up.\u201d France, meanwhile, have been plunged further into disarray, with the scrum-half, Morgan Parra, taking aim at the coaching methods of Jacques Brunel, whose decision to select two centres on the wings and a wing at full-back has been heavily criticised. \u201cI think that we are capable of doing what the English do, but are we working on this during training? I think we don\u2019t work on it enough, even not at all,\u201d he said. \u201cYet these are very simple things that are today part of high-level rugby. We can do this. But do we work on it? No.\u201d The French rugby newspaper Midi Olympique on Monday ran a banner headline that read \u201cWaterloo\u201d and reported that \u201ca wind of rebellion rises again\u201d. One unnamed player told it that \u201cnobody knew which position to play\u201d in the second half. \u201cIt was chaos,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were lost on the pitch and tried to ask the bench.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
