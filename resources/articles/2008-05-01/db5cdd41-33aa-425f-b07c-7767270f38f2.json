Indeed, it goes some way towards justifying the existence of the next-gen consoles thanks to fearsome AI (drivers nudge you off and spin in front of you), incredible physics and damage engines and gloriously gritty graphics. Structurally, it establishes a new benchmark too. You start off as a driver for hire, taking on assignments in Europe, the US and Japan; soon, you have enough money to start your own team, and eventually you can employ another driver. You can rewind time for a short while (handy when you hit a kerb and take off), and all forms of motorsport are present, including endurance racing, open-wheel racing, drifting and \"touge\" street-racing (in Japan) and even stock cars. Makes the squeaky-clean, damage-free GT5: Prologue feel like Pole Position."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
