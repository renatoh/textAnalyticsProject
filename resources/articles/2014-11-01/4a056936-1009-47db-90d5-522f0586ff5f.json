Falcao has a calf injury, Evans a foot problem, Da Silva a muscular complaint, and Jones is recovering from a shin problem. All the issues are severe enough that they might not even make the bench for the game on 22 November at the Emirates. Asked if any of the quartet might return, Van Gaal said: \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so because now some of them have already not played for five, six, seven weeks. They could sit on the bench because they can play 20 minutes but I cannot put a lot of players who are not 100% fit on the bench. You saw what happened with [Paddy] McNair [getting cramp against Crystal Palace] because the rhythm of the game is very high in the Premier League.\u201d While Robin van Persie has picked up a minor problem and is unavailable for Holland\u2019s friendly with Mexico on Wednesdaythere is confidence the United striker can return for Sunday\u2019s Euro 2016 qualifier with Latvia. \u201cVan Persie is not quite fit,\u201d said Guus Hiddink, the Holland coach. \u201cHe trained today but he did not fully participate. I don\u2019t think he will be used against Mexico.\u201d The many injuries suffered by United this season have clearly hampered Van Gaal in his selections and none more so than in defence. The manager has been forced to field 11 different combinations at centre-back and along with Da Silva\u2019s current lay-off, Luke Shaw, the left-back, has also been injured. David de Gea has said that this has provided a challenge to him as goalkeeper. \u201cIt obviously makes things very difficult but that\u2019s football and it\u2019s my job to be able to adapt to different situations. \u201cAs a goalkeeper it\u2019s important to form a good understanding with your back four and become familiar with each other\u2019s positions on the pitch. It\u2019s difficult when the players aren\u2019t there but you have to adapt and concentrate on your job. The experience has definitely helped me improve. \u201cWe would never use excuses but it\u2019s always going to be a big setback when we have injuries and some sendings-off as well. It makes everyone\u2019s work that bit more difficult. \u201cIn terms of maintaining a solid level of performance we need to have the consistency of players in the squad so hopefully everyone will be fit very soon. That will help us continue to improve.\u201d Van Gaal, meanwhile, has been accused of having a \u201chuge ego\u201d by Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, the Bayern Munich president. The Dutchman was coach of Bayern from 2009-11 and Rummenigge told Germany\u2019s Spiegel magazine: \u201cAs soon as he presented his autobiography in a snobby restaurant I knew hard times were ahead. Louis van Gaal was not always easy care. He wanted to \u2018Vangaalise\u2019 our club. He has a huge ego.\u201d Rummenigge, however, did describe Van Gaal as a \u201cgood and successful coach\u201d and today the Real Madrid manager, Carlo Ancelotti, echoed the United manager\u2019s recent criticism of one of the summer arrivals at United, \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda. Ancelotti said the forward can \u201close control sometimes\u201d. Ancelotti managed Di Mar\u00eda last season, which culminated in the 26-year-old Argentina winger being voted the man of the match in Real\u2019s Champions League triumph in Lisbon, when they beat Atl\u00e9tico Madrid 4-1 after extra-time. Di Mar\u00eda was sold to Manchester United in August for a British record \u00a359.7m, with James Rodr\u00edguez, the Colombia forward, replacing him at Real. Ancelotti said: \u201cPeople should think twice before saying that James can fill Di Mar\u00eda\u2019s boots because they\u2019re very different players. Di Mar\u00eda could take matches by storm with his energy, but he also used to lose control sometimes, misplacing important passes.\u201d After United\u2019s victory over Palace, Van Gaal, who replaced Di Mar\u00eda on 71 minutes, said of the Argentinian: \u201cHe has played in a very small space and he is a dribbler. But sometimes you cannot dribble, you have to make it a pass game and Di Mar\u00eda is not a player who wants to give a pass every time he gets the ball. Therefore he lost the ball a lot of times and that was not good for the balance of the team.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
