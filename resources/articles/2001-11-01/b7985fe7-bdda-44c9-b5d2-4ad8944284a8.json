You can tell by the way they cry his surname in fake South American style, with at least six Rs and 10 Ls. If it gets much longer they will have to play extra-time to fit it all in. But Marinelli, 21, does look something special, especially when pitted, as on Saturday, against a Derby County side for whom relegation must already be a certainty. He was allowed excessive freedom to display his ball skills, and \"the boy from the Argentinian pampas\", as the local radio myth must have it (he was actually born in Buenos Aires), has such talent in abundance. Marinelli, signed for \u00a31.5m from Boca Juniors two years ago, may prove to be one of Bryan Robson's lasting gifts. He was never going to be much use to Robson - you don't buy skinny South American teenagers with limited English for the purpose of avoiding relegation - but Steve McClaren's progressive coaching style and a more confident atmosphere may bring out the best in him. For every uplifting foreign signing, Middlesbrough have served up a dud. That warns against excessive optimism. But Robbie Mustoe, Boro's long-serving midfielder who has shrewdly observed the comings and goings in the Riverside stadium's transit lounge, confidently extols Marinelli's qualities. \"When he gets the ball at his feet he is as good a player as I have seen here,\" Mustoe said. \"His ability is fantastic. The way Derby played made it easy to get the ball to him and we did it as much as we could.\" Inquire how Derby played and the only answer that really matters is \"badly\". But they also played 4-3-3, with Benito Carbone occasionally drifting infield, not so much playing \"in the hole\" as occasionally having a peek at it. Marinelli's confidence blossomed, he scored his first Boro goal with a perfectly executed half-volley at the far post, from Jonathan Greening's deep left-wing cross, and later added a second, beating Mart Poom at his near post after evading Luciano Zavagno. McClaren's stock on Teesside faltered when the season began with heavy home defeats against Arsenal and Newcastle. Now the back four of old - the likes of Festa, Fleming, Vickers and Gordon - has been jettisoned and a cute passing style is in its embryonic stages. That did not suit everyone's taste in a misshapen first half. \"Too much tippy-tappy\" came one cry from the stand, with some justification. Then Boro tippy-tapped five second-half goals, beginning with Szilard Nemeth's knock-in after Poom failed to hold Marinelli's scudding shot. With Alen Boksic chipping in off a post, and Mustoe scoring from 25 yards, delight descended. Fabrizio Ravanelli worked hard on his Teesside return but his limbs are stiff now. The Italian, a hero at Boro for his goalscoring feats, a villain for his criticism of some half-baked training attitudes, received a warm reception. He scored, too, slamming in a free-kick with a minute left. But at the final whistle the applause cascaded down for the Argentine long on name and long on talent. Man of the match: Carlos Marinelli (Middlesbrough)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
