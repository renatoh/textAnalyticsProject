Surprisingly the 22-year-old has only one century to show for 53 ODIs since his debut against Sri Lanka in 1998-99. Danish Kaneria This 22-year-old leg-spinner, seen as Mushtaq Ahmed's most likely successor, was referred to as \"Pakistan's secret weapon\" by General Tauqir Zia, president of the Pakistan Cricket Board, when he forced his way into the side against England two winters back. He has played six ODIs and taken seven wickets. Yasir Hameed Though he kept wicket at Chelmsford 25-year-old Yasir is here as a batsman and occasional off-spinner. After making six against Scotland he became one of the successes of the warm-ups, averaging just under 50. Like Nazir, he is an explosive bat. Shabbir Ahmed Like Shoaib Akhtar, 27-year-old Shabbir's early career was threatened by a suspect bowling action. Although he made his debut in 1999 he has only played seven ODIs. Now cleared, he is tall, brisk and capable of steep bounce. He started the tour well by taking three Scottish wickets for 41. Misbah-ul-Haq Preferred to Faisal Iqbal for this visit, 29-year-old Misbah is a right-handed middle-order batsman. His two warm-up innings produced only 21 runs, but since his late arrival at international level he has averaged 42. Umar Gul A duck and one wicket for 50 are all this 19-year-old right-handed fast bowler has to show for his two warm-up outings, and his six ODIs have brought only five wickets at 35. However, his bowling promise is confirmed by a first-class average well below 20, which makes him one for the future. Bilal Asad A 24-year-old all-rounder yet to play a full international, Bilal opened successfully against Essex but usually bats lower down. He may still have to wait for his ODI debut - he was originally preferred to Abdul Razzaq but now Razzaq has been added to the squad. Mohammad Hafeez As a right-handed opening batsman Hafeez has improved during the warm-ups, with 38 against Northamptonshire and 54 at Leicester. His off-spin is proficient enough to class him as an all-rounder. He made his ODI debut against Zimbabwe in the Sharjah Cup last winter, and has played nine to date."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
