The impact of the closures is that youth courts in England and Wales, which are housed in magistrates courts, are facing increased workloads as cases are moved to the remaining open courts. Criminal cases involving children are taking almost 40% longer than they used to, partly because of the problem in getting a court date. Last year, youth cases took an average of 142 days from offence to completion, compared with 101 in 2011. In the slowest region, Sussex Central, the average time was 491 days last year. The delays go against the guidelines for youth cases, which say children should be dealt with as quickly as possible. In Manchester youth court, trials for children are being booked well into 2020 after five out of the nine magistrates courts in the Greater Manchester region closed since 2011. Children from Bury and Rochdale, which no longer have their own court, waited 324 days on average last year. But getting a national picture on what has happened to youth courts during nine years of austerity is difficult, with even the government admitting it does not know how many remain. In response to a Guardian freedom of information request on how many youth courts closed between 2010 and 2018, the Ministry of Justice said it did not hold the information because there was \u201cno legal or business requirement\u201d for it to do so. \u201cYouth courts take place in magistrates court and are not a separate category of court building. Some magistrates courts hear youth work while others do not. A youth court can sit in any suitable HMCTS [Her Majesty\u2019s Courts and Tribunals Service] building where necessary, but only approved magistrates can hear youth court work. Whether a court is or is not hearing youth work is something that can change over time as it is not routinely identified in the name of the site,\u201d said the MoJ response, which came from the HMTCS property directorate. The Youth Justice Board, a non-departmental public body responsible for overseeing the youth justice system in England and Wales, said it also did not know how many youth courts remained open. The MoJ had to make cuts of 25% in the four years to 2014-15 as part of the 2010 spending review under the coalition government. The department was also under pressure to make money. The courts sold between 2010 and February 2018 raised \u00a3224m for the public purse. Since 2010 there has been a 75% drop in children going through the criminal justice system: 26,881 children aged 10-17 received a caution or sentence in England and Wales in 2018, compared with 106,969 in 2010. The government continues to look to savings in the court system and earlier this year said it was acceptable for users to have to travel two hours for justice: leaving home \u201cno earlier than 7.30am, attend their hearing, and return home by 7.30pm\u201d. But youth justice practitioners warn that if journey times were to increase then those attending court would experience greater stress and anxiety \u2013 particularly children, who may not have the means to pay for a longer journey. Many youth lawyers complain that their clients now have to travel too far for their hearings and cannot afford the bus or train fare. Responding to a government consultation earlier this year, one youth magistrate warned: \u201cWe are expecting minors to spend a day, sometimes without adult supervision, to make their own way to a courthouse which is miles away. Children and young people should and are considered as vulnerable and I do not think this is appropriate or achievable for a large number of young defendants or witnesses.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
