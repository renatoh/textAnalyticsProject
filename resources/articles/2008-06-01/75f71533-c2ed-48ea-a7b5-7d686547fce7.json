Fewer still could make it sound anything more than a gimmick. Beggars' take on The Future, Cohen's spare tale of apocalypse, starts with a stomp and ends with a snap, its head-waggling midsection full of funky foreboding. It certainly gets things off on the right foot. Indeed, though this Reading four-piece formed less than two years ago, have yet to play a headlining tour and are performing with their keyboardist for the first time, they sound splendidly honed, their set polished till it glints after dates supporting Joe Lean and the Jing Jang Jong. Still, unusual covers aside, there's nothing terribly novel about their sound, which borrows from the same Merseybeat template as the La's and the Coral yet is neither as transcendent as the former nor eclectic as the latter. This is a band in love with the classic look: buttoned-up shirts and skinny black jeans, tousled mops drizzled over their ears. Their tunes are as neatly arranged as their appearance: catchy, melodic songs rooted in visceral rhythms that see guitarist Justin Girdler frugging furiously while brother Jamie closes his eyes and taps his feet, his voice halfway between a croon and a spit. The lulls in this impish assault are rare but, much to Beggars' credit, when they do come, they are saved by quality touches - an epic bridge here, a blatant steal from Louie Louie there - and enough raucous harmonies to keep you humming for weeks. This is a band obvious enough to rhyme \"young\" with \"fun\", but what they lack in radicalism they make up for in vigour, and this short, vital set bodes well for their smattering of festival dates, as well as for their debut album, due this autumn. \u00b7 At Glastonbury festival tomorrow, then touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
