However, as positive as he is about the opportunity, his departure from Tottenham still rankles. The former Spurs manager believes Harry Kane would not be the player he is today if he had not stood up to the board 13 months ago and refused to allow the England striker-in-waiting to go out on loan to Derby County. While giving credit to Mauricio Pochettino for building on his legacy at White Hart Lane, Sherwood pointed out that \u201cnot even this guy\u201d can match his highest win ratio as a Spurs manager in the Premier League era. Notwithstanding this retrospective, the Villa manager oozed positivity as he weighed up the opportunities at another big club. Sherwood intends to instil the freedom and belief he imbued in players such as Kane into Christian Benteke as Villa begin a 13-match bid to escape the relegation zone in the Premier League. There is little comparison to be made between the two jobs he has started in the past 14 months. \u201cThe risk of failure at Tottenham was us dropping out of the Europa League slots,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s managed to better my win record, even this guy, Pochettino, and everyone\u2019s talking about how well he\u2019s done. I just need to do what I can do, and I know I\u2019m good enough to do the job. I want that to sound confident, not arrogant. I just believe in my ability to do the job. I just need to get the players onside. It\u2019s all about man-management, how to get the most out of players, and I think I did that at Tottenham because my record suggests I did. \u201cIt\u2019s good for me: I left a bit of a legacy there with those young players. And he [Pochettino] has carried it on, I admire him for that. [But] if I hadn\u2019t resisted the club wanting to loan him [Harry Kane] out last January, he wouldn\u2019t be Harry Kane now. \u201cHe\u2019s got a strong mentality which is embedded in himself. But we will take attitude over ability all day long \u2013 and when you\u2019re a kid you have to have the attitude and the application. Your ability will shine through in the end. He\u2019s had to be very strong mentally, he\u2019s had to fight it, they haven\u2019t always sung: \u2018He\u2019s one of our own\u2019. He\u2019s had to earn the right and he\u2019s earned it now. You try to buy Harry Kane and he\u2019ll cost you a few quid.\u201d Sherwood dismissed the notion that his former assistant Chris Ramsey was the coaching lead in their partnership at Spurs. \u201cI\u2019m not an observer,\u201d he said. \u201cI go out there and coach. I take the main bulk of the session, the technical side.\u201d He wants to build his gameplan at Villa around re-energising Benteke, and improving him. \u201cHe can go on and on, he looks like he has a real good desire to want to listen and improve,\u201d Sherwood said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Christian thinks he\u2019s cracked it yet. I think he\u2019s a real good lad \u2013 he speaks better English than me as well! \u201cI don\u2019t need to watch the DVDs, I know what he\u2019s got: I know he can get in behind, I know he was a beast up there and can bully people. Anything crossed into the box, he used to find it and eat it up \u2013 we need to get back to that. He\u2019s a centre-forward and they have to be the focal point of your side. If they\u2019re in the game a lot you\u2019re not doing bad.\u201d Kevin MacDonald, Villa\u2019s former reserve team and caretaker manager, was on Friday named as Sherwood\u2019s assistant to work alongside Mark Robson, the first-team coach, and Seamus Brady, who is in charge of analysis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
