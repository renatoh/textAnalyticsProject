No newspapers, no magazines, no reference books and, crucially, no novels. Nothing. But. Poetry. It was a mind-bending experience. Don't get me wrong: I'm not complaining, quite the opposite. I'm a sucker for poetry. I'll happily read a collection from cover to cover, and usually get through four or five new ones every month - as well as dipping in and out of volumes and anthologies I've read before. But to consume so much - somewhere in the region of 120 collections, I think - in such a concentrated way, without the leavening effect of prose, effected a profound and - to me, at least - fascinating shift in the way I read. What with one thing (pre-Hay festival reading) and another (a full-time job), I realised some time in March that I was going to need to set aside some dedicated poetry time in order to give proper attention to all the collections. With that in mind, I took two weeks' holiday before the submissions deadline, figuring that if I read solidly, this would give me enough time to read, reread and whittle down my choices to the six collections I was allowed to nominate for each shortlist. My fiction ban came into effect the week before my holiday, during which I read a couple of collections every evening. But things began in proper earnest on the Saturday morning, when I sat down with a pile of slim volumes and a vat of coffee. Over the next fortnight, two things happened. The first was wholly positive: I found that, by immersing myself in poetry, I read with far greater incisiveness and clarity. I no longer needed to make the gear shift that is generally required when you pick up a volume of poetry after reading prose; my ear was attuned to poetry's rhythms, and my eye - accustomed to the sight of poetry on the page - became far quicker at detecting themes, echoes and linguistic flourishes (reading the collections back to back also, of course, allowed me to arrive at qualitative judgments with far greater speed and conviction). As the days passed and the pile of \"read\" volumes grew taller, I also became increasingly aware of what a rare privilege it was to read a year's worth of poetry - I felt as if I was being given an insight into the country's collective conscious. Words resurfaced from collection to collection - caul, clarity, fetch - and themes emerged, of which the most prevalent was water: poets from every part of the British Isles - and beyond - turned again and again to rain, rivers, seas and floods. The subject found its ultimate expression in Sean O'Brien's The Drowned Book, which is a hymn to the wet stuff - a sort of municipal reimagining of Alice Oswald's book-length river poem, Dart. The second effect was more personal and unexpected. I found over the three-week period that I was physically longing for novels. Since I started reading to myself, aged, I guess, about six or seven, I've never been without a storybook - if you'll excuse the expression - for longer than 24 hours. Poetry, I found, stimulates a very different part of your brain from fiction; it enriches, but in different ways. To use a - doubtless hackneyed - food metaphor: if poetry is the haute cuisine of literature (the souffl\u00e9s, the profiteroles), fiction is the meat. And I soon discovered that woman - at least, this woman - cannot live on souffl\u00e9s alone. I craved narrative. About halfway through the fortnight I ventured, blinking, from my house to visit the supermarket for supplies and, without consciously intending it, found myself in a bookshop, where I feverishly bought a stack of novels. I placed them on the corner of my coffee table where they sat taunting me. The judging meeting itself was a treat - it was glorious to be able to emerge from splendid isolation and discuss all the wonderful work that we'd been reading. I'm delighted with our shortlist, heartily recommend all the collections we've chosen, and am looking forward immensely to the final meeting when we select the winners, although the quality of the shortlisted collections is such that vigorous arguments will doubtless ensue. But I must confess that after the meeting I experienced something bordering on bliss, when I sat down with the book I'd lined up (Resistance, by poet-turned-novelist Owen Sheers - it doesn't do to go cold turkey) and binge-read for the whole evening. It's now a week or so later, and I'm somewhat surprised to discover that, after feasting on fiction, I'm feeling the pull of poetry again - far more strongly, in fact, than before my full-body immersion. I think that the experience of reading only poetry has had a positive effect on the way I read, in terms of focus, perception and attention. As such, I'd highly recommend it - but make sure you have a novel to hand, in case the cravings become unbearable."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
