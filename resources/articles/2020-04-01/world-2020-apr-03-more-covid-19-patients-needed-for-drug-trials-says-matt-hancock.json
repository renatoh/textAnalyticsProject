Speaking at the government\u2019s daily coronavirus press conference, Matt Hancock said the government was \u201cbringing together some of the finest research minds in the country\u201d to design and deliver trials at record pace. \u201cWe have established three national clinical trials covering each major stage of the disease: primary care, hospital care and critical care for the most seriously ill,\u201d he said. \u201cJust like the Nightingale hospital, one of these was put together in just nine days, which is breathtaking speed, these trials are looking at the effectiveness of existing drugs and steroids repurposed for treatment for Covid-19. \u201cOne of the trials, which is called recovery and deals in hospital care, is the largest of its kind in the world, with 926 patients involved.\u201d Hancock, who recently emerged from a week of self-isolation after being diagnosed with coronavirus, said more patients were needed to volunteer to take part in the trial. The \u201cbigger the trials, the better the data and the faster we can roll out the treatments\u201d, he said. The deputy chief medical officer for England, Jonathan Van-Tam, said doctors would approach suitable patients about taking part in clinical trials in the UK. \u201cFirst of all, we need the physicians in charge of their care to sign up for the clinical trial. Then it is up to the physician to approach the patient and ask them if they would like to take part,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a process of very careful written informed consent for that to happen. The straight answer is yes, we do need people to take part in the clinical trials, and they are doing.\u201d Van-Tam said he expected it to be a few months before the drug trials yielded results. \u201cIt will all depend on how quickly patients are recruited into the trials across the NHS,\u201d he said. Boris Johnson, who was also diagnosed with Covid-19 last week, announced that he would have to stay in self-isolation in his flat at 11 Downing Street longer than the seven-day minimum because he still had a temperature. The Department of Health confirmed that, as of 5pm on Thursday, 684 more people had died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus, bringing the total deaths in the UK to 3,605. Hancock insisted on Friday there was capacity in the NHS to deal with the crisis, with 2,029 critical care beds currently unoccupied, not including those at the newly opened NHS Nightingale. After growing criticism of the government\u2019s failure to pursue a strategy of mass testing for coronavirus as advocated by the World Health Organization, Hancock made a new pledge on Thursday to complete 100,000 tests a day in England by the end of the month. \u201cI\u2019ve been really delighted by the response since I set that challenge down at this press conference yesterday,\u201d he said on Friday. \u201cMore people have come forward saying that they can turn their capabilities to increasing testing and we\u2019re going to have to hit that target.\u201d Hancock indicated earlier that the coronavirus outbreak could reach its peak in the UK on Easter Sunday, with about 1,000 deaths a day in the lead-up. But speaking at the press conference on Friday evening, he cautioned against over-interpreting his comments, saying the spread of the virus depended on how people adhered to lockdown rules. With the weekend\u2019s weather forecast to be sunny and mild, England\u2019s chief nursing officer, Ruth May, told the press conference that members of the public should not to be tempted to go outside. She urged them to remember the two nurses who had died from the virus. Echoing a plea by the prime minister earlier in the day, she said: \u201cThis weekend is going to be very warm and it will be very tempting to go out and enjoy those summer rays. But please, I ask you to remember Aimee [O\u2019Rourke] and Areema [Nasreen]. Please stay at home for them.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
