Sue Martin, 49, from Cardiff, told BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme her husband, Mal, 58, became progressively worse before an ambulance took him to hospital on 29 March. As he rapidly deteriorated, and with doctors saying there was \u201calmost zero chance he was going to survive\u201d, she and their children, Hana, 16, and William, 13, were allowed to see him for 10 minutes to say their goodbyes. In the interview, recorded on Wednesday, she said: \u201cAlthough every day we prepare for the worst, there\u2019s a little glimmer of just maybe, just maybe, he might turn a corner.\u201d Mal, who is the chairman of a recruitment firm, is diabetic but was fit and well before becoming ill. Sue, a civil servant, called an ambulance 10 days after he first became ill after his breathing became very rapid. She was told he would have to go straight to intensive care and be put on a ventilator and that he was \u201cvery, very sick, and they weren\u2019t sure he was going to come through it\u201d. She said: \u201cHe walked out of the house and I really thought a couple of days on oxygen and he would be back home with us.\u201d Immediately after he was admitted, she and the children managed to FaceTime him before he was placed on a ventilator. \u201cWe just told him how much we loved him,\u201d she said. Her husband promised their daughter he would be at her wedding and would see his son play rugby for Wales. He then texted that he was \u201cgoing to fight it, and it was not his time, and that he was coming home\u201d, she said. Then the text messages stopped and she knew he had been taken to ICU. \u201cThat day really was when everything changed for us. We have just existed since,\u201d she said. Though she was told his chances were 50/50 at first, he then \u201ctook a dive\u201d, with his kidneys failing. \u201cThey said there was almost zero chance he was going to survive,\u201d she said. He was \u201con the brink, and they couldn\u2019t do anything more for him\u201d. After begging to see him, she described the hospital as wonderful, with one nurse waiting behind after shift to be with them. She and the children were allowed 10 minutes and had to wear full personal protective equipment (PPE). \u201cEssentially, we were going in to say our goodbyes.\u201d \u201cIt was like he was just asleep, although he had so many tubes and wires in him. We just told him that we loved him. And it was heartbreaking to hear the children tell him they were going to make him proud.\u201d \u201cWe were really glad to have that time with him.\u201d She said they had fully expected Monday to be his last day but then his blood pressure went up slightly. \u201cThey have obviously made it very clear that he is still extremely, desperately ill, and there was still almost zero chance of him pulling through. \u201cBut that was Monday, and we are on Wednesday, and he has been the same for the last two days. No improvement. But no further deterioration,\u201d she said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
