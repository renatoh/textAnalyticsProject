The UK's largest town has a solid industrial heritage (mainly in textiles), some very impressive Victorian architecture and lies close to many bleak and beautiful moors. Then, of course, there are the lovely, rounded vowel sounds of the north-west, the unmistakable humour (both exemplified by Bolton's most famous son, Peter Kay), as well as the smell of chip fat and Chorley cakes in the air. Gown Ladies and gents, a round of applause, please, for the UK's newest university. The Privy Council approved plans by the Bolton Institute of Higher Education to upgrade itself, and - following an extensive consultation process with partners and stakeholders around the world - it has renamed itself (drumroll please) the University of Bolton! Where they came up with that crazy moniker, no one will ever know. Despite being a proper grown-up university these days, Bolton still exists on two campuses, both within walking distance of the town centre. The Deane campus, in particular, has been the focus of investment with a new design studio and \"knowledge exchange zones\" opening. Top-rated teaching departments Textiles is strong, which is appropriate given Bolton's heritage, wouldn't you say? Top-rated research departments Metallurgy and materials was the strongest performer in the 2001 RAE, with a 4 rating. Celebrity academics Professor Clive Chirwa spends his days with dummies. No, not his students - the crash test variety. He leads research into crash safety. Professor Dick Horrocks is an expert on flame- retardant materials. Head count There are around 8,000 students; 46% of them are female and a whopping 98.2% are from state schools. Of the 282 academic staff, 33% are female. Bolton encourages students from around the world, but is proud of its local roots - almost three-quarters are from the Bolton area. Academic pay Pretty much bang in the middle of the league tables. Lecturers in arts are on something like \u00a329,000; social science lecturers are on about \u00a331,000 and their science colleagues take home about \u00a330,000. Climate Slightly more damp than your average, and maybe a bit chillier too. That's what the chips are for: insulation. Transport links Handy for Liverpool and Manchester - both are less than an hour's drive. Manchester's about 20 minutes on the train. Town is walkable, but there is a good bus service if you don't fancy it. Entertainment For the really glossy nightlife, Liverpool and Manchester are where you will head. But that's not to say that a night out in Bolton would necessarily be spent in a Phoenix Nights-style club. (And would that would be such a bad thing, in any case?) There are cinemas, bowling, shops, bars and restaurants at Middlebrook leisure park and the Valley Centretainment complex (for the love of God, though, Centretainment?). There are plenty of pubs and clubs in town, too. Then there's the Octagon theatre, the Bolton museum and the Bolton Albert Halls, which stages an eclectic mix of tours and shows: it's Barbara Dickson one night, American Wrestling Spectacular the next. Bolton Wanderers play at the Reebok stadium. And don't forget to head out of town to take in some of that scenery. Schools Bolton's LEA performs slightly under par in the league tables. High achievers include the Valley community primary school and Eagley junior school. St Joseph's RC high school, St James CofE secondary or Canon Slade CofE will see you right after that - the latter is good post-16, too. House prices Southerners would be forgiven for thinking they'd stepped into a time machine. But no, it's just the north. Terraces go for an average of \u00a377,000, semis are \u00a3118,000 and detached homes \u00a3249,000. What to say in the common room... \"Garlic bread. I've tasted it, it's the future.\" The essentials bolton.ac.uk \u00b7 To order a copy of the Guardian University Guide 2005 for \u00a314.99 with free UK p&amp;p, call 0870-066 7850"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
