Ian Huntley, 29, is accused of murdering 10-year-old schoolgirls Holly Wells and Jessica Chapman after they entered his home in the Cambridgeshire town on August 4 last year. Mr Huntley's former girlfriend, 26-year-old Maxine Carr, is accused of perverting the course of justice and assisting an offender. The jurors, who have now deliberated for more than 16 hours in total, were dismissed by the trial judge, Mr Justice Moses, at 4pm. Before sending them home, the judge as usual warned them not to discuss the case with each other or anybody else until returning to the jury room tomorrow morning. The seven female and five male jurors were first sent out on Friday morning after the judge completed his summing-up of the 27-day case. He told the jury that verdicts on all charges would have to be unanimous. Two hours later, the jurors briefly returned to court number one of the Old Bailey after making a request to re-examine and measure the bath where Mr Huntley says that Holly drowned. Unusually, the jurors were shown how to use a DVD player and given access to a laptop computer to call up images presented during the trial as well as media interviews given by Mr Huntley and Ms Carr before their arrests in August last year. Mr Huntley, a former caretaker at Soham Village College, denies murdering the girls, but has admitted a single charge of conspiring to pervert the course of justice. The jury has heard he admits that Holly died accidentally in his bath and that Jessica died as he tried to silence her screams, although he insists that he did not mean to kill her. He bundled their bodies into his car, dumped them in a remote ditch near Lakenheath, Suffolk, where they were found 13 days later, cut off their clothes and set fire to the corpses. Ms Carr, a former classroom assistant in the 10-year-olds' class, denies conspiring to pervert the course of justice and two counts of assisting an offender. She has told the jury that she lied to protect her then fiance, giving him a false alibi, but insisted that she never suspected he could be involved in the girls' disappearance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
