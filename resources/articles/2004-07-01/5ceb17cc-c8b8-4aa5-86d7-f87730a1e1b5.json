Rooney, who is recovering from a broken metatarsal bone sustained at Euro 2004, has been granted time off after returning from Portugal and has gone abroad on a two-week holiday. Discussions will continue in his absence, although Everton are braced for the negotiations to be protracted and remain unconvinced that the 18-year-old will re-commit himself. For all the tentative interest from Manchester United, Chelsea and Real Madrid, no club has yet made a formal offer to sign Rooney, who has two years to run on his current deal, although Old Trafford remain the most likely destination should he reject Everton's contract offer. The Everton manager, David Moyes, who has limited funds at his disposal, will seek to raise around \u00a31m by selling Tomasz Radzinski to Fulham. The Canada international, who will link up with the rest of the Everton squad on their pre-season training camp in Austria next week, has rejected a new three-year contract at Goodison Park. The former England manager Glenn Hoddle appears to be out of the running for the vacant role as France national coach. Reports from across the Channel suggest that Laurent Blanc, Jean Tigana and Raymond Domenech are still in the running after the French Football Federation yesterday announced that their shortlist consisted of three names. The former Senegal coach Bruno Metsu withdrew his interest once it became apparent he was an outsider, and Rene Girard, a former assistant national coach who was also on the original list of six contenders, is thought to have been ruled out of contention. The French federation president, Claude Simonet, who will name the successor to Jacques Santini on Monday, said: \"A problem was posed in relation to his [Hoddle's] relations with the national coaching body. His salary also proved a problem.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
