Ducks and moorhens wander in the lanes, and contemplative anglers gaze from the river banks. But look a little closer, and you see that the water running down the village street or flowing into the river is raw sewage. After a year of heavy rain, the public sewage system owned by Southern Water cannot cope. Not for the first time, ground water has infiltrated the pipes, and effluent bubbles up through manholes into the roads and gardens. On bad days residents have found their shower trays fouled and their lavatories full to the brim with backed up sewage. Condoms, sanitary towels and heaps of soggy loo paper have been spread across the fields and footpaths. For nearly five months villagers have had to put up with \"emergency\" measures. They say the sewers and pumping systems need big investment. Southern Water says the problem is a complex one, with responsibility shared between the environment agency, county and borough councils, the highways agency and private owners - in charge of drainage since water privatisation. At St Mary Bourne raw sewage is pumped directly from manholes through a crude filter into the River Bourne, in a field opposite the school playground. Down the road, tankers, contracted from Cleansing Services Group by Southern Water, line up to take away the overflow. \"This happens every few years depending on rainfall. Six years ago Southern Water discovered leaks and damage to pipes. It tried to seal them from the inside, but the repairs have done nothing. As soon as there is pressure on them from rising water, there is the same problem again,\" said Michael Widen, a villager in St Mary Bourne. Permission In Appleshaw, Southern Water has had permission from the environment agency to pump sewage for nearly five months from the manhole outside the Walnut Tree Inn on the village green into an open ditch, which then floods the main road with contaminated water. The road is now in such bad condition it is closed. Jenny Hopkins, who lives on the green, has to put on her wellies to do her washing. Her basement is flooded and sewage fungus grows on the walls. \"This is not a new problem,\" she said. \"In 1995 Southern Water said it would seal leaking joints on its sewers and leaking manholes. The pipes, according to the contractors, are asbestos concrete and were only supposed to last 30 years. They can be breached through cracks. We need investment in new sewers. Southern Water also said leaking private pipes were to blame but it has not informed residents which they are.\" In Chilbolton, it is the same story of pumping night and day, discharging into the river, constant noise and pollution from heavy tankers thundering up and down the village lanes. Victoria Ramsay's thatched cottage is opposite the pumping station and she has been battling for years to get the problem solved. \"They won't invest because they are more interested in their shareholders than in their customers, and now Scottish Power is going to sell Southern Water we despair of getting anyone to sort it out.\" At the end of January the local Liberal Democrat MP, Sandra Gidley, tried to get satisfaction for her constituents. Having failed to get a response to her letters to Southern Water's customer service manager, she sent an open letter to the directors of Scottish Power saying that had in vestment been made in the system, water would not have become contaminated with effluent. \"Are you aware that chartered water engineers are now thought to be an extinct species, because you have squeezed Southern Water's manpower so much? We fear that this is a case, just like Railtrack, of lack of investment over a number of years in order to boost shareholders' profits, at untold cost to the fabric of our community. Now that Southern Water is owned by Scottish Power, who pulls the strings?\" she wrote. Investment Since privatisation in 1989 companies have had their prices set by the regulator, Ofwat, after negotiations on how much money they need for investment. Most companies originally put in huge estimates of what they would need to spend on their assets and then did not spend the money. Profits soared by 147% in the sector in the seven years following privatisation. In the next price review, the regulator imposed big price cuts. Facing reduced returns, many utility groups have been trying to separate their assets from their operations to sell them off. Southern Water underspent on its first and second asset management plans. A spokesman for the environment agency said: \"There were efficiency savings. We pressed very hard for them to spend the money saved on quality improvement.\" When Sir Ian Robinson, chief executive of Scottish Power, replied to Ms Gidley he said that the issue was complex and that leaking private pipes were in part to blame. \"We have to operate within a budget. Our own is fixed by Ofwat. Our capital improvement programme ... is dominated by the requirement to treat waste water before it is discharged to sea. Additional needs have to be carefully prioritised.\" Ofwat rejected the suggestion that its price limits could be blamed for preventing investment. \"The companies could have appealed, but no sewerage company did,\" said Mike Saunders, Ofwat's consumer affairs director. Big programmes of investment were required to meet environmental needs, he said, and Ofwat accepted that companies had to set priorities. \"There is enormous scope in some cases for passing the buck,\" he said. Southern Water's managing director, Stuart Derwent, said the problem was complex, with responsibility falling on several agencies. Many of the areas where ground water used to soak away in the past had been built on or Tarmacked over. \"As soon as you get flooding you are bound to get infiltration of the sewage system. I do not accept that we shift responsibility.\" He rejected the suggestion that the sewers needed to be renewed. \"If there was any obvious damage, we would repair it. We believe the sealing work has been successful. It's not a question of diverting money to sea pollution. In the last price review we were less than happy about the amount available for other works and we are now having productive talks with Ofwat about the high ground water problems.\" He denied that contracting out could compromise service standards, and defended the company's profits. \"We needed to generate unusually high profits to sustain these vast amounts of investment. Water is a very capital intensive business,\" he said. The villagers remain unimpressed. Ms Gidley said: \"It's a nightmare trying to get anything done. But this isn't just a village problem. It's happening everywhere and its going to get worse as the old infrastructure breaks down.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
