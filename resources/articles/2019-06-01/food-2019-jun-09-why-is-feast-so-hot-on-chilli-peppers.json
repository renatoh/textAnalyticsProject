Admittedly Saturday\u2019s edition was some sort of chilli special \u2013 the first 11 pages had recipes from four trusty regulars which all included chillis in at least one form, sometimes more, including Thomasina Miers\u2019 instruction to start children on mild doses to accustom their palates, before building up to the real thing. Perhaps she should have said \u201cnumb\u201d rather than \u201caccustom\u201d, as it seems to me that the ubiquitous chilli is frequently used to mask other flavours or to compensate for their lack. Indeed, chillis are now routinely added to so many savoury foods \u2013 from cauliflower cheese to pizza and ratatouille \u2013 which are perfectly fine without them. So, in the interests of balance, can I suggest that you publish a chilli-free Feast very soon?
