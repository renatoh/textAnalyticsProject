After being snapped looking inebriated on a balcony, holding hands with his Palmer co-star Alisha Wainwright, Timberlake began his Insta-soz post saying: \u201cI stay away from gossip as much as I can.\u201d Of course you do, you marvellous, honourable man! Timbers continued: \u201cA few weeks ago I displayed a strong lapse of judgment \u2013 but let me clear \u2013 nothing happened with my co-star\u2026 I drank way too much that night and I regret my behaviour\u2026 I apologise to my amazing wife and family\u2026 I am focused on being the best husband and father I can be\u2026\u201d Blah blah, yak yak. The post ends with a reference to Palmer \u2013 because, hey ladeez, nothing says \u201csorry\u201d more meaningfully than a film-plug. There\u2019s nothing wrong with an apology, but why did it have to happen on social media? One presumes, as husband and wife, Timberlake and Biel have occasional face-time access to each other (schedules permitting)? And aren\u2019t celebrities constantly gassing about media invasions of their privacy? Yet here\u2019s Timberlake invading his own privacy, blasting out an apology to Biel rather strangely in front of the world, and humiliating Wainwright (the \u201cco-star\u201d; it would appear that no name is necessary) in the process. I\u2019d love to think that this was Biel\u2019s doing: \u201cOi, you messed up in public \u2013 you can apologise in public too.\u201d Sadly, one suspects that this wasn\u2019t so much an apology as a brand-announcement to repair Timberlake\u2019s reputation. So, it\u2019s technically more of an apology to his agent and marketing team. Next time Timberlake needs to apologise to his wife, maybe he should consider doing it with a big bunch of flowers and a box of Milk Tray \u2013 even better, some humility and sincerity behind firmly closed doors. \u2022 Barbara Ellen is an Observer columnist"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
