For months Ipswich have brushed aside talk of Europe with an alacrity which suggested Martin O'Neill was giving them lessons, yet finally the mood is changing. Where once Premiership survival was seen as an achievement, now failure to make the Champions League or Uefa Cup would be a blow. \"Most definitely,\" says Stewart, who saw Ipswich drop to fourth yesterday with Leeds' 2-1 win at Anfield. \"If we don't get into Europe we'll be disappointed.\" The run-in suggests they will make it. Today sees the visit of Newcastle, whose manager Bobby Robson was the last man to qualify Ipswich for Europe in 1982. After that there are home matches against Coventry and Manchester City and trips to Middlesbrough, Charlton and Derby. Rivals must feel the only team missing are American Samoa. Stewart is not expecting to find the net 13 times in one game but the Premiership's leading scorer does have his eye on personal as well as club glory. Like Sunderland's Kevin Phillips last term, he intends to win the golden boot in his first top-flight season. \"My original goal was to be in the top five scorers in the Premiership,\" says Stewart, whose 18 goals put him one ahead of Chelsea's Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink. \"My goal now is to win the golden boot.\" Despite his gleaming convertible Mercedes, the personable Stewart does not come across as a superstar. Perhaps it is the west country accent or the fact that he is devouring sausages and potato rather than broccoli and grilled fish. Maybe it is the CV which shows Bristol Rovers and Huddersfield as his former clubs. Yet his form encapsulates what George Burley is achieving at Ipswich. Where others ignored Stewart because of a perceived lack of pace, Burley paid Huddersfield \u00a32.5m a little over a year ago and has been vindicated. John McGreal, Matt Holland and Jermaine Wright have taken similar, cheaper routes. \"We are proud of the way we improve players,\" says Burley, who has spent around \u00a38m since winning promotion last May. \"And that's not luck, it's a day-in, day-out situation. We like to work on areas of the game where we think we can improve them. People always questioned that lack of pace with Marcus but I think he's got quicker and sharper since he came to the club. \"He's always had a great football brain, but playing with good players, training the way we do and being in this environment has improved him. His all-round game has been exceptional. He's not just a goalscorer, he does a lot with his work-rate and hold-up play.\" The hat-trick Stewart scored at Southampton recently illustrated his striking instinct. He knows, though, that a tougher test lies ahead. \"I think it will be a lot more difficult next season,\" he says. \"People will know what we're like as a team and what I'm like as a player.\" Kevin Phillips has found life harder second time around, yet Stewart is hopeful of continuing in the vein which makes Burley suggest he \"has to be considered\" for England. A former schoolboy international and under-21 squad member, Stewart's self-confidence is plain. \"I always felt I could play at this level,\" he says. \"I just needed someone to have the belief in me like the manager now and the chairman. They have given me the chance to play and to settle a few scores. That's what I've done this season; I've shut a few people up. I'm not going to name names, but they know who they are.\" That hunger is common among the cast-offs and bargains Burley has mixed with local talent. It cannot have gone unnoticed at Middlesbrough that Alun Armstrong, sold to Ipswich for \u00a3500,000 in December, got the equaliser against Liverpool on Tuesday to take his Premiership tally to five. That would make him Boro's second top scorer. Burley's eye for a player is augmented by training which concentrates on technique, organisation and repetition that makes Ipswich's passing and team pattern instinctive. Throw in the flexibility to play 4-4-2 or 3-5-2 and to use the aerial threat of James Scowcroft when necessary, and their success looks more than a flash in the pan. \"I think George Burley's the best manager I've worked with,\" Stewart says. \"Every player goes out knowing their job and how to achieve a win, and as a man-manager he's fantastic. He treats people like adults and I respect him for that because I've come across one or two managers who think you're an eight-year-old and try to treat you like one.\" A unity and sense of purpose is fostered from the top, with the chairman David Sheepshanks holding a pre-season meeting with the players to explain plans and canvass opinion. With increased revenue looming from the stadium expansion, and probably Europe, the future looks bright. \"We wanted to get to this standard within five years,\" Stewart says. \"We've achieved it in six months.\" He expects signings in the summer and believes the club could cope with European competition. \"If we stay clear of injuries, yeah. We've managed that quite well this year - touch wood - and we've done okay.\" Okay? As understatement of the year, that takes some beating."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
