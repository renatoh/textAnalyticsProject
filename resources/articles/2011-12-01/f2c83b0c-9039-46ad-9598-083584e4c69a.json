In either case, I was six and she was my first crush before I knew what a crush was. The year was 1948, the movie was Luxury Liner. Powell was 19, and played a spunky adolescent stowaway on a cruise ship. Her father, George Brent, is the captain, and when he discovers her aboard, she's made to scrub decks, peel potatoes and then play cupid to the various shipboard romances. She was cute, vivacious and captivating. The luxury liner might never have left the soundstages, but Powell convinced you that you were sailing across the ocean, because she sparkled with sincerity and intelligence. And then came the extra enchantment: a magnificent coloratura voice emerged from this petite five-footer, one that could hold its own with Lauritz Melchior, the renowned Wagnerian tenor. So my parents, who were Powell admirers, would take me to every Powell movie that followed \u2013 A Date With Judy, Small Town Girl, Rich, Young and Pretty, Athena, Hit the Deck. My crush grew as she grew from the adorable to the beautiful and, as her versatility increased, displaying unexpected comic timing as the gum-chewing moll with Fred Astaire in their classic duet from Royal Wedding: How Could You Believe Me When I Said I Loved You When You Know I've Been a Liar All My Life. Finally, her performance in Seven Brides for Seven Brothers cemented her stature. Even though jazz and dramatic films took over as I entered my teen years, Powell's name would always leap off the page in an article, and her picture continued to produce a palpitation. But I lost track of her career as she devoted herself to theatre and television. And then I actually met her. Earlier this year, I organised an exhibition of vintage film posters from my collection at the second Turner Classic Movies film festival in Hollywood. Two Jane Powell classics \u2013 Royal Wedding and Seven Brides \u2013 were included in the festival lineup. Powell was scheduled to attend the opening night party with her husband, the former child actor Dickie Moore. It was a very large room on the penthouse floor of the Hollywood Center; hundreds of people were milling around. I kept looking for a familiar face when suddenly, a pair of large dazzling blue eyes caught my attention. They were on the face of a tiny, elegant lady with short blonde hair, dressed in black. It was unmistakable and unbelievable: Powell was walking towards me. I've met many famous and powerful figures over the years, but this time I was beginning to melt. I took the plunge and headed towards Powell and Moore. Introducing myself, I told her how much she had meant to me. She was gracious, friendly and interested. It was a 10-minute encounter. I was churned up, unable to say anything further, and kissed her hand goodbye. I was high for the evening. However, the success of the poster exhibition meant it was transferred to New York. Naturally, we programmed An Evening with Jane Powell. Butterflies proliferated as the moment of her arrival approached. I greeted her at the entrance. She was a vision in a raspberry dress and cashmere shawl, red pocketbook and an unusual shade of red-orange pumps. As I told the audience how she first came into my life, we made eye contact \u2013 the glamorous Powell was smiling at me! Then she walked on to the stage to thunderous applause. Before leaving, I told her I'd send pictures of the posters, especially the Luxury Liner, which she said looked like her daughter, Sissy. She thanked me and I kissed her on both cheeks. Then we hugged. Those dazzling blue eyes looked into mine as she said: \"We have to have dinner when you're next in town.\" The crush continues. Style and Motion: The Art of the Movie Poster is at the Furman Gallery, Lincoln Center in New York until 1 January."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
