How could I be so unobservant? This year it was a fly that betrayed them. I happened to spot the aquamarine from the abdomen of a bluebottle, brilliant in the sunlight but all trussed up on a deathbed of silk. A female cross spider enfolded this turquoise body and was sucking its juices. As I watched the feeding individual, I came to realise that cross spider webs and their occupants were everywhere. The most captivating was the one owned by a gravid female being courted by her suitor. As in many spiders, the garden cross exhibits a striking sexual dimorphism. He is perhaps as long but thinner, finer-bodied and with less than a quarter of her overall mass. Their courtship was an infinitely sensitive piece of choreography, conducted by the delicate touch of 16 translucent legs and four palps (the short feelers at the front of the head), as well as vibrations transmitted through a tracery of silk. He'd press forward, sampling the moods of his partner, proceeding with determination to satisfy his urges, then retreating almost as ardently. Although males can end up satisfying more than her sexual appetite, her desire to eat him is often exaggerated. This female finally got into a posture that enabled copulation, a process that is as strange in spiders as it is difficult to observe. He first transmits his sperm to his palps. She meanwhile presents herself, with four legs cocked mantis-like round her head, and offers to him a small aperture, called the epigyne, at the base of her abdomen. He moves in at super-speed as a mere blur to insert his palps at this vital point, and one registers their union only as an instantaneous flux of diaphanous limbs."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
