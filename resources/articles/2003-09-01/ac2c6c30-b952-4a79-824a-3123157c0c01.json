But Peter Dinklage, who trained at Rada in London and the Welsh School of Music and Drama in Cardiff, is, at 4ft 5in, about to become a giant of the American independent cinema. The Station Agent, a tiny low budget film made in less than three weeks at a railway halt in the backwoods of New Jersey, yesterday took the San Sebastian Film Festival by storm, and seems destined to become the offbeat hit of the year. Harvey Weinstein's Miramax studio has already snapped up the film, in which Dinklage, 34, plays Finbar McBride, a sawn-off Clint Eastwood who walks into a hick town one day and turns the lives of its lonely residents upside down. Dinklage's monosyllabic turn - for most of the first half of the film he says nothing but the word \"no\" - has already won him the best performance award at Sundance, one of six the film has so far picked up in America. Yesterday its first-time writer-director, Irish American Tom McCarthy - who cut his teeth on Ally McBeal -- said for three years no one wanted to touch his script which flirts with sentimentality, but repeatedly undercuts itself every time the characters are on the verge of getting mushy. Dinklage said the real problem for the studios was having a dwarf as the romantic lead. \"They loved everything else, it was just having someone like me there that kind of freaked them. I loved it - he's a great character to play - it's nice to be able to say no so many times every day.\" The pared-back script was also a problem for mainstream producers but McCarthy said that they stuck by playwright Harold Pinter's maxim that you should always cut your favourite lines. \"You know what,\" said Dinklage, \"it works. It's also very good for the actors. There weren't a lot of lines to learn.\" But it is the oddball Little &amp; Large relationship between the wandering Finbar, which Dinklage plays almost as a character from a Sergio Leone western, and a bored Cuban-American who runs a hotdog van, which has won audience's hearts. Bobby Cannavale, who is already fast earning himself a reputation as something of a heart-throb in Sex and the City and films like The Guru, is awed as his new little friend breaks hearts while he can't get off first base. While McCarthy and his actors are riding the crest of a wave, the Spanish director Julio Medem is already being pilloried for his documentary Basque Ball even before it is seen. Right-wing commentators in the Madrid press are calling for the film, which controversially gets Basques of all persuasions to talk candidly about their attitudes to the terrorist group ETA, to be banned."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
