A generation before, the crackling cassette recordings of Ayatollah Khomeini's harangues which circulated in Tehran were said to have played no small part in fomenting the Iranian revolution. In an earlier epoch, the development of Dutch presses and distribution networks which churned out \"libelles\" targeting French royalty was, according to some historians, the catalyst for the storming of the Bastille. Today Facebook, Twitter and BlackBerry are commanded to attend a Home Office summit for earnest discussion about the role their networks played in the spasm of criminal disorder that gripped English streets so recently. The hysterically harsh sentences already handed down in one or two cases of pro-riot social messaging is a reminder that moral panic can often follow hot on the heels of new technology. The ability of such punishments to set a precedent, and set off sentence inflation, is only one reason why the prisons minister, Crispin Blunt, is naive to imagine that the sudden spike in the jail population is a \"one-off\" that will soon be reversed. It must be hoped that ministers keep cooler heads than magistrates, and stop short of translating reflexive rhetoric, such as David Cameron's talk of banning rioters from particular networks, into unworkable policy. For if there is one clear lesson from history it is that such technological genies will not be put back in their bottles. Beyond this, there are few general rules linking disorder and new inventions. Certainly, technologies can affect both the form and the timing of revolt, just as developments in communication and reconnaissance have their place in military history. But it ought not be assumed that scientific progress always works against established authority: were it not for the then new railway to Birmingham, London police could not have been dispatched to the Midlands to break up a Chartist rally in 1839. Nor can it be assumed that the particular role of technology in any disturbance is an easy thing to disentangle. It is at this stage an open question as to whether or not instant messaging was truly important in fomenting the recent troubles, or if instead the flow of hi-tech gossip tended to track developments on the ground. The Guardian is embarking on analysis of over 2.5 million tweets that may help settle this. The government would do well to undertake similar studies in cause and effect itself before rushing into a response. Perhaps such work will indeed suggest that gangs were using instant publishing to organise on guerilla lines, and keep one step ahead of the authorities. If, and only if, that is proven, the question of bespoke regulation will rear its head. But even then, it should not be imagined that removing one means of spreading the word will secure order. There would still be nothing to stop the rallying cry to rampage spreading through the taverns and streets of London, just as it did during the Gordon riots of 1780. A more decisive blow for the forces of law and order could be struck by tackling the social roots of the rioting. Yesterday brought two instructive indicators of these. Official figures on young people who are neither in employment, education or training \u2013 the tally of youngsters who, in sum, have nothing to do \u2013 jumped up at the fastest rate since records began. At the same time, the Office for National Statistics revealed that the return to be earned by a degree had declined, suggesting that the reward for studying is diminishing at the same time as a culture of inertia takes hold. The role of new technologies in the rioting deserves scrutiny, but it should not be allowed to obscure the wisdom of an ancient adage: the devil finds work for idle hands to do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
