It's not every day that you find a US musical that attacks corporate greed, rampant exploitation and unsustainable lifestyles \u2013 and, while it's not flawless, it has a welcome satirical bounce. Given its lavatorial setting and its palpable debt to Brecht and Weill's most popular work, I'm tempted to dub it The Spend-a-Penny Opera. You need more than spare change, however, to go to the toilet in the urban dystopia envisaged by Greg Kotis's book. A chronic water shortage means that public loos have been extravagantly privatised. Desperate queues form outside the archetypal \"Amenity Number 9\", whose female custodian announces: \"If you gotta go, you gotta go through me.\" But the plot hinges on a rebellion led by a cleaner who takes the daughter of of the convenience business's Mr Big hostage, and whose followers brandish banners proclaiming \"Pee for Free.\" Clearly, the show is an assault on the mercantile exploitation of natural functions. What gives Urinetown its gaiety, however, is its parodic, self-referential tone. The show is narrated by a tough cop who, while on the side of authority, points up the absurdities of the form, observing that \"dreams only come true in happy musicals\". Mark Hollmann's score, and the lyrics he co-wrote with Kotis, also offer a sustained pastiche of the popular musical. We get conscious echoes of Les Miserables in the big romantic songs, a Kurt Weill saxophone pervades a capitalist anthem and the invigorating Run, Freedom, Run is a rousing gospel number. I'm all for jovial eclecticism, but the constant mockery of the musical form tends to obscure the seriousness of the message. It's a rare musical that cites the political economist Malthus and his prediction that the population will increase faster than the means of subsistence. Behind the show also lies a perfectly valid question as to whether diminishing resources will open the door to ever greater financial extortion. But the big issues take second place to jokey pastiche, proving that it's difficult to have your hand on your heart and your tongue in your cheek at the same time. Jamie Lloyd's buoyant production, however, confirms the truth of another adage: that casting is nine-tenths of showbiz success. The mere presence of RSC star Jonathan Slinger as the buttonholing cop, looking like Richard III in a fascist mac, gives the proceedings an air of menace. Simon Paisley Day brings his formidable height and a towering rage to the role of the toilet tycoon. Jenna Russell, brandishing a cigarette as if it were a lethal weapon, is very funny as the ferocious guardian of the urinals. And Richard Fleeshman and Rosanna Hyland play the romantic leads with the right air of self-conscious absurdity. Soutra Gilmour's excellent designs also bring a touch of Piranesi to the world of underground pissoirs. For me, the show could be more didactically alarmist still. But even to find a musical that airs the topic of ecological disaster and explores the metaphorical possibilities of the water closet comes as something of a relief.
