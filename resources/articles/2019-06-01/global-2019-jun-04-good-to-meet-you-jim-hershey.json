Jim Hershey", "bodyText": "Congratulations on your three-year turnaround, and the newish magazine format. My first exposure to your paper was when it was the Manchester Guardian, which came weekly to my parents\u2019 house in St Louis in the 70s. The fine airmail stationery-quality paper was remarkable to an adolescent, as were some of the features. I picked up reading my parents\u2019 subscription again when I moved back to St Louis in the early 90s. Life\u2019s evolutions brought my own subscription, but even direct and timely home delivery could not keep me current on all the reading! Fast forward to April 2019 and a move to Cambodia, including a stack of, at the time unread, Guardians. I \u201crenewed\u201d my subscription to a PO box in Phnom Penh where I received my first copy a couple weeks \u201clate\u201d: the 10 May issue.This place, too, was Hell on Earth at one time, but that is another story. Call me old-fashioned in the day of the 24-hour news cycle, but I subscribe to the theory \u201cIf you didn\u2019t know it before you read it, it is still news\u201d. Please keep catching me, and the million Guardian supporters, up on what is important."}, "isHosted": false}}}
