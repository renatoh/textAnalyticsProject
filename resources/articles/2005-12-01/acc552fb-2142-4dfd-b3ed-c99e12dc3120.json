Saracens had been hoping to surprise everyone by naming Farrell, who has not played a competitive match for his new club since someone stepped on his toe in a practice game in August, as a replacement in their squad for the crucial Pool Four fixture at Vicarage Road. Instead the unfortunate Farrell, whose comeback had been officially pencilled in for the post-Christmas period, strained his back during Sarries' brief session in Hatfield yesterday and looked in considerable pain as he shuffled off to yet another appointment with the club's physiotherapists. The club's director of rugby Steve Diamond, like everyone else, could scarcely believe Farrell's misfortune. \"He was training this morning and really yanked his back,\" sighed Diamond, confirming Farrell had been \"very close\" to making his competitive union debut. \"We'll see how it is tomorrow but the lad is so frustrated. Our next game is against London Irish on December 27 and we just hope he'll be fit for that.\" Farrell's serial misfortunes are starting to rival the litany of injuries suffered by Jonny Wilkinson, who could easily have been a colleague in England's midfield by now had both men enjoyed better fortunes. Wilkinson is set to return for Newcastle at Leeds on December 27 after having an operation on his groin last month. The seemingly innocuous toe injury Farrell sustained in the summer has only now eased sufficiently for him to resume full contact training. When he signed from Wigan last March he was recuperating from knee surgery and his last competitive match in either code was over a year ago. He now faces a worrying wait to discover if his painful back is a temporary setback or a long-term concern. As Farrell himself said: \"I think you could describe 2005 as a bit of a washout.\" Worcester have signed the 23-year-old New Zealand threequarter Mike Maguire to fill the gap left by the retirement of Ben Hinshelwood. Maguire, who has played most recently for Otago, holds an Irish passport and qualifies to play for Ireland."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
