Accompanied by his father, the boy appeared at a hearing lasting 40 minutes in the youth court at Wigan, Greater Manchester, some seven hours after a brief announcement from police that he had been charged. He cannot be named because of his age. He is accused on 12 separate counts involving the younger child, all relating to a series of alleged incidents between April 1 and July 27 this year. The boy stood silently as the two charges of rape, seven of sexual assault and three of engaging a child in sexual activity were read to him. He spoke only to confirm his name, address in Worsley Mesnes, Wigan, and other personal details. The court heard that the offences were alleged to have taken place in Worsley Mesnes. No plea was entered and reporting restrictions were not lifted. The boy was remanded into secure accommodation until a further appearance at Wigan youth court in five days' time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
