The dead man was discovered at Moor Farm at Hunmanby Gap, near Filey, North Yorkshire, on Monday night, at an enclosure where deer were being kept during the mating season, when they usually become aggressive and unpredictable. Two farmers had arrived at the enclosure to look for 73-year-old Clifford Colling, from Filey, who owned the herd. One of the men was also attacked by a stag and sustained serious head, leg and arm injuries as he attempted to help Mr Colling. The stag was later shot dead by a police marksman. Hugh Rose, technical adviser to the British Deer Society, said attacks on humans were not uncommon during the breeding season, which runs from the end of September to late October. \"It happens every year,\" he said. \"Farmers are well aware of the risks of entering an enclosure during the rutting season. The stags stop eating and their testosterone levels shoot through the roof. \"They become very frustrated and very aggressive and take it out on trees and bushes - anything that's in their way. The problem is that for the rest of the year, the stags are big gormless lumps you can stroke on the head and feed carrots to. \"Then they transform into these mad animals, foaming at the mouth, who are trying to kill each other. \"I think perhaps farmers forget their docile friends can turn on them too. They are extremely unreliable and dangerous animals.\" He said farmers should not enter deer enclosures during the breeding season unless they were in a vehicle. The injured man was taken to Scarborough general hospital for treatment. The North Yorkshire coroner has been informed of Mr Colling's death and a post-mortem examination is to be carried out today. A North Yorkshire police spokesman said: \"Paramedics were called, but the man was pronounced dead at the scene. Attacks by wild deer are relatively rare, according to the British Association for Shooting and Conservation. \"On the whole in the wild, deer are much more shy of man than farmed deer,\" said a BASC spokesman. \"It is not a problem we have heard of anywhere in the wild.\" Another problem involving deer is that they run the risk of being killed or injured on Britain's roads. Earlier this month, it emerged that up to 50,000 deer are hurt or killed in road accidents each year. The accidents also lead to 10 human deaths a year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
