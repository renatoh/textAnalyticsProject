First, by providing a pathway and role models for young Asian kids to look up to and to help more of them get involved in the game. Second, to help break down some of the barriers between the different Asian communities in England.\" The Bulls will be the most exotic of a weird and wonderful collection of entrants for the June 3 competition in tomorrow night's draw. Lionel Hurst, the former London Broncos chief executive who came up with the idea, has also invited teams from Paris, L\u00e9zignan, Edinburgh and Dublin. But the tournament has taken on a greater significance following the recent demise of the York Wasps, which threatens to end more than a century of professional rugby league in the Minster City. \"We are hoping the Ironside team who will represent York will act as a focal point for a revival of the city's professional club,\" explained Hurst. Encouragingly, the players who were made redundant by York's collapse last month will return to training tonight under their former coach Stewart Horton with hopes high that a rescue package can be completed before the Northern Ford Premiership resumes in four weeks. Bradford's Great Britain prop Stuart Fielded will face no disciplinary action after the game's executive committee studied the incident for which he was put on report in Sunday's 15-14 defeat by London and ruled that he had no case to answer. The England centre Chev Walker is Leeds Rhinos' only injury doubt for Sunday's Challenge Cup semi-final against St Helens at Wigan. Walker, who has played in the three earlier rounds, sustained a hip injury in Saturday's defeat at St Helens. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
