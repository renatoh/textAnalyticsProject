But it is time to vote with your head as well as your heart", "bodyText": "At elections, political tribes join together to promote their own policies and criticise those of their opponents. That\u2019s the nature of elections. But there are always individuals who enhance parliament. And there are always policies upon which every party can agree. One is democracy, and the right of every adult to vote. At every election the future of our country is at stake. But on this occasion even more than usual. When the nation voted on Brexit it did so on a diet of fiction and undeliverable promises. As the facts become known, it\u2019s extraordinary that a new vote is denied: extraordinary, and frankly undemocratic. People have strong views on Brexit. Mine are very clear. I believe that leaving the European Union is the worst foreign policy decision in my lifetime. It will affect nearly every aspect of our lives for many decades to come and it will make our country poorer and weaker, and the individuals within it. It will hurt most those who have least. Never have the stakes been higher, especially for the young. Brexit may even break up our historic United Kingdom. Within a few years, Scotland may leave the union. Northern Ireland may unite with the south. Both may do so in order to remain within the EU. Our young generation has already recognised this \u2013 by registering to vote in record numbers. And your vote is absolutely crucial \u2013 for you have the longest lease on our country\u2019s future, and our place in the wider world. So my message to you is very clear: don\u2019t allow your future to be shaped by others, with no input from yourselves. You \u2013 every single one of you \u2013 can make a difference to the election result. So don\u2019t hang back. Don\u2019t wait until Friday 13 December and then regret that you didn\u2019t make a choice. To vote means to choose. So choose the future that you believe in. Vote for the candidate who you believe will best represent your own views and your own aspirations in the next parliament. I was in politics for many years, and \u2013 believe me \u2013 no single party has a monopoly on wisdom. I am a Conservative, but there have always been policies of other parties with which I agreed. That is politics as it truly is. Tribal loyalty has its place. It can be good and honourable. But sometimes you need to vote with your head as well as your heart. To vote for your country and your future. This is such a time. Michael Heseltine is a giant of the Conservative party, a giant of successive Conservative governments \u2013 including my own when he was deputy prime minister. He has always been fearless in protecting the best long-term interests of the UK. Michael is, truly, one of a kind \u2013 and a very wise one of a kind. David Gauke, Dominic Grieve and Anne Milton \u2013 all of them principled, decent, talented human beings \u2013 were forced out of the Conservative party, and are now fighting this election as independent candidates. But let me make one thing crystal clear: none of them left the Conservative party, the Conservative party left them. Without such talent on its benches, parliament will be the poorer, which is why \u2013 were I resident in any of their constituencies \u2013 they would have my vote in this election. \u2022 John Major is a former prime minister. This is an edited extract of a speech he gave to the Vote For a Final Say rally on 6 December 2019"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
