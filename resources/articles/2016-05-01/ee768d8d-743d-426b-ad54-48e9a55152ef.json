Palace, whose league form tailed off over the second half of the season, finished 24 points off Louis van Gaal\u2019s team, though the FA Cup has provided regular reminders of their quality since the turn of the year. Pardew was a workaholic midfielder in Steve Coppell\u2019s side for the 1990 final, when Palace also finished 15th but level on points with Sir Alex Ferguson\u2019s United, who prevailed in a replay, and he has tapped into memories of that occasion to steel his team before the club\u2019s second appearance in the showpiece. \u201cFor me, as a player in 1990, I thought: \u2018Oh, we might win,\u2019\u201d Pardew said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think we could win if I am honest. I thought we might. But if it all goes our way this time, I actually think we can win. And I think this group of players think they can win, too. Some players don\u2019t get that shot at an FA Cup final. One or two of these players will never play in a final again, so this is their opportunity to get a winner\u2019s medal. We\u2019ve had good meetings about what it means for us all. We\u2019re well set.\u201d Pardew has leant on Coppell in the buildup. The former Palace manager and United winger visited the training ground on Thursday and provided scouting reports on Van Gaal\u2019s side. Unlike the Dutchman, Pardew\u2019s future has not come under scrutiny despite a league run of two wins in 21 matches, with the 54-year-old appreciative of the backing from hierarchy, players and supporters. \u201cWe have seen in the Premier League where a relationship breaks down, whether chairman to manager or manager to fans,\u201d he said. \u201cThey get strained when you are under pressure and you have not had results. But, on the whole, they have stayed in place. I thank my fans, board and, more importantly, players for that. They have all stayed faithful to what we have tried to achieve and the gameplans we have put in front of them. \u201cWe have one more game to go with this group. Then it breaks up: Marouane Chamakh might not be here; Brede Hangeland and Adrian Mariappa are out of contract; Emmanuel Adebayor, too. It will be a different group next year, so this is the last gameplan for this group. If they can see it through and we get a little bit of luck, I think we can win it.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
