One of the country's leading arthroscopic surgeons predicts that the fly-half will be sidelined for a minimum of three weeks and says it may take six weeks for the injury to heal fully. But Wilkinson is hoping to play in England's group match against South Africa a week tomorrow. Simon Moyes, who operates at the Wellington Hospital in London, told the Guardian that the Newcastle player would be hard-pressed to resume ahead of schedule: \"He will be getting physio all day every day but I really do believe three weeks would be needed to get back on form and I fear it will be nearer six.\" But Wilkinson was last night remaining optimistic. \"I know being positive is the appropriate frame of mind here, but I am genuinely feeling that way about my damaged ankle,\" he said. \"I am looking at the South Africa match a week tomorrow as a game that I am hoping and still determined to play in. In terms of injury recovery it is still too far in the future to know, but South Africa is certainly the goal.\" Comparisons are being made with the case of David Beckham, who suffered a similar injury in a European Championship qualifier against Estonia on June 6. He took painkillers to allow him to help Real Madrid clinch the Spanish title on June 17 but aggravated the problem and did not play again until July 21 when he was still well short of being 100% fit. \"People hear that you sprained an ankle and think it's relatively minor but it does take a good few weeks to settle,\" cautioned Moyes. \"Look at David Beckham ... he wasn't right playing for England against Germany. They got him back on the pitch too soon.\" Even if Wilkinson is passed fit against the Springboks he will be even more of a target than is normally the case. There will be a huge temptation to take the risk because England do not have massive depth in the goalkicking department but the South Africa captain, John Smit, felt it was foolhardy to rush an injured player back prematurely. \"It hampers you mentally if you play when you're not fully fit,\" said the Springbok hooker, due to make his own return from a long-term hamstring problem against Samoa on Sunday. The South Africa coach, Jake White, whose opening pronouncement in Paris yesterday was to ask the French nation to \"support us against the English\", will not be ruling Wilkinson out of the equation just yet. \"He's a very important player for England as well as being one of the best players in the world. If there's any likelihood of him getting on the field, I'm sure Brian Ashton will put him on the field. I spoke to Brian yesterday and he said they were so used to seeing Jonny on the ground that they carried on training.\" England will trust they suffer no further injuries against the United States in Lens on Saturday. The hooker Mark Regan has already stressed that teams who rely on only one player cannot hope to succeed at a World Cup. \"Obviously [injury] can have an effect but that's why we selected 30 players. Olly [Barkley] played well against France and we have a world-class medical team. We need 30 players to win a World Cup.\" That said, it will be a significant blow to the tournament's hopes of making a global impact if Wilkinson is a mere spectator throughout. He is a quicker healer than most but he does get a lot of practice. Yesterday he was chosen in a Heineken World Cup dream team selected from the greatest names to have featured in the tournament. Even Australians will be disappointed if he plays no part this time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
