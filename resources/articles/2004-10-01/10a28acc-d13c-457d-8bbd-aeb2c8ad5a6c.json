The company has been blamed for the botched introduction of the Criminal Records Bureau - which caused the system for checking teachers and other staff working with children to break down - and its problematic administration of Londoncongestion charge in its early days. The Department for Education and Skills said it had awarded the five-year contract, the biggest in education so far, to manage the government's twin strategies to improve standards of reading and writing at primary and secondary schools. In taking charge of the national primary and Key Stage 3 strategies, Capita Strategic Education Services will also be expected to help ministers hit their targets for literacy and numeracy. Primary schools have still not met the levels promised for 2002, the issue on which David Blunkett said he would resign as education secretary. The project will involve hiring thousands of reading and maths consultants to advise schools and local education authorities on under-achieving pupils and how to raise the test scores at ages 11 and 14. The Guardian revealed in February that Capita was one of the two companies in the final round of bidding for the contract. Despite the size of the contract, the invitation to tender was publicised only in an advertisement in an obscure European journal in March last year. The DfES is shedding thousands of civil servants' jobs, much of whose work is being contracted out to the private sector. Teachers leaders and opposition parties condemned the award, which the government hailed as a historic \"new partnership\". The contract will begin in April. The schools standards minister, David Miliband, said: \"The national strategies have played a significant part in helping teachers to raise standards of learning across the whole curriculum, and in particular literacy and numeracy standards in the primary years. \"This new partnership offers us the opportunity to build on this success and to take forward key elements of our vision for raising standards in schools set out in the recent five-year strategic plan for children and learners.\" The executive chairman of Capita, Rod Aldridge, is not a major Labour donor, but has attended Labour fundraising events and has advised the government on outsourcing. He said: \"The national strategies represent one of the most ambitious change management programmes in education, and their execution to date has had a significant impact on improving standards in learning.\" Phil Willis, the Liberal Democrat education spokesman, said the award of the contract posed issues about conflicts of interest, since Capita is understood to be in the frame as a potential sponsor of a city academy. \"I find it absolutely amazing that a major public service provider to the DfES can be awarded a contract of this scale,\" he said. \"There is now more competition between local education authorities than there is in the public sector.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
