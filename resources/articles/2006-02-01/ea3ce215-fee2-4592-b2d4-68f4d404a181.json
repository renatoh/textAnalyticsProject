Lampard's place in the team will be taken by Tottenham's Michael Carrick. FA spokesman Adrian Bevington said: \"The medical staff immediately withdrew Frank from the session and he is going straight back to Chelsea because we don't want to take a risk.\" Coach Sven-Goran Eriksson had been hoping to play Lampard alongside Steven Gerrard for at least 45 minutes so that the pair could build up a better understanding ahead of the World Cup in Germany. In attack, Charlton's Darren Bent will make his debut alongside Wayne Rooney. The team in full: Robinson, G Neville, Bridge, Ferdinand, Terry, Beckham, Gerrard, Carrick, J Cole, Rooney, Bent."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
