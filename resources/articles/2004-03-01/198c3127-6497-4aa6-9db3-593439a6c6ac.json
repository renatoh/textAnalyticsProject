At Prenton Park this evening, his team-mates will be aiming to emulate their inspirational goalkeeper to reach their first ever semi- final. The 32-year-old Dutchman needed a pain-killing injection in his knee to play in the sixth- round tie, but still excelled and kept out Kevin Muscat's 75th-minute penalty. That ultimately ensured Tranmere have a second opportunity tonight to reach the last four, as well as an unlikely chance of reaching Europe. \"I planted a big kiss on John after he saved the penalty,\" said the former England youth international Ryan Taylor, whose push on Tim Cahill had prompted the award. \"I was devastated when it was given because I thought I'd cost us the quarter-final, so when John's trailing hand flicked it over I just thought, 'mate, you're my hero.' I've called him that ever since.\" Tranmere's cup pedigree - they were beaten League Cup finalists in 2000 and have twice reached this stage in the FA Cup since then - means Millwall will approach the trip to Birkenhead with no little trepidation as they compete to take on Sunderland in the last four next month. \"We're in with a chance, definitely,\" said the Rovers manager Brian Little. \"Realising where you are going is probably the biggest incentive to get there. We can all imagine what it would be like to be involved in a fantastic semi-final and, realistically, we'd put ourselves down as having a chance in the next round as well. But we have to get there first.\" The Leicester City manager Micky Adams has accused the Professional Footballers' Association of failing to give Frank Sinclair, Paul Dickov and Keith Gillespie adequate support while they were imprisoned in Spain last week. And Adams feels both the PFA and his own union, the League Managers' Association, were found wanting. \"Both unions could have been more helpful,\" he claimed."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
