For Johnson-Thompson, who has emerged as one of Britain\u2019s greatest hopes, the idea is \u201ca stroke of genius\u201d. But for Barrie Wells, the sporting philanthropist who has backed the bubbly young athlete since she was 15 and brought the pair together, it was simple common sense. A rabid sports fan, Wells funded 18 Olympic hopefuls to the tune of more than \u00a32m in the run-up to London 2012. He has scaled back his involvement now, preferring to concentrate on a charity that offers spare seats in executive boxes to terminally ill and severely disabled children, but such is his bond with Johnson-Thompson he has continued his links with the 22-year-old. Back at the start of their relationship she had to take two buses to training, and his investment helped with driving lessons. Last year, she was the No1 heptathlete in the world. Likely to go head to head with the London 2012 gold medallist Jessica Ennis-Hill at the world championships in Beijing in August, as well as at next year\u2019s Olympics, Johnson-Thompson easily tops 1,000 points in five of her events but she struggles in the javelin and the shot. When Sayers, having had her own funding stopped by UK Athletics, plucked up the courage to call Wells to see if he could help, he was minded to dismiss the idea before alighting on a mutually beneficial plan. He would fund Sayers and contribute to her warm weather training camps if she would help out Johnson-Thompson with her throwing. \u201cShe said it was like the film Pay it Forward. I was doing her a favour and she was doing Katarina a favour,\u201d Wells says. Their first session, just before Christmas, was judged a success by Sayers, Johnson-Thompson and her coach, Mike Holmes. \u201cI like helping people and you are doing something for the good of the sport as well. I deem Kat to be one of our best athletes ever,\u201d Sayers says. They met for a second time at Johnson-Thompson\u2019s Wavertree training base on Saturday, ahead of a Merseyside football derby in which Wells and Johnson-Thompson took a keen interest. Wells says when he first started funding \u201cthe Kat\u201d they bonded over a shared love of Liverpool FC, and as an early reward for success he arranged a visit to Melwood for her to meet the captain Steven Gerrard. \u201cThe shot and javelin are the clear weak points in my heptathlon so when Barrie thought of it [teaming up with Sayers] and brought it to me, it felt a stroke of genius for sure,\u201d says Johnson-Thompson, who will compete in the British indoor championships in Sheffield this weekend and then the Birmingham indoor grand prix. \u201cTo have a world-class athlete like Goldie trying to pass on her wisdom; it\u2019s so simple but we hadn\u2019t thought of it before.\u201d There is a pleasing symmetry about the collaboration between two athletes at opposite ends of their careers but with a shared focus on the Rio Games. It sees the pair training together once a month, working on video analysis and speaking on the phone. Sayers, 32, had run out of funding options when she turned to Wells late in 2014 having got his number through the former gymnast Beth Tweddle (another athlete he has funded). \u201cMy cold call was the most painful experience of my life,\u201d confesses Sayers. \u201cI was thinking: \u2018I\u2019ve got to sort some finances in order to train this year.\u2019 \u201cI hate asking for help at the best of times, least of all financial help. Why should anyone give you money, especially when you\u2019ve never met them? We didn\u2019t really talk about that. We just had a chat and met at a dinner, got on well and Barrie came up with the Kat idea.\u201d Sayers sees few issues with Johnson-Thompson\u2019s throwing arm but believes she can help better link a kinetic process she likens to hitting the perfect golf drive off a 25m run-up and add five metres to her range. \u201cThere will be something that just clicks. It\u2019s always the way,\u201d she says. \u201cIf I can add on about five metres that\u2019s 100 points and gives me the chance to make a big improvement on my heptathlon PB,\u201d adds Johnson-Thompson. \u201cEvery point counts. I would love to have that long javelin in the bag. I\u2019ve got a great long jump and then I go into the javelin and everyone catches up, gains points or goes ahead of me and then I have to run my heart out in the 800m.\u201d Improving her javelin would give her a mental edge too, she believes. \u201cI try to mentally prepare for the javelin like I do all the other events, but you can\u2019t help but have it in the back of your head that you are going to lose points. To improve it would help in so many ways.\u201d Johnson-Thompson, who turned 22 last month, finished fifth in the 2013 world championships but had to miss last year\u2019s Commonwealth Games due to a stress fracture in her left foot. Before that she had set the world\u2019s best points total for 2014, broken the British high jump record and won a silver medal in the long jump at the world indoor championships. Wells, who also funded Ennis-Hill earlier in her career, bubbles with enthusiasm when talking about his ambitions for Johnson-Thompson. \u201cOlympic golds plural,\u201d he declares. \u201cShe will only be 23 in Rio and 27 in Tokyo.\u201d And Johnson-Thompson can\u2019t disguise her gratitude for the early help Wells gave her. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have got where I am today if Barrie hadn\u2019t helped me out when I was starting out,\u201d she says. \u201cHe helped me with a car, driving lessons to get to training when I didn\u2019t have much money. He believes in athletes when maybe others don\u2019t. Look at Jenny Meadows who people lost faith in but Barrie carried on and look what she did last weekend, a world leader.\u201d The 800m runner, who has also lost her UKA funding but has recorded the two fastest times in the world this year, is the only other athlete that Wells continues to fund. Johnson-Thompson says she cannot wait to take on Ennis-Hill in the battle of the double-barrelled multi-eventers and believes her decision to return to the heptathlon in G\u00f6tzis in May, where the pair will compete, can only be good for the sport. \u201cEvery sport wants the Olympic champion to be competing. If she comes back at the same level of 2012, I can only think about improving my own performance,\u201d she says. There is one potential rival, the Russian Tatyana Chernova, who would not be such a welcome opponent in Beijing. Amid an ongoing doping meltdown in Russian athletics, Chernova was recently stripped of two years\u2019 results after retrospectively testing positive for a banned steroid. But she was allowed to keep the gold she won ahead of Ennis in Daegu in 2011, a fortnight after the annulled period expired. Chernova was banned for two years, but backdated to July 2013 \u2013 so could technically return at the 2015 world championships. \u201cIt\u2019s a very sensitive subject but at the same time it\u2019s scandalous,\u201d says Johnson-Thompson. \u201cI do think that Jess should get that world championships medal from Daegu that she lost out on. It\u2019s an unfair advantage. \u201cTechnically she\u2019s allowed to compete in the world championships this year. I don\u2019t know if she will come back, it will be a bit embarrassing. If she does, the rest of us have to get on with it and hopefully whatever advantages she got from cheating are not in her system because it can last a while.\u201d Wells says Johnson-Thompson and her family have become close to his and he intends to retain a front row seat where ever her journey takes her. \u201cBecause she is now a big earner, when we go out for lunch every three weeks or so she insists on paying. That\u2019s very rare indeed,\u201d he says. Sayers \u2013 who finished an agonising fourth at the Beijing Games in 2008 \u2013 also has her eyes fixed on Rio 2016 after last season stripping her own throw back to basics in the wake of elbow surgery that involved taking a ligament out of her right wrist and inserting it into her left arm. \u201cI am certainly looking to Rio and then we have the London world championships,\u201d says Sayers. \u201cIt would be nice to step off the track there having ruptured my elbow last time.\u201d It was at the London Grand Prix, weeks before the London 2012 Olympics, that Sayers sustained her injury. But in addition to continuing to nurture her own ambitions, as a result of her innovative arrangement with Wells, Sayers is now also focusing on those of somebody else. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you get as much joy from watching someone else do well as you do from your own achievements but I would imagine I would. It\u2019s a responsibility and I\u2019m not taking it lightly.\u201d Barrie Wells began his Box 4 Kids initiative after taking an executive box at Anfield and filling it with 150 disabled and terminally ill children and their carers every season. Through his Wells Sports Foundation he has expanded the idea by persuading those with boxes at the Etihad, the Emirates, The Hawthorns, the Britannia Stadium, rugby league grounds, Wimbledon and Wembley to do the same. Boxes in the Royal Albert Hall and arenas in Leeds, Liverpool and Sheffield have also been donated. Once venue owners, individual box holders or businesses agree to give up their allocation for a specific match his team handle the arrangements.
