In it, he recounts his experiences after the terrorist attacks on New York in 2001, and how he realised that people were using virtual worlds to to connect and communicate with people from around the world about these tragic events. What struck me -- and I thought that I already knew this, but maybe I didn't know it as strongly as I know it now -- was that what was happening in the virtual worlds was exactly what was happening in my neighborhood. I'm a hermit, and generally avoid people as much as possible. But in the aftermath of Sept. 11, I found myself walking around Berkeley, talking to strangers, sharing a laugh, and connecting with people for reasons I can't begin to comprehend. I never fully captured that spirit about games -- that for all their blustery sounds and graphics, what we love most about online worlds is that they give us a chance to interact with strangers, not just to go on adventures, but also to say hello. To announce that we exist. And to chat with old friends, virtual or otherwise. Of course, when he wrote it, we had no idea what was going to happen in the real world. This London Memorial was created Thursday by the residents of Second Life. It is absolutely covered in displays made by players from around the world. Since it was put up by, there have been constant crowds gathered to talk, to share experiences, fears and support. If anyone else has any examples from other games, please pass them on."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
