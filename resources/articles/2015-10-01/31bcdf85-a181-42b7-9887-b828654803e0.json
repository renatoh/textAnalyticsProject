A sense of clarity quickly returned, however, when the subject of next summer\u2019s European Championship finals was raised and whether Wales would enjoy themselves in France. \u201cWe can\u2019t be going there thinking: \u2018It\u2019ll be nice\u2019,\u201d the Wales manager said. \u201cIt\u2019ll be nice if we perform, it\u2019ll be nice if we compete, that\u2019s what it\u2019s about. It\u2019s not about creating history and leaving a legacy, it\u2019s about keeping it going, keep performing, keep progressing. \u201cWe\u2019re going to go there and we\u2019ve got to perform against some top teams \u2013 we\u2019ve already done that in this campaign anyway, so there\u2019s nothing to be afraid of, but going there thinking: \u2019It doesn\u2019t matter because we\u2019ve got there\u2019 \u2013 we won\u2019t have that attitude and the players won\u2019t have that attitude. Probably now the real pressure starts.\u201d While Wales have had to wait more than a half a century to return to a major tournament, going all the way back to the 1958 World Cup finals in Sweden, where a teenager by the name of Edson Arantes de Nascimento scored the only goal of the game to put Brazil through to the semi-finals, the clear message from Coleman and his players is that the passage of time has done nothing to erode their ambition. However much their supporters turn the finals into a holiday \u2013 and the loyal band that have followed their country through some lean years certainly deserve to cross the channel with a sense of joie de vivre \u2013 Coleman\u2019s team want to make a big impression in France. \u201cWe aren\u2019t going just to make up the numbers,\u201d Aaron Ramsey said. \u201cWe have been really difficult to beat and that can be really dangerous in a tournament like that, so we are going to give it everything. The best countries around Europe like to get the ball and attack, and that can be quite dangerous as we can exploit that on the counterattack. We have individuals who can make a difference and create something out of nothing and score goals, so we can go there with a lot of expectation.\u201d It is bullish talk and not without foundation. Ranked eighth in the world, Coleman\u2019s side had gone 10 competitive matches unbeaten before conceding two late goals against Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina here \u2013 a result rendered irrelevant from a Wales point of view when news filtered through that Israel had lost at home to Cyprus \u2013 and it is worth noting that three of those fixtures were against Belgium. Wales, by Coleman\u2019s own admission, are not particularly easy on the eye at times and there is no point trying to play down the extent to which they depend on Gareth Bale, who has scored six and created two of their nine goals during qualification; the possibility of the world\u2019s most expensive footballer being injured next summer does not bear thinking about for this side. Yet recent history tells us that team spirit, which is something Wales have in abundance \u2013 Bale was not exaggerating when he said the players are \u201clike brothers on the pitch\u201d \u2013 and defensive resilience built on tactical discipline can go a long way in tournament football. That is not to say that Wales are destined to follow in the footsteps of past European champions such as Denmark and Greece by going on to surprise everyone and win the damn thing next year, but at the very least Coleman\u2019s side could prove to be awkward opponents and a country to avoid if, as expected, they are placed in pot four in the draw. \u201cI think we\u2019ve got the sort of players where we can soak it up and, on our day, hurt anybody,\u201d the Wales manager said. \u201cIn international football it\u2019s not all about running about for 90 minutes like chickens without heads \u2013 you\u2019ll just get picked off. It\u2019s about decision-making and we\u2019ve got better at that, more streetwise, in this campaign and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve got results. If you\u2019re playing against the likes of Belgium, with the type of quality they\u2019ve got, it\u2019s an art to get 11 players working in tandem without the ball.\u201d While preparation for France starts immediately \u2013 albeit it Tuesday night\u2019s qualifier at home against Andorra is likely to be more of a party \u2013 off the pitch there are a few issues to address between now and then, notably Coleman\u2019s contract, which expires at the end of the European Championship finals. The Football Association of Wales was keen to talk to Coleman six weeks ago but he asked his employers to hold off so that he could focus on qualifying. With that hurdle successfully negotiated, Coleman, who joked that he would \u201cprobably sign a 10-year-contract\u201d if the FAW had tried to negotiate straight after the final whistle in Zenica, is likely to resume discussions next month. \u201cLet\u2019s look at it this way, if I did part company with Wales, for whatever reason, I\u2019m not going to work with Gareth Bale again or anybody like that, am I, unless I go to Barcelona or Madrid, where he is,\u201d Coleman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a team of really good players. When am I going to get the chance to work with that type of quality?\u201d While clearly keen to stay on for the 2018 World Cup qualification campaign, Coleman did suggest \u2013 without elaborating \u2013 that the FAW needs to give him some assurances before he commits. \u201cThere are things that we need to change a little bit if we\u2019re going to push on and if we want this not to be a one-off, and we want to build on it \u2013 and that will be important in any decision that is made going forward,\u201d he said. In the meantime, Wales can savour the fact that their \u2018golden generation\u2019 \u2013 a tag that at times seemed to be more of a burden than a compliment to the players John Toshack blooded before the late Gary Speed succeeded him \u2013 have not only produced the goods but plan to keep doing so. \u201cWe are a nation with a lot of hungry players for success; hopefully we can stay at this level now,\u201d Ramsey said. \u201cWe have been together for a long time, we have had some really low times but we have stuck together as a team and we have grounded results, and got better with the years. We have finally shown that this campaign and what we are capable of doing.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
