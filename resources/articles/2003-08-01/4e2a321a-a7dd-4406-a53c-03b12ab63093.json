The key difference is that \"our\" puzzles have two parts to every clue (the definition and the subsidiary route to the definition) whereas \"theirs\" have only a definition. This definition may be as cryptic as you like, but since there is only one part to the clue, the only way of knowing you have the right answer is to solve all the checked clues as well. Despite my position in the tournament I sometimes - just for the hell of it - argue that ours represent the high point of western civilisation whereas theirs are little more than childlike doodling. You can see that some might find this irritating. Which is why, last week, I was put in my place by a New York-based reader who used an astute combination of argument and flattery to silence me. The New York Times, he agreed, has fairly straightforward puzzles through the week, but on Sundays it usually has a theme and within the theme there is great scope for imagination and flair, both in the clues and in the composition of the theme and the grid. The puzzle in question required the solver to substitute the name for a typographical or grammatical symbol for the asterisk in the clue. One particularly delightful example read: \"Make Annie happy. P*Y\". US crosswords, irritatingly, don't give the number of letters as part of the clue, but in this case the answer needed to fill an 11-letter space. So we need a nine-letter word for a typographical symbol. Put it inside \"P\" and \"Y\" to get something that will make Annie happy. Annie who? This of course is the trouble with American crosswords. We have no way of knowing which Annie_ until, dimly, from some forgotten corner of our minds we dredge up the information that little orphan Annie had a dog called Sandy. And from there it is a short step to the solution, which I urge you all to do. Answer: PAMPER SANDY. Last week's solution: \"Detailed draft dossier (5,3)\" - DATED LIE \ufffd Sandy Balfour.
