The sandwiches I made with it were inedible, being far too salty to eat. I would be pleased if you could advise how this stuff should be used. Pauline Kelly A Gentleman's Relish is a bit like Marmite in that you either love it or hate it. As you can tell from the smell, it is made with anchovies (60 per cent) and a little butter. The trick is to spread it very, very thinly, just the slightest smear, on hot toast. You should barely be able to see it. And yes, it's probably horrible in sandwiches. Q My tomatoes have been a bit disappointing this year. How can I perk them up? David B A I am not normally a fan of balsamic vinegar, but it works a treat with under-par tomatoes. Slice them thickly and put them in a shallow dish. Make a dressing with olive oil, black pepper and a few drops of balsamic vinegar. Pour it over the tomatoes and leave in a cool place, covered, for a good hour. The rich vinegar will give the tomatoes depth. Q Where can I buy a good-quality remote cooking thermometer which stays in the meat while cooking and then transmits a wireless ready signal to a receiver you carry in your pocket? Thanks. Charles Cooper A I am not really a gadget person, and although I am a fan of meat thermometers I don't know about ones that transmit a signal. Maybe our readers do. I am throwing it open to them. I don't suppose there's one that gets Radio 4 as well? \u00b7 If you have a cooking question for Nigel, email ask.nigel@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
