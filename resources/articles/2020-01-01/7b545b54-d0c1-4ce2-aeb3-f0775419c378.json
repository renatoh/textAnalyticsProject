If this bushfire crisis, this nation-wide trauma, can\u2019t loosen the denialists\u2019 grip on Coalition climate policy, then maybe nothing will. That would mean everyone sifting through Scott Morrison\u2019s verbiage for signs that he might really be intending to change direction is searching in vain, because he\u2019s just trying to talk himself out of political trouble. It would mean everyone patiently pointing out that the prime minister could quite easily \u201cevolve\u201d his current policies into something that actually reduced Australia\u2019s greenhouse emissions could save their breath, because that isn\u2019t the kind of evolution he is considering. And it would mean there\u2019s no point reprising the facts, that Australia\u2019s emissions are flatlining, not falling, that we could seize an economic advantage in a low-carbon world and at the same time help the globe avoid the all too obvious costs of inaction. The Coalition cabal who apparently still call the shots thinks climate science is \u201cvoodoo\u201d. They\u2019re impervious to facts. They are already threatening, via anonymous quotes to the Australian, to \u201cblow the place up\u201d. Again. Just like they\u2019ve been blowing up national climate action for more than a decade. And as this week\u2019s Guardian Essential poll showed, despite the widespread sense that the fires are a tipping point, despite global outrage at the self-defeating stupidity of our policies, despite the world\u2019s largest fund manager ditching thermal coal, despite the wave of grief and anger from around the world \u2013 even from James Murdoch \u2013 it\u2019s still not clear that Australian public opinion will force this government to change. Sure, Morrison\u2019s mishandling of this crisis has cost him. His overall approval ratings have dived but his numbers have held fairly steady in his base. The strategists \u2013 who always pay more heed to those numbers than to other benchmarks, like, say, a country in ashes \u2013 no doubt believe that, with enough confusing obfuscation about \u201cmeeting and beating\u201d targets, enough revising of the figures, enough serious practical efforts to help burnt-out communities, and just enough rhetoric conceding the reality of global heating, all will be well in time, without promising to do anything about it. All will be well for the poll numbers that is. Not for the nation. This is not, repeat not, an argument for abandoning the arguments in favour of climate action. It is not a counsel to cop out in despair. The federal government has a responsibility to the country, and to its international commitments, to enact policies to reduce Australia\u2019s emissions to net zero by 2050. That job gets harder the longer it delays. Every concerned citizen, and every frustrated investor, and every heartbroken lover of Australian nature, and every worried parent or grandparent, and every justifiably furious child should maintain that rage. But we are also running out of time. So perhaps we should simultaneously consider a plan B \u2013 solutions that bypass the federal government. Not ideal, but needs must. Maybe the many Liberals who understand climate science will persuade Morrison to act. Maybe the majority of federal politicians across all parties will take the former Labor minister Greg Combet\u2019s advice and unite on this one issue, in the national interest. Maybe they will support the bill introduced by the independent Zali Steggall. Many of the drivers of greenhouse emissions are actually the responsibility of the states \u2013 urban transport, land use, electricity generation and transmission. And most of the states have already accepted that emissions need to reach net zero by 2050 and are in the process of deciding on interim targets and policies to meet them. If they collaborated, the states could go a long way to enacting the Turnbull government\u2019s national energy guarantee \u2013 the one that Morrison as treasurer whole-heartedly supported \u2013 and which also had the support of Australian business and pretty much every stakeholder. After Morrison overthrew Malcolm Turnbull and ditched the Neg, the Business Council of Australia, desperate for someone to do something, was actually canvassing how companies could \u201cgo it alone\u201d , agree on on framework to just start getting on with it, and that idea is still under discussion in business circles. A bunch of billionaires are backing massive renewable energy export policies despite the lack of a coherent climate and energy policy. It would obviously be better for the federal government to fulfil its responsibilities, to do its job, but maybe it\u2019s time to concede that may never happen, and for the states, and the business community, to look for ways to work around it. We\u2019ve actually been in this position before. In the late 2000s, despairing in the face of an intransigent Howard government, the New South Wales government introduced one of the world\u2019s first mandatory greenhouse emission trading schemes and the premiers set up a taskforce to collaborate on turning it into a national system. But then, trailing in the polls and watching community concern mount as the millennial drought dragged on, John Howard dramatically reversed his government\u2019s long-standing sceptical stance and, in June 2007, announced details of a carbon trading scheme he would introduce if re-elected. \u201cBeing among the first movers on carbon trading in this region will present new opportunities for Australia. And we intend to grasp them,\u201d he said, and many people believed him. But, long out of office, in 2013 he admitted his shift had been purely opportunistic. His government had hit a \u201cperfect storm\u201d, because of the drought, the ground-breaking report by Sir Nicholas Stern and the Inconvenient Truth movie by the former US vice-president Al Gore, but he didn\u2019t really think there was anything \u201csignificant\u201d or \u201cdamaging\u201d about greenhouse emissions, and concern about global warming was really just a \u201csubstitute religion\u201d. As we know, Labor won the 2007 election and eventually, after much political pain, introduced a carbon price, at which point the NSW government closed its scheme, but then the Abbott government repealed the carbon price (it called it a tax, although Tony Abbott\u2019s chief of staff later admitted this was just another piece of political opportunism) and replaced it with, well, with nothing much at all. And that\u2019s where we sit, stalled, as the climate emergency happens around us. Maybe, under the current political pressure, something will give. But we\u2019ve been fooled before and there\u2019s no time to be fooled again. So that means it\u2019s time to think of ways around the federal Coalition\u2019s intransigence, because those deniers will never be swayed, and we can\u2019t allow them to dictate our future.
