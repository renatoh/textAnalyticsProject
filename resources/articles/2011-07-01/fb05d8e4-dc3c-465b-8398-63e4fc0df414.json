Or, as a recent report from the House of Lords science and technology committee on the annual \u00a3236bn public sector procurement spend put it, \"a culture within government and other public sector organisations which inhibits \u2013 or may even be antithetical to \u2013 innovative solutions\". But procurement has been undergoing a renaissance. As public sector organisations deal with savage budget cuts, procurement managers find themselves increasingly a core part of the solution. \"Traditionally, procurement walked in at the end of big decisions,\" says Andrew Forzani, head of procurement and commissioning at Surrey county council, which found \u00a321.5m in savings in 2010-11. \"But now it's about the lead-up. It's not just about IT contracts and back office but now, fundamentally, big-ticket items. On adult social care there are big questions and decisions, a lot of which are commercial. We can bring the market knowledge.\" Surrey has centralised and restructured its procurement team and aims to make savings of \u00a325m-\u00a330m in 2011-12. Among its successes, the procurement team has tackled new highways maintenance contracts and an award-winning streetlight-buying strategy, a PFI project brought together in 2009 under the department's leadership. \"We're pushing the boundaries of some people's skillsets,\" Forzani explains. \"Many are used to awarding tenders but we've upskilled to get a broader skillset that people in the public sector don't always have, and we've also hired in from the private sector.\" Online tools have helped to change the face of procurement, cutting red tape and exploring new markets. \"E-tools are good for reaching out to suppliers and sign-posting what we'll need in the future,\" Forzani says. Partnerships are also increasingly crucial. Information-sharing tools, such as the best deals service used by councils in the south-east of England, offer local authorities the chance to compare regional contracts. While some organisations opt simply to share information, others have turned to more radical service-sharing. Southwest One, a joint-venture company between IBM, Somerset county council, Taunton Deane council, and Avon and Somerset police, has produced \u00a312m in procurement savings, with another \u00a3165m savings opportunities in the pipeline and an aim to deliver \u00a3200m over the 10-year contract with procurement initiatives across a wide range of commodities, from care services to IT. IBM owns a stake in the company but the venture has a joint governing board. \"It's a radical and unique venture,\" says Ian Conner, procurement leader at Southwest One, which, as well as sharing traditional back-office functions, runs a \"transformational procurement\" programme to encourage effective working. \"We want to change the way we do things including acting as front-end advisers, where we engage in the commissioning cycle and help drive strategy,\" says Conner. The venture hasn't escaped criticism. A report produced by Somerset council last year highlighted problems including some missed targets, IT teething problems and difficulties in establishing a level of loyalty from transferred staff, although its customer contact centre and management spending controls were praised. Conner accepts some of the criticisms but points out the scale and timeline of the project. \"It's been seriously challenging,\" he says. \"Delivering something this radical isn't easy. We're getting people to the top table to devise strategy who haven't ordinarily been included \u2013 you don't do that overnight. We've driven huge savings and we are feeding in lessons learned.\" Filling the skills gap Getting the right people is also now a key factor for successful procurement, managers say. \"It's been vital in driving change,\" says Conner, who heads up a team of 26 secondees and five directly hired managers. \"We identified skills gaps and then introduced a training programme. We have an eclectic group of specialisms, including someone in the top of their field in social care. The diversity helps us do something fresh.\" In central government, the Highways Agency was singled out for praise by the Lords committee for introducing a collaborative procurement network, which led to \u00a313m in road repair savings over three years. One area open to improvement is benchmarking, where costs are compared and shared, Forzani says. \"It's miles behind the private sector where commercial intelligence has been far greater and from which we're trying to learn,\" he explains. \"The public sector doesn't always share [information], and suppliers are more confident in charging us a huge variety of prices for like-for-like goods and services. Benchmarking has been very powerful.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
