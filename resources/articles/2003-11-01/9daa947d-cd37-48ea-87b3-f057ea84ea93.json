Van Nistelrooy was dropped from the squad for their final qualifier against Moldova after reacting angrily to being substituted in the 3-1 defeat by the Czech Republic in September. But the Dutch manager Dick Advocaat watched him score twice for Manchester United in the 3-0 Champions League win over Rangers last week and has recalled him to the squad for the two-leg affair, the first of which is at Hampden Park on Saturday. Seedorf has been overlooked for Advocaat's past three squads, since the match against Belgium in August. But an injury to Mark van Bommel, who has had a hernia operation, means a recall for the Milan player. The Scotland and Rangers defender Maurice Ross says that his side should not be too disappointed if they manage only a draw in the first leg. \"I can't imagine us being defensive whatsoever - and if we do sit back against Holland and show them too much respect it might just be easier for them,\" he said. \"If we have a go at them then it could turn out better for us, so we've got to put them on the back foot. But the tie will definitely still be alive if we only take a draw over to Holland. It is imperative we've got some thing to play for in the second game.\" Ross has been frozen out of the Rangers side in recent week. But he insists he will be going flat out at training this week to show the Scotland manager Berti Vogts he is ready and able. \"Berti has shown faith in me before when I've not been playing for my club,\" he added. \"I'm sure the manager has a rough idea of his team in his head - but if Berti sees enough in me during this week and decides to throw me in then I would be delighted.\" Vogts, meanwhile, is expected to include Blackburn's midfielder Paul Gallagher in his squad. Holland squad: Van der Saar (Fulham), Waterreus (PSV Eindhoven), De Boer (Galatasaray), Van Bronckhorst (Arsenal (Barcelona/), Ooijer (PSV Eindhoven), Reiziger (Barcelona), Stam (Lazio), Zenden (Chelsea/Middlesbrough), Bosvelt (Manchester City), Cocu (Barcelona), Davids (Juventus), Sneijder (Ajax), Van der Vaart (Ajax), Overmars (Barcelona), Van der Meyde (Internazionale), Van Hooijdonk (Feyenoord), Kluivert (Barcelona), Makaay (Bayern Munich), Van Nistelrooy (Manchester United)."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
