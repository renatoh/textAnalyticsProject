The locals were just coming to terms with constant upheaval in the dugout and murmuring discontent in the boardroom, the unnerving political intrigue played out while their side eroded opponents' resistance with mechanical efficiency and only the occasional flash of exhilaration, when along comes a mustachioed maverick who once rejected the chance to coach England - and Chelsea find themselves reinvented overnight. Deposed as the richest team on the planet, and with swashbuckling football delighting out on the pitch as much as their Brazilian manager's charm wins friends off it, they are in danger of becoming popular. The Premier League's top two collide in west London tomorrow and, if league form offers an indication of what is to come, then this is a meeting of immovable object and irresistible force. Liverpool have been compared to Jose Mourinho's Chelsea in recent weeks, nicking games late with their relentless energy and resolve. They have won five league games already this season with goals plundered in the last 13 minutes. Luiz Felipe Scolari, in contrast, has seen his side sweep most before them, conjuring pizzazz and flair from a squad previously renowned for attritional and occasionally dour victories. Avram Grant did not lose a league game at Chelsea yet his reign felt rather grey; Scolari has brought a splash of colour to the scene. The transformation owes much to the man, but also plenty to his philosophy on the game. When permitted - and Roma frustrated them for long periods in midweek, which may encourage Liverpool - Scolari's Chelsea play slick, forward-thinking football propelled down the flanks by attack-minded full-backs. When winning the World Cup with Brazil in 2002, Scolari had Roberto Carlos and Cafu. These days he asks Ashley Cole and Jose Bosingwa to make inroads, their width stretching opponents and creating freedom for a talented midfield, supplemented by the inspirational Deco, in which to revel. Frank Lampard, his long-term contract signed, is scaling new heights. John Mikel Obi has emerged from Claude Makelele's considerable shadow to offer more mobility and physical presence even than the French master of the midfield shield role. At times on Wednesday, Mikel strode forward with the leggy authority of Patrick Vieira in his pomp. Even players who appeared lost last year, most notably Florent Malouda, have been reinvigorated by Scolari's infectious enthusiasm. The prolonged absence through injury of Michael Essien, Michael Ballack and Didier Drogba has gone almost unnoticed. \"Everyone's made a big thing about the full-backs getting forward and attacking, and they are doing that more than ever, but that's just one element of our style,\" said Lampard. \"We've got a really good system going in which John Mikel Obi is playing out of his skin in the holding role, filling in almost as a centre-half at times, and people are struggling to handle the movement we're coming up with all over the pitch. People don't remember just how good we were in that first year under Mourinho, the amount of points we amassed (95), the number of goals we gave away (15). That was very special. Now, there's a similar kind of mentality going into games, feeling very strong even if the football is slightly different. The togetherness, the spirit, the way we're knocking the ball around - it's the football I've always wanted to play. It's certainly football every fan would enjoy watching.\" Even Middlesbrough partisans, dumbstruck by their side's inability to stay close to Chelsea's pinged passing, were moved to applause during last weekend's 5-0 thumping at the Riverside. Aston Villa, challengers elect to the established top four, were flattered by their 2-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge. Suddenly, Chelsea are not all about Roman Abramovich's money or Mourinho's ego. There is evidence of class. It was important for the club to become more popular,\" said Lampard. \"When you are successful people get the hump, but if you can keep playing good football, people will respect you.\" If Scolari's appointment was a masterstroke in terms of his impact on the team, then his arrival has proved just as beneficial for the club's public relations. In a set-up prone to cliques, the 59-year-old has had a unifying effect. \"Everyone's warmed to him,\" said John Terry. \"Maybe he's made Chelsea a friendlier place to come to, and he's just a great guy.\" It is early days yet, but there has been no evidence of squabbling with the hierarchy. Refereeing decisions have rarely enraged him publicly. The English may still be patchy, but it is full of humour. Scolari spoke yesterday of his intention to share \"a glass of wine, or maybe a beer\" with Rafael Ben\u00edtez after tomorrow's game. \"We'll go to my office and discuss life, not football,\" he said. \"My approach is about humility. We are unbeaten so far, but we know we are not invincible. It is all about passion and professionalism. \"I was a player. Not a very good one, but I played for 16 years and always for the team because I didn't have good quality. When I started as a coach, it was the same. I fight for my players in each country that I've worked in - in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Brazil, Portugal - because they fight for me out on the pitch. Players respect those characteristics.\" Scolari's charm and experience are gleaning the best out of his squad. League games between these sides have been mind-numbing at times in recent years, won invariably by a Liverpool mistake and ruthless Chelsea opportunism. \"You never know,\" added Terry. \"This time, the game might just actually be worth watching.\" Are Scolari's side now lovable? Tim Lovejoy Television presenter, host of Five Live's 606 and Chelsea supporter \"People forget that when we were the nearly men we were liked, but people seem to be coming around to us again. Big Phil has us playing fantastic football. But there's something nice about being hated - it shows you're doing something right\" Steve Pound Labour MP for Ealing North and Fulham fan \"They're a well-drilled bunch of mercenaries, playing with occasional flair, and Lampard's flying header against Middlesbrough was sublime. But ultimately it is like watching the North Korean army - you can admire their expertise, but they inspire no affection whatsoever\" John Scales Former Wimbledon, Liverpool and Tottenham defender \"Their movement is good and their tempo is higher. They have a ruthless streak and they kill teams off very well. They are a formidable team and an intimidating bunch of players and by consequence they are more enjoyable to watch\" Ken Doherty 1997 world snooker champion and Manchester United fan \"I certainly hope they finish second in every competition they enter this year, but I do like Scolari - he's a proven character and he has brought the sexy football that was missing under Mourinho or Grant. I couldn't admit to enjoy watching them, I have to be completely partisan you must understand\" Martin O'Neill European Cup winner with Nottingham Forest and Aston Villa manager \"They are brilliant. I thought we could beat them, which shows I'm daft. Scolari has inherited a great team, and put his own stamp on it, and that is remarkable\" David Pleat Former Spurs and Sheffield Wednesday manager and Guardian columnist \"I think the perception that they're significantly better is a myth. They're passing the ball quicker and they're slightly less cautious but nothing too significant. Their midfield work is good and Bosingwa's pace on the right is helping them attack quicker\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
