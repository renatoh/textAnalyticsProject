The national data seem to indicate that Mitt Romney may actually be ahead of President Obama, while the battleground state polls show little movement, and have Obama still ahead in states like Ohio. There seems to be three possibilities as to why this split is occurring: first, the national polls are right; second, the state polls are right; third, they are both wrong and the truth lies somewhere between the two. Let me, however, offer a fourth explanation: both the national and state polls are correct. Say what? The reason we can't seem to square the national and state polls is that the difference in margin between Ohio's numbers and the national average is about 2 percentage points. That seems too wide for most of these polls to be right. Yet, consider the current political landscape and history. I noted earlier that the debate framed Mitt Romney differently than most voters were used to. The problem is that there have already been 70,000 ads from the candidates in Ohio. It doesn't take much reasoning to think that these voters might already have a pretty keen idea of where they stand on the two gentlemen. Ninety minutes of debate might not be able to reverse months and months of ads, while it could reverse negative feelings where these ads don't air. Indeed, a report from Democratic pollster Geoff Garin seems to reinforce this finding. But let's take a further step back and look at this split in a historical context, as I did earlier this year. When we think of close elections, most minds would immediately turn to 2000 and, to a lesser extent, 2004. In 2000, we had a split between the popular vote and the electoral vote. The state that made the difference, Florida, had a difference of only 0.5 points between its vote and the national margin. In 2004, the difference in margin between the national vote and the key state of Ohio was, likewise, only about 0.5 of a point. So, then, doesn't that mean that a 2-point split between the state that is likely to decide the election and national vote is very unlikely? Not exactly. The reason most of us don't think a 2-point split is possible is because our election dataset is so small. Expanding our dataset, we can examine the last electoral vote and popular vote split before 2000. Grover Cleveland won the 1888 popular vote by about 0.8 of a percentage point, but lost the pivotal state of New York and, thus, the electoral vote to Benjamin Harrison. What was the margin in New York? 1.1 points. Thus, the difference in margin between the tipping-point state of New York and the popular vote was 1.9 percentage points \u2013 or nearly 2 points. Math indicates that another 1888 is quite possible. Historically, there have been very few elections that were so close, but we can seek to determine what the difference was between the national vote and the state that would have flipped the election had it, and states with closer margins, been won by the losing candidate. The average difference in margin in the tipping-point state and the national popular vote in the last 60 years is a little under 1 percentage point. The average since 1828? 1.5 percentage points. These are not that much less than 2 points. Indeed, Nicholas Miller has found that the chance of the electoral vote winner and popular vote winner differing is far higher than you might imagine. The chance that a split occurs when the popular vote margin is 1 percentage point is 25%, or one out of every four. The chance that the electoral and popular vote split occurs when the popular vote margin is 2 percentage points? 12.5%, or one out of every eight times. These are not so very low odds at all. We just have so few chances to actually see close elections in the real world that it seems impossible from our limited perspective. These historical data, along with the fact that many voters have already locked in their choices in the swing states, make the chance of an electoral and popular vote split seem not all that far-fetched. Will it happen? I would guess not, but it's not such a long shot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
