Andrew\u2019s disastrous Newsnight interview on the issue \u2013 where he emphatically denied Epstein\u2019s accuser Virginia Giuffre\u2019s claim that she had a sexual encounter with the royal at age 17 \u2013 has seen the prince exit public life in disgrace. But in a statement announcing his current departure from public duties, the Duke of York said: \u201cOf course, I am willing to help any appropriate law enforcement agency with their investigations, if required.\u201d This echoed his comment during the BBC interview, in which he said he was prepared to give testimony under oath \u201cif push came to shove and the legal advice was to do so\u201d. Prince Andrew\u2019s offer to potentially be interviewed could be important for US authorities\u2019 continued investigation of Epstein \u2013 who killed himself in jail after his arrest for alleged sex trafficking of minors \u2013 as they are keen to talk to high-profile friends of the disgraced financier as they seek to track down more of his accomplices and associates. But speaking with US authorities \u2013 even when innocent \u2013 inherently carries legal risk, longtime attorneys told the Guardian. Prince Andrew is not charged with wrongdoing but with the BBC airing an interview with Giuffre on 2 December the controversy is only likely to ramp up. Julie Rendelman, a former prosecutor who has long practiced criminal defense, said she would advise clients to be wary if subpoenaed by a grand jury \u2013 a body of US citizens which determines whether to bring an indictment \u2013 if there is any possibility that they are the subject of an investigation. \u201cUnless they\u2019re being given immunity, then as an attorney who believes that a client potentially has risk of criminality or criminal liability, I would tell them to plead the fifth,\u201d Rendelman said, referring to the US constitutional protection against self-incrimination. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing to be gained by talking to a grand jury without immunity in those circumstances.\u201d A decision to meet with US authorities would depend on whether a client has \u201cserious risk of facing imminent criminal charges\u201d. In that situation, a client could potentially benefit by quickly giving up possible co-conspirators. But there are certain circumstances in which an attorney might advise a client to testify before a grand jury, she said. \u201cIf you have someone that\u2019s just a witness \u2013 a pure [and] simple witness to a crime that has absolutely no criminal liability whatsoever, as an attorney, you have to distinguish those individuals,\u201d Rendelman explained. \u201cWith that said, there are gray areas: there\u2019s the defendant, there\u2019s the completely innocent individual, and there\u2019s often someone in the middle.\u201d But one should be careful not to automatically think that there\u2019s no criminal exposure when there might be, Rendelman said. A secretary at a business that has scammed millions of people, for example, might think they have nothing to worry about in testifying, and that authorities might just want to know what others were doing. \u201cThere is a potential risk that what can be used is not just against them, but against her because she worked there,\u201d Rendelman said. Other legal experts voiced similar views about the prospect of the prince voluntarily meeting with investigators. \u201cI see the downside to be larger than the upside for him,\u201d said David Weinstein, a former federal prosecutor who now practices white-collar criminal defense at Hinshaw &amp; Culbertson. \u201cIt\u2019s the way the questions are asked, the way he answers the questions.\u201d Prince Andrew\u2019s performance in the Newsnight interview \u2013 which has triggered a full-blown royal crisis \u2013 is unlikely to inspire much confidence in his ability to handle an interview by trained lawyers or FBI agents. Giving a \u201cbumbling\u201d response or hesitating is risky and speaking with authorities \u201cmay allow them to confront him and then twist his answers\u201d, Weinstein said. There are also practical issues. If Prince Andrew were lawfully served with a subpoena \u2013 be it for a grand jury, or a trial or deposition \u2013 generally speaking, he will need to comply. However, it is far more difficult to serve him outside the US. \u201cDue to the heightened measures of security that surround the royal family, it certainly is far more difficult to walk up to a member of the royal family and serve them a subpoena as you would a private citizen,\u201d Weinstein said. While there are rules about how to serve subpoenas on a foreign national on US soil, such as surprising them at points of entry, diplomatic immunity and his being a high-profile royal could further complicate the issue. Rebecca Roiphe, a New York Law School professor and former assistant district attorney in Manhattan, said there could be legal risks in Prince Andrew cooperating depending on his potential involvement with Epstein\u2019s activities. \u201cIf he was peripherally involved in that, if he has information about others, I would say absolutely any attorney would take him in to cooperate,\u201d Roiphe said. \u201cThe problem is, if he faces serious exposure and he\u2019s a target of that information, most attorneys would not have him explain everything he knows \u2013 it really depends.\u201d Mary Ellen O\u2019Toole, who was formerly an FBI profiler deeply involved in finding the Unabomber killer, said that if Prince Andrew could provide information that would further the investigation and clear him at the same time, it \u201cprobably would be very helpful to him\u201d to come forward. O\u2019Toole said the utility in cooperating with authorities largely depends on how he would handle the situation and that the pitfalls of such an interview were real as being untruthful with authorities can flout laws against making false statements, leading to further legal problems stemming from the interviews themselves. \u201cI think it would be considered an adversarial situation \u2013 I don\u2019t know how prepared he would be,\u201d said O\u2019Toole, who now directs the forensic science department at George Mason University in Virginia. \u201cSometimes people come in and say things that get them jammed up. \u201cIt is a catch-22 situation for him,\u201d O\u2019Toole said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
