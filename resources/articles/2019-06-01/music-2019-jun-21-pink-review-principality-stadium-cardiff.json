As it swings, she snarls, winks and breaks into Get the Party Started, her tongue-in-cheek romp from 2001. To the delight of Cardiff\u2019s roaring crowd \u2013 though perhaps not her insurance underwriter \u2013 the 39-year-old pop veteran scales every angle of the bejewelled contraption with the acrobatic execution of a Cirque de Soleil runaway, held aloft by just a light harness. Not your average start to a party, then. But Pink is not your average pop star. Born Alecia Moore, the multimillion-album-selling artist and trained gymnast has spent two decades infiltrating the mainstream with her brand of delightfully brash pop-rock anthems (her 2017 album Beautiful Trauma was the third-biggest seller in the world that year). From the self-empowerment anthem Fuckin\u2019 Perfect \u2013 played tonight sans expletives \u2013 to the club banger Raise Your Glass, her confessional songwriting has marked her out as an ambassador for misfits. She knows, too: \u201cWe\u2019re all Pink on the inside,\u201d chimes a mid-set transition clip. Pink condenses a tour\u2019s worth of energy, showmanship and stage production into one show, flexing her athleticism while singing live, on-key and with sublime verve. Bedecked in a tailcoat, she works as a wired-up ringmaster, commanding her backing dancers through the feverishly catchy Funhouse; hearts move to mouths as her muscular prowess is pushed to the limit throughout a gyroscopic Secrets. With this arsenal of palatable, crowd-pleasing hits, there was presumedly no need for a cover, but her powerful rendition of Bishop Briggs\u2019 gothic, reverb-drenched River allows a rare unshowy routine that, for once, leaves the spotlight on Pink\u2019s voice rather than on her physical capabilities. The nursery rhyme-like stomp of So What heralds a high-flying aerial finale; strapped in by four bungee chords, Pink erratically slingshots her way across the stadium\u2019s ticketed sections and dive bombs towards fans. As the hook-line fades out, she finally grounds herself on a structured perch and waves at her ecstatic fans, offering them a conspiratorial nod. And with that, pop\u2019s greatest nonconformist soars back to Earth. \u2022 Touring the UK until 30 June."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
