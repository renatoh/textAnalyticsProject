Nick Thomas-Symonds, who was appointed to the shadow cabinet by the new Labour leader Keir Starmer on Sunday, has written to his Conservative counterpart Priti Patel to request funds for organisations that run \u201cfrontline\u201d domestic abuse services, as well as to turn underused hotel chains and university halls into emergency accommodation. The UK\u2019s biggest charities dealing with the issue have reported increased demand for helplines and online advice as the coronavirus lockdown creates a pressure cooker effect in abusive households. Experts in the field have warned that abusers and their partners having to self-isolate together at home may lead to an increase in abusive behaviour and violence. The domestic abuse commissioner, Nicole Jacobs, has called for support for charities and organisations that provide lifeline services for victims of violence in the home throughout the crisis as they face major financial strain. In his letter to Patel, seen by the Guardian, Thomas-Symonds says: \u201cI am writing to ask you to work with colleagues across government to urgently bring forward a package of emergency bespoke financial support for the organisations who are doing vital frontline work to ensure that they can provide a crucial safety net to some of the most at risk women, children and communities throughout this crisis. \u201cI would also be happy to discuss how your department, and those across government, can ensure that this additional investment is made available as soon as possible and also in ensuring that organisations operating on the frontline are given the necessary financial flexibility. \u201cIn order to ensure that they can make best use of the available funds it is important they are not unduly burdened by reporting restrictions, whilst of course ensuring we make best use of taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d As well as providing emergency accommodation, the MP for Torfaen in south Wales asks the home secretary to ensure refuge workers have access to personal protective equipment and Covid-19 testing. Thomas-Symonds asks for increased public messaging, through supermarkets, pharmacies and other appropriate areas, to provide information on the means by which victims can signal the need for urgent police help. He adds: \u201cWe are seeing initiatives such as these being coordinated in some areas of the country, but such is the scale of the risk and challenge it is vital that government step in to provide additional leadership in this area. \u201cSome of the most at risk people in our communities simply cannot afford for these vital services to be undermined at a time when they are needed most.\u201d The charity Refuge reported that the national domestic helpline, which provides support to abuse survivors as well as facilitating referrals to refuge accommodation, had seen a 25% increase in calls in the first week of the Covid-19 lockdown. Similarly, Women\u2019s Aid reported a 41% increase in use of the charity\u2019s live chat service between 26 March and 1 April, compared to the previous week, as well as a marked increase in visitors across all its digital support services."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
