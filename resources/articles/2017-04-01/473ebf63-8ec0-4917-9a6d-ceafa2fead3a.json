Nastase was overheard on Friday at a press conference for the Fed Cup tie between Romania and Britain saying about the current world No 1\u2019s unborn baby: \u201cLet\u2019s see what colour it has. Chocolate with milk?\u201d Williams confirmed on Wednesday last week that she was 20 weeks pregnant with her first child after posting an image of her baby bump. Her fiance Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of the Reddit website, is white. Nastase, 70, the Romanian team captain, had also asked his British counterpart Anne Keothavong for her room number. He was also heard to call her and British No1 Johanna Konta \u201cfucking bitches\u201d in an outburst that led to his provisional suspension by the International Tennis Federation (ITF) and expulsion from the competition being held in Constan\u021ba, Romania. In a comment on Instagram, Williams wrote: \u201cIt disappoints me to know we live in a society in which people like Ilie Nastase can make such racist comments towards myself and unborn child, and sexist comments against my peers. \u201cI have said it once and I\u2019ll say it again, this world has come so far but yet we have so much further to go. Yes, we have broken down so many barriers - however there are a plethora more to go. \u201cThis or anything else will not stop me from pouring love, light and positivity into everything that I do. I will continue to take a lead and stand up for what\u2019s right.\u201d The 35-year-old American player said she was not afraid, and directed questions and a defiant statement to Nastase, drawing on a poem by Maya Angelou: \u201cDoes my sassiness upset you. Why are you beset with gloom? You may shoot me with your words ... you may try to kill me with your hatefulness, but still, like air, I rise.\u201d Williams also thanked the International Tennis Federation, adding: \u201cThey will have my full support.\u201d Nastase was expelled from the stadium on Saturday after swearing at officials, as well as at Keothavong and Konta. He also directed an aggressive rant at a Press Association journalist. The Romanian has remained defiant about his expulsion and has made no apology for his conduct. \u201cI don\u2019t need this bullshit. I\u2019m 70 years old. I don\u2019t even get paid for being team captain. I don\u2019t give a shit if they fine me,\u201d he told the Daily Mirror. His friend, the former gymnastics star Nadia Com\u0103neci, was one of the few public figures in Romania to criticise Nastase. \u201cI cannot condone or defend his recent ugly and very offensive remarks \u2026 I am a great supporter of women in sport and I would never condone any kind of sexist comments of this kind, whether they are from Ilie Nastase or anyone else,\u201d she said. Meanwhile, Keothavong questioned whether Nastase should have been appointed as Fed Cup captain given his notoriously volatile temperament. \u201cClearly his behaviour on court over the weekend and leading up to this tie was inappropriate and in hindsight maybe he shouldn\u2019t have been put in the position that he was,\u201d she told Sky Sports News. \u201cYou walk out on to court as a tennis player expecting to be in a safe environment and expecting to be playing against a partisan crowd \u2013 that\u2019s understandable \u2013 but you don\u2019t expect to be verbally abused when you\u2019re out there just trying to do your job.\u201d Nastase was quoted by Romanian news website news.ro on Tuesday, defending his remarks about Williams. \u201cI didn\u2019t make any racist remark,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the racist remark is. \u201cIs it racism that I said he could come out as chocolate with milk? If I said that she would have an ugly, black (baby)? That is racism.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 25 April 2017 to clarify that Williams was drawing on a poem by Maya Angelou in part of her comment on Instagram."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
