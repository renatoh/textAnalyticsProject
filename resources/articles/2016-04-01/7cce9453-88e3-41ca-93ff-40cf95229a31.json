The parliamentarians will eventually cast a conscience vote on the proposed legislation which would bring the NT in line with the rest of Australia, but debate will not resume again until the next sittings in May. The legislation would allow doctors to prescribe the drug which can induce a medical abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy. The debate on the private member\u2019s bill to amend the Medical Services Act was adjourned midway through speeches which voiced concerns about the capacity of Indigenous women to understand the drug, fears the proposed law would lead to a death, and wishes to outlaw abortion altogether. Currently women in the NT can only access surgical abortions in hospitals, which often requires long-distance travel to a metropolitan centre, and where there may be a significant wait. A medical abortion is available only in very restricted circumstances in a hospital. Dr Suzanne Belton from the Menzies School of Health Research in Darwin, has previously told Guardian Australia the restrictions place the territory 10 years behind the rest of Australia and 20 years behind other countries. While a number of speakers on Wednesday night noted the debate was not about abortion itself, Independent MLA Gerry Wood said the issues could not be separated, and RU486 would provide for \u201cabortion on demand\u201d. Wood said he believed a human life began at conception and that support for abortion was a \u201cfashion\u201d and a \u201cfallacy\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit like asking me, \u2018would you like to be hit by a bus or a car?\u2019 The end result is the same,\u201d he said. He said a woman\u2019s right to an abortion should be questioned \u201cwhen other rights are overridden\u201d. \u201cNo one asks the unborn if they think it\u2019s safe,\u201d he said. The position of Larissa Lee, member for Arnhem, where 80% of her constituents are Indigenous, was unclear. Lee said she was concerned about the consequences of the drug in remote communities away from hospitals, and worried about the lack of support for people there who undergo a medical abortion. She accused Aboriginal health workers of not having the capacity to work with the medication, and said the trauma of a medical abortion would have a greater impact on remote-living young Aboriginal women and girls. Independent member for Goyder and parliamentary Speaker, Kezia Purick, who introduced the private member\u2019s bill, was criticised for distributing the most recent amendments to the other members only that morning. CLP member Lisa Finocchiaro said she had spoken to a number of stakeholders and people in her electorate and, on the information she had, the number-one concern of Territory women was safety. \u201cThere is no question the amendments are significant and I won\u2019t hide from the fact I\u2019m disappointed proper time was not afforded all members of the house,\u201d she said. \u201cThe bill is too important to get wrong\u201d. Finocchiaro said she had confidence in medical bodies to determine guidelines around its provision, and she generally supported reform of the Medical Services Act to allow RU486. \u201cI\u2019m a proud Territorian and there are plenty of ways we do things differently and are proud of it. But certainly, and unfortunately, there are examples where the Northern Territory\u2019s difference are not to be proud of, and I\u2019m thinking specifically of issues affecting women,\u201d she said, citing domestic violence and access to RU486. Health minister John Elferink and Labor MLA Gerry McCarthy were in agreement that the bill was \u201cbad legislation\u201d, and suggested the proposed amendments could provide, as McCarthy described, \u201ca pathway to a coroner\u201d. Elferink, who retires in August, said he supported change but this bill would leave a future health minister \u201cunrestrained in this space\u201d and able to change the policy. If that happened \u201cthe first time we would become aware of it is when a coroner is investigating a death,\u201d he said. \u201cRubbish, absolute rubbish,\u201d Purick interjected. McCarthy also equated an abortion resulting from RU486, which is taken between five and nine weeks into a pregnancy, with the physical result and emotional impact of a stillbirth. Labor members Natasha Fyles and Nicole Manison spoke in support of the bill. \u201cThis is not about termination; that was decided many years ago,\u201d said Fyles. \u201cThe passage of this legislation would allow Territory women access to a safe medical termination, something that women overseas gained in the 1980s and 1990s,\u201d she said. She dismissed Elferink\u2019s concerns about access and availability, pointing to \u201cclear guidelines\u201d from the royal Australian and New Zealand college of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Manison said \u201cit was absolutely time we catch up to the rest of this country and have some faith that our medical professionals certainly can work with somebody to assist them to obtain a medical termination and know they\u2019re going to follow the best possible practices to assure the safety of that person\u201d. Purick, the former opposition leader Delia Lawrie, and Labor member Lynne Walker have previously spoken in support of the bill. Debate will resume in May, with 20 minutes left for Wood to speak."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
