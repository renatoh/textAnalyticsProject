But the new chairman of ITV plc was, it transpires, right - last night the network only got two of the coveted gongs - and at today's annual general meeting Sir Peter Burt made it clear that the bottom line is all that counts. All eyes were on the incoming Scotsman, who has just assumed the helm of ITV after years in the world of banking, not least for signs of dissatisfaction with the chief executive, Charles Allen, whose future has once again been the subject of speculation. But the duo put on a class act at today's AGM, with not a whisker of a difference of opinion apparent between them. The two Scotsmen certainly seemed at ease with other on their first public appearance together, exchanging jokes and smiles on the directors' podium. Keeping the dogs in line But Sir Peter - the 60-year-old former chief executive of the Bank of Scotland - made it clear he would not flinch from punishing executive failure. \"I've said I don't believe in keeping a dog and barking myself,\" he said. \"What happens if your dog does not bark? You replace the dog. \"If the management are not doing it properly the non-executives have a duty to replace the management. End of story. If you go down any other road, madness lies.\" He denied suggestions that he had told Anthony Bolton - the \"quiet assassin\" at investment fund Fidelity who led the coup against Mr Green - he had \"a lot to do\" at ITV. \"Did I tell Tony Bolton that I had a lot to do? No I did not. I'm the non-executive chairman. It's the job of the non-executive directors to ensure the company is properly run, but it's not our job to run the company.\" Management would nevertheless be given slack to make mistakes in their pursuit of new ideas, he said. \"If people try things, mistakes get made and things go wrong. The trick for the management and for the non-executive directors is to ensure that mistakes are made at a level that is containable. \"It's the management's responsibility to go out and plant acorns. Some will grow into saplings, some will grow into oak trees. But most of the acorns will be eaten by pigs and come to nothing.\" Shrugging off rumours about Dyke at ITV Sir Peter's relationship with Mr Allen is under scrutiny, not just because some shareholders have called for the latter to go the way of Mr Green. It emerged that Sir Peter met the former BBC director general, Greg Dyke, earlier this month, sparking rumours that he was lining up Mr Dyke to replace Mr Allen. Sir Peter said today that ITV plc had been off the agenda when he met Mr Dyke, who is an old foe of Mr Allen and now stalking the broadcasting jungle without a job. \"I have met lots of people within and outside ITV to learn as much as I can about the TV industry,\" Sir Peter said. Mr Allen was singing from the same hymn sheet. \"Peter Burt has met a number of people within the industry. I think people put two and two together and made seven.\" ITV shareholders are unlikely to be too forgiving, with many of them remembering the ITV Digital fiasco two years ago in which Mr Allen's Granada and Mr Green's Carlton blew more than \u00a31bn. As one shareholder put it: \"This company is attracting a lot of suspicion because of its precursors.\" A stormy ride at the AGM The mood at the two-hour meeting in the City of London today was often stormy, with some investors decrying the payoff given to Mr Green as \"obscene\". Remuneration dominated the complaints list among the 500-odd investors present, although Sir Peter also had to field the usual ragbag of inquiries about the scheduling of Nationwide league football highlights, TV violence and the dearth of Danish pastries. Sir Peter delegated questions where appropriate to Mr Allen, finance director Henry Staunton, and directors Sir Brian Pitman and Sir George Russell. But he was not afraid to set out his views on ITV plc, just five weeks after he took up the chairmanship. Defending Sir George Russell's role on the panel that selected BBC chairman Michael Grade, he said ITV was \"not in competition\" with the publicly funded corporation. \"They do not take commercial advertising,\" he said. \"It is in all our interests as shareholders and as citizens to see a strong and successful BBC.\" Whether this illustrated a certain naivety that ITV needs to make sure it beats BBC1 to guarantee an audience share that will command ratings wasn't clear - he was loyally backed up by his chief executive. \"We are not in competition with the BBC for revenue. Commercial impact is what drives our revenues. If the BBC is underperforming, we make less money,\" said Mr Allen. Up to now, Sir Peter has said little about ITV programmes and has not impressed rank and file programme-makers at the network. \"It is up to Charles and his team to get it right. I'll give them the time to do that, but at the end of the day I'll look at the bottom line. If he says to me that he's won Baftas and all sorts of awards, but there are no profits, he will not have done well,\" he told the Observer upon his appointment. With both chairman and chief executive speaking as one and getting ringing endorsements in shareholder votes today, it could be the start of a long double act. But Sir Peter gave every impression that he would be a resolute and authoritative chairman, so Mr Allen must be hoping not too many of his acorns get eaten by pigs. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857 \u00b7 If you are writing a comment for publication, please mark clearly \"for publication\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
