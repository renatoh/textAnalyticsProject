Bennett\u2019s 20-man England contingent features three debutants but the inclusion of Chris McQueen is the most noteworthy of the trio. The Gold Coast forward was born in Brisbane and has played State of Origin for Queensland but qualifies for the national side via his English father \u2013 the same applying for Cronulla\u2019s Chris Heighington, who returns after a six-year absence. The selection of both players has caused a backlash but the England team manager has defended the decision. \u201cI think there\u2019s a real feel at the moment against globalisation so it\u2019s no surprise to see it come into sport, too,\u201d Peacock told the Guardian. \u201cBut the rules are the rules, so we can play by them. We\u2019ve not been beating Australia and New Zealand so we need to find a way to change that. If they strengthen the side, then why not? \u201cEveryone else seems to use heritage players and the rules are there to be used. But it\u2019s about strengthening your squad and not diluting it with too many heritage players because, yes, you still need to have a strong English core.\u201d Peacock has also defended the decision to fly to Sydney mid-season to play Samoa, saying a Test against northern hemisphere opposition such as France would have been insufficient preparation for the World Cup. \u201cWhen you play for England in any other sport you get to see the world and see some different destinations but we haven\u2019t done that,\u201d Peacock said. \u201cIt gives us a great build into the World Cup and a flavour of what it\u2019s like to play in a Test match of that calibre. Playing France just would not have cut it this year in the run\u2011up to a World Cup.\u201d The Salford winger Justin Carney could be banned on Tuesday night for at least eight games after being accused of racially abusing an opponent. Carney was sent off during Salford\u2019s Challenge Cup tie against Toronto and he faces a Grade F charge \u2013 the Rugby Football League\u2019s most severe \u2013 at an independent disciplinary tribunal.
