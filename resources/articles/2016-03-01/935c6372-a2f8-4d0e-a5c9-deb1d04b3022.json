He has urged voters to stand up for policies of the future, including over climate change, the National Broadband Network, renewable energy and Gonski education funding. Windsor asked for the help of people inside and outside the electorate, characterising the deputy prime minister as a man of the last century, one of a \u201csmall group of right-wingers\u201d including Tony Abbott and Eric Abetz, who were placing a \u201chandbrake\u201d on the future. It\u2019s not about sending Barnaby Joyce a message,\u201d Windsor said. \u201cIt\u2019s about winning the seat. I am serious ... and I\u2019ll need the help of as many people as I can get from both within and outside the electorate,\u201d Windsor said. \u201cOne thing that can happen here, though, is that people can demonstrate if they\u2019re serious about their own futures, they can send an enormous message to this place and fight the political machines that are going to move in on this in an attempt to grind me up. \u201cThey might grind me up but if people are serious and it\u2019s a challenge to the electorate and the people who live there, if you are serious, you\u2019ve got a choice. If you are not, I would vote Joyce.\u201d In an hour long press conference in Canberra, Windsor faced questions regarding the sale of part of his Werris Creek family farm to Whitehaven coal for more than $4.6m - given he was opposing the $1.2bn Shenhua coalmine. He said legal advice suggested that Whitehaven, which owned the underground resources, had the right to mine on the land and the case would simply end up in the land and environment court. He said the Werris Creek mine was a very different situation to the the Watermark mine proposed on the Liverpool Plains, due to the water resources under the Plains and the highly fertile black soil above. The Werris Creek mine, he said, was on an old quarry, on \u201ccrap country, the type of land that should be mined\u201d. Windsor ended months of speculation by announcing his decision, first on ABC Tamworth and then in Canberra. Joyce had already held a press conference in New England to preempt the announcement. He told the ABC that Windsor was part of the \u201cLabor Green independent alliance\u201d. \u201cIt\u2019s a democracy and I welcome any person and there will be a number of independent candidates, Mr Windsor\u2019s one and that\u2019s his choice,\u201d Joyce said. \u201cThere will be the Greens. I think overwhelmingly, people see Mr Windsor\u2019s political journey as one where it started as an independent but ended up as a member of the Labor/Green/independent alliance. \u201cThat\u2019s his prerogative. I\u2019ve been overwhelmed by the support that I\u2019m getting. So if that\u2019s the battle we have then I look forward to it.\u201d While Joyce may be favourite, it presents a headache to the newly elevated Nationals leader, who is usually required to campaign across the country for other members. The competition in New England will tie him closer to home. Joyce holds the seat on a notional margin (after electoral redistributions) of 19.9%. In 2010 at his last election, Windsor won 61.9% of first preference votes. Windsor first held the balance of power in the NSW parliament and sided with the Liberal state government of Nick Greiner. He first the federal seat of New England in the 2001 election as an independent and held it for 12 years. In 2010, he had joined fellow independents Rob Oakeshott and Andrew Wilkie to back Julia Gillard\u2019s minority Labor government. He retired in 2013 citing health issues. Windsor said if he held the balance of power in parliament again, he would not formally support one side over the other as he did in 2010. He said the parliament could continue as normal. \u201cMy leaning would be to being absolutely independent,\u201d he said. Windsor also said he would not be directing preferences, which he considered an \u201cinsult\u201d to voters, even though it is highly likely that, if he wins, that he will do so on the back of preferences. \u201cThe electorate I live in, the electorate I love, the electorate I\u2019ve worked for over many years, I see things stalling,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m not prepared to see regional people, people in the electorate of New England, treated as second-class citizens with their education of their kids, the Gonski [reforms], with their telecommunications ... in relation to climate change.\u201d Windsor criticised Joyce for doing \u201cabsolutely nothing\u201d for the Murray-Darling basin plan and accused Joyce of ignoring climate change in the agricultural white paper. \u201cWe\u2019ve got a current member who thinks renewable energy is a bit of a joke,\u201d he said. Windsor told reporters the prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, had been talking about the future a lot but had been \u201chandbraked\u201d on many issues. \u201cIt is this small group of right-wingers of which Barnaby Joyce is one, Tony Abbott, [Eric] Abetz, you all know who they are, that have a handbrake on progress.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
