It says the drop in helpdesk pay was a direct result of the outsourcing of many functions to countries such as India. The drop was as much as 25% for temporary helpdesk staff, who now earn an average of \u00a312 an hour, while permanent staff suffered a 3% fall in average salaries, to \u00a317,538. By contrast, some skilled IT consultants, such as security experts, enjoyed a rise of 22% in pay this year."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
