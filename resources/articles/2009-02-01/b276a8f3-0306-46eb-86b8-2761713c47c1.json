Guadeloupe is on the edge of Insurrection. Not that we didn't know that Guadeloupe, on general strike for almost a month, had been simmering with anger, but back home we had our own problems with the Sarkozy government, following the January 29 demonstration where 2 million people took to the streets of France. Guadeloupeans are furious, and so are we all. Like commentator and writer Elizabeth L\u00e9vy, most of us knew nothing about the situation in the French Indies but when we heard Christine Taubira, MP for the French Guyana and twice candidate to the presidential elections, talk about the French Indies' quasi \"social apartheid\", we wanted to know more. Former French presidents such as Jacques Chirac had all managed to keep discontent quiet there. How long could it last? Those forgotten territories of the French republic, as Taubira calls them, suffer from high unemployment and low wages but, perhaps more importantly from the arrogance and monopolies of a handful of industrialists, often B\u00e9k\u00e9, descendants of the white colonials, who despite representing only 1% of the population own half the land, 90% of the agro-industry and 20% of the overall economy. The LKP, a collective against extreme exploitation, led by 42-year-old Elie Domota who refuses to speak other than in creole, demands a \u20ac200 (\u00a3176) monthly raise for low-paid workers who now make roughly \u20ac900 a month, and lower prices on 100 key products such as basic food items. Taubira says that the French state has turned a blind eye on the local industrialists' abusive monopolistic practices for too long. It may have been out of negligence rather than malevolence, but the end result is the same: it's the people that pay the price, for the benefit of a few. It took President Sarkozy three weeks to send Yves J\u00e9go, a negotiator who failed to negotiate, who came back to Paris, weighing 10 pounds lighter. The fact that the French president hasn't yet intervened on the subject and addressed the populations of Guadeloupe but also Martinique where the anger is also palpable, is rightly seen as a sign of contempt. For the last three days, the youth of the island, 60% of them unemployed, have been building barricades, setting public buildings on fire and using rifles to shoot at the police. One trade union member was killed on Tuesday night. According to Lib\u00e9ration's reporter Antoine Guiral (listen to his account here), the youth, among them many Haitians, is becoming uncontrollable. For a 29-year-old lawyer blogger from Guadeloupe, most of the youth roaming in the streets and building barricades are delinquents and petty criminals not interested in the population's fight. \"We are now all becoming bitterer by the hour.\" One thing is sure though, the parties of the left in France, from Besancenot's Anti-Capitalist party to the Communists, all monitor the situation in Guadeloupe with increased interest, especially as the nation prepares for another general strike and national demonstration on March 19. The French government must now act very quickly or face (at least one) insurrection."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
