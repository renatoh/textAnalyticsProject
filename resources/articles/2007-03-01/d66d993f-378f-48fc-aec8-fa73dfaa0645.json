Like everyone else, Gordon Brown has found it difficult to get his teeth fixed for free. Mervyn Druian, his South African-born dentist, is reported as saying that Brown has been a regular patient for 20 years. My own researches indicate that Brown started smiling in public about five years ago. This had nothing to do with a) his satisfaction at his career pattern to date at Westminster; b) his naturally sunny disposition; or c) the state of the economy. It was entirely about the fact that he had got his teeth fixed, he could smile without looking like Dracula (he had dreadful gaps before) and his advisers had told him to loosen up. A toothy smile doesn't always work wonders. The only professional dentist in the House, the Tory MP Sir Paul Beresford, is always pictured with his mouth shut because he knows what works well in the papers and others understand why this should be so: thus, the foreign secretary, Margaret Beckett, tends to keep her trap firmly shut - for photographs, at least. David Cameron has an expensive-looking set suggesting serious orthodontic bills in his teenage years, but has already learned to be careful of the camera. And Tony Blair's teeth are awful. The best teeth in the House? Baroness Gardner of Parkes, a Tory peer and retired dentist, says it's impossible to say. \"It would be pushing it to pick one MP. You'd have to look at them carefully and think which ones were genuine, which were crowns and which were veneers. People can do extraordinary things with teeth, you know.\" I suggest a few possible candidates for Westminster's most winning smile and her most positive response is: \"Barbara Follett has a nice-looking mouth.\" What about Harriet Harman, who always smiled with her mouth open? \"If I'm thinking of the right mouth, she's got one out of alignment,\" says the baroness."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
