Khan's contest has been dubbed an official eliminator for the WBO lightweight title, which changed hands last month when the veteran Nate Campbell defeated Juan Diaz. But Thaxton, 33, says his fight with Romanov, a 25-year-old Belarusian, is the more significant contest. \"I don't think you can compare the two fights really. My fight is about the best in Europe against the best in Britain. How they can make Amir's fight a WBO eliminator I don't know. \"I ain't got a Danish pastry in front of me. I'd say this is going to be the toughest fight of my career. Romanov's the best in Europe. This is a hell of a fight for me against a hell of an opponent. I think about him more than my wife at the moment. I have trained harder than ever and I really believe I can pull this off.\" Thaxton and his promoter, Mick Hennessy, have tried to lure Khan into an all-British showdown, in which Khan would risk his Commonwealth title. Hennessy has made several offers to Khan's promoter, Frank Warren, who himself claims that his \u00a3125,000 offer to Thaxton was rejected. Thaxton insists he is being avoided because he is a big puncher who might end Khan's unbeaten record. \"That's the story of Amir Khan's career,\" he said. \"He's fighting these guys who are not known as bangers. Frank Warren is on record as saying Gairy St Clair [who in Khan's last contest was outpointed after being brought in as a late substitute when Kristjansen pulled out because of illness] is a better fighter than Kristjansen, so surely this is a backward step for Amir.\" The Commonwealth Boxing Council is trying to force Khan to defend his title against Thaxton and yesterday said that promoters had until next Wednesday to agree terms or make purse bids for the fight. But Warren rejected the circular, saying: \"I have said to Simon Block [the secretary of the Commonwealth Council and of the British Boxing Board of Control], if you want to make fights then take out a promoter's licence. \"I am in the Amir Khan business and I will do what is best for him. We are targeting the WBO title and I hope he fights for it by the end of the year. As for Jon Thaxton, if it's a fight that suits us we'll take it but it will not be because the Commonwealth Council or anybody else says it must happen.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
