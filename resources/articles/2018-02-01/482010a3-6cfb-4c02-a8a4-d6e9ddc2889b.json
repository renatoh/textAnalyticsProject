Encountering a few mouthy fans on his return south may have been unpleasant but it was nothing compared with the intense discomfort his team endured at Murrayfield last Saturday evening. If an emergency cord had been available, England would have yanked it after 20 minutes. And now everyone wants to know how the wizard of Oz is going to fix things up between now and the increasingly tricky-looking trip to Paris next week. One fine Scottish performance does not instantly make England a busted flush \u2013 24 wins from 26 games remains a more than decent strike rate \u2013 but the flaws it exposed are not all of a type that can be simply massaged. \u201cI\u2019m not a magician, mate,\u201d Jones said with a shrug, as snowflakes started to settle on the pavement outside Oxford\u2019s Randolph Hotel. What may just interest England\u2019s forthcoming opponents, however, is what he said next. The Australian had just been asked whether England\u2019s turnover woes and lack of pace to the breakdown compared with their Scottish counterparts might tempt him to alter his side\u2019s stylistic approach. \u201cWe can\u2019t win that way,\u201d came the blunt reply. \u201cOne thing I know is we can\u2019t win playing pattern football. We don\u2019t have the athletic ability to do it. I have them for 13 weeks a year. I can\u2019t suddenly make them more athletic. All I can do is try to maximise the players we have. We\u2019ve got good players but we don\u2019t have the ability to be athletically better than other teams.\u201d Forget the short-lived tunnel row, Ryan Wilson\u2019s crooked fingers (who knew?) and Elliot Daly\u2019s imminent return to fitness. Jones has long felt that England\u2019s best chance of beating New Zealand is by negating them, rather than taking them on at their own all-court game, but never has he more clearly articulated the uncomfortable reason why. Previously he has spoken about playing to England\u2019s traditional yeoman strengths up front; now he seems to be saying he has no other option and is effectively cobbling together a World Cup-winning side from an old fairy liquid bottle and a bit of sticky-back plastic. Jones being Jones, of course, this could just be his crafty way of winding up his forwards to the point where they come steaming out at the Stade de France determined to flatten everyone and everything. If that is also what happens against Ireland it will be job done. The snag is that some of England\u2019s bigger rivals may prefer to take him at face value when he complains about having only limited time in which to fashion a world-beating side. \u201cIt took New Zealand eight years to fix it \u2013 we\u2019re trying to do it in four so everything\u2019s a bit more difficult for us.\u201d Eh? You can almost hear the sympathy oozing from every pore from Inverness to Invercargill. Even if it is true, it sounds horribly like an pre-emptive excuse. Rather less debatable was Jones\u2019s admission that his side had \u201cplayed poorly\u201d and received \u201ca harsh lesson\u201d. So, too, his acknowledgement that they should have \u201creacted quicker\u201d to Scotland\u2019s breakdown threat and urgently needed to tighten their midfield defence. Either way, he is still backing his team\u2019s attitude: \u201cI\u2019ve seen various commentaries about various things but any team that wins 24 in 26 games has got a bit of steel about them. Yes we were caught short on Saturday but \u2026 I don\u2019t need to worry about the steel or the character of these players. \u201cThe reality is that the more games you win, the closer you are to a game like this. That\u2019s human nature. We think we\u2019ve prepared well, they get a few things going their way, the crowd gets excited, the referee gets excited and we get a bit disappointed. Then you\u2019ve got an imbalance between the physical and the mental. The ability to swing that momentum back is what we need to find next and that\u2019s not easy. The problems we\u2019ve got are still there even if we win the game. The result just magnifies them.\u201d The healing process this week has started with an old-school honesty session among the coaches \u2013 \u201cWe\u2019re working round the clock to fix it\u201d \u2013 and Jones\u2019s Sunday afternoon chat with Sir Alex Ferguson at Old Trafford, despite all his travel headaches, also helped to put things in perspective: \u201cHe mentioned a lot of matches where things went wrong and a lot of the times you don\u2019t have a solution to it.\u201d Even top gurus, in other words, have their off days: \u201cWe all think we\u2019re clever but we\u2019re not so clever because our game\u2019s an inexact science. We don\u2019t have robots, we have human beings. There are no shortcuts guys. We all wish there were.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
