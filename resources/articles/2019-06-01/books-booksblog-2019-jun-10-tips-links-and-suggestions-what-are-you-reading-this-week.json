Here\u2019s our roundup of your comments and photos from last week. Good news from JayZed, who has been rereading Ghost Wall by Sarah Moss: I thought I should check and see whether it really is as brilliant as I thought it was on first reading. Reader, it is. As is so often the way with rereading, I found it even more impactful second time around, and felt really quite shaken and upset as the story reached its climax. Don DeLillo\u2019s story collection, The Angel Esmeralda has made HaveOneOnMe3 feel almost as intoxicated as a would-be Prime Minister: Nothing surprising here for those who love Uncle Don\u2019s work, but it\u2019s extraordinary. Every single line of his prose is like a crystal, in terms of its beauty, purity, and design perfection. Reading him almost literally makes you high, his sentences are that brilliant. Little Boy by Lawrence Ferlinghetti has swept up Eamonn Barrett: A lovely flow of consciousness from the grand old man of American poetry. It takes a little getting used to but once you surrender to it, it sweeps the reader along. Such a nice respite from the current news, that\u2019s for sure! \u201cWhat a great read,\u201d says MsCarey, after finishing Gull by Glenn Patterson: It\u2019s the eye-popping story of how John DeLorean (acclaimed American car engineer, experienced corporate manager, charismatic showman and hustler-in-waiting) realises his dream of making a stylish, affordable (it was to retail at $12,000) sports car for the American market. Patterson does a remarkable job of taking the mass of raw material and shaping it into a proper novel. Real life characters mix with invented characters so well that you can\u2019t see the join\u2026 There is also no grand tone. It\u2019s not polemical, farcical or, thank the lord, earnestly outraged. Having shaped his narrative, Patterson lets the story speak for itself and it is the reader who will feel outrage, disbelief, hilarity as she works through the novel. Children of Ruins by Adrian Tchaikovsky has pleased SackTheJuggler: [It] is the sequel to Children of Time, which was (some spoilers) a story about a spider civilisation, accidentally created, and what happens when they come into contact with their inadvertent human creators. The book (so far) has a similar structure as the earlier one, with separate storylines which will presumably unite at the end. In one thread, human engineers discover that the planet they have been sent to terraform is already teeming with life. In the other, a joint human-spider expedition encounters strange aliens. There\u2019s a lot of good stuff about how the humans and spiders attempt to communicate more effectively with one another, and the difficulties of communicating at all with entirely alien species. Enjoyable \u201csense of wonder\u201d SF. MarisadeAzevedoMonte is rereading Solzhenitsyn\u2019s Cancer Ward: I know that the title is enough to put some off, but I\u2019d highly recommend it not just as a microcosm of Soviet society, but as a wise and perceptive encapsulation of the contemporary human condition, warts and all. The protagonist, Kostoglotov, remains a hero of mine. The bravery of standing up for decency when surrounded by chicanery, deceit and toadyism strikes a particular chord in these dystopian times. \u201cI am slowly working my way through 1491 New Revelations of the Americas Before Columbus by Charles C Mann,\u201d says BeachBumble: It\u2019s an extremely well researched book yet written in an easily understood style. It covers all of the Americas, north, central and south, and paints a startling picture of complex highly populated nations with cities, cultures and histories at least as sophisticated as those in the old world, and their remarkable impact on their environments. Be prepared to have all your assumptions about native Indian life completely turned upside down! Finally, following last week\u2019s discussion of Jack Kerouac and On The Road, Vicc recommends Off The Road by Carolyn Cassady, about her life with Neal Cassady, Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg: It is a fascinating book. Her writing is witty and honest. There are points where you want to shout \u201cjust leave him\u201d but when we\u2019re young we don\u2019t usually have that perspective. When I read On the Road, Cassady struck me as someone who\u2019d annoy the hell out of me. Reading his wife\u2019s account of life with him, I still think so. I can dig that. Interesting links about books and reading Writers are more productive when they cluster. Erica Eisen on Samizdat: \u201cI imagine the book\u2019s maker sitting bent over their desk, carefully redoing each full stop, comma, accent and h\u00e1\u010dek one by one, for the benefit of future readers they would never meet.\u201d The Tale of Genji\u2014what is it? James Ellroy reads \u201cat night. When the world quiets down. When the hell hounds of my imagination stir in my bed beside me and grant me a few hours of repose.\u201d Sophie\u2019s Choice is the perfect summer read, according to Emma Copley Eisenberg.
