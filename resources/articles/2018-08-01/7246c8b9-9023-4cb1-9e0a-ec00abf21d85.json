At least three children have left the island since Thursday, and reports from island sources say at least three more children, as young as 12, are \u201con FFR\u201d \u2013 food and fluid refusal. The current crisis on the island is overwhelming medical staff, who are referring dozens of children for transfer off the island, only to have their decisions rebuffed by Australian Border Force officials on the island or department of home affairs bureaucrats in Canberra. Two children were moved off the island with their families on Thursday. Early on Friday morning, a 14-year-old refugee boy suffering a major depressive disorder and severe muscle wastage after not getting out of bed for four months, was flown directly from Nauru to Brisbane with his family. There are concerns, doctors say, he may never be able to walk normally again. Later on Friday, in the federal court, Justice Tom Thawley ordered another girl \u2013 given the designation EIV18 by the court \u2013 to be moved to Australia for urgent medical treatment. Court orders prevent publication of the girl\u2019s age \u2013 other than the fact she is a child \u2013 her name or country of origin. Guardian Australia reported on the girl\u2019s case on Wednesday. Three separate doctors had independently assessed her, and all had recommended she be moved urgently from the island, but this was resisted by the Australian government. The girl has been inside the supported accommodation area of the regional processing centre for three weeks, and has been refusing food and water for much of that time. Before she, too, fell into acute depression and \u201cresignation syndrome\u201d, and refused to eat or drink anything, she had been one of the brightest and most articulate of the refugee children on Nauru. \u201cBefore she got sick, she was the best-performing student,\u201d a source familiar with the girl and her condition told the Guardian. \u201cShe had a dream to be a doctor in Australia and to help others. Now, she is on food-and-fluid refusal and begging to die as death is better than Nauru.\u201d The girl told her Australian advocate: \u201cI can\u2019t live in this island anymore. I hate everything and everyone around me. I hate to go outside. \u201cWe left our country to have a good and better life, but we faced the worst life ever, the life which forced us to end it.\u201d The court ordered the girl be moved \u201con an urgent basis\u201d from Nauru. The next commercial flight is not until Sunday, but doctors have said the girl is too unwell to take a commercial flight. A department of home affairs source in Canberra confirmed to Guardian Australia an air ambulance flight had been approved for the girl, but the government was waiting on arrangements to be made for her family. Guardian Australia has been told by sources on Nauru that up to three more refugee and asylum seeker children are on food and fluid refusal on the island, including two brothers aged 14 and 15. Only the most critically ill cases are being addressed, Nauru sources say, and the situation is \u201cdangerously chaotic\u201d. A 12-year-old girl who attempted to self-immolate this week has not been moved. In the case of a 12-year-old boy who\u2019d eaten no food for 20 days, he was reportedly just hours from death when he was moved by air ambulance on Tuesday. He weighed just 36 kilograms and could not stand up when he was taken to the airport. Island sources say there is an uncontrollable \u201ccontagion\u201d of children committing self-harm, attempting suicide or refusing all food and fluid. Several children have been diagnosed with the rare but serious child psychiatric disorder \u201cpervasive refusal syndrome\u201d, also known as resignation syndrome, which has been documented at high rates among asylum seeker children, especially in Sweden. Children suffering resignation syndrome effectively withdraw from life \u2013 refusing to eat, drink, go to the toilet, leave their beds, speak or even open their eyes. They are sometimes completely unresponsive to stimuli. The National Justice Project, which has succeeded in having more than a dozen children transferred off Nauru through court applications \u2013 either conceded by the government or ordered by judges - said there was a child health crisis on Nauru. \u201cThe National Justice Project is overwhelmed with cases of desperately sick children on Nauru,\u201d the NJP principal solicitor, George Newhouse, told Guardian Australia. \u201cWhat kind of a world do we live in where life-or-death medical decisions need to be decided by a judge? \u201cI\u2019m very concerned about the difference between the medical reports we are seeing and the information the government is using to base its decisions.\u201d The Australian government has consistently declined to comment on individual cases, but the Nauru government has defended the safety of children on the island. \u201cChildren of refugees and asylum seekers on Nauru have access to education, health services, welfare, good accommodation and a range of social services provided by the Nauru and Australian governments. Nauruan children grow up happy and healthy on our island. Activists [are] playing politics and distorting facts,\u201d the government said in a statement. \u201cMedia reports about children of refugee and asylum seeker families in Nauru are false. None are in detention. They live with their families in our community alongside Nauruan children. To suggest any child is in danger just because they live in our country is offensive.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
