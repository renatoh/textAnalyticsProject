Rowan Williams told the service at St Paul's Cathedral that every victim of the attacks in London had \"a separate, unique beauty\". The Queen and the prime minister joined relatives of the victims of the attacks, survivors and emergency workers for the 55-minute service. In his sermon, Dr Williams spoke of the \"sense of arbitrariness\" created by terrorists targeting people because of where they were at a particular time, and said the terrorists believed any victim \"was as good as any other\". But Dr Williams told the congregation: \"There are no generalities for us, no anonymous and interchangeable people. We live by loving what's special, unique in each person. Everyone matters.\" Half of the 2,300-strong congregation at the service were survivors from the attacks or relatives or friends of those killed by four suicide bombers who attacked the capital's transport system. All but one of the 52 victims was represented at the service. The Department of Culture said one family had chosen not to attend. The mayor of London, Ken Livingstone, delivered the first reading and Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor also addressed the multi-faith service. Four candles were then lit as acts of remembrance representing each of the scenes of the attacks at Aldgate, Edgware Road and King's Cross tube stations and at Tavistock Square. Emergency and transport workers, accompanied by the bereaved families, carried the candles to the altar. Special thanks were given to people from the emergency services. The Bishop of London, the Rt Rev Richard Chartres, led representatives of the major faiths in a declaration of unity in the face of terrorism. A \"candle of hope\" with six wicks representing the six major faith groups was lit by young representatives: a Sikh, a Muslim, a Hindu, a Christian, a Jew and a Buddhist. The service was conducted by the Dean of St Paul's, the very Rev Dr John Moses, and was broadcast live on huge screens in Trafalgar Square, where members of the public gathered to pay their respects. After the service, the Queen talked on the steps of St Paul's with some of the families of those killed by the bombs. She was given a posy by seven-year-old Ruby Gray, whose father Richard was killed in the Aldgate tube station blast. Her 11-year-old brother Adam refused to attend the ceremony because he blamed Tony Blair over the Iraq war and for making London a terror target. Their mother Louise, from Ipswich, told London's Evening Standard: \"He is very angry with the bombers but he also blames the war and he blames the government. He doesn't want to be part of anything that has Tony Blair there.\" Other relatives of the victims have said they are angry at what they say has been a lack of support from the government. Loyita Worley, 49, from Finchley, north London, who survived the Aldgate blast, was one of those present today. \"A lot of people were involved from all over the world and all over England and have been dealing with things in isolation,\" she said before the service. \"This is an opportunity for people to be under one roof to remember those who died and those who were badly injured and whose lives will never be the same.\" Relatives of the four suicide bombers were not invited and neither were the family of Jean Charles de Menezes, the Brazilian who was shot in error by police on July 22, a day after a second failed suicide bombing attempt by four men. Arriving for the service, the Metropolitan police commissioner, Sir Ian Blair, said: \"Today is a time for reflection. I think about the words spoken by the Chief Rabbi on July 8, there are hundreds of languages spoken in London, but there is one universal language which is the language of tears. \"Suicide bombers are entirely indiscriminate - Muslims, Hindus, Jews, black and white, male and female - they all died. There is nothing here about any one community being responsible. Our job is to support those communities and to help us protect ourselves against terrorism.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
