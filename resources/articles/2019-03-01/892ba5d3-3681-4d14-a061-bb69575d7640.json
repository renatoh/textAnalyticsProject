Nobody is pretending this is a documentary, after all, so typing things such as, \u201cwas victoria in labour when chartists stormed palace\u201d, followed by \u201cdid chartists storm palace\u201d, followed by \u201cjenna coleman contact lenses\u201d never leads to any satisfaction, more a raising of the eyebrows. Victoria is at its light, good-looking, Sunday evening best when you can sit back and enjoy the soapy ride. It is easier not to have all the facts, or at least to ignore them, for an escapist hour or so. It is 1848, and Victoria is heavily pregnant with yet another child; of the five she has already, the two eldest are sentient, while the others are silent window-dressing. She does not, however, have time to put her feet up. There is trouble brewing abroad, at home and within her own family, and Victoria is losing patience with Lord Palmerston, the foreign secretary, upon whom she is focusing much of her polite crossness and gentle disdain. Laurence Fox is clearly having a blast as Palmerston, a swaggering, slimy operator who is said to be unsafe around women, loves egging working men on to whack seven bells out of each other and appears to lack any sort of principle, unless it is beneficial to him. He congratulates France on overthrowing the king, then sits down to dinner with the exiled Louis Philippe, who has taken refuge in England. Palmerston supports revolution abroad, but employs a \u201clock them all up\u201d policy towards the Chartists at home. \u201cAlbert, he\u2019s vulgar,\u201d says an unsettled Victoria, who later raises her insult game to this monstrous dismissal: \u201cLord Palmerston, you have my permission to withdraw.\u201d Yes, queen. As adversaries go, he\u2019s going to be fun, though whether it will be palatable for an audience to sit through a series of self-serving politics remains to be seen. There\u2019s the arrival, too, of a half-sister, Feodora, fleeing revolutionary forces in Baden. Feo (Kate Fleetwood, having as much of a blast as Fox) is, we learn by way of neon-lit exposition, a daughter from Victoria\u2019s mother\u2019s first marriage. The dog doesn\u2019t like her and she plays chess with Albert, which is probably going to be symbolic. If Feodora is indeed a baddie, as appears to be where the needle is pointing, the scene of her arrival for dinner in a dress that can only be described as \u201cdevilish\u201d \u2013 red, black and lacy \u2013 is quite the statement. As if the inconvenient arrival of European relatives wasn\u2019t enough, there is growing friction between Victoria and Albert, who is about to enter his Prince-Philip-in-The-Crown phase of discomfort in the role of second fiddle. His own daughter won\u2019t curtsy to him: \u201cYou are not the sovereign.\u201d And when it comes to matters of national importance, Albert has an unfortunate habit of using the first person possessive pronoun \u201cours\u201d before correcting himself to \u201cthe Queen\u2019s\u201d. Still, he makes his own distractions. The man who would be prince consort (but not until 1857) has decided to investigate what life is like for people who do not live in a palace, and has discovered that the Chartists may have a point. Nevertheless, Albert insists the family does a runner to the Isle of Wight when the protests get too protest-like. Victoria is many things, but it is rarely subtle. In a play put on by the children to entertain Louis Philippe, young Bertie fluffs his lines and pouts as he says he doesn\u2019t want to be the stupid king. The dialogue can be leaden, and not just when they are talking about moulting wigs. After the French revolution, Victoria thanks God for the English Channel. Albert replies, \u201cI\u2019m not sure that will be enough. Ideas can swim,\u201d which made me think of an uprising in goggles and a rubber cap, trudging its way across to Dover. As ever, it all hinges on Jenna Coleman\u2019s performance as Victoria and her ability to conjure up a portrait of this queen as understanding, sympathetic, kind and decent, even under unimaginable and possibly imaginary pressures. It might not be elegant and it might not survive the strain of putting its plot points to the search engine test, but as diverting drama it gets the job done."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
