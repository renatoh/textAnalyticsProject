Wolves boosted Liverpool\u2019s Premier League title hopes by beating Pep Guardiola\u2019s team 3-2 on Friday night and now have the daunting task of recuperating enough to try to produce a similar performance against the runaway league leaders. Liverpool will have had an extra 24 hours\u2019 rest, having won at Leicester on Thursday evening. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen [a situation like] playing games against tough teams with 45 hours between games,\u201d said Nuno. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be very tough. Of course, it goes against everything \u2013 it\u2019s absurd. There\u2019s no explanation.\u201d Nuno accepted this is a demanding time for all teams \u2013 \u201call the managers and players are concerned; we cannot do anything, we have to survive\u201d \u2013 but Wolves\u2019 workload has been particularly punishing this season. They have already played more matches than any other side in the division because of their Europa League exploits, and they have a relatively small squad. Nuno said he will assess the fitness of his players before selecting his lineup for Sunday but knows he does not have the option to rotate as much as other managers. \u201cEverybody ran a lot [against City] and to get back [to that level] requires a lot of effort,\u201d said Nuno. \u201cWe have a small squad, so how we are doing things is very important. We will look at it and make the right decisions. We will sit down and speak and decide.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
