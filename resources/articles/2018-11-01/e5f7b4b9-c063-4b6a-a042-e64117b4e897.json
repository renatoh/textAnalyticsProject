Children are conscientious editors. Gleitzman is used to writing for children. He\u2019s not used to being edited by them, with the possible exception of his own children, who comment on everything he does. But giving kids the opportunity to edit is precisely the point of Early Harvest, the annual publication put out by 100 Story Building, an organisation based in Melbourne that centres around providing opportunities and programs for young writers. Each year, an editorial team of Grade 5 and 6 students comes up with a theme \u2013 this year it\u2019s \u201cDreams\u201d \u2013 and then oversee the production of a book filled with short stories, illustrations, games and activities. It\u2019s no small task. \u201cThe biggest challenge was having those 200-something submissions and we had to cut it down to 12,\u201d says Nivain Don, one of the members of the editorial committee. \u201cAnd it\u2019s hard to select the stories because all of them were so good,\u201d adds fellow editor Airin Vinod. The tough decisions didn\u2019t end there. In addition to work submitted by fellow schoolchildren, Early Harvest also invites established authors and illustrators to submit work. They are then subjected to the same level of scrutiny as everyone else. This year, beloved author and Australian Children\u2019s Laureate Morris Gleitzman happily put himself at the mercy of the editorial committee. \u201cI contributed something a little different,\u201d says Gleitzman. \u201cWhat it is is a list of the first sentences of all of my books, all 40 books, and another 20 or so [from short stories].\u201d The editorial committee knew who Gleitzman was before working with him. This didn\u2019t make them hold back on their edits, though. \u201cThey certainly didn\u2019t diminish their responsibility to turning out the best magazine they could through any sense of deference or \u2018oh, he\u2019s a professional author so we must treat his work with kid gloves\u2019,\u201d Gleitzman says. \u201cThey were very professional.\u201d \u201cChildren of this age are not precious or reverent. They are always vocal about whether they like something or not, it\u2019s just a rare occasion that their opinion can affect the outcome in such a huge way,\u201d says Simon Conlon, the Programs Manager at 100 Story Building. \u201cChildren and young people are sharp and opinionated and we try to give them the choice to decide where their creative projects should go \u2026 Their ideas are inevitably better than any of ours.\u201d Gleitzman mentions how the editorial team were quite critical of one of his lines from an early book. \u201cThey felt wasn\u2019t really a good opener,\u201d he laughs. \u201cI did feel moved to point out to them that the book whose first sentence they were saying wasn\u2019t a terribly good opener had sold about 150,000 copies.\u201d He pauses. \u201cBut I also acknowledged that, possibly, had they been editing the book when it was first published \u2026 maybe it would have sold more than 150,000 copies.\u201d The editors cut Gleitzman\u2019s list of 65 opening lines down to 61. The biggest reason for cutting the list was, according to Vinod, \u201cbecause it had bad language\u201d. \u201cOne of the first sentences of a short story contained the word \u2018bosoms\u2019,\u201d says Gleitzman. \u201cThey used exactly the same wording as so many of the world\u2019s biggest publishing houses do,\u201d he says with a laugh. \u201c\u2018We just feel that this isn\u2019t exactly right for our readership\u2019.\u201d So they negotiated. \u201cWe made a deal,\u201d says Vinod. \u201cHe said we could change some [lines],\u201d says Don, but sometimes when a compromise couldn\u2019t be met, they cut lines completely. \u201cHorse trading!\u201d Gleitzman says. \u201cI haven\u2019t seen the final magazine yet but I think I traded a \u2018bosoms\u2019 for \u2018scum\u2019.\u201d Gleitzman emphasises the importance of giving children the chance to be in charge creating something in this way. \u201cI think handing over a whole publishing structure like this to young people is a really good way of giving them extra dimensions to their own writing,\u201d he says. \u201cChildren\u2019s point of view is different to adult\u2019s point of view,\u201d Vinod says. \u201cChildren have different thoughts and ideas and it\u2019s good children can express their opinion.\u201d \u2022 Early Harvest 7 is launching on 10 November"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
