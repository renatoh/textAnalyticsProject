Adriano, who spent the second part of last season on loan to S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil, seemed to have relaunched his career under Jose Mourinho but his lifestyle off the pitch was called into question after absences and late attendance to training. Before the Christmas break Mourinho told Gazzetta dello Sport: \"If I were him, I'd think long and hard whether he wants to stay here where he has a certain image or to leave.\" The 26-year-old striker has scored one goal in seven Serie A appearances this season but Mourinho said: \"With his physical power he could be one of the best strikers in the world sleeping at nights and drinking water.\" Redknapp could also make a move for the former Everton and Leeds United midfielder Dacourt, who is not finding space under Mourinho. The 34-year-old Frenchman has played only once as a substitute this season and was limited to only 10 appearances in a season and a half at Inter. \"Mourinho has no faith in me,\" Dacourt says. \"I used to play on a regular basis when fit but now there is no more space for me and it's hard to accept. I did not manage to change Mourinho's opinion, enough is enough, I have offers from England and I think I should move on.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
