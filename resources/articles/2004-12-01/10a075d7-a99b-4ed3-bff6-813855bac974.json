Tel: 028 9022 0200. Website: Malmaison. First impressions: The grand old exterior of the McCausland Hotel now houses the latest Malmaison. I overheard one customer describe it as Dracula's living room; with its bold black panelling, purple, aubergine, gold and grey crushed velvet cushions and sofas, it could be described as cosy gothic. What are the rooms like? On the small side but swish with flat-screen TV and DVD. More plush darkness creates warmth and atmosphere: crushed red velvet on the beds and gold velvet on the chairs gives a Moulin Rouge chic. The two suites are extreme lush gothic particularly the one with a purple baize pool table. The bed test: Under a heap of crushed velvet cushions, you'll find an extra-firm king size bed (7ft in the suites) with a leather headboard and fine linen bedding. The bathroom: White and black tiled with a shower head the size of a sunflower. Horrendously noisy extractor fan. The restaurant: Tables are hidden behind high black semicircles, making this large restaurant very intimate with only 50 covers. Good steaks from the Duke of Buccleuch estate from \u00a314.95, sea bass with fennel \u00a316.95. The bar: Sumptuous, airy bar lit by hundreds of tealights in red glasses. More black panelling and crushed purple velvet. A flat-screen shows classic movies. Extensive bar menu includes duck shepherd's pie \u00a38.50 and they do a decent mojito. What is there to do nearby? Amid the classic old pubs like the Crown Saloon, there's a new breed of spunky little bars cropping up in wee corners of the city while Michelin star restaurants and chippies alike believe in big feeds. How much? From \u00a395 per double. Continental breakfast \u00a39.95, cooked \u00a312.75."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
