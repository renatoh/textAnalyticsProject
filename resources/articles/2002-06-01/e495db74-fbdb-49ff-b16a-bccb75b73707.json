That ambition now depends on the benevolence of England's selectors after the withdrawal of the Olympic silver medallist from the 200 metres at the Commonwealth trials yesterday. Marlon Devonish and Chris Lambert, the first two in the final in 20.36sec and 20.41sec respectively, are guaranteed selection, leaving Campbell praying for the the discretionary third place when the team for next month's games is announced tomorrow. His hopes have been raised by the fact that Dwain Chambers does not want to run despite being ranked as Europe's No1 over the distance. Chambers plans to concentrate on the 100m, an event he won on Saturday in 10.03 ahead of Mark Lewis-Francis in 10.07. Campbell had finished fifth in 10.43, a performance that persuaded the 28-year-old not to run again having had tests that show he has a blood infection. He still wants the selectors to pick him for the 100m and 200m, along with the relay, and he has promised to prove his fitness. In Campbell's favour is his pedigree - he is the European 100m champion and finished second in the Olympic 200m - but against him is the fact that injury has prevented him from racing successfully since Sydney. His chances appear especially slim in the shorter sprint, where Jason Gardener has a better claim. The European indoor champion finished fourth in the 100m in 10.31 after failing to recover from a poor start. At least in the 200m Devonish and Lambert are the only athletes who want to compete in the games who have achieved the qualifying standard of 20.60. Graham Beasley, who finished third yesterday, ran only 20.76 so, like Campbell, would require time to reach the standard. The looming controversy overshadowed a fine run by Devonish in front of a crowd of 20,000, the largest attendance at a British meeting since 1994. He fought hard to hold off Lambert, who had run 20.37 in his semi-final. A number of athletes achieved performances they had never approached before. These included UK records for Janine Whitlock and Kelly Morgan in the pole vault and javelin respectively. Both were rewarded with Rover cars for their performances."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
