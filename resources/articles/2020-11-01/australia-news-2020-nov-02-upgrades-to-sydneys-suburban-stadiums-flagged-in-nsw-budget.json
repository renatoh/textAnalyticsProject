It is understood the 17 November budget will earmark between $2m and $3m over the next two years as a means of exploring a business case for revamping the city\u2019s sporting infrastructure to create jobs and economic growth. That could come not only from professional and grassroots sport, but also community events, the treasurer, Dominic Perrottet, said on Monday. The state government does have a long-term view to granting the NRL\u2019s wish for multiple 20,000-seat stadiums, with grounds at Leichhardt, Penrith, Brookvale and Liverpool also believed to be in the mix. The \u201cmini Bankwest Stadiums\u201d campaign obtained verbal state government backing in August, in a marked departure from big stadiums. It comes after the proposal to replace the 83,000-seat ANZ Stadium at Olympic Park was shelved because of the financial strains caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. Councils have been pushing for upgrades to their local grounds, and local MPs welcomed suggestions they may soon become the beneficiaries of new venues or upgrades akin to Parramatta\u2019s 30,000-capacity Bankwest Stadium. However, the government\u2019s current investment plans are limited to formulating a business case and do not include dollars dedicated to specific infrastructure. It is understood A-League side Sydney FC, Kogarah Oval\u2019s major summer tenant, has not been informed of any specifics. The SCG Trust, which is overseeing the $730m rebuilding of the Sydney Football Stadium, is also in the dark. Perrottet warned against \u201cgetting too far ahead of the game\u201d. \u201cThere will be some funding for planning work on Kogarah in the budget on 17 November. We know the NRL is keen to revamp some of the smaller NRL grounds but we need to do the work to make sure spending money stacks up,\u201d Perrottet told Guardian Australia in a statement. \u201cWe certainly have the runs on the board \u2013 the stadium at Parramatta is world class. It\u2019s been recognised as being one of the best venues in the country. Nobody has a better record of building infrastructure than our government \u2013 we have a $100bn pipeline of projects across the coming years.\u201d On Monday Perrottet also told 2GB radio \u201cwe\u2019ll work through this on a case-by-case basis but we do want to move away from the big stadiums and try and ensure local communities over time have great facilities\u201d. Last month, the Manly Sea Eagles chairman, Scott Penn, called for funding to help revamp the NRL club\u2019s home ground, Brookvale Oval, after construction began on a $33.1m centre of excellence and the northern grandstand. Along with Sydney FC, the Cronulla Sharks also play NRL home games at Kogarah Oval \u2013 which is the St George Illawarra Dragons\u2019 traditional home \u2013 while Shark Park is being redeveloped. The Inner West council mayor, Darcy Byrne, said Leichhardt Oval had been \u201cleft out in the cold once again\u201d and accused the government of directing funding to the \u201cfavoured electorates\u201d of Kogarah and Brookvale. \u201cWhile the state has continually snubbed the stadium and refused to make any funding contribution, [the] council has continued to invest in Leichhardt Oval, pouring several million dollars into improving the ground,\u201d Byrne said. \u201cBut we can\u2019t do it all on our own.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
