Unemployment - admittedly as measured by the controversial claimant count - is down to a 25-year low of 3.5% and the underlying rate of inflation at 1.8% is the lowest in Europe. If you add the rate of unemployment to the rate of inflation you get what economists call the \"misery index\". In the mid 1970s, when Labour was last in power and inflation was raging at over 20%, this index was over 30 points. It is now 5.3 points, at which level it to ought to be renamed the happiness index. Even the Daily Telegraph was moved yesterday to admit in a page one headline that \"Things can't get any better for Blair\". In fact, things are not quite as good as they look. There is a record trade deficit that could spoil the party. But that does not detract from the extraordinary success of Mr Brown's economic policy. Unlike the Conservatives, whose policies were responsible for two unnecessarily sharp recessions in a decade, he steered the economy clear of the first downturn during his period in office. And he has a fighting chance of avoiding a recession - defined as two successive quarters of negative growth - this time too. He has, of course, inherited an exceptionally favourable environment. Inflation has fallen all around the world as a result of globalisation (lower trade barriers enable people to buy from the cheapest source) and the effects of the digital revolution. The prices of computers, microchips and software have been falling in real terms for decades and now that they are moving into consumer goods and cars, the price falls follow them. At the same time the arrival of the internet, enabling shoppers to click around the globe for the cheapest prices, has provided a constant downward pressure on prices, even where companies think themselves immune from the effects of the net. Mr Brown has also been helped by some reforms of the Thatcher period, particularly in the labour markets where Labour has been conspicuously slow in unravelling them. Where does he go now? There is only one way - to keep testing the limits of the new economy to see how far further unemployment can fall. On the International Labour Office's definition of unemployment (those looking for work and not just those claiming benefit) it is 1.56m rather than 1m. If you include others not in either definition (such as people with family responsibilities who would like to work, or some of those claiming long-term sickness benefit who could be working), the real total of unemployed people could be over 3m. This is not to deny that there are serious skill shortages in specialised areas. But in terms of continued economic growth, the existence of a submerged reservoir of unemployed could be a source of strength. During the 1950s and early 1960s it was the norm to have unemployment at under 500,000 or even below 300,000. Maybe recent high inflation was merely a delayed response to the explosion of oil prices during the 1970s. Why can't we get back to the unemployment rates of the post-war era? We won't know until we try, and, unless we try, we will never know. Gordon Brown should continue his gradualist policy of nudging unemployment down until it can realistically go down no further. The fall to below a million which is expected next month should be seen not as the end of the road but as a fresh start."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
