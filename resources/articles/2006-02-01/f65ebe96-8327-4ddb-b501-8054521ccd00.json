At least half the population tuned in to watch the national team beat the United States 5-2. It was also a match that pitched together what must have been the two most expensive teams in the history of the Olympics, a movement once synonymous with amateurism. The Canadian team represented a combined annual salary of $118m (\u00a370m), the US $97.2m. Canada's victory was largely credited to Wayne Gretzky - aka The Great One, the highest scorer in the history of the NHL - who was, and remains, the team's executive director and who, it was claimed, had arranged for a lucky coin to be buried in the arena in Salt Lake City before the match and then watched it turn into Olympic gold. As his team opened the defence of their title with a 7-2 victory against the host nation Italy yesterday in the Palasport Olimpico, talk of coins was banned. Gretzky's wife, the actress Janet Jones, is alleged to have bet $5,000 (\u00a32,900) on which side would win the pre-match coin toss at the Super Bowl last month. It is just one of several transactions that Jones is alleged to have made, along with several NHL stars, with a gambling syndicate that has been linked to organised crime. Jones is believed to have bet $500,000 during a six-week period. Gretzky is not alleged to have done anything illegal but the scandal, which has received widespread coverage in north America, has overshadowed the beginning of Canada's defence. The cameras yesterday were largely trained on Gretzky. As you would expect of a man who has lived with pressure for most of his life, he has remained largely unfazed. \"As I said seven days ago, I wasn't involved and I consider it over and done with,\" he said. It is particularly embarrassing for Canadian ice hockey as during a speech last week the International Olympic Committee president Jacques Rogge had chosen to focus on the evils of gambling. Gretzky may not be directly involved in this scandal but the word among Canadian journalists here is that he likes to play the tables in Las Vegas. But they also claim that the timing of the story is part of a conspiracy by the American media to unsettle the Canadian team before the Games. Jones, a former Playboy centrefold model, is a woman who clearly enjoys the finer things in life. She previously dated the Hollywood star Bruce Willis and the late Vitas Gerulaitas, a former tennis US Open runner-up and Australian Open champion, before marrying Gretzky in a wedding that cost $1m - her dress alone cost $40,000 - and was broadcast live on Canadian television. Fascination in the couple continues. Jones has accompanied Gretzky here and their arrival in Italy earlier this week was covered live on TV back home. \"I feel for the guy,\" said Todd Bertuzzi, a member of Canada's team. \"I've always looked up to him and respected him. Basically, all of us are playing the game because of guys like him. It [stinks] to see someone go through something like this. Especially since it's all speculation. Nothing's proven.\" Yet, strangely, all the attention that Gretzky is receiving here could work in his team's favour. To Canadians, this tournament is comparable to what the World Cup will be for England supporters later this year, and the team is shouldering huge expectations they will retain the gold medal. With the media focusing on Gretzky, they have at least been able to prepare free from a lot of the pressure they may have expected. \"We're thinking about what athletes have to think about, and focus on the job at hand,\" the Canada coach Pat Quinn said. \"They have to put things aside and whatever that distraction may be, that's exactly what they expect of themselves and we're all going to move forward.\" The scandal does not appear to have affected Gretzky commercially. The clothing brand Roots yesterday announced that he is to be the focus of a new collection for release next week. Gretzky again shrugged off questions after the match yesterday. \"If we don't win the gold medal obviously I'll get blamed, but I've been blamed for losses before,\" he said. \"It's not going to change my life. It's been a hard week for my family and the only focus I have right now is this hockey team. The concern is to worry about playing hockey.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
