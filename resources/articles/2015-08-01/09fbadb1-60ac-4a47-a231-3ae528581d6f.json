It\u2019s an adaptation of Posy Simmonds\u2019 1999 graphic novel Gemma Bovery, which began life as a serial in the Guardian; satirising middle-class lifestyle aspiration and, a little like the Woody Allen short story The Kugelmass Episode, it surreally drops modern characters into the Flaubert novel Madame Bovary. Fabrice Luchini is the one actor who is entirely and comfortably at home in this film. He plays Martin, a former Paris publisher who has retired to a little northern French town to run his late father\u2019s bakery and becomes mesmerised by his delectable new English neighbour Gemma Bovery, gamely and intelligently played by Gemma Arterton with some persuasive French dialogue. He conceives a neurotic and menopausal obsession with her Flaubertian extramarital adventures (the camera is always leching over her curves) and the tragic danger that Gemma must therefore be in. The finale is almost farcically ridiculous, of a piece with the film\u2019s tonal variety and the rather uneven performances. But there are entertainingly sharp cartoon stabs at the new opportunist-bourgeois English in France. It\u2019s silly but enjoyable \u2013 and Luchini is, as ever, very elegant."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
