Passing through numerous pairs of hands, the ball ended up with the mercurial full-back who dived over. Blanco's habit of 40 Gitanes a day remains one of the better adverts for smoking. Darkest day: Losing at home to nemesis England in the 1991 quarter-finals. A match remembered for Renaissance men Eric Champ and Mickey Skinner exchanging pleasantries. Only Napoleon did less for the entente cordiale. Won't let you forget: Twickenham 1999: 13 minutes of mayhem as Les Bleus ran riot with 26 points against the All Blacks. Down 10-24, they won 43-31. Svengali factor: Bernard Laporte concentrates on consistency and discipline, an approach summed up by his favoured epigram of 'controlling the controllable'. Only then, apparently, can that legendary, mythic and stereotypical Gallic flair emerge. How do you beat them? The notoriously short French fuse holds out a little longer these days, though they can still be relied upon to offer up generous amounts of penalties. How do they beat you? No surprise that, yet again, France's backline will be viewed with much trepidation. The scrum, too, is rather tasty with their world-class flankers Olivier Magne and Serge Betsen to the fore. Fly-half Gerald Merceron is a poor kicker, though. Lost without: Fabien Galthi\u00e9. Another petit g\u00e9n\u00e9ral from the same factory as Jacques Fouroux and Pierre Berbizier, Galthi\u00e9's focus, drive and leadership galvanise his side. Avoid in a dark alley: Betsen is a marauding flanker who took Jonny Wilkinson out of the game two years ago when France defeated England in the Six Nations Championship. Words of wisdom: 'I am worried that in this World Cup defence will totally dominate attack,' states Laporte, having a neurotic moment. The home view: 'Laporte is lucky as he is the first coach to be widely accepted - even the press are nice to him. A success would be a place in the final,' says Eric Collier of Le Monde. OSM prediction: Although through the 1990s France were temperamental, Les Bleus are more consistent these days. Trouble is, they have been consistently average. Could be the first World Cup since 1991 in which they fail to make the last four. The squad Backs: F Galthi\u00e9, D Yachvili, F Michalak, G Merceron, D Traille, T Marsh, Y Jauzion, B Liebenberg, C Dominici, A Rougerie, P Elhorga, X Garbajosa, N Brusque, C Po\u00eetreneaud. Forwards: J-J Crenca, S Marconnet, P de Villiers, O Milloud, R Iba\u00f1ez, Y Bru, F Pelous, O Brouzet, D Auradou, J Thion, S Betsen, O Magne, I Harinordoquy, P Tabacco, C Labit, S Chabal. Pool B contender: Clement Po\u00eetreneaud, 21 One of an emerging French backline that is talent and class rich, the Toulouse full-back was a star of the recent Six Nations Championship. His penchant for fizzing runs means he is familiar with the tryline and he also knows how to drop a goal. Expect the words Serge and Blanco to feature generously in commentaries."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
