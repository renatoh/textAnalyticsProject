Lennart Johansson, Uefa's president, called on Blatter to explain ISL's descent into bankruptcy. The company was Fifa's marketing partner for the 2002 and 2006 World Cups and was declared bankrupt by a Swiss court last week with debts of over $500m (\u00a3350m). The collapse of the company has already led to the cancellation of the World Club Championship in Spain this summer and could have serious knock-on effects for next year's World Cup in Japan and South Korea, given that ISL was also responsible for selling worldwide television rights for the event. Blatter estimates the cost to Fifa alone at \u00a340m. \"The Uefa executive committee call for an extraordinary meeting of the Fifa executive committee to discuss the full consequences of recent events,\" Johansson said, reading from a statement. \"The Uefa executive committee express its grave concern at the lack of transparency and clarity of these matters and calls on the Fifa president to provide a full and complete explanation on all issues relating to the bankruptcy of ISL ... and the role played in these and other related matters by the Fifa president and the Fifa administration.\" Blatter, who defeated Johansson for the Fifa presidency, has become personally involved in the ISL debacle and was at the forefront of an attempt to save the company from bankruptcy. He denies allegations that ISL maintained a bank account in Liechtenstein with which it paid bribes to him and othersenior sports administrators. Johansson, asked if he would call for a vote of no confidence in Blatter or ask him to stand down if he was unable to explain adequately the collapse of ISL and Fifa's involvement, said: \"We must give him the chance to explain fully what has happened. But we do want an answer from him very quickly on these counts. \"We are astonished about what we are reading in the newspapers and it seems the situation is changing almost daily,\" he said. The matter is likely to be discussed at Fifa's extraordinary congress in Buenos Aires on July 7. Liverpool have been boosted by the news that they will be among the seeds when the draw for the Champions League third qualifying round is made in July. This means that G\u00e9rard Houllier's Uefa Cup winners should avoid the big guns who will also enter the competition at this stage, including Borussia Dortmund and two teams from each of Italy and Spain, one of them likely to be Wednesday's beaten finalists Valencia. Liverpool moved yesterday to replace their departing coach Patrice Bergues with another Frenchman, Jacques Crevoisier. \u0095 The former Barcelona goalkeeper Javier Urruticoechea, known as \"Urruti\", was killed in a car crash yesterday. The Basque-born 49-year-old, capped five times by Spain, died when his car hit the central barrier of a ring road in Barcelona in the early hours. \u0095 You've read the piece, now have your say.
