Drinking in the sozzled aftermath of the intoxicating wrestle with Ghana, there were reasons to savour the morning after. Not least the fact Andy Carroll seems likely to be, if not the most important England player of the next decade, then perhaps the most tantalising and easily agonised over. This is not just for his undoubted skills, or because of the hunger within English football for his style of raging, snorting forward play. It's not a tactical thing either, as it has been with Peter Crouch, who for the past six years has offered England \"that option\". Crouch's fascination has always lain in his physique, which resembles in outline a deliberate and brutally pointed satire on the notion of a traditional English footballer, some hilariously wounding pastiche made out of blankets and broom handles and a balloon for a head intended to be incinerated in rowdy protest outside FA headquarters, which somehow ends up looking eerily indistinguishable from the real-life Couch. Carroll is different. At Wembley, still seeking low-gear fitness, at times he brought to mind not so much a young Alan Shearer as the old Alan Shearer, a single pummelling shooting boot, to be unpackaged and wheeled about the park like a rust-bound first world war field gun. But Carroll is a more versatile big man than this, \"superb on the floor\", as Steven Gerrard noted this week, and finessed in his touches. The issue with Carroll is instead physiological. It is to do with what football sometimes refers to as \"intake\". The issue, unbelievably, is lager. \"He needs to improve, to drink less,\" was Fabio Capello's verdict after Carroll's first goal in midweek. This is the agony of Carroll, still so tender with greenhorn promise. Lager has already stained his path, a thirst that is a matter of public record: during the nightclub shemozzle that reached the courts last year it emerged that Carroll had drunk \"eight or nine pints of lager\" at the time of the incident. Lager! Muscle-rotting lager! All those terrible yellow toxins, wizening his knees, slackening his tendons, emaciating his calves. As was the case with Bryan Robson's shoulder, which popped its way dispiritingly through the late-1980s, sound-tracking the decade as clearly as any plunking Roland synthesiser, the temptation is now there to become wrapped up with Carroll's lager tally, to assume a condition of relentless ambient anxiety over the state of his ongoing lager thirst. Clearly this is an absurdity that could only exist in football. Imagine if this was a gymnast we were talking about, the tracksuited eminences sitting around muttering things like: \"Well, Jeremy's got all the credentials to become world No1. Poise, technique, focus \u2013 if only he could stay off the lagers!\" while some slack-bellied hulk in straining lycras flops his way around the parallel bars. Or musing over the mystery of Andy Murray's occasional concentration lapses while in the change-around chair Murray devours his customary foaming tankard of Hofmeister and signals urgently for a refill. The standard approach to football and booze is to shrug helplessly and point to a historical intertwining. Footballers have always drunk beer. Most clubs were founded out of pubs and breweries. In the 1960s Bobby Moore even starred in a TV advert for going to the pub (\"Look in at the local!\"). I spoke to a manager recently who said he could look at any player and tell you if they're a lager drinker (something about the complexion, the slackness of the skin). Still, there must be something more decisive to be done than simply hoping vaguely that Carroll can shed the thirst of his forebears. It might help to look into the very nature of lager itself. This is after all the most annihilating of drinks, a swarming tide of Total Drinking. When you're drinking lager there is only one thing that makes any sense: more lager. Plus it is an athletic catastrophe. There is no sensible lager food, no sustainable lager lifestyle. A lightly dressed salade Ni\u00e7oise \u2013 plus a few pints of lager. This just isn't going to happen. Lager begets only lager, and a full raft of degenerative lager trimmings: the palette-sharpening lager-fag, the lager-hunger solace of the sodden kebab. Lager turns the world a single colour: lager colour. It is perhaps this all-consuming quality that has marked lager out as football's chosen drink. Perhaps in Carroll's lager thirst we should even find some hope. The rituals of social lager-drinking have always fitted football's group dynamic, or the dynamic of any randomly thrown together bunch of young men. With its all-consuming cycle of drink-piss-round-drink, lager provides pretty much a complete solution to the problem of having something talk about. Lager is a young man's social lubricant and perhaps Carroll will just grow out of it, before it can seep any further into his prized fast-twitch sinews. He is already cast against type: a surprising rendition of the tall, aggressive, neck-wrenching centre-forward, with his daintier skills, his aesthete's ponytail. There is no real reason to think he can't beat football's yellow peril, too."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
