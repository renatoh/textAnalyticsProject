I just can\u2019t do it.\u201d Doolittle said his opposition to the president was based on \u201ca lot of things, policies that I disagree with, but at the end of the day it has more to do with the divisive rhetoric and the enabling of conspiracy theories and widening the divide in this country\u201d. The Nationals clinched their first World Series title in Game 7 in Houston on Wednesday against the Astros, after blowing a two-games-to-none lead with three home losses then coming back from 3-2 down. Doolittle, a closer, took care of business in Game 6, relieving series MVP Stephen Strasburg in a 7-2 victory in Texas. Trump attended Game 5 in Washington, only to be booed and subjected to chants of \u201cLock him up\u201d, triggering national debate about the need or otherwise for civility in a polarised society. On Saturday the Lincoln biographer, Clinton adviser, Guardian contributor, baseball fan and stringent Trump critic Sidney Blumenthal wrote in an email: \u201cThe Red Sox had the curse of the Bambino. The Cubs had the curse of the billy goat. The Nationals had the curse of Trump. \u201cFrom the moment he announced he would attend a game they lost three straight World Series games in their own park. Then, they removed themselves from the scene of the curse and won two straight in Houston. About Trump ever entering Nationals Park: Never Again!\u201d No team based in Washington had won the World Series since 1924. In a euphoric tweet after the team\u2019s victory, Doolittle said the trophy was \u201cv shiny, hard to drink from (we tried), impossible to eat cereal out of, heavier than it looks, can be worn like a hat, still in one piece (barely), says 2019 World Champions on it, IS BACK IN DC AND WE CAN\u2019T WAIT TO SHARE IT WITH YOU.\u201d The champions paraded through the city on Saturday, to a rally near Capitol Hill. Tens of thousands of fans attended. Doolittle told the Post he did not want to distract from teammates who did want to meet the president but said he felt \u201cvery strongly about his issues on race relations\u201d and wanted to make a stand for LGBTQ rights. His wife Eireann Dolan \u2013 with whom he said he had done \u201cwork with refugees\u201d, making Trump\u2019s infamous \u201cshithole countries\u201d remark particularly painful \u2013 has two mothers, he said. \u201cI want to show support for them,\u201d Doolittle said. \u201cI think that\u2019s an important part of ally-ship, and I don\u2019t want to turn my back on them. \u201cI have a brother-in-law who has autism, and [Trump] is a guy that mocked a disabled reporter. How would I explain that to him that I hung out with somebody who mocked the way that he talked, or the way that he moves his hands? I can\u2019t get past that stuff.\u201d Trump infamously mocked Serge Kovaleski in 2015, over the New York Times reporter\u2019s work on the billionaire\u2019s dubious claims about his experiences on 9/11. Kovaleski has a condition, arthrogryposis, which affects the movement of his arms. The Times called Trump\u2019s mockery \u201coutrageous\u201d. Doolittle said he had studied how other champions handled their decisions not to visit the White House. Winners from the NBA, NHL and NFL have refused to go. Trump has clashed personally with many, notably last summer with Megan Rapinoe, the star player on the US team which won the Women\u2019s World Cup. Doolittle indicated that if the president comes out swinging \u2013 and tweeting \u2013 he will not be tempted to throw any beanballs back. \u201cI don\u2019t want to get mad online,\u201d he said. \u201cI want people to know that I put thought into this and, at the end of the day, I just can\u2019t go.\u201d He added: \u201cPeople say you should go because it\u2019s about respecting the office of the president. And I think over the course of his time in office he\u2019s done a lot of things that maybe don\u2019t respect the office.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
