After two terms in power, though, why should mentioning income tax still be such a sensitive issue for Labour MPs? Squeaking pips Brought to power in 1974 on the back of an upsurge in working class and trade union politics, Labour chancellor Denis Healey pledged to pound the rich \"until the pips squeak\". Conservative MPs wore Chairman Mao suits in mocking tribute as Mr Healey presented his Budget, but the chancellor still managed to infuriate some in his own party by postponing the introduction of a wealth tax. It was to be the only moderation he showed for most of the decade. The basic rate of income tax was raised immediately to one-third of earnings, and the top rate increased from 75% to 83%. Corporation tax more than quadrupled, rising to over 50%. Over the coming years Mr Healey's budgets continued to raise taxes, controversially giving the TUC an effective veto on fiscal policy by making his budgets dependent on TUC acceptance of pay ceilings. Mrs Thatcher, leading the opposition, called them genuine socialist budgets in that they guaranteed \"an equal share of misery for all\". By the end of the 70s Mr Healey's plans were falling apart. Having brought the top rate of tax to 98% he was forced to retreat, making billions of pounds worth of tax cuts in a bid to salvage the economy and Labour's electoral hopes. Eyeing the mess he was about to take over, the shadow chancellor, Sir Geoffrey Howe, told Mr Healey he had \"left a dreadful inheritance for the next chancellor\". Mr Healey's 1979 budget was to be the last by a Labour chancellor for 18 years. The Thatcher years Lord Young, Mrs Thatcher's secretary of state for trade and industry in the 1980s, recalled the story of a futurologist predicting in the 1970s that the two European countries with the lowest standard of living in the year 2000 would be Albania and Britain. \"We did change the world,\" he said. \"The UK, which was the sick man of Europe, became the healthy man of Europe ... I remember Mrs Thatcher saying: 'The test of whether we have succeeded will be when all the entrepreneurial Britons come home'.\" Over the next decade, they did. Labour's attempts to win back power floundered, with heavy defeats in 1983 and 1987 on the back of fuzzy financial proposals. The 1987 \"shadow budget\" reined in the tax-and-spend plans of the previous election, but also pledged to abolish Tory \"income tax bribes\" and came under heavy fire for failing to spell out how the party would finance its spending. By 1992, Labour had reduced its tax plans still further. With John Smith as its shadow chancellor, the party was appearing re-electable, with clearly costed plans that were open about introducing a new 50% tax band for high earners. The Tory response - a billboard campaign focusing on \"Labour's tax bombshell\" - caused damaging public disagreements between Mr Smith and party leader Neil Kinnock. The shadow budget blew up in Mr Smith's face, and John Major pulled off an unexpected electoral victory. By the 1997 electoral campaign the red flag of socialism had been replaced with the red rose of Blairism, and the new Labour election manifesto promised no return to \"penal tax rates\" and no income tax increases during the party's first government. Despite polls earlier in the year showing that over 90% of business leaders feared tax hikes under a Labour government, Blair led his party to a landslide victory - and kept his tax pledge. New Labour in power In 1945, Labour's first economic policy had been to nationalise the Bank of England. In 1997, in a sign of how Labour thinking had changed, Gordon Brown's first act as chancellor was to make it independent. Tony Blair promised that there would be \"no concealed tax increases, no evasion, no double-dealing, no hidden agenda\". Over the next four years, chancellor Brown worked on building a reputation for prudence, pledging that there would be no \"indiscriminate across-the-board tax cuts\". Having kept to Tory spending plans until 1999, he made over \u00a31bn in income tax cuts in 2001 to aid Labour's re-election campaign, prompting claims that he was \"returning to boom and bust\". The shadow deputy prime minister told the house that if \"old Labour represented feast then famine, new Labour represents famine then glut\". Tony Blair's Labour government was convincingly re-elected the following year. In 2002, Mr Brown unveiled his \"NHS budget\", pouring \u00a340bn into the health system and increasing public spending from \u00a3390bn to \u00a3471bn over the next four years. He refused to increase income tax, but instead raised \u00a39bn through an across-the-board increase of 1% in national insurance contributions. Backbenchers applauded his \"first Labour Budget\", although in the aftermath of Iraq his Budget the following year was seen as lacklustre. The Conservatives claim that Labour is increasing the real tax burden through stealth taxes, a favourite method of the Thatcher government. Lord Young called Tony Blair - and Labour's acceptance of capitalism - the \"final victory\" of Mrs Thatcher. The final taboo? The furore over Mr Hain's comments today spell out the importance that both the government and the opposition continue to attach to Labour's tax record. David Davis told MPs in the run-up to the last election: \"The chancellor ... is saddled with Labour's history and reputation for economic incompetence.\" Conservatives certainly hope that's the case - Gordon Brown's reputation for economic prudence and competence is still seen by many as the main obstacle to a Tory return to power. Mr Hain's comments will return to haunt his party, who will now surely face claims from the Conservatives that their real agenda is one of tax-and-spend, no matter what the Treasury says. As the government's response has shown today, the Labour party, too, fears its past failings will return to haunt it. Labour's 18 years in the wilderness remain a painfully recent memory, and their move away from the red flag and socialist tax-and-spend policies is still seen by many as directly linked to their subsequent electoral successes. Mentioning tax increases remains, for many Labour MPs, the ultimate faux pas, and certainly too sensitive a subject for the \"adult debate\" Mr Hain says he hoped to foster."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
