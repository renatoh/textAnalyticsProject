The Welsh sheep farmer turned broker tied the knot at his Brecon Beacons farm at the weekend in front of 250 guests, including Vodafone's chairman, Lord MacLaurin. Griffiths' \"very tasteful\" marriage to a fashion PR included pre-drinks at the local pub he owns, the White Swan in Llanfrynach. A Saudi friend who couldn't make it instead air-freighted a veritable garden of flowers to Bristol airport, which were then helicoptered to the wedding, along with some bellydancers. Having stepped down as Evolution's chairman in May, there is talk that the endurance event-loving Griffiths will now quit altogether. \u00b7 Alan Johnson, the trade and industry secretary, offended Incredible String Band fans at a London conference on climate change yesterday, suggesting that while global warming might be a mainstream concern now, worrying about climate change in the 1970s was \"pretty eccentric\" - as weird as liking the ISD. (For those under 40, this folk band from the Scottish Borders had a string of hits in the 1960s with titles such as Wee Tam and the Big Huge.) ISD fans preferred Johnson's reference to Maggie Thatcher giving short shrift to a civil servant fretting about global warming: \"You're telling me I should worry about the weather?\" \u00b7 The star of T-Mobile's ad for its new Web 'n' Walk mobile internet service, the fictional writer Chad Kroski, became a porn celebrity after the ad was aired in Germany. The ad, which has its British debut this month, features a woman in a bar desperate to chat up a bloke who has a Kroski book. She dashes to the loo to use her T-Mobile device to Google Mr Kroski and gets all the chat-up fodder she needs. But T-Mobile was forced into damage control after the German advert prompted some bright spark to set up a porn site in Mr Kroski's name. A little unsportingly, chadkroski.co.uk takes surfers straight to T-Mobile's site."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
