In fact, I believe these lines have been attributed to John Wilmot, second earl of Rochester (1647\u201380) \u2013 as confirmed by page 143 of The Works of the Earls of Rochester, Roscommon, and Dorset; the Dukes of Devonshire, Buckinghamshire, &amp;c. With Memoirs of Their Lives, published in 1731. His poem The Maidenhead reads as follows: \"Have you not in a Chimney seen, / A sullen Faggot wet and green, / How coily it receives the Heat, / And at both Ends does fume and sweat? / So fares it with the harmless Maid, / When first upon her Back she's laid / But the well-experienc'd Dame, / Cracks and rejoices in the Flame.\" Kathryn Barush Wadham College, University of Oxford \u2022 The poem is well known to singers of catches and glees. Set by Robert Smith and included in the LP Catches and Glees of the English Restoration, it was one of the texts collected by John Playford for his Musical Companion (1672/73).
