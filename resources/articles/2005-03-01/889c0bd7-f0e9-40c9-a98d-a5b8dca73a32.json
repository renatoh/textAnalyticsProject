Under rules introduced this year competitors must use the same engine for two races but can change it if they retire, a rule clearly intended to provide for accidents and mechanical failures. \"However, we need to draw a distinction between failing to finish rather than choosing not to finish,\" an FIA insider said yesterday after Toyota slammed BAR for their interpretation of the rules. \"There has been a lot of controversy surrounding loopholes in the new rules but exploitation of such grey areas is against our understanding of racing,\" said Luca Marmorini, the technical director of Toyota's engine programme. \"Even though our drivers did not score any points in the last race we decided to pass the chequered flag out of respect for the new rules. If we are to challenge for points regularly we must finish the race and that means having an engine to last two races.\" That viewpoint was echoed by Pat Symonds, executive director of engineering for the Renault team, whose driver Giancarlo Fisichella won in Melbourne. \"The ideal of running an engine for two weekends is, I believe, a good one,\" he said, \"but the loophole that has been left is ridiculous.\" Nick Fry, BAR's team principal, was unrepentant. \"Our reading of the rules is that, if you fail to finish, it then gives you the opportunity to change your engine,\" he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
