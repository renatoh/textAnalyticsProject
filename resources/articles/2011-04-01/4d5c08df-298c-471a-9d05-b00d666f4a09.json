After cult hit Moon, Jones goes for the mainstream with a conceptual thriller that makes Christopher Nolan look soulless but would have Hitchcock scratching his head. The Deja Vu-meets-Groundhog Day plot forces Gyllenhaal's GI to relive the last eight minutes of a train bombing over and over till he finds the terrorist (experimental technology \u2013 don't ask). That shouldn't leave much time for relationships, big questions or light relief but it's all squeezed in, just about\u2026 Sucker Punch (12A) (Zack Snyder, 2011, US/Can) Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone. 110 mins. Zack Snyder shows you his fantasy, which turns out to consist of fetish-outfitted babes in scenarios out of computer games and women's prison movies, to a diluted alt soundtrack. This man needs help. Oranges And Sunshine (15) (Jim Loach, 2010, UK/Aus) Emily Watson, Hugo Weaving, David Wenham. 105 mins. Loach junior acquits himself and indicts the government, with an intrinsically tear-jerking social history. Watson lifts the lid on a hidden deportation policy and tracks down its victims. Essential Killing (15) (Jerzy Skolimowski, 2010, Pol/Nor/Ire/Hun) Vincent Gallo, Emmanuelle Seigner. Despite its topical themes, this unfolds as an almost abstract chase movie, relentlessly pitching its Taliban captive (a wordless Gallo) into tense, occasionally absurd, situations. Killing Bono (15) (Nick Hamm, 2011, UK) Ben Barnes, Robert Sheehan. 114 mins. Knockabout rock comedy on the Dublin rivals U2 left behind. Not much killing, but it has Pete Postlethwaite's last performance. Louise-Michel (12A) (Gustave de Kervern, Beno\u00eet Del\u00e9pine, 2008, Fra) Yolande Moreau, Bouli Lanners. 95 mins. Downsized workers get their revenge by taking out a hit on their boss in this gleefully anarchic comedy. A poor choice of hitman and liberal political potshots add to the fun. Hop (U) (Tim Hill, 2011, US) Russell Brand, James Marsden. 95 mins. Just what parents need for Easter: an animation full of comical animals, family values, literally tons of sugary sweets and, er, the Playboy brand. Passenger Side (15) (Matt Bissonnette, 2009, US) Adam Scott, Joel Bissonnette. 85 mins. Despite some stock elements (bickering brothers, road trip, hipster soundtrack), this LA indie is less predictable and more focused than it first appears. Blooded (15) (Edward Boase, 2011, UK) Neil McDermott, Nick Ashdon. 78 mins. The pro-hunting lobby get the wrong end of the shooting stick in this highland game-of-death faux doc that's had real animal rights activists up in arms \u2013 not literally, mind. Young Hearts Run Free (12A) (Andy Mark Simpson, 2011, UK) Andy Black, Jennifer Bryden. 93 mins. Another tale of growing up in, and striving to get out of, the industrial 1970s north, though this at least has some context to make up for the limited scale. Out next week Armadillo Risk-taking documentary on Danish forces in Afghanistan. Cold Fish Macabre portrait of a Japanese serial killer. Rio Bird animation from the Ice Age team.
