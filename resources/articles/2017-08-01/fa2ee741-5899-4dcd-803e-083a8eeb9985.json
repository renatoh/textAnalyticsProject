Evans, 29, had been identified by Pep Guardiola as precisely the kind of ball-playing centre-back the manager wants to bolster an area of the defence that lacks depth and quality. Guardiola, it is understood, has a firm interest in Evans but saw an \u00a318m bid rejected on Wednesday. If City can prise the Northern Irishman away from West Brom he will be given a chance to compete for a first-team berth. Evans left United two years ago after Louis van Gaal, the former manager, sanctioned his sale to West Brom, a move that \u201cstunned\u201d Van Gaal\u2019s predecessor Sir Alex Ferguson, according to Michael O\u2019Neill, the Northern Ireland coach. That deal cost Albion around \u00a38m as Evans was in the final 12 months of his contract at Old Trafford. He has two years left of his terms at West Brom so an improved bid of around \u00a320m may tempt the Midlands club to sell. Last month Tony Pulis, the West Brom manager, claimed Evans would not be sold and pointed to how he was now the captain following Darren Fletcher\u2019s move to Stoke City. \u201cJonny Evans is staying with West Bromwich Albion,\u201d Pulis said. \u201cThere is no doubt about that. Jonny will be our captain next season. He had a fantastic year last season and I\u2019m hoping he steps up now. He\u2019s not had the responsibility before, to be a captain around the club.\u201d However, if Evans was to join City he would follow Peter Schmeichel, Andy Cole, Andrei Kanchelskis, Owen Hargreaves and Carlos Tevez as players who have also been at both clubs since the Premier League\u2019s inception 25 years ago. While Pulis would be loth to lose Evans following Fletcher\u2019s departure, Guardiola\u2019s options at centre-back are particularly limited. The captain, Vincent Kompany, has had an injury-troubled past two seasons, while John Stones and Nicol\u00e1s Otamendi, the only two other front-line operators in the position, are yet to totally convince the head coach. Guardiola\u2019s issue at centre-half is underlined by Eliaquim Mangala\u2019s reintroduction to the first-team squad after spending all of last year at Valencia on loan. The Frenchman cost \u00a342m from Porto in the summer of 2014 but failed to impress, yet Guardiola named Mangala on the bench for Saturday\u2019s 2-0 victory at Brighton &amp; Hove Albion. That signalled that despite his shaky City career Mangala is currently ahead of Tosin Adarabioyo and Jason Denayer."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
