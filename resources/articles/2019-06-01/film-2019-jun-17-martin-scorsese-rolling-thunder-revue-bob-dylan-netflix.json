In the autumn, his much-hyped, big-budget gangster film The Irishman will be released on the streaming service, but the 76-year-old has dipped a toe in the water with something a little smaller and funkier: another Bob Dylan documentary. I say \u201canother\u201d, but if you\u2019re expecting a direct follow-up to Scorsese\u2019s 2005 opus No Direction Home, or a concert film in the vein of 1978\u2019s Dylan-featuring The Last Waltz, you\u2019ll be surprised. Rolling Thunder Revue: A Bob Dylan Story, which has been streaming on Netflix since Wednesday, is something more puckish and, well, freewheeling than any of Scorsese\u2019s previous music docs \u2013 the word \u201cstory\u201d, for starters, shouldn\u2019t be disregarded: there\u2019s a bit of fabrication here amid the facts. Ostensibly, it\u2019s a portrait of Dylan\u2019s famous seven-month Rolling Thunder Revue concert tour from 1975 to 1976, which saw him \u2013 alongside a rotating coterie of friends and collaborators \u2013 perform in a series of smaller venues in smaller US cities, fostering an intimacy between artist and audience that he felt was lost in rock stadiums. And much of the unhurried 140-minute film delivers on that promise, in a jangly, haphazardly structured fashion that effectively evokes the cheerfully ragged ambience of the concerts themselves. So we get priceless archive footage of a Brillo-bearded Allen Ginsberg bewildering polite midwestern audiences with ornately woolly poetry readings, or Joni Mitchell riffing on her then newborn song Coyote in a backstage jam session \u2013 alongside the perfectly selected Dylan stage performances you\u2019d expect, from a transfixing version of One More Cup of Coffee to electrified renditions of his folkier 1960s standards to a duet with Joan Baez on I Shall Be Released that practically delivers a you-are-there quiver. Hey, Scorsese has always known how to choose a song; Dylanophiles will be more than sated. But there\u2019s a tricksier fictitious element to Rolling Thunder Revue that is already polarising the faithful. Amid the accompanying gallery of contemporary talking-head interviews with figures ranging from Baez to Sam Shepard \u2013 and some very funny running commentary from Dylan himself, who claims with a sigh to scarcely remember proceedings \u2013 are four fakes, inventing stories of their involvement with the project. Alleged film-maker \u201cStefan van Dorp\u201d recalls his experiences of shooting the tour with amusing sourness; Sharon Stone reflects on her supposed time as a teenage roadie. It\u2019s a droll gimmick designed to match Dylan\u2019s own prankish sensibility, but a needless one given Scorsese\u2019s wealth of more significant material: when we have boxer Rubin Carter, once falsely imprisoned for murder, on hand to talk about how Dylan\u2019s song Hurricane helped reignite his case, such in-jokes feel like rather trivial sideshows. Then again, this is a revue, after all: have the liberties of filming for Netflix put Scorsese in a more playful mood? Perhaps, though the baggy, immersive oddity of Rolling Thunder Revue still feels like more of a big-screen experience. No Direction Home and The Last Waltz, both available to stream on Amazon Prime, are still there for the traditionalists: the former with its loving, scholarly attention to biographical detail, and the latter (primarily capturing Dylan collaborators the Band, but with a galvanising appearance from the man) with a throbbing live current still unbeaten in the annals of concert cinema. But Scorsese\u2019s latest feels no less true to its subject, nor to the film-maker\u2019s own wily creativity. Netflix isn\u2019t the end of him by a long shot. Also on DVD this week If Beale Street Could Talk (eOne, 15) Barry Jenkins follows up Moonlight with a rapturous James Baldwin adaptation, creating saturated visual poetry to carry the author\u2019s vigorous evocation of African American family life in 1970s Harlem. Boy Erased (Universal, 15) Joel Edgerton\u2019s heartfelt film of Garrard Conley\u2019s gay-conversion therapy memoir is too tastefully reserved to get under the skin, but Lucas Hedges\u2019s bruised lead performance makes it worthwhile. The Heiress (Sony, PG) Sharper and tarter than you might expect from the 1940s studio system, this William Wyler-directed take on Henry James\u2019s Washington Square \u2013 with an Oscar-winning Olivia de Havilland in the lead \u2013 holds up beautifully."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
