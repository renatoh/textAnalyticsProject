Strategically stationed to ensure attempts at evasion are fruitless, they are usually young, bright-faced and impeccably polite. They wear bibs. They carry clipboards. They smile a lot. Many describe them as the most annoying people in Britain. Last week, after exhaustive training, I joined the swelling army touting for charity on our streets. Dubbed 'chuggers', a coinage for charity muggers, our group took up positions in a London street. My first attempt at persuading someone to sign up for a direct debit drew a chilly response.'You're a bloody pain,' says a man in a suit walking by. 'You've already asked me seven times.' The next time was not better, another man telling me bluntly that he hopes they never find a cure for cancer. Several more people cross the road to avoid me and one old lady laughs with pity before shuffling past. Seen by many as the scourge of shoppers, chuggers can be uncompromising in their pursuit of a slice of strangers' disposable income, yet provide a rich source of funds for charities. I spent two days as a chugger in London and, whatever the weather, the obligatory smile was etched across my face. But putting up with the abuse, cold shoulders and irritated glares proved to be worth it. One man did stop, expressed his concern and offered to give \u00a312 a month to the cancer research charity. Then a lady pulled me to the side and told me about her own fight against the disease. It's not an easy job: although it may be for a good cause, chuggers are trained to be as tough as any other salesperson vying to relieve shoppers of their hard-earned cash. The pay for a chugger is a flat rate (in this case \u00a38 per hour) with no commission, but - crucially - targets have to be met. Most are employed by fundraising businesses which have contracts with charities. The income of these businesses depends on the numbers of people signed up and staff are expected to raise a minimum amount per day. In reality this means signing up at least two people, one for \u00a310 a month and one for \u00a36 a month. If those targets are not met over 'some time', your employment - we were told ominously - would be reviewed. Other employees, in the job less than a month, spoke of friends who had already been politely asked to leave. One worker told me that on a slow morning the team manager had come down and screamed at the group. 'This girl had tears in her eyes,' he said before admitting that it did the trick: 'In the afternoon we all met our targets.' Although the targets were made clear, we were told that under no circumstances were we to guilt-trip or pressurise anyone into giving. The company's ethos was to offer people the chance to sign up, to raise awareness and to make money for a good cause. Training also ensures that employees can give answers to those who want more information about the cause itself. For one afternoon we used role-plays to learn about the charity. The performances ranged from a mock-up court case with the charity on trial to an ad hoc version of Blockbusters. 'What CL is a type of cancer that had a 0 per cent survival rate 20 years ago but an 85 per cent one now?' 'That'll be childhood leukaemia, Bob.' Then we were taught how to approach the public: ask people if they have a minute for the cause, introduce yourself, tell them the problems facing the charity, the proposed solutions and then be upfront in asking for money. We were to start with a request for \u00a310 or \u00a312 a month and if they were not happy with that to try for \u00a36. As soon as money is mentioned the collectors must disclose that they are being paid for what they are doing. Finally, I was let loose on an unsuspecting public. My first posting was Baker Street. A mixture of tourists and businessmen streamed past and for the first couple of hours it seemed to be going quite well. Lots of people stopped and listened. Two people did sign up: one woman who had lost her mother to breast cancer and a young man. It felt good. But as the day wore on, and it became darker and colder, the appeal of the job fell. Towards 6pm it was just the people rushing home from work. The mobile phones clutched to their ears were their way of signalling their lack of interest. Some broke into a run when they saw me. My next posting was the suburbs - Blackheath. I thought people would be in less of a rush and happier to talk but they weren't. They are so used to seeing chuggers outside their local train station that those happy to sign up had already done so - three times. The same families kept walking past me and each time were met with my cheery: 'Hi. Could you spare a minute for cancer research?' I felt ready to go home when one man shouted: 'You're a bloody pain.' But, once again it got better. That afternoon one man came over to me and cut into my prepared speech about the charity with: 'Yeah, I believe you, just let me sign up.' Later in the day two more stopped, one to offer \u00a310 a month and one \u00a315 a month. Signing up two people a day sounds easy, but it isn't. Many are offended by fundraisers. I found myself thanking people who said no because they had been kind enough to acknowledge my existence. For much of the day I felt like an inanimate street bollard. If anyone showed pity my spirits lifted. If they stopped to chat I started to glow. If they signed up I was ecstatic. Many people are concerned that the concept of payment for face-to-face fundraisers is wrong but for the charities it has become an invaluable source of funds and has led to a greater number of younger people giving money. For Shelter, it brings in \u00a33 million a year - making up 15 per cent of its income - and has been important in raising awareness. 'Shelter is very misunderstood,' says Liz Monks, deputy director of fundraising. 'We are not only about helping people on the street but also helping people to stay in housing. With face-to-face, people are trained before they go out so they can tell people about us.' But for those who do not want to give money by this method having someone smiling at you and willing you to stop can simply seem annoying. 'People don't like being buttonholed on the street. It is seen as aggressive,' says Antony Robbins, the Charity Commission's head of communications. Despite this the commission has received only eight complaints about chuggers, none of which has led to a full-scale inquiry. 'Many people find it a pain but if you don't want to give on the street then don't,' says Robbins, claiming there has been no evidence at all of fundraisers acting aggressively. If anything the opposite has been true: 'People verbally or occasionally physically attack fundraisers. It is very disappointing.' Clipboardpeople In 2002, 350,000 members of the public set up direct debits with chuggers. There are now 19 companies, signed up to the Public Fundraising Regulatory Association (PFRA), that send chuggers out on to the street. The average donor who uses a chugger to sign up will continue to give for five years. Between 85p and 93p of every pound given to a chugger goes to a charitable use."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
