The embattled prime minister had pinned her hopes on a last-ditch effort to persuade the European Union to work with her in devising a legal guarantee, known as a \u201cjoint interpretative instrument\u201d, that she believes could get her Brexit deal through parliament. The idea of the EU having the target of terminating the Northern Ireland backstop no more than a year after it was put in force had been supported by Germany\u2019s Angela Merkel and Austria\u2019s Sebastian Kurz. But it was opposed by Ireland, France, Sweden, Spain and Belgium, who voiced doubts that the prime minister would be able to sell the technical concession to hostile MPs in Westminster. Following an address by May before a dinner, and subsequent discussions among the 27 member states, the European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, suggested it was difficult to imagine any deal getting through parliament at the moment, and that it was not up to the EU to satisfy the demands of rebellious MPs. Juncker said: \u201cOur UK friends need to say what they want, rather than asking what we want. We would like in a few weeks for our UK friends to set out their expectations because this debate is sometimes nebulous and imprecise and I would like clarifications.\u201d Deliberately avoiding the confrontational approach demanded by her hard Brexit critics, May had appealed to her EU counterparts to work with her in revising the Brexit deal. \u201cWe must get this right,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s hold nothing in reserve, let\u2019s work intensively to get this over the line.\u201d The prime minister told the summit that \u201cwe have to change the perception that the backstop is a trap\u201d \u2013 clearly signalling that it had to be time-limited \u2013 and insisted that with revisions her deal was \u201cthe only deal capable of getting through parliament\u201d to bring EU leaders on side. But Juncker said that he could not understand the mindset of British MPs, and indicated an unwillingness to bend to the Commons, setting up a nervous few weeks for Downing Street. He said: \u201cI am still of the opinion that Mrs May is fighting hard and bravely but we have not seen results.\u201d Some EU sources said there would be no further \u201creassurances\u201d for the UK other than the short statement agreed over dinner on Thursday in Brussels, dashing hopes of more complicated legal wheezes, such as treaties deposited at the UN. \u201cThis is it, as I understand it,\u201d said an EU source, pointing out the European summit conclusions were binding on members. A second EU diplomat said the \u201cdoor was still open\u201d, but complained that May had not explained what she was seeking in enough detail in her address to the leaders. May had billed her appeal as the last opportunity to save her unpopular deal and get it through parliament in time for the 29 March deadline, although it was unclear that the move would persuade a sceptical Democratic Unionist party and hard Brexit Conservatives that the UK cannot be stuck in the backstop. The prime minister still hopes to begin a short, intense period of final negotiations with EU officials following the Brussels summit, leading to an additional guarantee that No 10 insists must have legal weight. But a final version of the summit communique published by the EU leaders late on Thursday was less generous to May than earlier drafts. Irish objections led the removal of a phrase that the EU \u201cstands ready to examine whether any further assurance can be provided\u201d on the backstop. Wording that the the backstop would not be \u201ca desirable outcome\u201d was also cut from the text. The UK had hoped to set a year as a target for getting out of the backstop by negotiating a free trade deal or an alternative arrangement for avoiding a hard border on the island of Ireland. It is still hoped that further talks can run on through Christmas on such a document. With little prospect of a quick breakthrough though Downing Street conceded that the delayed meaningful vote on what is likely to be a revised Brexit deal would not take place until the new year. It would go ahead \u201cas soon as possible in January\u201d having previously said it would take place before 21 January. May\u2019s reputation rests on resolving the impasse, after an intensely difficult week, in which she was forced to pull the vote on the original Brexit deal on Tuesday because she had no chance of getting it through the House of Commons. That prompted hostile Conservative MPs to table a motion of no confidence in her as party leadership, which she saw off on Wednesday by 200 to 117. In Brussels on Thursday, May was forced to publicly repeat a promise she had made to Conservative MPs, when pleading for her job before the party\u2019s 1922 Committee the day before, that she would not lead the party into the next general election. The prime minister acknowledged that she \u201cwould love to be able to lead the Conservative party into the next general election\u201d, which she said would be as scheduled in 2022, but conceded \u201cI think it is right that the party feels it would prefer to go into that election with a new leader.\u201d In Brussels, a bilateral meeting between May and Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, underscored the diplomatic difficulties ahead of May. Varadkar said his British counterpart had made a range of suggestions to break the deadlock, some of which \u201cmade sense, others I thought were difficult\u201d. A backstop is deemed necessary by the EU to ensure that there will be no return to a hard border in Ireland in the event that the UK and the EU cannot sign a long-term free trade deal. If it comes into force, the UK would remain in a customs union with the EU."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
