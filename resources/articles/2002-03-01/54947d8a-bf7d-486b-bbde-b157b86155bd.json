With the prospect of extra- time and penalties coming ever closer last night, the PSV Eindhoven centre-forward leapt bravely at a Theo Lucius shot that had come back off the crossbar to force the ball across the line. There were 51 seconds left. So Leeds joined Rangers and it is the Battle of Holland not Britain which awaits the Uefa Cup quarter-finals. This was a slow burner of a contest, one in which PSV got gradually stronger and Leeds weaker, but David O'Leary saw another of his much-mentioned candles blown out by Vennegoor of Hesselink. Last night began in similar fashion to the first leg last week - goalless again, yet open and highly entertaining. As in Holland, too, the PSV right-winger Dennis Rommedahl started at a sprint, the Dutch still fancying his chances in a race against Ian Harte. Rommedahl's prominence must have concerned O'Leary, though the visibility of Mark Viduka and Alan Smith in the first half-hour told of Leeds' confident approach. With Lee Bowyer influential in central midfield, Eirik Bakke had a couple of speculative shots from distance, before Viduka had a 12th-minute flick well saved by Patrick Lodewijks. Harry Kewell, playing with real relish, emerged as a key individual after that, a heightened profile that will have delighted his manager. In the 20th minute he exchanged a slick one-two with Viduka and sent an exquisite right-foot shot curling round the static Lodewijks. Unfortunately for Kewell and Leeds, the ball shaved the outside of a post If that was Kewell at his best, shortly afterwards the Australian showed a different side. Viduka was again the creator, charging on to Danny Mills' 50-yard pass and reaching the byline. From there Viduka did as he should, looked up, ignored Smith and found Kewell arriving late at the back. But Kewell, on his favoured left foot and 10 yards out, skied his drive. For a while, with Mark van Bommel oozing class rather than the aggression of the first leg in the Eindhoven midfield, PSV assumed nonchalant control. Rommedahl was to the fore once more as chances fell to Andre Ooijer, who went close with a header, and Theo Lucius, who shot narrowly wide from the edge of the area. But the half ended on a high note for the Yorkshire side, a great move instigated by Rio Ferdinand's dashing run featuring Gary Kelly and Viduka before Bakke drilled in a 20-yard shot that flew just over. Kewell came out with his gloves on for the second half, even if a typical surge down the left to win a corner suggested the opposite. But Leeds squandered that and, when Bowyer put a header wide following impressive running from Kelly, O'Leary's team had spent almost four hours without a goal. That was worrying enough but PSV were now playing with even more enterprise than before the interval. There were times when Leeds had all 11 men in their own half behind the ball as Van Bommel knitted things together simply but to dangerous effect. Mateja Kezman, the sprightly sidekick to Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink, was finding space easier to come by in the Leeds area and had Nigel Martyn at full stretch with a diagonal shot on the hour. Needless to say Van Bommel was the originator of the attack and immediately set another on its way with a clipped pass to Rommedahl. The nippy winger rocked Martyn on to his heels. The balance of power had changed - Ferdinand made a big block on Kezman - and Leeds had to discover a way of regaining the momentum. Leeds United (4-4-2) Martyn; Mills, Ferdinand, Matteo, Harte; Kelly, Bowyer, Bakke, Kewell; Viduka, Smith. PSV Eindhoven (4-4-2) Lodewijks; Bouma, Hofland, Ooijer, Bogelund; Rommedahl, Van Bommel, Vogel, Lucius; Vennegoor of Hesselink, Kezman.
