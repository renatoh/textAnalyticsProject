But with a six-hour drive and a long ferry crossing to get there, plus a bit of wet weather thrown in, you're always worried it could turn into disaster. Would they be fighting and squabbling in the back of the car to relieve the boredom, or be hit with a heavy dose of motion sickness? Would they be running madly around the boat causing mayhem and chaos? And once we arrived, would there be enough to do if we were stuck inside with the rain pouring down? Ultimately it was a relief that, despite a few temper tantrums, our luck held and the final outcome was more holiday heaven than hell. Those seeking Continental weather would most likely be disappointed with Brittany. Okay, we had sun each day, but the weather systems were so changeable that, from one hour to the next, it was impossible to guess whether to take swimwear or sou'westers to the beach. On more than one occasion we wished we'd taken the latter, fleeing back to the car as a sweltering afternoon turned into a downpour. Days on the beach were spent with eyes scouring the skies for dark clouds, checking which way the wind was blowing. Our g\u00eete, near the village of Landudec, had the great advantage of being about 15 minutes' drive from the coast and the many beaches of the Baie d'Audierne. With young children there is no easier form of entertainment than taking them all to a safe stretch of sand, such as at Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s, where one parent can snooze away while the other takes them for a paddle. Brittany has so many of these beaches that the kids can have an exciting new adventure every day. Fortunately, none of them betrayed any after-effects fromthe oil spillage from the tanker Erika in 1999, which had devastated hundreds of miles of coastline. All in all, we found less oil than you'd probably get from the greasy chip wrappers blowing around most UK beaches. The Baie des Tr\u00e9pass\u00e9s was next door to the Pointe du Raz, Breton's equivalent of Land's End (the local d\u00e9partment is named Finist\u00e8re, from the Latin finis terrae ). The Pointe is at the tip of a rugged coastline that includes a number of jutting tips (Pointes du Millier, de Beuzec, du Van and R\u00e9serve du Cap Sizun) each of which is worth a brief pause to marvel at the crashing waves, rocky alcoves, steep cliffs and sweeping views right across the Baie de Douarnenez. It became clear that Brittany is France's equivalent of Cornwall: similar weather, similar landscape and, thanks to the Celtic influence, similar history, too. Indeed, the area in which we were staying, stretching from the south-western tip to Quimperl\u00e9 in the east, bears the name Cornouaille. With 700 miles of coastline, it's hardly surprising that the local economy has traditionally been dominated by the fishing trade. Even today, around 60% of all France's fish and seafood comes ashore in Brittany. At a restaurant in la For\u00eat-Fouesnant we had an awesome selection of shellfish - mussels, oysters, crab and prawns - together with an array of knives, clamps and nutcrackers with which to eat them. In Cornouaille's main town, Quimper, I was less fortunate, ordering \"andouillettes\", which the waiter described to me as \"porc\" but I later discovered were intestines. A visit to Concarneau began with a (rain-damaged) lunch on the beach, followed by a trip to the town centre, where there's a quayside castle. You can take to the ramparts overlooking the harbour, or wander through its narrow streets packed with bars, caf\u00e9s and souvenir shops. The town itself is the kind of place we could have spent hours in, but as the afternoon drew on and the kids became a little tired of walking among the crowds, we made our exit. A short drive around the Baie de la For\u00eat takes you to Beg-Meil, renowned for its wide sweep of sandy beach, and a few splashes and sandcastles later, the children were all fully recharged. Despite attracting thousands of holidaymakers, Beg-Meil suffers from having few facilities. Like nearly all the beaches we saw, there was nowhere to get even just a drink, or a lolly for the kids. Sandy shores may be plentiful, but you may have to travel some distance to find one with a caf\u00e9 nearby. Another enjoyable trip was the cruise from Quimper to B\u00e9nodet down the Odet. Described as France's most beautiful river, the Odet weaves through thick steep-sided woodland, eventually emerging into a wide-open harbour. And B\u00e9nodet is a town worth stopping off in: its main beach is a gorgeous golden crescent, with amusements and bouncy castles for the kids, and water sports for the adults . . . and that rarity, a caf\u00e9 to flee to when the stormclouds threaten. In our week's stay, we tried to see as much of the area as possible, leaving our gte early morning and returning in time for the evening meal and kiddies' bedtime. The cottage owners had renovated the place a few months previously, creating a neat, compact and modern interior. The fully tiled bathroom had a power shower, and the newly- varnished pine floorboards throughout the upper floor were positively gleaming. Unfortunately the tic and scuttle sounds soon made us aware that we were sharing our temporary home with cockroaches, who made their way across our lounge floor after dark. At first, they seemed tolerable, a sign that we were somewhere exotic, somewhere with a tropical climate. But as the days went by, the weather showed we were far from the tropics, and their scurrying became impossible to ignore. So we decided to make good use of the insect death spray left in our utility room. Despite this minor problem with the local wildlife, Brittany is the kind of place we would happily return to. Its fantastic variety of beaches will make it a good option for at least as long as the children maintain their love of buckets and spades, which should be another few years yet.
