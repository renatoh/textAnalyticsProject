They have lost two brothers through deaths in custody, and even though both men have been the subject of a coronial inquest \u2013 one released just this week \u2013 the family still doesn\u2019t have the answers they need to heal and move on. Two brothers, both troubled and in poor health, died after being restrained face down by police and hospital guards. \u201cIt was the same house, the same hospital,\u201d their sister Sonya Coghill (Coolwell) says. \u201cWe are never going to heal. There\u2019s no justice, so there\u2019s no healing.\u201d Bradley Coolwell was 39 when he died in 2011. As a young man, he\u2019d been in and out of jail on minor property offences. In 1991, he was diagnosed with schizo-affective disorder and spent much of the next 20 years in full-time residential, involuntary mental healthcare at The Park mental health centre in Brisbane. In September 2011, police received a call from a member of the public to go to Kingston railway station \u201cdue to concerns for the welfare of a large gentleman wearing Superman pyjamas and a Superman T-shirt\u201d. \u201cHe indicated that he\u2019d been up all night. He\u2019d been battling with Superman. He also believed he was the Hulk \u2026 So we obviously made a number of assumptions as a result of that conversation,\u201d police told the coroner. They took Bradley to Logan hospital where he was transferred to a secluded ward. Nurses tried to take his Superman pyjamas away and dress him in \u201csecurity linen\u201d \u2013 hospital wear that cannot be torn by hand and cannot be used to form a ligature. This caused him great distress, the coroner has said. \u201cThe more he resisted, the greater the effort to make him comply by the security guards. There is no evidence that he tried to strike the security personnel. He struggled and resisted to the point where force was applied first in an effort to bring him down.\u201d Bradley Coolwell was left naked in a prone position for several minutes, with the \u201csecurity linen\u201d left for him to dress himself. At the inquest, the nurses disagreed on whether or not he was still breathing when they left the room. The coroner found that Bradley died from a combination of respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. The inquest took five years to hand down the findings. In 2015, in the same house, Bradley\u2019s young brother Shaun was 33 when he died in 2015 after being restrained face down by police. The coronial findings into his death were handed down on Monday \u2013 just after his birthday \u2013 ending three years of waiting to find out what happened to him. \u201cNo one even told me that the findings were being handed down,\u201d Shontay, his twin sister says. \u201cI only found out when my family saw it on TV.\u201d On the night he died, Shontay says she found Shaun in the bathroom, \u201cwiping his hands uncontrollably down his hips and ankles, like he was trying to get something out of him\u201d. She called triple-0 and told the dispatcher he was affected by methamphetamine and was hurting himself. According to coronial documents, when police arrived they found Shaun on the bathroom floor, with a bone-deep gash in his foot. They dragged him out by his legs, restrained him face down and put him in handcuffs. Within moments, he stopped struggling, the documents state. Shaun was restrained for nine minutes, the inquest found. His breathing worsened. Then it stopped, one minute after an ambulance officer administered a powerful sedative called midazolam. Police and ambulance officers resuscitated him and wheeled him out of the house on a stretcher. Shontay thought he would be OK. \u201cI had hope,\u201d she says. But hours passed and Shontay says she didn\u2019t hear anything. When the phone rang, her cousin Lindsay, who was there helping clean up, answered it. \u201cI turned around and looked at Lindsay and then she\u2019s like \u2018no, oh no\u2019, then I was thinking no, they\u2019re not gonna say that Shaun\u2019s died, this can\u2019t happen,\u201d Shontay says. \u201cWhat upsets me the most, is that the police locked me out of the house,\u201d she says. \u201cAll I wanted to do was to stand next to Shaun and say, \u201cI\u2019m here, brother, Shaun I\u2019m here\u201d, but they wouldn\u2019t even let me do that.\u201d When news spread of Shaun\u2019s death, their nephew Sean Fisher came over from Stradbroke Island. That night, in grief and frustration, he got drunk and things got a bit rowdy. The police were called for the second time in 24 hours. \u201cThe coppers came back because of the noise complaints I suppose,\u201d says Fisher. \u201cThere was a whole heap of family there.\u201d According to Shontay, a police officer told her to open the door. She says she refused \u201cbecause you\u2019ve already come here once today and killed my twin brother\u201d. Shontay says the police then threatened to kick the door down \u201cand I was thinking, oh no, I\u2019m going to die now as well,\u201d so she let them in. Fisher says he stood up when the door opened \u201cand then bang, they just shot me with a Taser\u201d. \u201cI remember being on the ground. My aunty was saying \u201che\u2019s choking, he\u2019s choking\u201d. She had to put her hand down my mouth and pull my tongue out,\u201d Fisher says. Fisher says he passed out after being shot with the stun gun. \u201cI woke up in the same hospital where my uncle\u2019s body was only a few hours before.\u201d Fisher was not charged with anything, but Shontay was fined for obstructing police. \u201cI\u2019m still trying to pay it off,\u201d she says. *** On Monday, the coroner found that Shaun had \u201cdied as a result of cardiorespiratory arrest during restraint\u201d. Since 2008, the restraint technique used on Bradley and Shaun has been implicated in the deaths of 24 people. More than half of those who died were Indigenous, affected by methamphetamines, or struggled with mental health problems. Experts are divided on whether prone restraints can lead to asphyxia and cardiac arrests. But the warning factors are now part of the training of corrections officers and medical staff in every jurisdiction in Australia. Changes to policy and procedure seem to come only after someone has died. The Coolwell family has called for someone to be held accountable for Shaun and Bradley\u2019s deaths. But the majority of prone restraint cases investigated by coroners have not been referred for prosecution because of a lack of evidence. Professor Bernadette McSherry, head of the National Seclusion and Restraint project at Melbourne University, says coroners are aware of the difficulties in establishing that a criminal act has taken place in the cases. \u201cYou have to prove beyond reasonable doubt, so the legal threshold, if you like, is quite high,\u201d she says. It\u2019s no consolation to Shontay Coolwell and her sister Sonya Coghill. Their only brothers are dead, and they still don\u2019t really know why. Sonya says Queensland needs to adopt a custody notification service \u2013 \u201cpay a lawyer to stay awake and answer when you need them\u201d she says \u2013 so that families can get immediate help in de-escalating conflict with the police and health authorities. People with mental health issues should not be in jails, she says. \u201cWe can manage this, our way. Let them do the rest of their time on country. They are healing and they\u2019re healing their country \u2013 Jagera country. \u201cWhen things go wrong, they\u2019re too windy [scared] to call the police. They\u2019ll try anything, call any other mob, rather than the police. \u2018Cause look what happens. \u201cHopefully the doors of justice will open for us somewhere. We want to change the legislation: stop taking our children, stop locking up our people with mental health issues. \u201cI know families out there who feel the same grief and frustration \u2013 there\u2019s no closure, and that impacts the whole family and community.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
