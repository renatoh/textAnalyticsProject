A report by the Institute for Public Policy Research says political and ethical considerations have been sidelined by a fixation with technological benchmarks, such as the aggressive roll-out of high-speed internet services. \"We have been trying to get this infrastructure in the ground, on our desks and in our schools and homes, but we didn't think too long and hard about why we wanted to do it,\" says William Davies, author of the report. The IPPR's \"manifesto for a digital Britain\" points to the unintended consequences of the government's campaign to bring broadband \"to all who want it\" by 2008. Quoting a recent survey, the IPPR says that over 50% of respondents cited downloading music or adult content as their motivation for signing up to broadband. Music downloading remains tainted with illegality while the act of viewing pornography speaks for itself, says the report. \"This raises questions as to whether policymakers ought to be celebrating this technology to the extent that they have done.\" Mr Davies says the government can intervene by supporting new approaches to digital rights management, which protects copyright. It could also encourage legal peer-to-peer services, whose illegal counterparts have created a generation of music pirates, he adds. The report also questions the strength of the link between broadband and education. A study by British sociologist Neil Selwyn has found that educational use of the internet is \"far lower\" than the government thinks and a lot of online learning tends to focus on IT skills. A lack of technical support for would-be users is also inhibiting take-up, says the IPPR. The report says that this, as well as a perceived lack of useful content, could explain why 40% of people in the UK rarely if ever use the internet. \"Quality, legal broadband content isn't being produced to encourage uptake of the technology.\" The thinktank cautions that in departments such as the e-government unit, whose remit includes putting all government services online by the end of the year, too much focus can be put on \" how one achieves innovation, at the expense of the question why one wants innovation\". The report also cites forecasts that e-government initiatives, intended to cut costs, will spend more taxpayers' money than they save. A cabinet office spokesperson said the government would unveil an IT strategy for delivering \"quality public services\" this autumn."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
