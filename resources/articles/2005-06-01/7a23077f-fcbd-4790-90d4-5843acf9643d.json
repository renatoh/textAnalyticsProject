Information technology, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, and research and development projects accounted for almost half of the 1,066 projects that created almost 40,000 jobs in 2004, according to the Department for Trade and Industry. Alan Johnson, the trade and industry secretary, said the figures were proof that the UK was seen as a good place to do business and that there had been no adverse effects on potential investors from the decision to stay outside the single currency. \"The UK is still viewed globally as one of the best places in the world to do business thanks to our unrivalled economic performance, emphasis on research and technology and skilled, flexible workforce,\" he said. With the prime minister calling for Europe to reallocate the money it spends subsidising farming through the Common Agricultural Policy to research and development, the DTI figures showed that R&amp;D projects were up 22% to 101 last year, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology increased 38% to 80, and there was a 61% rise in IT and software projects to 240. The US was the largest inward investor into the UK last year, accounting for 464 projects, 43% of the total, and 17,000-plus jobs. Leading developing countries are also starting to invest in the west, with India and China among 38 other nations that put money into the British economy last year. The south-east attracted most jobs, with 5,379 people hired by foreign companies. Jack Straw, the foreign secretary, said the government was \"ambitious for Britain and determined to seize opportunities in the new global economy\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
