The club\u2019s chairman was bemused, to the point where he turned to Mauricio Pochettino and asked him whether it was a new rule he had implemented. The manager smiled. It had started out as a rule but now it was simply habit. \u201cWhen I came to the club, maybe there were rules [put in place],\u201d Pochettino said. \u201cFor example, every morning, we shake hands with everybody. It was to show respect for each other; to show how you feel each morning when you meet. \u201cIt is a small thing but it means a lot to create a real team. It shows you are interested in the people with whom you shake hands. \u201cIt is may be a small thing but one that starts to grow in the group and a lot of things like this are important. They settle into the team and they show what we show as a team \u2013 that we are ready to fight for each other.\u201d To the players who encountered Levy at the training-ground canteen on the day of the anecdote, it was perfectly natural to greet him with a handshake. \u201cThe rules have become habits,\u201d Pochettino said. And if Levy was surprised \u2013 perhaps the chairman suspected a wind-up \u2013 then here was an illustration of how Pochettino has changed the culture and personality of the dressing room and, in turn, the club. Tottenham travel to West Ham United on Wednesday for the first of two crunch derbies \u2013 they have Arsenal at White Hart Lane on Saturday \u2013 on the crest of six consecutive Premier League wins, and with genuine title dreams the latest product of the spirit and momentum Pochettino has created. \u201cWe start to feel we are a real family and this is important,\u201d the manager said. \u201cIt\u2019s the first step to believe we can achieve big things.\u201d The confidence is palpable and there were flashes of boldness from Pochettino, even if he will not be drawn from his one-game-at-a-time mantra. Claudio Ranieri, the manager of the league leaders, Leicester City, had declared on Monday that Tottenham were the title favourites. Pochettino said \u201cit\u2019s good to play around like this and joke\u201d but he added: \u201cYou cannot hide our position. \u201cWe are second in the table and the dream for all professionals is to achieve these things. We have shown character and maturity, and we also have the legs to run. \u201cWe need to know that we are the youngest squad in the league, so full credit to them and the club. The potential is massive for the future. We are in the beginning of a great period for the club.\u201d Pochettino said his favourite word is \u201cbelief\u201d and the Argentinian added he had shown it to his players from the moment he took over at White Hart Lane in the summer of 2014. The rewards have come this season. It will be hostile at West Ham, against a club that have always loved to hate Tottenham, and Pochettino noted how the Upton Park pitch was in poor condition, which \u201ccan affect us more than them\u201d. His players are ready to fight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
