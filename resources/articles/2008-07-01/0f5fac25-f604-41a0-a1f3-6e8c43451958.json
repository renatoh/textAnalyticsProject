But has he been conned by clever misuse of the words welfare, punitive and justice? The government established the Youth Justice Board to develop nationally defined community programmes to reduce youth offending. These had long been provided by local authorities, the police, doctors, teachers, parents and charities. Their programmes range from advice through support, education and training, to treatment and therapy. They could be called welfare-oriented and it could have improved support for children in trouble by strengthening them and praising cooperation. So why is justice in the title? And why is the board responsible for funding the youth prisons that Travis notes have consumed most of its funds? Traditionally, they were funded by the Home Office and allocated by the courts as crime is an offence against the crown. And why does he call prison punitive when it is weak, damaging and expensive punishment for most youths? Thereby, he conceals the fact that decades of well-intentioned reforms have prevented local, responsible adults from using prompt, painful punishments as part of the discipline needed to maintain order without recourse to our slow, expensive courts. Nor are the problems caused by the absence of the death penalty mentioned despite recourse to harm reduction and the fear roused by recent youth killings. Travis notes welfare may be provided by the new children's trusts that he likens to the old local authority children's departments. But he does not worry about the youth justice service they may run or note that the old departments were incorporated into adult social work to reflect the influence families had on children's behaviour. He ends by saying the latest reforms should not be done by stealth as the public should understand them. Little chance of that while language is so confused! By the way, local authorities faced with funding the supportive but expensive children's prisons have often closed them! These are called secure accommodation as the reforms they complemented were intended to avoid children being sent to prison. George CA Talbot, Watford Proof positive Mark Johnson's astute observations on working with young people and weapons hit the nail on the firmly on head (It's time the great and the good met some really scary kids, June 25). Except about there being no evidence of what works. Channel 4's broadcast of Ballet Hoo: Ballet Changed My Life, where UK charity Youth at Risk empowered 200 \"at risk\" young people in the Midlands to change their life perspective and their life paths, is just one example of innovative and externally evaluated programmes that can make a real difference to the choices young people make. What's missing for these young people is the ability to trust and respect others and themselves. Through external evaluation we've demonstrated the impact of changing this relationship to themselves and others with communities in conflict, such as in Kosovo and Belfast, as well as with young people in disenfranchised communities across England. Far too much money and attention is given to planning, structure, process and systems. More focus is needed on adults' ability to create meaningful relationships with young people. Only out of relationship is change in behaviour possible. With the fragmentation of relationships, particularly between adult and young males, how can we expect these \"scary young people\" to respond to our questions about what they need and then trust that we will act on it? The Street Weapons Commission should look at innovative, evaluated methods of engaging young people \u2013 and the people who support them \u2013 that are relevant to the complex lifestyles of this millennium.
