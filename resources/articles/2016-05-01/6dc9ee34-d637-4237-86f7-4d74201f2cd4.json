On Friday the treasurer, Scott Morrison, blocked the sale of S Kidman &amp; Co to a majority Chinese-owned consortium because it \u201cmay be contrary to the national interest\u201d. The sale of the company\u2019s assets, which comprises 2.5% of Australia\u2019s agricultural land or 1.3% of Australia\u2019s land mass, was worth $370.7m. The Chinese-owned would-be majority owner, Dakang Australia Holdings, may respond to the decision by Tuesday, allowing a chance to revise the bid. On Monday, in an interview on Radio National, Joyce refused to be drawn on whether the government would reject a revised foreign bid for Australia\u2019s largest agricultural landholder before it goes into caretaker mode before a 2 July double-dissolution election. Joyce said the blocked sale sent the message Australia would determine investment decisions based on its national interests. In a testy interview Joyce repeated formulations of \u201cwe have the right to say the word \u2018no\u2019\u201d and framed interviewer Fran Kelly\u2019s questions about the principle behind the decision as a contradiction of that right. \u201cIt sounds like you want me to say yes,\u201d he said. When asked why the sale wasn\u2019t in Australia\u2019s national interest, Joyce said: \u201cI think it\u2019s because an incredibly large section of land, it\u2019s 2.5% of our agricultural land, [or] 1% of Australia. \u201cLet\u2019s not get carried away \u2013 we\u2019re not blocking every sale.\u201d Joyce described Australia as \u201cthe most liberal nation on earth\u201d when it came to foreign investment, because foreign buyers were not allowed to buy agricultural land in Japan, China and some US states. Joyce denied the decision would discourage foreign investment. \u201cWe have people lined up out the door, over the hill ... still wanting to buy land,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a large section of foreign investment in agricultural assets. If someone wants to buy up Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, would we let it happen?\u201d When Kelly responded \u201cOf course not\u201d, Joyce said: \u201cYou agree with me. There has to be a line in the sand, now we\u2019re arguing where that line should be drawn.\u201d Asked about a fall in foreign investment from $40bn in 2014 to $30bn last year, Joyce said in the agricultural sector it had \u201cgone through the roof\u201d so blaming the fall on rejection of agricultural land sales was \u201clooking in the wrong direction\u201d. Joyce refused to say whether the government would reject a revised bid before going into caretaker mode, saying it was a matter for the treasurer. \u201cLet\u2019s try and stick to our knitting,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m agriculture and water resources, and we\u2019re doing a splendid job in the Coalition in that area ... I\u2019m only too happy to talk about how we\u2019ve released the carp herpes virus and how we\u2019re going to rid our waterways of carp.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
