Jim Hacker arrives puffed up with the call to high office, only to have Humphrey Appleby explain how the department functioned perfectly smoothly through an election during which no one sat at the ministerial desk. \"Her Majesty does like the business of government to continue even when there are no politicians around,\" he explains. \"A bit difficult, surely?\" replies an incredulous Jim, before Humphrey answers, at once fawning and arch: \"Yes \u2013 and no.\" And oh, shouldn't Sir Humphrey be alive at this sweet hour? For several glorious days, no one knew which politicians were on top, leaving Whitehall's professionals with the whip hand. Suddenly, officials could tell Labour ministers \u2013 who briefly existed in a frozen reality, midway through defenestration \u2013 what they could and couldn't do. Better still, the civil service got to hold the ring in the cross-party talks which formed the new government. Sir Humphrey would have relished playing the blue and yellow tribes against one another, to ensure neither could achieve anything not to his liking. By happy coincidence, the series' authors, Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn, have chosen this week to revive the mandarin's mandarin. Yesterday Sir Humphrey and Jim began walking the boards at the Chichester festival, in a new play set in the era of BlackBerrys and spin. Some things have changed, but the man from Whitehall still believes he knows best \u2013 and this week he enjoyed more power than ever."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
