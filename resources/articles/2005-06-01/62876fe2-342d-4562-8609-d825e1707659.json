The grandiose mansions that line the white sand beach are where New York's high rollers escape for the summer, from international financier George Soros to the heirs to the Hilton hotel chain and the descendants of the Ford car family. Fashion designer Calvin Klein's $27m summer pad even comes with its own shark pool over which a previous owner dangled his daughter as a party trick. A mile or so inland, the world's best golfers can regularly be seen wandering the fairways of Shinnecock Hills, viewed as America's premier golf course and the venue for last year's US Open championship. But now the residents of Southampton find themselves at the centre of a multibillion dollar law suit filed by some of America's poorest citizens as the Shinnecock Native Americans fired an opening salvo in their battle to reclaim 3,600 acres of ancestral lands around the exclusive Long Island town. To the beat of animal skin drums, the shake of rattles and the chant of an \"honour song\", their leader, Randy King, entered a federal court to file - financially at least - the largest Native American land claim in history over the oldest English settlement in New York State. In the 19th century the area attracted the original \"robber baron\" industrialists, including the Rockefeller family, spawning the modern-day Hampton vacationing mania. \"This day has been decades in the making. We only seek what is ours,\" Mr King, chairman of the tribe's board of trustees, said later in a statement. \"This land claim will enable us to have what our vacationing neighbours take for granted - steady jobs, better education for our children and access to quality healthcare.\" Many of the area's residents view the lawsuit as a lever in the attempts of the Shinnecock to build a casino on their 800-acre reservation on Shinnecock Bay. The area's exclusive residents have fiercely resisted the proposal, fearing it will lower the tone of the area, where even hotels are frowned upon. The tribe planned to build the casino in 2003, but New York State and Southampton town blocked the development. Gateway Funding Associates, a company backed by casino investors, signed an agreement with the tribe more than a year ago to pay for the legal action and other \"economic developments\", in exchange for part of any future proceeds, Tom Shields, a spokesman for Gateway told the New York newspaper Newsday. Billions demanded This week's lawsuit demands billions of dollars in compensation. The tribe said that if its claims were accepted, individual landowners would not lose title to their property. But the state would be asked to compensate the tribe for the value of the total property in that area, which the lawsuit said was assessed last year at $1.7bn (\u00a3923m). The tribe is also demanding 150 years of back rent and interest on the land, although no specific amount was cited. As well as Shinnecock Hills, the tribe is claiming ownership of the elite National Golf Links and the sprawling campus of Long Island University's Southampton College. About 500 members of the tribe live on the reservation to the east of Southampton town, but the Native Americans have long held that the whole area was wrongfully taken from them in 1859, when a group of private investors, claiming to have a petition signed by 21 Shinnecocks, got the state legislature to approve the exchange of the tribe's land for the 800-acre tract they currently inhabit. The lawsuit claims half of the 21 names on the petition were marked only with an X, some were repeated, while others belonged to minors or dead people. \"We'll have to review the lawsuit, but we will take whatever steps may be necessary to protect the interests of property owners and taxpayers on Long Island,\" said a spokesman for the New York State governor, George Pataki. Congressman Timothy Bishop, whose district covers eastern Long Island, said the lawsuit was \"alarming and unacceptable\". Most legal observers believe the land claim has little chance of succeeding. While the Shinnecock are recognized as a tribe by the state they have not received federal recognition, and this is likely to damage their claim. But despite claims by the tribe that it will not target private landowners, the lawsuit will cause headaches for the millionaires living behind the manicured hedges of their exclusive residences. The residents of Southampton traditionally view themselves as being a cut above the glitzier Hollywood set, including Steven Spielberg, who decamps to nearby East Hampton for the summer. Instead Southampton is a haven for the WASP bankers and hedge fund managers from New York's Upper East Side, all of whom guard their privacy jealously. They will be furious at the unwanted attention the lawsuit is thrusting upon the area, home to Alfred Taubman, the former boss of Sotheby's, and Barthold von Ribbentrop, the son of Hitler's former foreign minister, who was hanged at Nuremberg. Howard Stern, the radio shock-jock, recently paid $20m for four acres of oceanfront land off Wickapogue road. But many are concerned about the potentially disastrous effect the legal action will have on the property market. This is no laughing matter when the price of a property can range from $8m to $60m. \"I think the initial reaction is going to be, 'Wow, I'm not going to buy that with a lawsuit hanging over my head',\" Paul Brennan, an agent for Prudential Douglas Elliman Real Estate, told Newsday. \"It's potentially alarming. It puts a crimp in everybody's ability to move real estate or business cleanly ... I don't know what the legal ramifications are going to be.\" For now at least the Shinnecock Indians appear to be holding the best cards. Legal victories in land war 1970 48,000 acres of land are returned to the Taos Pueblo in New Mexico, after President Nixon signs the Taos land bill, the first time US legislation is used to hand back sizeable tracks of federal land to Native Americans 1980 The supreme court awards $105m in compensation to the Sioux tribe in relation to a dispute over ownership of the Black Hills in West Dakota. The Sioux had been guaranteed ownership in an 1868 treaty. But after gold was discovered, Congress annulled the pact, and an estimated $4bn of natural resources were mined from the land while it was out of Sioux hands 1985 900 acres of land in Rhode Island are returned to the Narragansett tribe after a 10-year legal fight. The estate was sequestered to make way for European settlement in the 1880s. The subsequent abolition of tribal authority in the area initially meant Native Americans were offered two acres as compensation 2001 7,600 acres in California, including 314 acres in the Death Valley national park, are handed over to the Timbisha Shoshone Indians. The decision gave Native Americans land within an established national park for the first time 2005 Land rights around Fort Apache in Arizona are awarded to the White Mountain Apache tribe by the supreme court, together with $7m in compensation Jason Rodrigues"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
