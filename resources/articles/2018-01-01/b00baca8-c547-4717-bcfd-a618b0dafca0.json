Meanwhile Rob Cross, a Sussex pub player the last time Taylor won this title and a virtual unknown even a year ago, is the new leader of the darting world. That he took the crown in such ruthless, relentless fashion only adds to the seismic nature of the night. The Power is out, and Rob \u2018Voltage\u2019 Cross is king. That\u2019s all from me; thanks for reading and emailing. Goodnight. A final word from Rob Cross. \u201cIt was a dream to play Phil in the final. You won\u2019t see another sportsman like him.\u201d Or will we? Phil Taylor speaks, barely audible over the crowd: \u201cRob was relentless, like I was 25 years ago. He\u2019s a lot like myself, he\u2019s dedicated. The players have got a big problem now. It\u2019s not about the money for him, it\u2019s about the winning, he\u2019s like me in that way.\u201d \u201cThe way he started, I thought I would lose 7-0. I tried to push him, make him think, but it didn\u2019t happen. It was an old man and a young man, and it was a mismatch really.\u201d Rob Cross speaks: \u201cI\u2019ve won my first world title, but tonight is all about Phil Taylor. Everything he\u2019s done for the game, I hope he enjoys his retirement.\u201d Taylor has written \u2018Thank you. Thank you. Loved it\u2019 on a piece of paper. What an odd moment this is. Phil Taylor receives his runner-up prize and is given a long, hearty send-off by the crowd. Now it\u2019s Rob Cross\u2019s moment, as he receives the trophy. He lets Taylor lift it up too, which is a very nice gesture. I don\u2019t think Van Gerwen would have done that. A strange moment after Cross sealed this most incredible victory, as the debutant made sure to let the departing Taylor have his moment. We\u2019ll hear from both players shortly. Treble 18. Hit. A second treble 18. Hit. Double 16 for the title. He\u2019s taken it. Phil Taylor has been thrashed. Absolutely incredible. Rob Cross is throwing for the title \u2013 but his first throw is poor, and Taylor rattles in a maximum! He\u2019s not done yet, but Cross rallies brilliantly with three, count \u2018em, treble 18s. He\u2019s on a 140 finish, Taylor waiting on 50... Ninth set: Cross 2-0 Taylor (Cross leads 6-2 in sets) Taylor\u2019s attempted mind games have only distracted himself \u2013 he quickly falls behind on his own throw, and Cross is closing in. He misses two darts at double 16, but Taylor is adrift on 204 \u2013 but a 180 puts the pressure on. Big moment now \u2013 and he takes it on his first dart. I think that\u2019s game over. Ninth set: Cross 1-0 Taylor (Cross leads 6-2 in sets and throws first) Is it time for the former electrician to put The Power out? He starts strong with 134, but Taylor sticks with him. Cross has 135 to finish, and after hitting treble five, tidies up to leave tops. Taylor loses ground, and Cross takes it in one. Taylor may have wound Rob Cross up with the latest bout of chat; he looked a little miffed as he headed off the stage. He\u2019ll now have a chance on his own throw; if he doesn\u2019t take it, things might get interesting. Taylor is serenaded by the crowd after that break \u2013 can he close out the set? Cross is first to a finish and Taylor\u2019s inconsistency is hurting him again. Cross is a long way off bullseye, and Taylor is chatting to him again. Cross has three darts at 30, splits and misses double six. Taylor takes out double 16, and wins the set. Eighth set: Cross 0-2 Taylor (Cross leads 6-1 in sets) Is Cross starting to see the finish line? A Taylor maximum puts him under pressure on his own throw, but Cross digs himself out with a 140. Taylor will have a shot at 63 \u2013 and takes double 16 with his last dart! Eighth set: Cross 0-1 Taylor (Cross leads 6-1 in sets, Taylor throws first) This is the Brazil 1-7 Germany of darts. If Germany had never qualified before. Taylor has 141 to hold throw but can\u2019t take it \u2013 and Cross misses double four! Taylor holds, but it\u2019s a long way back. \u201cEvening Niall, and Happy New Year to you, says Simon McMahon. \u201cGreat to see the Guardian giving the darts its rightful place with a LBL on New Years Day. Feels like a changing of the guard tonight. Cross is like a young Phil Taylor. As the legendary Sid Waddell once said of the equally legendary Jocky Wilson \u2013 what an athlete.\u201d Speaking of Wilson, I recently watched a Bullseye where he took on the Bronze Bully challenge with a lit snout on the go. They don\u2019t make them like Jocky any more. Savage darts is right. Phil Taylor\u2019s reputation alone has taken care of many of his opponents, and an entire generation of darts talent was suffocated by the Power at his best. Rob Cross, who was watching the tournament at home last year, has come here for Taylor\u2019s final match, and is wiping the floor with him. A chance for Cross to twist the knife, as he hits 140 on Taylor\u2019s throw. The Power is starting to look defeated but takes out 180 to leave 161. He misses bull \u2013 it\u2019s not exactly bad, is it? \u2013 but Cross is lurking on 93. He takes it. In two darts. Is he human? Seventh set: Cross 2-1 Taylor (Cross leads 5-1 in sets) A scrappy start to this leg, but Cross\u2019 66th maximum of the tournament (he\u2019s five off the all-time record) edges him ahead. Taylor carelessly leaves 169, allowing Cross to set up double 16. This time he misses the first dart, but not the second. Nerveless. Seventh set: Cross 1-1 Taylor (Cross leads 5-1 in sets) Taylor races away on his own throw and has some breathing space to take out double top. He gets it, and gives the crowd an intentionally over-the-top celebration. Just a bit of fun? No chance. Seventh set: Cross 1-0 Taylor (Cross leads 5-1 in sets and throws first) Cross could go to the next break in play just one set away. He cleans up this opening leg with embarrassing ease. What is going on here? Big test for Cross here \u2013 it\u2019ll either be 5-1, or Taylor will have a chance to make it 4-2. Taylor can\u2019t put pressure on, loose darts costing him, and Cross has six darts from 179. He gets down to 84, and Taylor leaves 58. Pressure? What pressure? Cross takes it with two darts. He\u2019s hit 70% of his doubles, and it feels like more. Sixth set: Cross 2-1 Taylor (Cross leads 4-1 in sets) A very tidy 123 checkout from Taylor, with Cross easing off the gas momentarily. The newcomer will throw for a 5-1 lead, though. Sixth set: Cross 2-0 Taylor (Cross leads 4-1 in sets) If he can keep this up, this will be a performance for the record books from Cross \u2013 another maximum and Taylor, averaging 102, cannot get near him. Cross takes out tops, and Taylor\u2019s 110 benchmark from 2009 is within reach. Sixth set: Cross 1-0 Taylor (Cross leads 4-1 in sets, Taylor to throw first) This is a big old set \u2013 if Cross can claim it, he\u2019d be two from home, and on his own throw. Another 180 puts him ahead \u2013 he\u2019s averaging 109+ now \u2013 and checks out in 11 darts. Easy! After that missed shot at a nine-darter, Cross offered Taylor some consoling words. Taylor appeared to use the moment to try and psyche his opponent out again. It\u2019s all a little unseemly on his big night. Cross has a shot at bull for the set, but hits 25 \u2013 and Taylor has to take out 153. Treble 20, treble 19... but double 18 is missed, and Cross moves three sets clear. Fifth set: Cross 2-0 Taylor (Cross leads 3-1 in sets) That moment would have swung the momentum entirely in Taylor\u2019s favour \u2013 a nine-darter in his last match! \u2013 but the way Cross bounced back was telling. He\u2019s just as ruthless here, nailing a double 16 to break Taylor again! Fifth set: Cross 1-0 Taylor (Cross leads 3-1 in sets and throws first) Destiny was calling there, as Taylor struck eight perfect darts in a row. He\u2019s never hit a nine-darter at the Ally Pally... and misses double 12 by a hair\u2019s breadth. He has three darts to check out, but is all over the place - and Cross punishes him! What a big moment that might be... \u201cThese high checkouts are fabulous from Cross,\u201d says Adam Hirst. \u201cBig numbers hit so cleanly every time, never looks in doubt. Like watching Harry Kane go through one-on-one. 20s, 19s, 18s, lovely stuff.\u201d It was notable in the semi-finals how many times Cross rescued a poor start with a treble on his final dart. It kept him in the game at crucial moments. Rod Studd has been bringing up the parallels with Taylor\u2019s first world title, when he thrashed his mentor, Eric Bristow in 1990. \u201cBlond streaks and moustaches were in fashion back then,\u201d Studd adds. He\u2019s clearly not been to Dalston lately. Fourth set: Cross 0-3 Taylor That break was another boost for Taylor, but this set started on his throw, so Cross need not worry unduly. Taylor takes out 80 in two darts to cut the gap. Fourth set: Cross 0-2 Taylor (Cross leads 3-0 in sets) That big checkout has put a spring back in Taylor\u2019s step, and he edges ahead on Cross\u2019s throw. The challenger is half an inch away from taking out 102, but leaves a chance for Taylor \u2013 and he breaks! Fourth set: Cross 0-1 Taylor (Cross leads 3-0 in sets, Taylor throws first) Taylor is in danger of losing his throw again as Cross races to leave double 14. He has to take out 151 the way Cross is finishing \u2013 and does! The crowd erupts. Maybe Taylor isn\u2019t finished after all... Third set: Cross 3-0 Taylor Taylor digs out a chance on Cross\u2019s throw, but makes a meal of it from 150, and Cross takes out 153! Oh my word \u2013 he is trouncing Phil Taylor here. Third set: Cross 2-0 Taylor (Cross leads 2-0 in sets) Taylor\u2019s decision to put Cross in first hasn\u2019t worked; he looks the more nervous of the two, and Cross bangs in another maximum on Taylor\u2019s throw. Four more treble 20s and he\u2019s pulling away \u2013 on 52 with Taylor on 233. He takes it out in two darts. Taylor tries to give Cross the eyes afterwards, and is sensibly ignored. Third set: Cross 1-0 Taylor (Cross leads 2-0 in sets and throws first) The debutant has dominated the first two sets, and has a chance to go 3-0 up here. He\u2019s averaging 107-plus, with Taylor a shade under a ton. Double 18, first dart, no problem. Oof! Where\u2019s the love, guys? The Deller option is looking the more likely scenario in these early stages. Long way to go though... Second set: Cross 3-1 Taylor Cross starts with a 60 but recovers well with Taylor below his best. A 140 puts him on a 167 finish, but Taylor applies the pressure with a maximum. Never mind \u2013 Cross takes out the 167! If he keeps this up, even The Power won\u2019t be able to stop him. 2nd set: Cross 2-1 Taylor (Cross leads 1-0 in sets) Taylor could use a straightforward hold to stop Cross\u2019s momentum, and a 180 sets him on his way. He leaves tops with Cross not on a finish. Job done, but Cross will throw for a two-set lead. 2nd set: Cross 2-0 Taylor (Cross leads 1-0 in sets) Cross gets back to business on his own throw, not letting Taylor get a sniff at a double as he finishes on double two with the last dart in hand. What a start! That awkward moment involved Cross knocking something off the table accidentally, and the crowd\u2019s cheers disrupting Taylor\u2019s rhythm. He apologised and Taylor seemed fine about it, but Taylor is sometimes, y\u2019know, not fine about things like that. 2nd set: Cross 1-0 Taylor (Cross leads 1-0 in sets, Taylor throws first) Mixed start for Taylor, who starts with a 177 and follows it up with a 67. Cross hits a maximum to pile pressure on Taylor, who\u2019s on 132. A curious moment distracts Taylor and Cross, who misses two shots at double 16. Taylor can\u2019t punish him, and Cross doesn\u2019t miss again. \u201cOne thing\u2019s for sure, if Phil Taylor wins, no matter who he name-drops in his victory speech, it won\u2019t be as excruciating as this one\u201d says Adam Hirst. 1st set: Cross 3-1 Taylor It\u2019s Taylor\u2019s turn to start a leg with a maximum, and he\u2019s millimetres away from taking out 147. Cross is a long way back, but puts pressure on with his next throw and Taylor makes a hash of double 18. Cross has a shot at double 16 for the set... and takes it! 1st set: Cross 2-1 Taylor Two 180s in this leg for Cross \u2013 he\u2019s on 57 for the tournament \u2013 and double 10 seals a 12-dart leg. Composed start. 1st set: Cross 1-1 Taylor The Power edges ahead to give himself six darts from 186, and after Cross sees two straight darts bounce out, he nails double 16. One 14-dart leg apiece. 1st set: Cross 1-0 Taylor (Cross throws first) The crowd absolutely bellow their appreciation to Phil Taylor. Walking in a Taylor wonderland, indeed. Cross just has to focus on his game, and a ton-140 start does the job. He\u2019s down to a finish in nine darts, and takes out double 18 with Taylor nowhere near. Here we go, then. The legend against the debutant, Voltage v The Power, and the atmosphere is electric... One more time, with feeling... Ladies and gentlemen... Here we go, then. John McDonald introduces Rob Cross first, whose walk-on music is, er, \u2018Hot Hot Hot\u2019. Surely it should be this: Walk-ons coming any minute now, so here\u2019s 90 seconds of Wayne Mardle, unaware he\u2019s on live TV: Taylor has won the pre-match bull, but given the first throw to his opponent. Classic mind games from the Power. The build-up has been all about Taylor, and fair enough really, but what of Rob Cross? He was born in 1990, six months after Taylor\u2019s first world title, and in darting terms, that was about it until last year, when a run of impressive results earned him his first PDC Tour card. He earned his first \u00a3250 as a pro in February, then picked up two Players\u2019 Championship titles and reached the European Championship final in October, losing 11-7 to Van Gerwen. Suddenly, he has become one of the sport\u2019s rising stars, but this fortnight, he\u2019s taken things to another level. Your first prediction is in: Predictions? The bookies have it almost too close to call, with Taylor the narrow favourite. I\u2019m not prepared to bet against Taylor, tonight of all nights. Taylor 7-5 Cross. The Power There are plenty out there who think the emerging Rob Cross, rather than Van Gerwen, will take up Taylor\u2019s mantle as the world\u2019s pre-eminent player. Winning the world championship at his first attempt would be a start \u2013 Taylor did just that in 1990. He won the BDO title again in 1992, before joining the breakaway PDC in 1994. He lost the first PDC final to Dennis Priestley, but made up for it soon enough. Taylor has won the PDC world title 14 times: in (deep breath) 1995, 96, 97, 98, 99, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2009, 2010 and 2013. He\u2019s also picked up the World Matchplay title 16 (SIXTEEN) times, the World Grand Prix 11 times, and the Premier League six times. There\u2019s an argument that over the last 25 years, he has dominated his particular sport like nobody else on the planet. If you\u2019re a newcomer to the wonderful world of darts, here are a couple of excellent pieces to get you in the zone. Andy Bull on a night at the Ally Pally, and Rob Smyth on the Power\u2019s last stand: While we\u2019re waiting, here\u2019s a nice read from Steven Pye, Sports Network member and 80s sports doyen, on the history of the world championships in that halcyon decade. In those pre-PDC days, the BDO title was the one to win, just ahead of Bullseye\u2019s coveted Bronze Bully. Taylor began against up-and-comer Chris Dobey, winning three sets to one, and then took care of pantomime villain Justin Pipe and another pretender in Keegan Brown, winning both matches without dropping a set. Gary Anderson, who beat Taylor in his last final appearance, was next but was beaten 5-3. That left Jamie Lewis waiting in the semi-finals, and while the qualifier almost matched Taylor\u2019s average, the veteran took him to finishing school, winning 6-1. Cross began the tournament as a dark horse despite his inexperience, and after an easy win over Seigo Asada he won an almighty scrap with Michael Smith by the odd set in seven. The No20 seed saw off John Henderson and held off a comeback from world youth champion Dimitri van den Bergh in the quarters. Then came that instant classic against Michael van Gerwen, won in a sudden-death leg after midnight. Cross has won three matches in the final set, and each time with a lower average than his opponent. When Phil Taylor announced early in 2017 that this world championship would be his last, many ventured that fate would lead him to his 17th world title. What nobody expected was that his final opponent would be a man who was yet to win a penny as a professional. Taylor\u2019s curtain call has loomed throughout a thrilling tournament, with the 57-year-old only really tested by Gary Anderson in a serene run to the final. After learning to share the spotlight as his darting dominance waned, he has the chance to take centre stage one more time. Taylor will have expected, perhaps hoped, to bow out against Michael van Gerwen, the new dominant force in darts and a man he has clashed with on and off the oche. Instead, Van Gerwen was beaten in an extraordinary semi-final by Rob Cross, whose already remarkable debut season has taken another leap forward here. If a 16-time winner against a rookie sounds like a recipe for a mismatch, think again \u2013 Cross, 30 years Taylor\u2019s junior, matched Van Gerwen blow for blow across 11 legs and held his nerve when his opponent couldn\u2019t. This is one of those all-too-rare occasions where a thoroughbred and an underdog meet on equal footing. Taylor is seven sets away from going out at the very top, and it\u2019s down to a former electrician to shut down The Power. Whoever wins, it\u2019s going to be quite the story.
