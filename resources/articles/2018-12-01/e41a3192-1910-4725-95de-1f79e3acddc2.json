In the 92nd minute too. The difference between pain and progress. Trent Alexander-Arnold 7 Rested on Saturday with good reason. Tireless in support of Salah and recovered well when Napoli got in behind. Jo\u00ebl Matip 7 Alert and sharp in the tackle. Intelligent passing helped frustrate and isolate Napoli\u2019s forwards. Virgil van Dijk 8 Covered superbly when mistakes were made around him but lucky to avoid red for his tackle on Mertens. Andy Robertson 8 Imposed himself on the big occasion again. Lost Callej\u00f3n only once, though it was almost costly, and offered a potent outlet. Georginio Wijnaldum 9 (star player) A dynamic link between midfield and attack, the kind lacking in Paris, and gave Hamsik no respite. Best display of the season. Jordan Henderson 7 Protected his central defenders with his distribution and presence. Rarely given licence to venture forward. James Milner 8 Early mistake led to Hamsik\u2019s chance but disrupted Napoli\u2019s rhythm during a dogged battle with Allan. Mohamed Salah 8 The end product was lacking and then, like all star talents, conjured a piece of magic that made all the difference. Roberto Firmino 6 Work rate can not be faulted but his final touch and link-up play remains awry. Withdrawn late on. Sadio Man\u00e9 6 Posed problems with his pace but struggled to make an impact and finishing was dreadful. Substitutes Naby Ke\u00efta for Firmino (79) 6, Fabinho for Milner (85) n/a, Dejan Lovren for Alexander-Arnold (90) n/a Napoli David Ospina 6/10 Excellent second-half display could not compensate for a costly vanishing act for Salah\u2019s opener. Nikola Maksimovic 7 The centre-half\u2019s height was again valuable at right-back, as in the first game, but not a threat going forward. Ra\u00fal Albiol 6 Dominant in the air and alert to Firmino\u2019s flicks, although pulled apart at times in the second half. Kalidou Koulibaly 7 (star player) Strength and awareness sets him apart as a class act but beaten too easily by Salah for the breakthrough. M\u00e1rio Rui 5 Rolled too easily by Salah for the opener and toiled against the added threat of Alexander-Arnold. Jos\u00e9 Callej\u00f3n 6 Managed to escape Robertson at times with his bright movement but missed a glorious chance to equalise. Allan 7 A solid, combative presence in central midfield. Distribution not always on his team-mates\u2019 wavelength. Marek Hamsik 6 Fired a good early chance over the bar and wasteful in possession. Unable to impose himself. Fabi\u00e1n Ruiz 6 Neat and tidy until he got into the final third where his finishing and his delivery was found wanting. Lorenzo Insigne 6 Teed up Callej\u00f3n with a glorious pass yet was anonymous for the majority of the match. Dries Mertens 6 A bright start faded, or was extinguished, after Van Dijk caught his ankle badly. Had to be replaced. Napoli substitutes Piotr Zielinski for Ruiz (62) 6, Arkadiusz Milik for Mertens (67) 5, Faouzi Ghoulam for Rui (70) 6"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
