After repeated clashes over potential handouts of shares to Ashley, who controls 58% of Sports Direct, fund management firms are considering voting against the proposal to allocate shares worth \u00a3200m to Ashley and an undisclosed number of employees. The vote is scheduled to take place on 2 July and is the fourth attempt by the company to pay its founder, who also owns Newcastle United football club, a share-based bonus. The Association of British Insurers (ABI), whose members control a fifth of the stock market, has issued its most serious warning \u2013 a \"red top\" \u2013 to alert shareholders to serious issues about corporate governance at the firm, which now has 600 sports stores in Europe. The National Association of British Insurers, which represents pension funds holding \u00a3900bn of investments, is calling for the vote on the bonus deal to be withdrawn. The ABI has been facilitating discussions for investors holding about 18% of the shares in Sports Direct not owned by Ashley. The shareholders have also met with chairman Keith Hellawell, the former policeman and one-time government \"drugs tsar\". Investors are thought to have been stunned by the latest proposal as it was announced shortly after they met Hellawell following the hiatus in April when a previous bonus scheme for Ashley, who is executive deputy chairman, had to be withdrawn. Investors regarded that as the third attempt to pay Ashley in shares after the first attempt failed to win the backing of investors in September 2012 and a failed second consultation, which was held a year later. The latest proposed deal for Ashley differs to those in the past because it has been linked into payouts for staff at Sports Direct, as the award of 25m shares is being made to the company's share scheme. But shareholders believe it is not clear how many of the 25m shares could be allotted to Ashley nor how many staff could be part of the arrangement. The company has about 3,000 full-time staff and an estimated 20,000 more on zero-hours contracts. Since a previous bonus scheme was withdrawn in April, annual profits targets have been added to the share awards and the timescale of the payouts lengthened from two years to four. The company declined to comment but Hellawell said when the deal was announced in April that the company had responded to shareholder feedback. \"Based on the stretching performance targets established, this scheme has the potential to create a further substantial increase in shareholder value,\" Hellawell said. Ashley does not take a salary from the business that he founded in 1982 with a single shop. Will Pomroy of the National Association of Pension Funds said members were backing the attempts by the ABI to facilitate discussions with Sports Direct. \"It remains unclear to our members why the board considers that this latest proposal is sufficiently more appropriate and, in the interests of minority shareholders, more appropriate than those proposed and withdrawn previously. As such, our members hope that the company withdraws this resolution,\" said Pomroy. Sports Direct was floated at 300p in February 2007 and immediately started to face questions from City investors about its attitude towards them. After the shares fell below the float price, Ashley said \"some of these City people act like a bunch of cry babies\". But after a shaky start on the stock market, the shares are now trading at 760p. In the past, Odey Asset Management, Sports Direct's biggest institutional investor, has backed the share awards for Ashley. But Pomroy said: \"Our members are concerned about the significant lack of detail being provided about the arrangements of this scheme and the absence of substantive consultation with shareholders is particularly frustrating. As a public company, it is imperative that the whole board begins to recognise the obligations it has and, in turn, endeavours to better engage with and listen to its investors.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
