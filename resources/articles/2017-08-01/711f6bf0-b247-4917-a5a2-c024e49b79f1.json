Tautrydas Narbutas, 24, denied murdering Albertina Choules, whose charred body was found in her garden in Buckinghamshire after she had been hit about the head and set alight. The 24-year-old Lithuanian instead entered a plea of guilty to the lesser charge of manslaughter, which was accepted by the prosecution after it was deemed he suffers from a psychotic disorder. Italian-born Choules, known as Tina, was killed at her isolated home on 6 July last year after calling the emergency services to report an intruder at her property. At the opening of her inquest in July last year, a coroner learned how the 999 call handler had heard the voice of a man in the background before the call with Choules was abruptly ended. When armed police arrived at the home they found a man standing near a fire and what transpired to be the remains of the pensioner. After a psychiatrist instructed by the Crown Prosecution Service agreed with the assessment of Narbutas made by a medical expert hired by the defence, it was decided his responsibility for the crime was \u201cseverely diminished\u201d. Narbutas, of High Wycombe, entered his plea at Reading crown court on Wednesday via videolink from Woodhill Prison where he is on remand, while an interpreter translated proceedings. He also admitted affray after his \u201cabnormal\u201d behaviour at the scene of the crime against two Thames Valley police officers who responded to the 999 call \u2013 but two charges of attempted grievous bodily harm were dropped. Prosecutor Alan Blake told Reading crown court: \u201cWe\u2019ve carefully reviewed all the evidence and in particular the medical evidence. The mental abnormality is identified as arising from a psychotic disorder. With that consensus among medical experts and the evidence of abnormal behaviour at the scene when the defendant was arrested, we do not consider there is a realistic prospect the jury would reject the medical evidence.\u201d He concluded: \u201cAccordingly, we consider it proper to accept the plea that has been offered.\u201d The widow of a company director, Choules lived in a woodland property with immaculate gardens in Marlow where she resided without electricity and spent her time caring for the local wildlife. Her estate was open for villagers to visit as part of a Buddhist trail she created with her husband, Michael, a fellow Buddhist convert who died of cancer in 2004. Following her death her family issued a statement describing her as \u201ccompletely selfless\u201d. They said: \u201cTina was incredibly special, as was her simple, self-sufficient way of life with no electricity, television or washing machine. She never liked to sit still and worked tirelessly to maintain her beautiful garden and produce all year round.\u201d The prosecution team met with Choules\u2019s family before agreeing to accept the plea. Narbutas was remanded in custody after Wednesday\u2019s hearing while more medical evidence was gathered for his sentencing on 3 October."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
