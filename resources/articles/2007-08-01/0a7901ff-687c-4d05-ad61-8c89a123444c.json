Or \"spoon it\", as I used to call it, before the trombonist next to me taught me a new expression. It means play a loud, confident note in completely the wrong place. But whether I do or not will have to wait, because the more important question right now is: how on earth did I end up playing in a Prom in the first place? The concert, which formed part of Brass Day last Saturday, was a milestone in the growing number of projects designed to open the doors of the Proms to student players and members of the public. Anyone with \"grade eight or equivalent\" could apply. The most ambitious piece of the evening Prom was Peter Wiegold's He Is Armoured Without, which the composer describes as, \"a study of the sounds of war - the stupidity, the lust and the melancholy of war\". Here is a Prom that fully satisfies Einstein's belief that \"if at first the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it\". This premiere certainly involved quite a cast: the strings and percussion from the BBC Philharmonic, a group of karnay, doira and nog'ora players from Uzbekistan, the fanfare trumpets of the Queen's Coldstream Guards, trumpet and trombone soloists, and around 100 additional brass players (including students from the Royal Northern College and Birmingham Conservatoire) dotted around the balconies, the audience and the stage. Most of it is scored, but parts of it are improvised. Rewind further, to the first full rehearsal of the Wiegold piece a week before the gig. If there's one sound that binds the piece, it is that of the Uzbek karnay, a huge, ancient, rasping ceremonial trumpet. \"Nick Kenyon had seen a piece I did with the Uzbeks and the London Sinfonietta,\" says Wiegold of the Proms director. \"He had always wanted to put something like it in the Proms. The sound takes you somewhere you haven't been. It's outside our nervous system.\" Getting outside our nervous system is a fair way of describing what Wiegold encourages in musicians. To warm up his troops - the \"terracotta army\", as staging director Graeme Miller calls us - Wiegold gets everyone improvising, imitating the music of the karnay as part of a call and response. The Uzbek trumpeters don't play with the same tuning or tone as classical brass players. Like many effects in the piece, the sound falls outside what is easily notated. So in the trombone part you sometimes find instructions such as \"banshee\", \"chattering\" and \"spitting fire\". At one point, a player queries what note he is supposed to be playing. \"I don't know,\" replies the composer, flicking through his score. \"Find a convenient one.\" \"A lot of it is about permission,\" says Wiegold. \"If you want to play a screaming note, play a screaming note; if you want to play a straight note, play a straight one. There are two things I always say about working like this. One is always invoke, don't describe. You've got to get the feel of it, not, 'Give me F sharps followed by A.' The other is to remember there are three things you can say to a player: do this, do something like this, do what you like. The middle one is really interesting. That's where you say something like, 'Do high bubbly trills.'\" On the shop floor, the attitude is less philosophical. \"I don't think he really knows what's going on,\" mumbles one player. \"That bit sounds like somebody dying in hospital.\" \"I think he means whacking the bell or something,\" says another. \"Can you repeat that for the slow ones?\" Not knowing what constitutes the right thing to play is aggravating a few musicians. Their feeling seems to be: \"Well, if you don't care neither do I.\" But it's also clear that lots of players are thrilled by this freedom. \"I'm sure there is some moaning, there always is,\" says Wiegold, currently head of music research at Brunel university. \"But at the same time, they are really sorting it out, dealing with the problems. The optimum number for this kind of work is 15 if you want everyone to be creatively engaged - I can't have 80 solos.\" If the process feels uncomfortable, or at times irrelevant, to the student who aspires to play in an orchestra, Wiegold is quick to point out that \"this is actually the way most people make music. To me, it is what folk or jazz musicians do: strong centre with elaboration around it. It's like the Dal\u00ed image of the melting clock. The clock is the Coldstream Guards, and then in the middle of it I get one of them to wail like John Coltrane, which he does amazingly - that's the image of the piece.\" On the night, backstage at the Albert Hall is like a bazaar. A string player from the BBC Phil, attempting to get to his violin case, looks as if he's crossing the M1, bemused at the number of people spilling from the dressing rooms. The Uzbeks bring out their embroidered robes and hats. Organisers buzz around dealing with last-minute logistical niggles. It's a live broadcast, so there isn't an inch to give. This is one clock that can't melt. Through the din of players warming up, Dil'murid Mirzaev, one of the Uzbeks, attempts to explain how they clean their instruments with yoghurt, and how they were originally used to scare elephants into battle. Then we're on. There isn't the usual concert silence as Wiegold lifts his hands at the podium, because the trombones are told to begin playing under the applause, very quietly, like a swarm of bees. The Prommers laugh as the two soloists, who have a kind of boxing ring in the middle of the hall, help each other unpack their instruments. Battle commences. It's a buzz to hear the whole building being used, and the theatre of it keeps the audience busy too, swinging their heads to locate some hidden player in the rafters. The trumpet solo is meant to be a Prospero figure, but that's what Wiegold looks like, stirring up forces, having to conduct people behind and above him with special hand signals. He could be at the races. During the free-for-all climax, his terracotta army nearly runs away from him, karnays strafing in the air like tank turrets. How loud can this get? The applause shows no sign of dying down after three or four curtain calls. Many of the players who grumbled during the process are smiling at the audience's - and their own - reaction to the finished product. Trombone soloist David Purser isn't surprised: \"It was always going to be a performance piece.\" And amazingly, I didn't blob in, although I confess at one point I mimed a few notes. It was when I looked across the hall and caught sight of the Coldstream Guards, in their full palace kit, and my mind wandered. How could this ever be repeated? But backstage afterwards, that is what is delighting Kenyon: \"Quite simply a unique day in the history of the Proms.\" And next time someone writes \"banshee\" in a score, at least we'll know what to do."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
