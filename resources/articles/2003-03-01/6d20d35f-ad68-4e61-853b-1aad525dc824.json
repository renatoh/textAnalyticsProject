But it's hard to forget something he said a few weeks ago. Every team at the World Cup could be beaten, he suggested, with the possible exception of Australia. That caveat was crucial, and on Sunday, his team played like they believed it. Forget Robert Mugabe and the Bulawayo weather system: Sunday at Port Elizabeth was where England really lost it. And there was no more telling moment than Michael Vaughan's horror misfield in the last over. It's all about symbolism and symmetry, you see. The symbolism is easy: Australia thrive under pressure, England wilt. The symmetry is more obscure. Back in early November, England went out to field in the first Test at Brisbane knowing they couldn't afford any slip-ups. Justin Langer pushed Andy Caddick's second ball gently to gulley, where the ball slipped through the fielder's legs. The psychological pendulum instantly swung Australia's way. The fielder was none other than Vaughan, who has developed a bizarre tendency to make the difficult look easy and the easy look impossible. And at Port Elizabeth he brought the wheel full circle: a misfield to help the Aussies at the start of the winter, and a misfield to help them at the end. Hussain maintained until his final days in office that England's problems against Australia weren't psychological. But Vaughan's boo-boo begged to differ. The problem isn't simply that England have a mental block about finishing the Aussies off. It's that the Aussies know it. Worse, England know they know. So, when England needed 14 off three overs to win the second VB Series final at Melbourne in January, in came Brett Lee to restore the natural order of things. When Australia slumped to 135 for 8 on Sunday, Michael Bevan burned red-hot while England fiddled. And when Andy Flintoff began to suggest that Andy Bichel might struggle to get off strike in that last over, Vaughan gave Bichel a helping hand. It's no good taking the world champions to the brink if you're going to stop to admire the view. In truth, the game was lost earlier, when England failed to go in for the kill with Australia 48 for 4. But both sides know that when one-day push comes to last-over shove, Australia have the self-belief and England - dear old, scarred England - do not. At least that's one thing Hussain won't have to worry about as captain ever again. o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o QUOTE OF THE WEEK \"He just puts it there - he's going to fly to the boundary.\" The Canadian opener, Ishwar Maraj, explains to journalists in a hotel bar how he's going to deal with the bowling of South Africa's Makhaya Ntini. Moments later, Ntini is introduced to an embarrassed Maraj, who whimpers \"Don't believe a word they tell you.\" Next day, the ball does anything but fly as Maraj crawls to an unbeaten 53 in 155 deliveries. His strike-rate of 34.19 makes it the slowest score of 50 or more in one-day international history. o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o SILLY POINT: HOW NOT TO PLAY MIND-GAMES Sachin Tendulkar went into India's game against England last week with an unrivalled tally of 1380 World Cup runs at an average of nearly 63. He had been in sublime form, and the last thing England needed was for him to have an extra reason to hit them all over Durban. Enter Andy Caddick, the man who once announced to the world that he knew how to dismiss Brian Lara. Not long afterwards, Lara hit 375. Not content with riling one genius, Caddick set his sights on needling another. \"I'm more than happy if Sachin opens the batting,\" he said, lazily inspecting his finger-nails. \"We have a better chance of getting him out.\" Warming to his ready-made pep-talk for Sachin and co, Caddick crowed, \"India hasn't been up to the mark - both their batting and bowling have been unimpressive. They should not take pride in scoring 300-plus against Namibia. They were aided more by the nimble-fingered Namibians than their batting strength,\" he joked, barely audible above Duncan Fletcher's sobs. \"Even Sachin did not play well despite his century,\" continued Caddick, presumably unaware that the men standing in front of him with dictaphones and notepads were in fact journalists. \"Sachin's just like another batsman in the Indian team.\" Caddick's plan worked a treat. When India won a vital toss the following day, Tendulkar was in the mood. Curiously, he reserved his most punishing strokeplay for Caddick, who seemed put out that his comments had found their way back to the Indian dressing-room. One short ball was pulled for six; a good-length one pushed back on the up through mid-off for four. By the time Tendulkar was out for a 50-ball 52, he had scored 36 of his runs off Caddick - and from just 19 balls. India were off to a flier, and Caddick finished with his most expensive analysis in one-day internationals. Have you got a star batsman who needs geeing up? Send for Andy! o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o COW CORNER: THE WEIGHT OF EXPECTATION To Geoff Boycott, it would have been a \"luvvly bit o' by-play\". To Steve Waugh, \"mental disintegration\". To Granny Spin, \"a crying shame\". With South Africa's World Cup hopes in the balance on Monday evening at Durban, their captain Shaun Pollock walked out to the middle. Then, it happened: Sky forgot to turn off their stump microphone. The result was a very audible masterclass in the art of sledging from the Sri Lankan wicketkeeper, Kumar Sangakkara, a law student who isn't afraid to cross-examine batsmen with the sarcasm of a public-school QC. \"Oh, here comes the skipper!\" chirped Sangakkara, who famously clashed with Mike Atherton during England's tour of Sri Lanka two years ago. \"He's looking nervous. Lots of pressure now. Oh, the weight of expectation! The weight of expectation! How's he going to cope?\" The freckles flared on Pollock's cheeks, but his mouth stayed shut. When Pollock patted Jayasuriya's first ball tamely back to him, Sangakkara reacted as if he had just been appointed a high-court judge. \"Oh!\" he exploded. \"Bowling! Pressure, boys, pressure!\" At this point, Sky turned the mike off, but the bleeting continued. Whether it contributed to Pollock's Duckworth/Lewis blunder is a moot point. But it wasn't the first time the two had met. Back in November, with Pollock at the crease and South Africa on the verge of sealing the Test series 2-0 at Centurion, Sangakkara decided to get stuck in. \"We don't complain when we lose away, man,\" he croaked. \"We don't cry like in Morocco [where Sri Lanka had beaten South Africa in the final of a one-day competition in August] and say 'this not our conditions, this is not our conditions' and go to the press conference and say the same. F***ing joke. If you win, be gracious, man. Otherwise it's s**t. Graceful, man, graceful, Shaun. Learn it.\" If Sri Lanka fail to qualify for the semi-finals, the Spin awaits Sangakkara's reaction with interest. o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o THE WEEK IN CRICKET Wasim Akram becomes the first bowler to take 500 one-day international wickets as Pakistan beat Holland by 97 runs at Paarl ...
