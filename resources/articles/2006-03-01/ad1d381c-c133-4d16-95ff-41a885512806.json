This was their fourteenth game in seven weeks and their third consecutive defeat in the past six days. With no visible let up in the fixture schedule, fatigue could prove to be their biggest enemy. Shades of 1996-97, perhaps, when the Teessiders reached two cup finals and went down? Of course, that was also the campaign when Middlesbrough's failure to fulfil a league game at Ewood Park led to a three-point deduction that eventually proved to be so costly. At least they turned up this time, playing their part in an entertaining and eventful game in which Blackburn strengthened their case for the fourth Champions League spot. Although Rovers had several key performers to thank for home league win number 11, it was that man Craig Bellamy who stole the limelight again with a typically busy performance. The Welshman put the Lancastrians in front after 11 minutes, turning Chris Riggott before sending a sweetly struck low shot into the far corner of Mark Schwarzer's net. Midway through the half, Bellamy's run towards the edge of the box was curtailed by Franck Queudrue's trip and Morten Gamst Pedersen stepped up to drill his free-kick beyond a poorly formed defensive wall and into the net. In between, Mark Viduka had brought Middlesbrough level with a well-hit shot from just inside the area after James Morrison had capitalised on Lucas Neill's wayward throw-in. The visiting team found an unlikely second-half ally in referee Chris Foy, who showed Robbie Savage a second yellow card in the 54th minute for the most innocuous-looking of hand-balls. Quite how the he was expected to get out of the way of Yakubu Aiyegbeni's powerfully struck pass only Foy will know. Blackburn's sense of injustice worsened eight minutes later when Fabio Rochemback drilled Morrison's pull-back from the right past Brad Friedel to equalise, but Bellamy scored what proved to be the decider after 68 minutes, giving Schwarzer no chance from 20 yards with an acute right-foot drive after Pedersen turned provider. Despite their advantage, a third Middlesbrough equaliser never looked on the cards. How they need a five-day break before Thursday's FA Cup quarter-final against Charlton. Man of the match - Craig Bellamy Capped an excellent display of non-stop running with two well-taken goals, while setting up the other with a threatening run towards the edge of the area. Another impressive performance from the Welshman."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
