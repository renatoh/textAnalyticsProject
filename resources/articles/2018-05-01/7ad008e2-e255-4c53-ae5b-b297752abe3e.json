By the end, this was a familiar story, a dominant all-round performance spearheaded by the brilliance of Ben Barba \u2013 however, this victory carried extra significance, you feel. Only twice throughout the entirety of last season were Castleford beaten here; St Helens have achieved that themselves in the last fortnight, following their victory in the Challenge Cup. That, if anything, underlines just how far ahead Justin Holbrook\u2019s side are of the field at present. Hearts will have been in mouths midway through the second half here when Barba hobbled off after long since assuring another victory for the Saints. His odds surely continue to shorten for the Man of Steel award after this latest performance. How relieved St Helens fans will have been to hear Holbrook deliver a reassuring post-match update on the full-back, saying: \u201cHe\u2019s fine, he\u2019s just got a couple of bumps and bruises.\u201d With a Challenge Cup quarter-final against Hull a week away, those words may have been the most welcome of the night for the supporters. The fact Castleford dominated last year\u2019s regular season \u2013 much like the Saints are doing this \u2013 and ultimately failed to win the Grand Final should at least provide hope to them, and the rest, that things can change come play-off season but this was a chastening evening for them. A late flurry of tries aside, which added some respectability to the scoreline, they were well-beaten. \u201cPlayers have got to be able to do their jobs better,\u201d said the Castleford coach, Daryl Powell. \u201cToo many of our players have to change if we are to have a chance of doing anything.\u201d In effect, victory felt assured for the Saints by half-time, when they were leading 22-4 thanks to four wonderful tries, the pick of which was a sensational individual effort from Barba, who raced the length of the field. He was ably assisted by the stand-off, Jonny Lomax, who will have done his England hopes no harm with this performance. Barba\u2019s departure failed to stunt their attacking prowess while Jake Trueman and Oliver Holmes were among Castleford\u2019s late scorers. The Saints finished the scoring with two wonderful breaks that were both finished by Th\u00e9o Fages as their dominance at the Super League summit continued."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
