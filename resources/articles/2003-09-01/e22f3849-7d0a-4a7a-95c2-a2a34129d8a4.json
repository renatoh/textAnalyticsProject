A select gathering of Daily Mirror execs and hacks are off later this month to Dublin for their annual 'drink-tank' (surely think-tank, ed). This, as some may recall from last year's La Manga shindig, is a 'brainstorming' exercise where executives bounce creative ideas off one another, think laterally and plan strategy, or failing that, get pissed and play a few rounds of golf, no expense spared. Top marks to Piers Morgan for getting that past his cost-cutting boss Sly Bailey a matter of weeks after the paper let three hacks go in the second wave of its redundancies, including former Daily Mail hack Wayne Francis, signed three years ago at great expense to the paper. Cheers. Snapper's costs more in focus Those savings have to come from somewhere. The Mirror's veteran snapper Kent Gavin retired after donkey's years of service chasing royals and reptiles to what should have been a heroes' banquet at the Arsenal. But one mole who was invited to attend was told that Gavin's last hurrah was to be a black-tie buffet. Silver service was just a bridge too far, obviously. Tired of being retired Theo? Meanwhile, the latest departure from the Evening Standard, which has rather carelessly lost a hack more or less every week for the past few months, is veteran picture editor David 'Theo' Theobald, who was told last week he was getting early retirement after more than 25 years of service to the paper. This must have seemed like d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for Theo, who underwent the same experience about two months ago, only to be called up the same day and told by a flunkey that someone had made a terrible mistake and could he please report for work the next day? Here's to a nice retirement. Bennett turns beach boy Neil Bennett, the ex-Sunday Telegraph city editor who now pulls strings at city PR firm Gavin Anderson, has taken on an unusual brief. In addition to the full gamut of blue chip clients, Bennett not known for his snazzy dress sense, is looking after surf label Fat Face, which, as fashion aficionados will know, makes the kind of threads not out of place on the beach or at a rave. Neil now has a free charge card. Whatever next? Agent Provocateur? Miu Miu?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
