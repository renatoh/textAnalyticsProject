This breach of the united front presented by vice-chancellors in backing the government's plans for \u00a33,000 top-up fees will embarrass ministers and encourage opponents on the Labour back benches. Details of the higher education bill expected to be announced in the Queen's speech next week are still being worked out but Charles Clarke, the education secretary, and his colleagues have been trying to find ways of protecting students from poorer families. But his proposed solution - to make universities use a third of their top-up fee income for bursaries - would discriminate against institutions with the most students from disadvantaged families, said Michael Driscoll, chair of the Coalition of Modern Universities. \"Even students with exactly the same disadvantaged background going to different universities would be in different positions - the whole thing is a mess,\" he said. Professor Driscoll went on: \"The more disadvantaged students a university has - the more fee income that is diverted into maintenance bursaries for students and away from paying staff and the other operating costs of providing a good quality education for students.\" He said the proposed bursaries scheme would create incentives for universities to charge the highest possible fee and to reduce the proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, \"rewarding universities for not widening participation\". In addition he fears courses such as engineering which would only be able to charge a low fee would become more uneconomic and be closed. At present students from poorer families pay no fees and Mr Clarke has promised MPs that they would not end up in a worse position after the introduction of top-up fees. To offset the maximum fee of \u00a33,000 students would get a \u00a31,000 maintenance grant, a waiver of the present fee of \u00a31,125 and a \u00a3875 bursary from the university. Professor Driscoll argued that students attending a cheaper course - with lower levels of staff and poorer facilities - would be worse off because they would not qualify for an upfront cash bursary. The proposal for fixed fees for all universities put forward by Labour backbencher Anne Campbell would mean students would be treated alike but universities with more disadvantaged undergraduates to find bursaries for would still find themselves in a worse position."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
