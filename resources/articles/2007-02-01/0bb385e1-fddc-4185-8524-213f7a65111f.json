The pair have known each other since Bennett, then city editor of the Sunday Telegraph, commissioned Johnson's business column 10 years ago. \"I talk to him and suggest things to him,\" says Bennett, now at the Maitland Consultancy along with former BBC director of corporate affairs Colin Browne. \"It's nothing formal. From time to time he rings me up and asks for advice. I am more than happy to advise him if he wants me to.\" Johnson famously does not have a PA and did not tell the C4 press office that he was going on Today, where he singularly failed to defend Celebrity Big Brother. Unfortunately for him, he didn't tell Bennett either. \u00b7 Fear not, fans of John Simm drama Life on Mars, about to start its second - and final - series. Monkey hears that plans are afoot for a further time-travelling show featuring another police officer catapulted back from the future to Philip Glenister's cop shop. Except this time round it's a few years later - the 1980s rather than the 1970s - and there will be a new soundtrack, new cop car (Sierra rather than Cortina?) and a new title: why, Ashes to Ashes, of course. And it may even be a woman officer who goes back in time, which will presumably annoy DCI Gene Hunt even more. Less Sweeney, more Juliet Bravo, perhaps. \u00b7 Jeremy Paxman moans that the BBC does not do enough for the environment, but the same cannot be said for the good people of Emap, who have appointed a chap to look after green issues. But Monkey can't help but wonder if he isn't quite eco-friendly enough. His name? Ben Greenish. Come, come, this is no time for half measures! \u00b7 More now from the living soap that is Michael's Big Adventure, otherwise know as Michael Grade's fledgling tenure as ITV executive chairman. This week, Michael turns his attention to ITV1's primetime programming and is said to be particularly unimpressed with Alison Sharman's Fortune series in which ordinary punters plead with millionaires for cash. \"Why have we got a begging show on ITV?\" Grade was overheard asking. Perhaps it would have been better if Anne Robinson had been presenting it. Monkey hears the Weakest Link host was wanted by ITV for the job. \u00b7 With the judging process about to begin for this year's Sony awards, Monkey's attention turns to Today reporter Jon Manel's effort last week, in which he illustrated a piece about the NHS budgetary \"cake\" ... with a cake. \"It's an extremely heavy cake,\" explained Manel as he grappled with a \"scalpel or to be honest a huge kitchen knife provided by BBC catering staff\". He then cut up the cake depending on where the money would be spent. \"That's a huge slice. That's more than a slice. That's an enormous chunk!\" The next slice was \"rather smaller, that's criminal negligence\", while another \"bigger, decent cake slice\" was devoted to, well, something else. \"What have we learned from this?\" asked Manel. Hmm. That news items involving cutting up cakes don't really work on radio? Not so much Today as The Day Today. \u00b7 If Manel's Today report isn't a shoo-in for a Sony gold award, then perhaps this is. Radio 5 Live's Peter Allen was interviewing a chap who had come up with a crime-busting place to hide your valuables - in your underwear drawer - when things took an entirely predictable turn. The specially adapted pants, explained the inventor, came with \"realistic looking skidmarks\" complete with \"dew drops\" to make them smell like the real thing. Not an entirely suitable discussion for a teatime news programme, you might think. \"If you thought that was offensive,\" said Allen, \"you're probably right.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
