You\u2019ll have a whole different supreme court structure.\u201d Trump has made immigration a central issue of his campaign, promising to build a wall on the southern border, to be paid for by Mexico, although Mexican leaders have rejected the idea. His promises to deport some 11 million undocumented migrants who live in the US have recently been thrown into doubt, however. CBN host David Brody asked Trump whether he was referring to \u201cwhat Michele Bachmann was talking about\u201d, which was Clinton providing potential citizenship for \u201cmany of these illegals\u201d, because \u201cthat means Texas and Florida could be gone\u201d. Bachmann, a former congresswoman from Minnesota who made a brief run for the White House in 2012 and is an adviser to the Trump campaign, last week told CBN: \u201cIf you look at the numbers of people who vote and who live in the country and who Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton want to bring in to the country, this is the last election when we even have a chance to vote for somebody who will stand up for godly moral principles. This is it.\u201d Both Texas and Florida have large populations of undocumented people, relative to other states, and the latter has been tightly contested in recent elections. Trump repeated: \u201cI think this will be the last election if I don\u2019t win. I think this will be the last election that the Republicans have a chance of winning because you\u2019re going to have people flowing across the border, you\u2019re going to have illegal immigrants coming in and they\u2019re going to be legalised and they\u2019re going to be able to vote and once that all happens you can forget it.\u201d Two successive presidents, Democrat Barack Obama and Republican George W Bush, have failed to pass immigration reform plans through Congress that would have created very gradual paths to citizenship. Despite steady support by moderate Republicans for such plans, Trump has consistently rejected citizenship unless migrants leave and return to the US. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to have one Republican vote,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s already a hard number. Already the path is much more difficult for the Republicans. You just have to look at the maps.\u201d In the Real Clear Politics head-to-head poll average, Clinton leads Trump 45.6% to 42.9%. The same site\u2019s poll average for Florida puts the Democrat up by 44.8% to 44.5%. In Texas, Trump leads by 45.7% to 37.3%. Data journalism site FiveThirtyEight has forecast that Clinton has a 71.3% chance of winning the White House. The website makes Florida the state most likely to tip the election, with an 18.7% chance. Solidly Republican Texas, it says, has a 0.7% chance of deciding who makes it to the White House."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
