Depending on your viewpoint, you may want to adopt a strictly ethical approach or you may be comfortable with a looser, socially responsible investment (SRI) strategy. SRI funds are invariably more inclusive. Even so, almost all will incorporate some negative screening. Many, for example, avoid tobacco and companies testing on animals for cosmetic purposes. With more than 50 funds to choose from, there are many options and you may want to use the services of an independent financial provider (IFA), which specialises in ethical investment. Many people have different criteria for ethical investments. For example, some people are happy investing in companies producing alcohol, but loathe the tobacco industry. A cheese-loving vegetarian may have a different attitude to a vegan who is opposed to the production of dairy products. An IFA will help you invest in the funds that are in line with your beliefs. What approach does each fund employ? Framlington's Health Fund claims to adopt \"a positive ethical stance\" and is one of the top performers, but invests in drug companies that test on animals. In contrast, NPI's global care fund avoids meat and dairy production, animal testing and any links with the fur trade. The purest ethical fund only has about 100 or so shares to invest in. With many linked to technology, this has meant many of these funds have been badly hit. SRI, however, allows a more flexible stance to be taken. Whatever you choose, you will be part of a growing trend. Some 10 years ago, the public held less than \u00a3320m in ethical funds, according to Ethical Investment Research Services (Eiris), which analyses the sector. Today it is \u00a33.7bn. CIS now says all its funds are managed on SRI principles, but only its Environ fund meets true ethical criteria. Spokeswoman Carolyn Hicks says SRI is about \"engaging in dialogue\" with companies. This could be putting pressure at shareholders' meetings to encourage better practice or slamming top executives' pay. What about performance and charges? Trustnet, which provides online fund information, says its research shows the most important factor for ethical investors is the fund manager rather than the ethical strategy. Marketing director James Jones says: \"Having already made the decision to invest in ethical funds, investors become less concerned about the comfort factor, and more concerned about the hard facts - will it perform well, and is it a good value investment?\" And many pundits are now rating Norwich Union, which last year poached top manager Clare Brook and her team of nine from Henderson Global Investors to head its SRI unit. Judging performance of any fund helps if you have historical data, although past performance can never be a guarantee of future performance. However this is not the case for many ethical and SRI funds, as they are often recent launches. Analyst Standard &amp; Poor's compared the average ethical fund against all UK unit trusts (excluding ethical). Between March and September of this year, it found that ethical funds were down 14.43%, compared to 11.8% for UK unit trusts. This is a relatively small difference and means little if you consider the average ethical fund is smaller. For the previous three years (1998 to 2001), the average ethical fund grew by 15.08%, compared to 22.26% for the average non-UK unit trust. The figures show that, while we are now experiencing a market downturn, ethical funds are catching up. Specialist IFA Holden Meehan insists: \"Many statistical surveys have been done. They show that historical median performance of ethical funds is not significantly worse than that of conventional funds.\" Charges are pretty much on a par with non-ethical funds. The average, according to analyst The Research Department, is about 5%, although the Clerical Medical Evergreen fund has an initial charge of 6%, while Standard Life's UK Ethical fund charges just 3%. What is the future of ethical investment? There are plenty of starting points for research. Research service Eiris provides data on companies. There is also a series of new indices, FTSE4Good, which show the performance of SRI equities. Ethical investing, and specifically the softer SRI movement, is expanding, and even the cynics are forced to admit this. Mark Dampier, head of IFA and discount brokers Hargreaves Lansdown, says his advice has always been to \"invest normally and give your money to charity\". He says the purest ethical funds have too many restrictions. \"How can they invest in the US if the country is ignoring the Kyoto agreement or Japan if there is no research available?\" he asks. Mr Dampier adds that he also feels some fund managers are too wrapped up in the finer details. \"I heard that one investment team spent hours locked in a meeting discussing whether or not to invest in WH Smith because they stock men's magazines.\" But, even if he may have his doubts, clients are calling the shots. \"We are now producing our own guide to SRI investment. I may be sceptical, but it seems people do want to know more about it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
