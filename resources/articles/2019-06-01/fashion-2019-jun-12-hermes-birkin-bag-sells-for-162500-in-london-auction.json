The 2015 Himalaya niloticus crocodile Birkin 35 was not the only bag to exceed expectations, with a 2007 Herm\u00e8s shiny ficelle porosus crocodile Birkin selling for \u00a3118,750, following estimates of \u00a350,000-70,000. The Birkin bag is named after the actor and singer Jane Birkin, who was seated next to the Herm\u00e8s chief executive, Jean-Louis Dumas, on a flight from Paris to London in 1983. Since then, the design has become hugely popular with celebrities and collectors \u2013 Victoria Beckham\u2019s collection of more than 100 Birkins, for example, is thought to be worth more than \u00a31.5m. Bidders from 41 countries, across six continents, participated in the auction with sales of 243 lots totalling \u00a33.4m. Creations from Karl Lagerfeld\u2019s tenure at Chanel were in particular demand. The renowned designer died in February, following 36 years at the fashion house. A 2017 Chanel black lucite and crystal rocket ship evening bag, which had been estimated to sell for between \u00a36,000-8,000, achieved \u00a321,250, and a 2010 shiny amethyst alligator bag, which was given the same estimate, sold for \u00a318,750. At the other end of the scale, a Herm\u00e8s leather wristlet from 1999, which had been expected to sell for between \u00a3600-800, achieved just \u00a3375. \u201cAs awareness grows regarding the variety of pieces on the secondary market, as well as the breadth of price points, the benefits of collecting at auction become apparent,\u201d said Rachel Koffsky, Christie\u2019s the head of sales for handbags and accessories. \u201cThis is coupled with the awareness of sustainability, as consumers look for ways to collect and shop with a reduced impact on the environment.\u201d Last year\u2019s handbags and accessories sale just missed the \u00a33m mark with sales hitting \u00a32.9m. However, the sale of a similar Herm\u00e8s crocodile Birkin, from 2008, achieved a European record for a handbag sold at auction, also selling for \u00a3162,500. The auction house again broke records last December when a rare Louis Vuitton explorer trunk from 1892 sold for \u00a3162,500. The most recent sale featured the largest number of designers, including Prada, Dior, Gucci, Delvaux, Celine, Fendi as well as trunks from designers including Louis Vuitton and Goyard. \u201cLimited edition and rare handbags continue to capture the attention of serious collectors and savvy shoppers alike,\u201d said Koffsky."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
