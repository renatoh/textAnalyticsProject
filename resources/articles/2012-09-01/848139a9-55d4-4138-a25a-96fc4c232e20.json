She pointed me down a path, across a bridge, but then she warned: \"You know, you can't get into the swimming pool.\" Why hello, Miss Jobsworth, I thought, bristling and preparing to jab my \"all venues\" accreditation in her smug face. She looked alarmed and took a step backwards. \"Only the athletes can get into the swimming pool,\" she simpered. Oh no, she'd been making a joke! It was day one of the Paralympic Games, and I'd clearly not got the memo that we were back to being nice to each other. Smiling, being polite and stuff that Londoners regard as a sign of weakness. So after a fortnight's regression into misanthropy since the Olympics, once again we are aspiring to be better, happier, more patriotic people. But if it was business as usual for the Games makers \u2013 the majority of whom seem to have been freshly indoctrinated for the Para-lympics \u2013 how are the rest of us feeling? A major international sports competition is a significant emotional and time investment; were we ready to wholeheartedly commit to another one so soon after the euphoria of the Olympics? The initial signs were that, yes, we were. With a peak of 11.2 million viewers, the opening ceremony gave Channel 4 its highest ratings in more than a decade. This was followed by an impressive 3.3 million who watched the British team play Germany at wheelchair basketball. Ticket sales have also been unprecedented. More than 2.42 million have already been allocated, leaving around 10,000 to be drip-released each day. After a surge in demand during the Olympics and steady enthusiasm ever since, there has been speculation that this will be the first sold-out Paralympics. At the ExCel, home to the powerlifting, table tennis and sitting volleyball among other events, there was little evidence of an Olympic hangover on Friday. Visitors had taken advantage of \u00a310 tickets (\u00a35 for children) that allowed them to roam from event to event starting at 9am with 7/7 survivor Martine Wright's debut in the sitting volleyball with constant action until past 10pm. In the gaps you could watch separated-at-birth pair London mayor Boris Johnson and Babs Windsor trying to play sitting volleyball, which was arguably worth the price of admission on its own. One frazzled Games maker admitted that the organising team had been a little overwhelmed by the enthusiasm. \"Spectators are just finishing up in one event and then literally sprinting to the next one,\" he said, just after he had to turn away a long line from a jam-packed powerlifting session. \"We expected them to mill around, maybe get something to eat, go to the toilet.\" Despite some waits at the open-access events in the ExCel, the atmosphere was jubilant. Twice I saw people spontaneously break into dance. \"This is much more relaxed than the Olympics,\" said Simon, who came with his wife and two kids from Ealing, west London. The aim that the Paralympics should be related but distinct from its big brother is also becoming evident. London 2012 chairman Seb Coe has pointed out that Paralympics GB's success in the swimming pool has led to louder cheers there than we ever heard during the Olympics. No one I met this week could confidently explain to me the labyrinthine classification in Paralympic sport, but it didn't seem to adversely affect anyone's enjoyment either. Likewise, the idea that we should judge the athletes on their ability, not their disability, was starting to hit home too. \"I didn't really understand the classification for women's powerlifting, but it was so awesome,\" said London-based Australian Amber, dressed fetchingly in a Superwoman costume. \"But the woman from Nigeria who won was under 44kg and she was benching more than double her weight, 109kg, and that's just amazing.\" \"I wouldn't be able to do half that shit,\" added her friend Gemma, who today was Wonder Woman. Anecdotally, it has been felt that these Games have been less partisan than the Olympics. At the velodrome on Thursday, Sarah Storey's extraordinary gold medal, the first won by a British athlete, was greeted by a racket that rattled the Siberian pine floorboards. But the screaming that accompanied a particularly topsy-turvy bronze-medal decider in the men's individual B pursuit between an Irish rider and a Spaniard was \u2013 to my ears \u2013 just as loud and even more sustained. While you would hesitate to describe all of the performances as elite sport \u2013 there were just six competitors in the women's F40 discus, each with a 50/50 shot at a medal \u2013 that has done little to dampen enthusiasm. Many people are just happy to see venues such as the Olympic Park \u2013 \"I just wanted to be part of it,\" said Anoushka from Oxford \u2013 before they are reassigned. Even traditional rivalries and jingoism have been put to one side in many instances. If you had ever thought that two arms would be beneficial, even essential, for swimming backstroke, then China's Lu Dong disproves that. A double arm amputee, she produced one of the performances of the Games so far to win the women's 100m S6 category, ahead of home favourite Nyree Kindred, and also one of the most memorable images as she stood on the podium with her medal and her bouquet cradled in the crook of her neck. If there's one thing that has been a bit off, it's the absence of foreign visitors. Locog insists they have sold half a million tickets abroad, but non-UK spectators were little in evidence in the opening days of the Games. Eventually, at a Rwanda-Brazil sitting volleyball clash, I found a stars-and-stripes flag, next to paraphernalia from Sweden, Germany, Holland and Ireland. Sadly, they all belonged to one (well-travelled) family \u2013 American mother Alice and her five children \u2013 and today they had come all the way from Berkshire. Alice has been disappointed by tales of NBC's lacklustre coverage, but ascribed it more to the current surfeit of sport in the US \u2013 the start of the American football season, the end of baseball's, and the US Open tennis \u2013 and the forthcoming presidential election than any lack of interest from her compatriots. \"We went to a few Olympics events, but I find the Paralympics even more inspiring,\" she said. \"Just seeing the Rwandan athletes in front of us and after the match how they put their shoes on, their legs on, that sort of stuff for them is so ordinary. I have found the whole thing incredible.\" Alice's kids look on rapt, and you can't ignore the fact \u2013 at a time when legacy is all \u2013 that children, in particular, are clearly loving the Games. \"We had a long drive from Oxford but it was worth it,\" Anoushka's eight-year-old son Joseph confided to me earlier. Inspired by the judo, he has just unleashed a devastating ippon on his younger brother in the main concourse of the ExCel. \"It's been the happiest day of my life.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
