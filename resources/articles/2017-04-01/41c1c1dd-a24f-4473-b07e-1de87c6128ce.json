While City and United prepare for the derby at the Etihad Stadium on Thursday with Champions League qualification their priority, Chelsea can move seven points clear at the top of the Premier League with victory against Southampton on Tuesday at Stamford Bridge. Re-establishing that imposing lead would potentially inflict further psychological damage on second-placed Tottenham Hotspur, whom they beat in the FA Cup semi-final on Saturday. \u201cFor sure, it would be my greatest achievement,\u201d said Conte, who claimed three Serie A titles with Juventus and took Italy to the Euro 2016 quarter-finals. \u201cNow, to win the title in England is a great achievement. A top achievement for the coach, the players and the club. \u201cTo win in England these days is not easy. To win this league is difficult, so we must be proud in our work. We must know that, now, it\u2019s a good season. It will remain a good season. But we want it to become a great season, a fantastic season. To become a great or fantastic season there is only one way: to win [the title]. This is a crucial week for us.\u201d Conte had inherited a side who had finished 10th last season, their worst placing under Roman Abramovich\u2019s ownership, with that actually representative of a recovery under the interim stewardship of Guus Hiddink after the unravelling of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s second spell in charge over the first half of the campaign. The Italian added David Luiz, N\u2019Golo Kante \u2013 whom Conte described as \u201ca silent leader\u201d in the dressing room \u2013 Marcos Alonso and the under-used Michy Batshuayi to the ranks for around \u00a3100m over the summer, a significant outlay eclipsed by the \u00a3150m spent by United and \u00a3165m by City in the transfer window. \u201cThis season it\u2019s very important to understand it\u2019s not always about who spends more money who wins,\u201d said Conte, who should have his captain, Gary Cahill, fit after illness and will recall Diego Costa and Eden Hazard against Southampton. \u201cOtherwise, in this league, this season the name of the [title-winning] team wouldn\u2019t be Chelsea or Tottenham or Arsenal or Liverpool. You understand?\u201d Asked if he anticipated the Manchester clubs spending as excessively again over the summer ahead, he said: \u201cYes, like every year. You\u2019ve seen the past. You can see that every season they spend a lot of money. But it\u2019s right for every team to do what they think is best. Every single club decides their own strategy. But this season isn\u2019t the only season the Manchester clubs have spent a lot of money. Look at the past. It\u2019s normal. It\u2019s right for them to do this, to reinforce their teams, if they think this is the right way to win the title.\u201d The Italian has already discussed Chelsea\u2019s plans for the summer with the director, Marina Granovskaia, and the technical director, Michael Emenalo, with the leaders hoping to strengthen significantly themselves before their return to the Champions League next season. The likes of Alexis S\u00e1nchez, Romelu Lukaku, Virgil van Dijk, Tiemou\u00e9 Bakayoko, \u00c1lvaro Morata and Alex Sandro feature on a hefty wish-list. \u201cIn every situation it\u2019s important to find the right balance: If you have to spend money, try and spend that money in the right way to take players with the right characteristics for your idea of football,\u201d Conte said. \u201cBut, for us, I repeat: this season is very important because we are trying to build something important for the present, to put the foundations down and be strong, stronger for the future. And to build, also, slowly, slowly to become a real power. A real power in the future.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
