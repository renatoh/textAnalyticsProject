There were 3,676 stillbirths in 2005, and half of those are still unexplained, says the report from the Confidential Inquiry into Maternal and Child Health, which was set up by the medical royal colleges. The study collects data on all stillbirths and deaths within four weeks of birth from clinicians in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It shows that one in 200 pregnancies end in stillbirth and one in 300 babies die before they are four weeks old. Stillbirths were in steady decline from the 1950s, says the report, but the rate has held steady since the early 1990s. \"The lack of progress in reducing the stillbirth rate is a matter of considerable public health concern meriting further initiatives and research,\" says the report. While the causes of half the stillbirths are unknown, it is clear that they were more likely to happen to mothers living in areas of social deprivation, who were twice as likely to have a stillbirth as those in the richest parts of the country. Where the babies survived birth, they were 2.2 times more likely to die within four weeks than those of mothers in more affluent areas. Mothers over 40 and below 20 were most likely to suffer a stillbirth. Black and Asian women were more likely to have a stillbirth, the research shows. Just over 50% of stillbirths are categorised as \"unexplained\" by doctors and 48% of the deaths of small babies are labelled as due to \"immaturity\". The report says this language is imprecise and not useful to researchers. Autopsies are not always carried out, even when the cause of death is not known. \"The occurrence of stillbirth is still a major and tragic problem in this country,\" said Jim Dornan, vice president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. \"We need to know more about why stillbirths happen.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
