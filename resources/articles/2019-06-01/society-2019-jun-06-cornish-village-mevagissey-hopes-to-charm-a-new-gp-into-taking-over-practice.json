The 75-year-old describes calling a Dr Hannon at 2am when her sister-in-law was taken ill with kidney stones in the 1970s. \u201cYou could see him from our window coming down that hill on his moped,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a very personal service.\u201d Last month the well-respected partner of the local practice, Dr Katherine James, announced she would be handing back her contract to run the surgery on 31 July. NHS England says it is assessing the options available, but it is feared the much-loved community surgery could close and its 5,300 patients forced to use the infrequent and expensive bus service to travel elsewhere for treatment. Faced with this prospect, the residents of Mevagissey, which is eight miles south of St Austell, the nearest medium-sized town, took matters into their own hands. The \u201cWill you be my GP?\u201d campaign \u2013 with its #willyoubemygp hashtag \u2013 aims to persuade doctors around the country that they should make the picturesque fishing village, with its narrow winding streets and superior fish and chips, their home. In a campaign video posted on the Cornwall Channel, a crowd of residents chant: \u201cBe our GP. We are a lovely community. We need you.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no point in us saying that we want to get a doctor to come down here, if we can\u2019t demonstrate that a doctor might be interested in doing that,\u201d said Kim Andrews, who kickstarted the campaign with local Conservative councillor James Mustoe. \u201cThere might be a doctor out there who maybe had never thought about moving to Cornwall. Maybe they think of Cornwall as somewhere they go on holiday once every 10 years. I think the first step is to remind them that we\u2019re here and it\u2019s a lovely place to live.\u201d The problem facing Mevagissey \u2013 with its population of around 2,000 \u2013 is not a unique one for rural communities. Research by the medical website Pulse published last week found that 138 doctors\u2019 premises shut their doors in 2018, compared with 18 in 2013. The data suggested that smaller surgeries \u2013 those serving 5,000 or fewer patients \u2013 were the worst affected in 2018, accounting for 86% of closures. GPs told the Guardian that under-resourcing and difficulties recruiting new doctors were forcing surgeries to close. Mevagissey\u2019s pitch is a simple one: theirs is a thriving fishing community, with the second biggest fishing port in Cornwall. As well as the retired population, there are young families living there. There are 5,300 patients on the surgery\u2019s lists from both the village and the surrounding areas, but, during the summer months, there is an influx of tourists who often need medical care. The campaign has apparently already resulted in some expressions of interest, though they said they could not go into detail. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want to be a GP here?\u201d said Cavanagh. Dr Marlene Behennah worked at Mevagissey surgery for 30 years until 2002 \u2013 she was also born in the village and went to school with Cavanagh. \u201cI\u2019m very very sad about this,\u201d she said of the possibility the surgery will close. \u201cI mean, this is my life\u2019s work.\u201d The problem is, she said, that not enough GPs want to become partners \u2013 which involves taking on the responsibility for the running of the practice. Figures by NHS England show there were 179 closures of contracts to run GP practices in 2017-18, compared with 107 the year before. Mevagissey surgery had been advertising for a new partner for years before the decision was made to end the contract. Behennah said the increasing amounts of admin are putting people off. \u201cIf you\u2019re a young doctor and you have a family, you don\u2019t want, when you\u2019ve finished at the end of the day, to spend two hours collecting data for the government. Why should they spend two hours doing nonsense after working all day?\u201d \u201cThe National Health Service, over its 70 years, has evolved,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery generation does things differently. Things have got to evolve and people have probably got to be prepared to accept a different sort of healthcare.\u201d But, she says, rural communities are being neglected. \u201cWhat works for London \u2013 drop-in centres and such \u2013 doesn\u2019t work for an area like this. Public transport is not good, people can\u2019t travel long distances.\u201d A spokesperson for NHS England &amp; NHS Improvement South West said: \u201cIt\u2019s our duty to make sure people continue to have access to GP care, and we want to make sure that happens in the best way possible.\u201d The body is due to set out the options for the future of the surgery in the coming days after an online survey of local residents\u2019 views closed on Wednesday. Aza Adlam, an arts and crafts teacher, moved to Mevagissey in 2015 after falling in love with it while on holiday. \u201cIt\u2019s a genuine community here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt takes half an hour to go somewhere that should take five minutes because everyone talks to you. It\u2019s just got a real warmth about it.\u201d A new GP would be welcomed with open arms, \u201cnot just because of what they do but because we love it when people come and live here\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
