I've been  deluding myself'", "bodyText": "Previously: An interesting man called Sam has moved in nearby. I meet him on the street and, after chatting for a while, I ask what he does. \"I'm an actor,\" he says. \"How interesting!\" I say. I pause and smile, expectantly. \"OK,\" I think, \"ask me what I do.\" But he doesn't. Sam's lived here more than a month now, and he still hasn't asked me what I do. It is driving me nuts. \"Ask me what I do,\" I think, whenever I see him. \"Ask me what I do!' But he never does. \"He's so self-absorbed,\" I think. Today, I spot Sam outside the house. \"Fancy a coffee?\" I mouth out of the window. \"OK!\" he mouths back. I take him into the living room. \"What a lot of Christmas cards you've got!\" he says. \"Yes,\" I think, quite proudly, \"I have had a lot of Christmas cards this year. And I haven't sent any! It's quite something to get so many when you don't send any. It means they really count. None of these people thought, 'Oh God, Ronson sent me a Christmas card. I'd better send him one back.'\" I nod to myself. \"Yes,\" I think, \"it's only when you don't send any Christmas cards that you learn how truly loved you are. You know what? I'm never going to send them again!\" Actually, I've never in my life sent a Christmas card. And look at my shelves! They're full of Christmas cards! This is a validation of my lifelong lazy attitude regarding the sending of Christmas cards. In the end, it just doesn't matter. \"It's like those people who stop washing their hair, and after a while their hair becomes self-cleaning,\" I think. \"There's probably loads of things I can stop doing.\" I look at Sam. \"Ask me what I do,\" I think. He's looking at my Christmas cards. \"Maybe,\" I think, \"he'll pick one up, realise it is from a notable person and ask me what I do.\" I pause. \"Go on,\" I urge inwardly. \"Do it!\" Sam's arm is hovering near the Christmas cards. \"Do it!\" I think. He grabs one. \"Yes!\" I think. He reads the inscription. Then he puts the card back, sits on the sofa, and drinks his coffee. \"Lovely coffee,\" he says, inscrutably. \"Who was the card from?\" I think. \"I must find out.\" \"Yes,\" I say nonchalantly, wandering over to the bookshelves, \"the coffee is lovely.\" I casually pick up the card. \"Happy Xmas from everyone at the NatWest Advantage Premier team.\" \"Damn!\" I think. Then I read the card next to it: \"Happy Xmas from Lloyd Piggott Chartered Accountants.\" \"Oh my God,\" I think. \"I've been deluding myself! These cards are all from companies I do business with.\" \"I usually chuck the corporate ones away,\" Sam says. \"They don't really count, do they?\" \"I usually chuck them away, too!\" I say. \"I don't know what happened this year!\" \"By the way,\" says Sam, \"what do you do for a living?\" I pause, astonished. Then it all comes gushing out. I tell him about minor awards I won years ago. I tell him Robbie Williams admires my work. I can't stop myself. I finally finish. I look exhausted. \"Anyway,\" says Sam, \"I'd better go.\" \"OK,\" I croak. I glance at the sad, corporate cards. \"It's not too late!\" I think. \"I'm going to send Christmas cards!\" \u00b7 To buy Jon Ronson's new book, Out Of The Ordinary: True Tales Of Everyday Craziness (Picador, \u00a38.99), visit guardianbooks.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
