Top stories Christian Porter has sought to allay concerns that a federal religious discrimination bill could water down protections for LGBT people in state legislation. The attorney general told Guardian Australia the bill \u201cis not intended to displace state law nor will it import specific provisions of international law\u201d after LGBT advocates warned that it could undermine state protections against vilification or discrimination on the grounds of sex or sexuality. Boris Johnson has claimed that he fully supports the UK\u2019s ambassador to the US, Sir Kim Darroch, a day after it was reported that his previous repeated and public refusals to do so had convinced the diplomat he had no choice other than to resign. Johnson came under withering attack in parliament for having refused to say he would keep Darroch on as ambassador if he became prime minister. The Labour MP Pat McFadden called Darroch\u2019s resignation \u201ca dark moment for our democracy\u201d and said Johnson\u2019s lack of support for the envoy was \u201ca chilling warning of what is to come if he becomes prime minister\u201d. Australia\u2019s peak lawyers group has warned the legal aid system is at \u201cbreaking point\u201d, after the extraordinary derailment of a high-profile murder trial in NSW. Three men were due to face trial in the supreme court on Monday for the 2016 alleged killings of the underworld figures Pasquale Barbaro and Mehmet Yilmaz. But the court was forced to postpone the four-month trial for at least a year because the legal aid rates were woefully inadequate for suitable barristers to take on such a complex case. The Law Council of Australia president, Arthur Moses, said the case was a worrying example of chronic legal aid underfunding \u201cundermining the criminal justice system\u201d. World British ships operating in the Gulf have been put on the highest state of alert, amid fears that UK-flagged commercial vessels are vulnerable to attack by Iranian gunboats. Mandatory evacuations have been ordered in several communities south and east of New Orleans as the city and a surrounding stretch of the Gulf coast brace for a possible hurricane at the weekend. Saudi Arabia may be planning to relax the country\u2019s strict male guardianship laws to allow women to leave the country without needing permission from a male relative, according to reports. The British extremist Tommy Robinson has been given a nine-month prison sentence \u2013 of which he will serve about 10 weeks \u2013 for contempt of court after he broadcast reports that encouraged \u201cvigilante action\u201d against defendants in a sexual exploitation trial. A French chef has demanded his restaurant be removed from the Michelin Guide, denouncing the \u201cprofound incompetence\u201d of the guide\u2019s inspectors. \u201cThey dared to say that we put cheddar in our souffl\u00e9 of reblochon, beaufort and tomme!\u201d said Marc Veyrat of Le Maison des Bois. Opinion and analysis The award-winning Australian comedian Corey White was still in preschool when his father went to prison but the old man\u2019s shadow looms large over White\u2019s new memoir. In The Prettiest Horse in the Glue Factory, White navigates a childhood marred by violence, drug use and neglect \u2013 but, as bad as his home life was, foster care was worse. Trauma has left him unable to piece together his memory, and revisiting the past comes at a cost. \u201cI didn\u2019t recover memories but I recovered emotions, I think,\u201d he says. \u201cPrior to the breakdown, I experienced these things as just almost like video images that I had no emotional investment in. I regained the sense of how visceral they were, and really a sense of how frightened or terrified I was.\u201d Psychedelic mental health treatment is expected to be approved in Australia within five years. The Victorian government is being urged to make the state a research leader in the field, which involves therapy using magic mushrooms or MDMA to treat mental illnesses. The UK, Canada, Europe and Israel are also active research hubs. Dr Paul Liknaitzky of Mind Medicine Australia \u2013 which lobbies for psychedelic-assisted treatments for mental health \u2013 said the stigma around the therapy has been lifting globally in the past 15 years. Sport England have thrashed Australia by eight wickets to reach their fourth Cricket World Cup final, chasing down a target of 224 with 17.5 overs to spare. It was a day of pain at Edgbaston for the Australians, who were reduced to 14-3 before Steve Smith\u2019s 85 restored some respectability, but England\u2019s batsmen made short work of the modest chase and now face New Zealand in the final. Australia are the top predators of the Netball World Cup, having claimed 11 of 14 titles since 1963, but now the Diamonds suddenly look beatable, writes Erin Delahunty. Thinking time: kd lang on being a lesbian icon In 1992 Kathryn Dawn Lang came out as gay during an interview with the Advocate, an LGBT magazine, while promoting her album, Ing\u00e9nue. Some radio stations stopped playing her music; she felt ostracised by the country music industry. In 1993 she appeared on the cover of Vanity Fair. She had continuously played up to, and cultivated, her androgynous looks \u2013 rocking a teddy-boy quiff and often a loosely tailored suit on stage. For the magazine shoot, she appears in a barber\u2019s chair, her tie loosened around her neck, with her face being shaved by Cindy Crawford. The image is disruptive, beautiful and poignant: it\u2019s no longer a man\u2019s world. \u201cElvis lives, and she\u2019s beautiful,\u201d Madonna said at the time. \u201cI was surprised when I heard a rumour that I\u2019d slept with Madonna,\u201d lang chuckles. Now 57, the singer is about to embark on a UK tour called Ing\u00e9nue Redux, in which she will perform the album in its entirety. \u201cThe first time I listened back, after 25 years, was when we were rehearsing,\u201d she says, speaking from her home in Calgary. \u201cI thought: \u2018Ugh, this is not going to be easy. It\u2019s a dirge, it\u2019s so slow.\u2019\u201d But when she had completely relearned the album: \u201cIt felt like putting on an old pair of shoes.\u201d Media roundup The Australian reports that Scott Morrison will veto any move to enshrine an Aboriginal \u201cvoice to parliament\u201d in the constitution. The Australian Financial Review says Josh Frydenberg and the Reserve Bank are at one over the economy. And the Advertiser reports on testimony to a South Australian parliament inquiry calling for koalas on Kangaroo Island to be killed and half the kangaroos in the Mount Lofty Ranges eliminated because they are causing \u201cirreparable damage\u201d. Coming up The inquest into overdose deaths of six young people at music festivals in NSW continues in Sydney. The LNP\u2019s annual convention begins in Brisbane, with the state leader, Deb Frecklington, speaking this morning.
