Though her age meant she was considered a high-risk pregnancy, she was left alone for several hours without monitoring or pain medication. Nurses told Mart\u00ednez to be quiet and put up with the pain, while doctors mocked her mother, Nancy Ceron Diaz, denying her information about her daughter\u2019s condition. \u201cMy daughter was screaming, but it was only when her face turned green that she was transferred to the maternity hospital,\u201d says Diaz, 41. Mart\u00ednez\u2019s baby boy, who suffered asphyxia as a result of being trapped unaided in the cervix for hours, was left with permanent brain damage. Now 30 months old, he cannot sit unaided or eat solid food, and will need full-time care for the rest of his life. Mart\u00ednez\u2019s case, which dates back to January 2017, is among a growing number reported to Mexican human rights officials in an effort to hold hospitals to account for the violent treatment afforded mainly poor and indigenous women and girls when they give birth. Mart\u00ednez is from Tlapa, the biggest town in the rural La Monta\u00f1a region of Guerrero \u2013 one of Mexico\u2019s poorest states, with high rates of teenage pregnancy, infant and maternal mortality and gender-based violence. There were five maternal deaths in La Monta\u00f1a during the first three months of 2019, compared with nine in the entire preceding year. Obstetric violence is a legal term coined in Latin America to describe cruel, degrading and negligent treatment during pregnancy, childbirth and the postpartum period. Such treatment, which happens in both private and public hospitals, leads to unnecessary pain and suffering, humiliation, ill-health, sterility and even death. The prevalence of obstetric violence is unknown in Mexico \u2013 the same applies globally \u2013 but, according to the World Health Organization, teenagers, impoverished women, those living in rural areas, and women of colour are more likely to experience abusive treatment. In Mexico, the problem is historically rooted in racist health policies that systematically turned normal pregnancies into high-risk ones, according to medical historian Elizabeth O\u2019Brien. \u201cAs long as they got the baby out and baptised so it could become part of God\u2019s kingdom, the woman\u2019s life and her capacity to give birth in the future didn\u2019t matter,\u201d O\u2019Brien says. This pattern of medical care is ongoing. In 2013, images of an indigenous woman, Irma L\u00f3pez, giving birth in an Oaxaca hospital courtyard after being turned away by staff sparked outrage. Meanwhile, almost 50% of babies are delivered by caesarean in Latin America \u2013 a surgery that increases the risk of life-threatening complications for women \u2013 compared with an optimal rate of 10-15%, according to the World Health Organization. The general and maternity hospitals in Tlapa have officially endorsed zero-tolerance policies against discrimination, yet some women from communities without running water are denigrated for being unclean and refused attention until they bathe. Others are reprimanded for screaming in pain during labour, according to midwife Elizabeth Melgar, the clinical coordinator at the state school of midwifery. \u201cObstetric violence keeps happening, especially to indigenous women who don\u2019t speak Spanish,\u201d says Melgar Consuela Moreno, 32, went to hospital with a piercing headache, nausea and cold sweats, barely able to stand. Tests revealed that she was pregnant and Moreno, already the mother of two children, told the duty doctor something was very wrong. Her symptoms were dismissed as typical pregnancy complaints. After seven hours in the emergency room, Moreno begged her husband to take her home. \u201cI\u2019d rather die at home than here.\u201d Her husband says Moreno was mocked by the doctor, who insisted she was fine \u2013 until a colleague discovered her blood pressure was dangerously high. She was transferred to the maternity hospital and rushed to surgery with an ectopic pregnancy. It is unclear what happened in theatre, but doctors told the family that while Moreno wouldn\u2019t be able to have more children, she would recover. But Moreno never regained consciousness. She died a couple of days later, in December 2018, leaving the family devastated and questioning the care she received. \u201cNo one took her temperature or blood pressure for seven hours, they just let my wife die,\u201d says Fidel Leon, 56. \u201cI feel so guilty for not having money to take her to a private hospital. I feel so guilty for being poor.\u201d Neil Aria Vitinio, a lawyer from the Tlachinollan human rights centre in Tlapa, is representing several victims including Mart\u00ednez and Moreno. \u201cIn each case we see a lack of timely and adequate medical attention, no knowledge of emergency guidelines, no notes, and, often there is discrimination, inhumane and unethical treatment,\u201d she says. \u201cThis keeps happening \u2013 despite 10 years of recommendations to improve hospital infrastructure, staffing numbers and training \u2013 because there\u2019s no political will.\u201d The state human rights commission concluded Mart\u00ednez was subjected to obstetric violence, and made a series of recommendations. The guidance, which has yet to be accepted, included financial compensation and staff training. The failure to stamp out obstetric violence left teenager Griselda Romero unable to have more children. In June 2017, Romero, who asked for her name to be changed, was turned away from hospital on several occasions after midwives concluded her labour was not far enough advanced. Back home, her mother made a tea from epazote, or wormseed \u2013 a nutrient-rich herb commonly used in Mexican cooking. But the pain became unbearable, so they returned to hospital where midwives berated Romero\u2019s mother about the tea, claiming it had quickened the labour and caused complications. The baby girl was born healthy, but then a midwife accidentally pulled out Romero\u2019s uterus along with the placenta. Panicked, the team of midwives and nurses tried to reinsert the uterus three times. Romero was not offered pain relief at any stage during childbirth; nobody called her gynaecologist. \u201cShe had my uterus in her hands, I saw it, it was so painful,\u201d says Romero. \u201cOne midwife was crying, another one shouted at me to be quiet.\u201d Romero was eventually transferred to the maternal hospital for emergency surgery, where doctors performed a hysterectomy. \u201cThis wasn\u2019t my fault, it wasn\u2019t my mother\u2019s fault,\u201d says Romero, now 19, who recently testified at the national human rights commission, which is adjudicating her case. \u201cNobody has said sorry. I\u2019ll never have another child. I want them to apologise and recognise the damage they did.\u201d The general and maternity hospitals did not respond to repeated requests for comment."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
