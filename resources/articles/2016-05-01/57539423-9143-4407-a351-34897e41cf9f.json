Research by UHY Hacker Young, found the average income tax payment in Elmbridge, which includes the wealthy towns of Esher, Walton-on-Thames, Cobham and Weybridge, increased to \u00a317,800 in 2014, the latest figures available, up 5% from \u00a316,900 the previous year. The accountancy group said the average income of residents was \u00a364,500, up 8% from the 2013 figure and more than double the UK average of \u00a329,600. The study found that Windsor residents pay the next highest amount of income tax on average, \u00a314,000 a year, up 14% on the previous 12 months. Average gross incomes in the area that surround its castle are now \u00a355,300. On average UK residents pay around \u00a34,820 a year to the Treasury in income tax, according to the research. In recent years, Elmbridge has become \u201cthe area\u201d in which to buy for many of Britain\u2019s top sports stars and entertainers, leading to the moniker the \u201cBeverley Hills of Britain\u201d. Sir Elton John, Sir Cliff Richard, Sir Mick Jagger, John Terry and Andy Murray, are all among the number of celebrities who live or have lived in the area. Strong transport links with London and the proximity to Heathrow airport means it has also become a popular for wealthy Russians. UHY Hacker Young\u2019s Mark Giddens said: \u201cElmbridge is a sought after residential area for high earning celebrities and city brokers. With a number of huge properties with large private grounds, it is a hotspot for wealthy city workers wanting to escape London.\u201d UHY Hacker Young found that the stockbroker belt areas surrounding London, accounted for 26 out of the top 30 constituencies for highest average income tax bill. Only two of the top tax-paying constituencies were outside of the south\u2013east \u2013Altrincham and Tatton. Both have good transport links with Manchester and are well-known celebrity hotspots, home to many current or former Premiership footballers and managers including Sir Alex Ferguson, Peter Crouch and Rio Ferdinand. The average income tax bill in Altrincham is \u00a310,400 with a gross income of \u00a345,900, while in Tatton it is \u00a310,600 with a gross income of \u00a346,000. Giddens said: \u201cManchester is growing in importance to the UK economy and is seen as a good alternative business hub to London. The rising incomes in these areas indicate that Manchester\u2019s economy is going from strength to strength.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
