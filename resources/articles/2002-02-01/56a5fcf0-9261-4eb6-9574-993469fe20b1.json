The champions may have waltzed to victory on the quagmire against Sunderland last Saturday, but their slick approach play was still hampered at times on a stodgy surface which cut up badly as the game progressed. Sir Alex Ferguson has frequently voiced his concern at the state of the turf in recent months and described the pitch on Saturday as \"difficult at best\". There have already been 20 first-team games at Old Trafford this season - including two England internationals - and, with seven home league matches plus at least two European ties to come, the current surface will be torn up on Thursday following the FA Youth Cup tie with Rotherham United tomorrow. The new turf is likely to cost around \u00a3100,000 but will be ready for the home game against Aston Villa on February 23. \"We had always planned to replace the pitch in February of this year,\" said a United spokesperson; the current turf has withstood the most use of recent attempts. \"The present surface has been in place for two years now and has been used for almost 100 games in that period. \"This time last year it was in its worst condition, so we decided then that we would replace it in February of this year. Because of the size of the stands, it is difficult to get the sunlight we need to keep the pitch in good condition.\" United will be following Newcastle's lead by repairing the playing surface mid-season. The Tynesiders had intended to replace the St James' Park pitch last summer but their efforts were hampered by the club's late entry into the Intertoto Cup, which meant only temporary repairs during the close season. A section of the pitch in front of the Milburn stand was subsequently re-laid over the Chritstmas period with the rest replaced after the 3-1 win over Leeds on January 12. Newcastle also invested in a 35ft-high inflatable dome to cover the whole surface, protecting the pitch from the elements and regulating the interior temperature to allow the grass to take root and grow during the winter. \u00b7 Wales's international with Argentina will go ahead after an anxious day of waiting for confirmation from the South Americans. The FA of Wales received the fax confirming the fixture last night. The game will be played at Cardiff's Millennium stadium on February 13 and fans will be able to buy tickets from tomorrow from the stadium - not the FAW - and the Welsh capital's ticketline offices. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
