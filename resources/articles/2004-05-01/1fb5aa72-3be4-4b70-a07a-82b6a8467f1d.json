Cracking shot and the momentum is tilting England's way like a see-saw with Jodie Kidd at one end and that Feltz woman at the other. 64th over: England 180-3 \"There's no photo,\" says Alex Perkins, \"but I recall reading last year that the Hoff was found naked in his hotel room by a cleaner, with the door to the recently emptied mini-bar swinging in the wind.....\". 'A cleaner', eh? 65th over: England 181-3 Only one run off the last two overs. Fact. 66th over: England 185-3 (Hussain 39*, Thorpe 24*) Vettori into the rough outside leg stump pins Hussain down, but England get four byes when McCullum is nutmegged like Brian Kilcline in his inglorious prime. 67th over: England 189-3 Sir Alex would call it squeaky-bum time, but England are going along nicely as technical problems prevent me putting up a pic of David Hasselhoff showing his sensitive side by pawing two young Andrex pups. Cairns saves a four, flicks it onto himself and then back over the rope. Oh dear. 68th over: England 190-3 (Hussain 43*, Thorpe 28*) Some comedian has sent me a pic of Jimmy-Floyd Hasselbaink. You know who you are. There are 27 overs left to get 92 runs (or seven wickets), I'm unreliably informed. 69th over: England 192-3 (Hussain 44*, Thorpe 29*) This is like a Friday night on Rochester High Street - something's going to go off any minute. Only one run off that over, and England need 90 off 26, and Paddy Murphy has a question: \"Who could take The Hass's role in Knight Rider 2004. Suggestions anyone?\" 70th over: England 193-3 (Hussain 45*, Thorpe 29*) With Vettori spearing it wider and wider outside leg stump, Hussain storms down the track with murderous intent... and scuffs to midwicket for one. Right idea, though, and it brings up the fifty partnership. 71st over: England 196-3 (Hussain 47*, Thorpe 30*) England are getting 'em in singles - for now. The target is 86 off 24 overs.\"Where could one get a brown New Zealand shirt the supporters are wearing?\" asks Damo. I've been sad enough to have this same thought, and you can get them from all good stores, etc. \u00a335 apparently, and why not? 72nd over: England 198-3 England need to judge when they move up a gear very delicately here. And they need to do it very very soon. \"Hasselhoff is as entitled as any of us to sit in a hotel room, drinking heavily in the semi-darkness, naked, possibly watching Baywatch repeats and baying at the television,\" says Neil Jackson. \"Come on, we've all done it - haven't we?\" I think you know the answer Neil. 73rd over: England 210-3 (Hussain 49*, Thorpe 35*) That'll do! Thorpe chips Coldplay's Chris Martin down to third man for four - a much-needed boundary. Hussain, for his part, screams \"Nooooo!\" like a man who's just looked in the mirror and seen Michael Winner staring back at him, when Thorpe tries to steal another quick single. Then Martin bowls a diabolical full toss down leg side for four. Not even Dr Octopus could have stopped that. Twelve off the over. 74th over: England 211-3 (Hussain 50*, Thorpe 35*) Peter Counsell proffers Jeremy Clarkson for Knight Rider 2004, and Hussain reaches what might just be a career-saving 50. That's if he doesn't grind England to a draw for the next 20-odd overs. Thorpe survives - correctly - a huge shout for lbw by the mini-mulleted Vettori. 75th over: England 218-3 (Hussain 57*, Thorpe 35*) Hussain dances down the wicket like Sinitta in her prime and belts Martin over mid-on for four. Martin has been a big let-down in this game. 64 to win off 20 overs. Even I could do this. Switch your mobile on, Susie Ramsay. Ricky Martin says so. 76th over: England 220-3 (Hussain 58*, Thorpe 36*) Vettori is New Zealand's best hope of saving this; only two runs off that over and England are finding him difficult to get away. 77th over: England 223-3 (Hussain 59*, Thorpe 37*) Like Shane McGowan in a beauty competition, New Zealand are struggling here: England need 59 off 18 overs. \"Why does it take three of you to cover a day's cricket?\" asks Richard Preston, before disappointingly not launching into an Essex girl-type joke about Guardian workers. \"You must get so tired you poor things, watching the cricket, reading rubbish emails and typing a few glib comments.\" Maybe it's because of all those rubbish emails, Dickie? It's a dirty job, etc. 78th over: England 236-3 (Hussain 69*, Thorpe 39*) Slaphead analyst Simon Hughes has rightly pointed out that the two umpires have had a bit of a stormer in this game. Fair play, etc. Hussain does a passable impersonation of Freddie Flintoff and wallops Jacob Oram down the ground for four: 46 to win off 16 overs. England can't blow this. Can they? 80th over: England 243-3 (Hussain 71*, Thorpe 44*) An over's gone walkabout somewhere, as have New Zealand's hopes of getting anything out of this game. Century stand is up now, and everyone loves England's old gits again. More suggestions for Knight Rider 2004: Tim Burgess, from Peter Sadler (\"doesn't sweat much under hot lights\"), Joey from Friends, from someone whose email I've deleted, Ron Atkinson, from Joseph Beswick (\"garish, overweight and belongs to a different era\"), and GU's very own Nick Harper, from me. 81st over: England 246-3 (Hussain 74*, Thorpe 44*) This has been a top knock from Hussain, who was under huge pressure when he came to the crease, even more so when he triggered Strauss with that stupid run-out. England now need 36 runs off 14 overs, and I need a drink. \"The curly hair,\" says Nick Pettigrew a little over-dramatically. \"The chance for an ironic remake. The campness. Step forward Mr Ben Stiller.\" 82nd over: England 254-3 (Hussain 82*, Thorpe 44*) \"Fleming has taken the new ball, but even the best captain in the history of cricket will struggle to pull this round. England are cruising like men 12-0 up in a Chess marathon on a P&amp;O round-the-world tour. \"How about David Dickinson for Knight Rider 2004? asks David Owens \"Also, is it possible to get the score text messaged to me if I go to the pub before the end?\" That depends how many crisp pieces of paper you can send my way, David. 83rd over: England 260-3 (Hussain 87*, Thorpe 45*) Hussain could get a hundred here, which would be a great way of giving his critics the bird. James Seadon, meanwhile, is pimping Ged Houllier for Knight Rider 2004, although surely he makes a better Clouseau? 22 to win now. 84th over: England 264-3 (Hussain 91*, Thorpe 45*) Quiet over, but it doesn't matter because an England win is the biggest formality since Dennis Wise tried to maim allcomers on Saturday. \"Rubbish emails? We send you loads, and you never print them. Including this one,\" says Anton Lawrence, clearly deluding himself that I'm the sort of sucker who'd fall for that old chestn 85th over: England 270-3 (Hussain 92*, Thorpe 50*) Fifty for Thorpe, as crisp and classy as ever. Now, will he do what he didn't do against NZ in 1999 and let the bloke at the other end get a ton? England need 12, Hussain needs 8. 86th over: England 273-3 (Hussain 94*, Thorpe 51*) \"Can I tempt you with a shameless bribe?\" asks Paul Coupar. Is Ged Houllier unemployed? \"One evening's worth of disco fizz in return for you informing my little brother Patrick that the chicken-and-mushroom Pot Rice was mine, that the top dog is on top and that he ought to get to work to earn that 90 quid he owes me.\" So there. 87th over: ENGLAND WIN BY SEVEN WICKETS! And a hundred for Hussain as well. Martin is lofted over mid-on, then the next ball is driven brilliantly through the covers for four to bring up the hundred, and he finishes it off next ball. It looked tense this morning, but that was a crushing win in the end, and a glorious reaffirmation of all that is good about Nasser Hussain. A simply magnificent innings."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
