This week, the shops and streets were quiet during the day as people continued fasting for Ramadan. Tourists stayed away too, so Shereen Habib ran her renowned Bo-Kaap walking tour just for me. Shereen is something of a local landmark herself, and people stopped us every few minutes to chat. Her historical analysis is a tiny bit rehearsed, but walking round with her is a treat. Just before I left home, my dad cooked me a Cape Malay chicken curry. A couple of days after my tour with Shereen, I went back to the Bo-Kaap to compare his version with Mrs Abdul Rahman's at Biesmiellah restaurant. Again, the restaurant was like the grave, but the food was to die for. The only problem was the difficulty of talking about somewhere called Biesmiellah without lapsing into Freddie Mercury. Wherever I went in Cape Town, Table Mountain was in the corner of my eye, taunting me with the fact that I hadn't yet climbed it. On Thursday I cracked. Heeding the warnings to never climb alone, I posted a note in my hostel, asking for someone to join me on one of the easy routes. Cathy responded, fit as a flea from climbing Kilimanjaro and two months of overlanding. The day before, Cathy was swimming with sharks off the Cape while I was shopping for flip-flops in Shoprite. Cathy plumped for the slightly-less-easy Indiavinster route, and under the circumstances I think I did very well. Faced with a fairly sheer rockface, and a drop of hundreds of feet behind me, I nearly lost it, but Cathy got me through, although I was struck by the fact that it seemed a very tough climb for tourists. Three hours in, and almost at top of the mountain, we bumped into a family from Johannesburg coming the other way, who told us they were doing Indiavinster route too. Strange. And no, how odd, we hadn't noticed any yellow painted footprints marking the route. It finally dawned on us that not only had we gone off the track in a big way, but the route we had taken was one that probably required climbing equipment. In other words, we did exactly what everyone warns you not to do - and that kills a couple of tourists every year. Don't try this at home, but I was chuffed with myself for making it, and Cathy was a star. The cable car ride down is cool too, with the floor revolving 360 degrees as it goes. At only six minutes, it falls even faster that the rand. Softies can go use it to go up, too. After pounding the streets and mountains, on Wednesday I went to the pictures. Mr Bones is one of only two South African features released this year. A huge Christmas hit, it is firmly in the culture-clash caper style of all the South African films I have seen. All two of them. The title character, adviser to a Kuvuki tribal king, reads it in \"the bones\" that a visiting Afro-American professional golfer is the lost crown prince of the Kuvuki. So Mr Bones is sent to Sun City to fetch him. If you think that is high-concept, note that Mr Bones himself is the grown-up white child who the Kuvuki rescue from a plane crash in a pre-title sequence. The first image is a beetle pushing along another animal's fecal pellet, and the toilet humour continues apace. Every South African archetype gets it in the neck, and at one point a poor rhino gets someone's head up its arse. Why do we do things on holiday that we wouldn't dream of doing at home? Walking in the middle of the road is one. Or in my case, taking a pew at the Dignity and Diversity Inter-Faith service at Cape Town's Sacred Heart Church last week. The service launched Cape Town's Gay Pride week, with representatives of the Cape's Catholics, Muslims, Buddhists and Hindus offering their perspective on the gay thing. A dozen or so sorry-looking protestors from the regular congregation were picketing the service, their banners saying Do Not Desecrate What Is Sacred, and God Says Repent Not Gay Pride. They spookily murmured psalms and the Lord's prayer as we went in, then shuffled in behind us and lurked at the back. Clearly disappointed that there were no drag queens clacking up the church steps in heels, and that we were not taking holy communion with frozen margaritas, they left. I did roll my eyes myself when I saw the first \"hymn\" was I Am What I Am, but it was sung stupendously by a woman in full African robes and headgear, who pitched it somewhere between a aria and a showtune. There are saucy ads all over town for the big Pride party on Saturday, but the ubiquitous poster for Richard Cock is not one of them. That poor man really exists and is leading Carols By Candlelight in the park this weekend. There were dick jokes aplenty at Naked Boys Singing, the South African version of the Off Broadway hit that does exactly what it says on the tin. Supposedly a celebration of unadorned nudity, these Boys had still been shaved and plucked like chickens ready for the braai. And to help them compete with the air conditioning, the show's hairdresser had done the porn star's equivalent of a comb-over. Yes, there is a way of trimming your pubic hair to make your penis look longer. Here endeth this week's lesson. andrewnetjetter@hotmail.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
