The sombre, modal piece wove together recollections of Yiddish lullabies, Chassidic chants and a plaintive Polish folk song imploring the white stork \u2013 a symbol of good fortune \u2013 not to fly south for the winter. Though billed as a cello concerto, Hall\u00e9 harpist Marie Leenhardt played almost as much of an active role. Mark Elder placed her directly behind Cohen's shoulder, from where she rarely allowed the soloist a moment's peace; perhaps the true definition of harping on. Perplexingly, when the harp finally fell silent at the start of the third movement, a percussionist began battering out a Nielsenesque snare tattoo. Cohen played with gloriously lyrical tone, yet bore the slightly pained expression of an artist trying to concentrate through the distractions going on around him. Elder not only promotes promising young conductors, he shares the platform with them as well. Andrew Gourlay is the latest in an impressive roster of Hall\u00e9 assistant conductors that has included Rory Macdonald and Edward Gardner; and for his debut Gourlay chose a beguiling, rarely heard tone poem by Dvo\u0159\u00e1k, The Wild Dove. Towards the end of his life, Dvo\u0159\u00e1k crafted four \"orchestral ballads\" from a Czech collection of fairytales entitled The Garland. The White Dove is a lugubrious murder ballad, which Gourlay animated with haunting finesse. We will undoubtedly hear more from him. Why we don't hear more of Dvo\u0159\u00e1k's late ballads is a mystery. Broadcast on Radio 3 on 7 December at 7pm."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
