That\u2019s what you sign up for when you go to see Carr: a grubby pleasure that may be more grubby than pleasure. We know we shouldn\u2019t. We\u2019ll regret it afterwards. There\u2019s certainly no deviation tonight from the formula that\u2019s served Carr well \u2013 commercially if not always creatively \u2013 for 20 years: blue humour, playground abuse, jokes about rape and paedophilia, and (according to taste) just enough wit and joke-writing flair to keep the stench and squalor at bay. Who knows what need Carr\u2019s comedy is meeting in some of us for jokes about dwarves, fat women and FGM? Carr\u2019s closing apologia insists he doesn\u2019t mean to hurt anyone, that his material is \u201cjoyful\u201d in intent. And certainly there is some subversive joy in having humour applied to such subjects. Deep-rooted convention is destabilised when Carr appears to laugh at the Nazi extermination of Gypsies. We gasp at the flouted taboo, then laugh to recall that \u2013 here at least \u2013 there are no consequences. Or no immediate ones. But, even if you agree that all subjects are fair game for comedy, Carr\u2019s relentless downward kicking (\u201cIs a dwarf an abortion that made it?\u201d) argues that jokes about lesbians, Gypsies and sexual violence aren\u2019t just acceptable, but something \u2013 over two long hours \u2013 to revel in. Many of his one-liners are barely jokes at all, just boorish cliches about vegans being boring or Germany being humourless. And you can\u2019t miss the \u201cmy mother-in-law\u201d echoes in his battery of one-liners (some neat, all unlovely) that each begin, \u201cMy girlfriend \u2026\u201d By that stage, I wasn\u2019t feeling the joy. But then, joy isn\u2019t exclusively what Carr\u2019s humour is about. It\u2019s a mug\u2019s game trying to parse other people\u2019s laughter, but at some points \u2013 as with the applause that greets a weak joke championing the use of gendered sexual swearwords \u2013 there seems to be some free-at-last sense of escape at play from the liberal consensus on what we are and aren\u2019t supposed to say. It\u2019s immaterial to point out that Carr, like many other middle-aged male standups, broadcasters and columnists, has been saying this stuff for years and no one has censored or marginalised him yet. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way. Carr is perfectly capable of joking across wider territory \u2013 as with the pert gag about Meghan Markle\u2019s feminism. I did find this show a little funnier than its recent predecessors \u2013 the quality of the wordplay a mite higher, the thuggishness less relentless. Carr even briefly parks the trademark one-liners and tries his hand at observational comedy, although the routine \u2013 about how rubbish old tech (Blockbuster video, Yellow Pages) looks in contrast to the new \u2013 treads familiar standup ground. As with previous shows, there are vox pops, too, when the audience volunteer their own words for vagina and female masturbation. The results are not elevating. But elevation\u2019s not what we\u2019re here for. Carr has cornered the blue-humour market, delivering sordid comedy with relentless efficiency to people who find more joy in that than I do. And he shows no signs of surrendering it. \u2022 At Buxton Opera House, 18 June; Floral Pavilion, New Brighton, 19 June; then touring."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
