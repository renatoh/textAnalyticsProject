Middlesbrough\u2019s manager is in the upstairs canteen at Rockliffe Park, the club\u2019s training ground set in undulating parkland on the border between County Durham and North Yorkshire. Hidden away in a village south of Darlington and sharing its site with a luxury five-star spa hotel, Rockliffe tends to make Boro an \u201ceasy sell\u201d to prospective signings and, almost exactly three years ago, Karanka proved no different. \u201cWhen Steve Gibson, the chairman, saw my face the first time I came here he knew I wanted the job,\u201d said the former Real Madrid defender and, later, assistant manager under Jos\u00e9 Mourinho. \u201cI knew this was the right place to start my managerial career. After seeing this environment I knew I was lucky but the team wasn\u2019t good enough for everything we have here. Steve Gibson said: \u2018We have the facilities, the stadium, the crowd\u2019 \u2013 but he needed a team to fit.\u201d As Boro\u2019s first foreign manager, Karanka prevented potential relegation from the Championship in 2014 before presiding over play-off final disappointment the following season and automatic promotion in May. His side are holding their own in the Premier League and entertain Chelsea on Sunday on the back of draws at Manchester City and Arsenal and a home win against Bournemouth. Along the way, the once halting English which made his media unveiling in 2013 rather excruciating has been replaced by an ease and fluency that led to him serving as an ITV studio pundit during England\u2019s friendly against Spain on Tuesday. No longer a new boy, the 43-year-old Basque is the fifth-longest-serving manager currently working in the Premier League. \u201cThat\u2019s a reflection of how tough football is,\u201d he reflects. \u201cI\u2019m so lucky to have Steve Gibson.\u201d The fear among Boro fans is that Karanka regards the club as a stepping stone in much the same way that, a decade ago, the then extremely ambitious Steve McClaren did. \u201cIt\u2019s always difficult to look too far into the future,\u201d he says, slightly cautiously. \u201cYou never know what might happen. \u201cIf we\u2019d lost to Arsenal, Bournemouth and Manchester City, what would have happened to me? I don\u2019t know. If results are bad, we know what\u2019s possible. Football\u2019s all about results. You can never get comfortable in this job, never. \u201cI can\u2019t think about what will happen in three, four weeks. I\u2019d be making a mistake if I were to think that two or three years ahead I could achieve this or that. Football doesn\u2019t work like that. As a player you have dreams but, as a coach, it\u2019s different. \u201cLooking too far ahead can be a big mistake. But, if I can be here long term, that\u2019s good; it means I\u2019m doing the job right and the club\u2019s progressing.\u201d Stability is clearly attractive. \u201cRight now, I feel it would be difficult, if not impossible to find another club like this because of the relationship I have with the chairman, the relationships I have with everybody,\u201d he acknowledges. \u201cIn Spain, also there are not many clubs like this one. Maybe Bilbao \u2013 but you cannot always find a Bilbao or a Middlesbrough. \u201cHere, the chairman\u2019s my friend; I don\u2019t think there are many managers in the Premier League who can call their chairman a friend. In the worst moments, knowing you have a very good relationship, that\u2019s when it really means something special.\u201d If Gibson remains a model of consistency, Karanka is much altered from the sometimes impatient, invariably intense, figure who arrived from Madrid. In part this evolution to a slightly more relaxed, measured demeanour has been a gradual metamorphosis but it is hard not to regard his mini-meltdown last March \u2013 when he was briefly suspended after a stormy training session, and missed a defeat at Charlton \u2013 as a catalyst. \u201cYes, I\u2019ve changed,\u201d he says. \u201cI have learned so much in these three years. I\u2019m a lot calmer now. With experience, you learn to react in a better way, be more patient.\u201d As he chats, lightheartedly, to the left-back George Friend and jokes with the winger Adama Traor\u00e9, Karanka seems very different from his sometimes rather stern, robotic public image. Moreover it appears that the moments of creative tension as Boro strove for promotion and he endeavoured to rouse a once quiet, noncombative dressing room have passed. \u201cEvery day my family and I are more pleased to have come here,\u201d he says with the conviction of a true anglophile. Three years ago his young son and daughter spoke only Spanish. \u201cToday their English is perfect,\u201d reports Karanka. \u201cThey have posh North Yorkshire accents and they love it here. It\u2019s a lovely area.\u201d Independence is evidently suiting the man once routinely labelled Mourinho\u2019s \u201cformer assistant\u201d. \u201cWorking with Jos\u00e9 is part of my past and I can\u2019t deny it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re still really good friends. But now I have to change that story with my own achievements.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
