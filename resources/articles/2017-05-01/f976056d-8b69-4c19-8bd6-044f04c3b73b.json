For the first time in 60 years, a British political party is receiving close to an absolute majority \u2013 50% \u2013 in the opinion polls. The last leader to achieve this was Harold Macmillan, who won 49.4% in 1959. No one has matched his achievement \u2013 Harold Wilson came closest with just under 48% in 1966, while Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair won three elections each without topping 45%. If the polls hold, May could surpass them all. This is not how party politics is supposed to work now. The class divides and tribal attachments that dominated 1950s politics are supposed to be a thing of the past, replaced by a more atomised and individualised society, with more fragmented and fluid politics. The era of two-party politics is over, we were told. Breaking 40% is the most a party can aim for and usually all it needs. The influx of Ukip supporters won over by May\u2019s embrace of Brexit has played a key role in this resurgence, but just as important, though less remarked upon, has been her party\u2019s ability to retain support despite a radical shift in policy. Most of the middle-class, pro-EU and socially liberal voters who backed David Cameron two years ago seem willing to stick with the socially conservative, pro-Brexit May \u2013 much to the Liberal Democrats\u2019 disappointment. A 50% coalition in a diverse society must, by arithmetic necessity, assemble a very broad range of voters. How are the Conservatives holding this huge coalition together? Nationalism is one powerful political glue and the prominence of the coming tussles between Britain and Europe has helped May to mobilise it. Strong and popular leadership is another tried and tested way to expand support \u2013 and May\u2019s lead over Jeremy Corbyn in opinion poll ratings is as large as any leader has enjoyed since polling records began. This combination is helping against other opponents, too. Tim Farron has discovered the emotional appeal of Europe is not widely shared, while in Scotland the Conservatives under Ruth Davidson are prospering by reviving the cause of the Union. The Conservatives are spreading out as they grow. Analysis by the pollsters YouGov suggests the party is gaining most ground where it starts weakest \u2013 in the traditional Labour stronghold of north-east England and marginal-heavy regions of the Midlands and the north-west. Our first-past-the-post electoral system is exceptionally kind to parties who spread very high support levels evenly \u2013 just ask Nicola Sturgeon. In 2015, her SNP managed to spread its 50% support well enough across Scotland to win nearly everywhere, converting half of Scotland\u2019s vote into 95% of the seats. If May manages to pull off the Heineken trick \u2013 reaching the parts of the country other Tory leaders couldn\u2019t \u2013 then, like Sturgeon, she could win in places Conservatives haven\u2019t represented since the Depression. Labour heartland seats such as Wakefield (Labour since 1932), Mansfield (Labour since 1923), Workington (Labour in general elections since 1918) could fall. The new Conservative coalition is broader than any in decades, but it is also fragile, driven by impossibly high expectations. The reality of Brexit is certain to let down some Conservative voters; either former Ukippers will be unhappy with compromises they will see as \u201cBrexit betrayal\u201d, or liberal centrists will become disaffected with the economic disruption and nationalist rhetoric of \u201chard Brexit\u201d. Division and decline could set in quite quickly, as the reality of the massive change coming sinks in. A reinvigorated Labour opposition, united behind a more popular and effective leader, could well bounce back in such conditions \u2013 particularly in areas which have long cultural links to the party. While May\u2019s coalition of support may fall apart, it will leave behind useful resources for tougher times. Conservative incumbents in formerly marginal seats will be left with majorities large enough to deter opponents. Newly elected MPs will have an opportunity to build a personal vote, something most do with some success, which will help them survive a renewed challenge from Labour. This proved immensely important for both Blair in 2001 and Cameron in 2015, when in both cases many new incumbents accrued large enough personal votes to hold on despite a national swing against their party. This broad coalition will also bring lasting change to the electoral terrain. The Lib Dems could be further expunged from the south of England, where Labour are already moribund, creating in effect a one-party state in much of the home counties. Conservative resurgence in Scotland could further realign that nation as a battleground between nationalists and unionists. Voters backing Tory candidates in many Labour heartlands will be breaking with decades-old tribal attachments and ending generations of local Labour dominance. Once the habit is broken, they may find a second Tory vote easier to cast. If the Conservatives\u2019 once-in-a-lifetime electoral coalition holds together on 8 June, the next election will be fought on a political map unlike any we have seen before.
