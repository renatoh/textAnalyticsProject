According to the fight\u2019s distributer, Triller, more than 1.6m pay-per-view purchases were made for the Tyson-Jones fight, making it one of the biggest PPV events of all time. Tyson is reported to have earned $10m and Jones $3m for last month\u2019s bout, which ended in a draw. The financial success of the fight caught the attention of Holyfield, who has fought Tyson twice. Their first meeting, in 1996, ended in victory for Holyfield. When the pair met a year later Tyson was disqualified after biting his opponent\u2019s ear. \u201cWe\u2019ve definitely had conversations, and it looks like it\u2019s gonna happen,\u201d Holyfield told TMZ last weekend. \u201cI\u2019m a very confident person, so I think it\u2019s gonna happen. Let\u2019s do it, baby. Simple as that, let\u2019s do it.\u201d The prospect of two men in late middle age fighting is unedifying for many boxing fans \u2013 Holyfield is 58 \u2013 but aging fighters have shown more willingness in recent years for pay-per-view events that can earn them millions. On Sunday, Floyd Mayweather, who is 43, announced he will fight YouTube star Logan Paul in an exhibition in February. Mayweather is thought to have earned more than $100m for his pay-per-view fight against UFC star Conor McGregor in 2017."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
