Meyers was speaking at a conference organised by the Producers Guild of America. She was responding to a question from Late Night\u2019s Mindy Kaling about criticism of the upscale domestic milieux of Meyers\u2019s films, particularly It\u2019s Complicated, the 2009 relationship comedy starring Meryl Streep, Alec Baldwin and Steve Martin, and the Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton romantic comedy Something\u2019s Gotta Give, released in 2003. The Guardian\u2019s chief film critic Peter Bradshaw described It\u2019s Complicated as \u201ccrack-cocaine-strength gastro-lifestyle fantasy porn\u201d, and called Something\u2019s Gotta Give \u201chorrifically icky\u201d and \u201cunspeakably acted\u201d. Meyers said: \u201cI don\u2019t love when a journalist or critic will pick up on that aspect [of the film\u2019s design], because they\u2019re missing why it works. It\u2019s never done to male directors who make gorgeous movies, or where the leads live in a gorgeous house.\u201d She added: \u201cBut I\u2019m not going to change it.\u201d Kaling cited the Wes Anderson film The Grand Budapest Hotel as a contrast, saying the treatment of Meyers\u2019s films was pejorative by comparison. The Grand Budapest Hotel was nominated for nine Oscars in 2015, winning four categories, including best production design, best costume design, and best makeup and hairstyling."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
