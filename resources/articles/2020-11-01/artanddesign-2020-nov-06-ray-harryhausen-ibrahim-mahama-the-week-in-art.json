Image of the week In the week of the US presidential election, the British Museum announced that an edition of Jasper Johns\u2019 Flags I (1973) had been given to them by the New York-based collectors Johanna and Leslie Garfield. Said to be worth at least $1m (\u00a3770,000), it is one of the most valuable modern prints ever donated to the museum. Catherine Daunt, a curator of modern and contemporary art, said: \u201cThis is a hugely important print. It is beautiful, complex and technically a great achievement.

Masterpiece of the week The Entombment, about 1500-1501, by Michelangelo This is one of Michelangelo\u2019s first paintings. He made his name in sculpture, studying at Lorenzo de\u2019 Medici\u2019s garden academy in Florence where he is said to have delighted Lorenzo with an imitation of a classical faun\u2019s face. His early sculptures, including The Battle of the Centaurs and Bacchus, brilliantly turn classicism into a dark and romantic art of self-expression. In this stab at painting, though, he\u2019s much more hesitant. You can see the influence of his senior, Botticelli, in the graceful faces and dance-like movements of Christ\u2019s mourners. But his sense of space is utterly original as Christ\u2019s body seems to float rather than slumping in a world lighter than air. From this experiment Michelangelo would go on a decade later to paint the Sistine Ceiling with vertigo-inducing freedom. \u2022 National Gallery, London.
