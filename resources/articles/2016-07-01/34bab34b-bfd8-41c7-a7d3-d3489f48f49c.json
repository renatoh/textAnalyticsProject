The Rolling Stones, a teenage David Bowie, Rod Stewart, Eric Clapton, the Who and Pink Floyd all first found regular audiences in this hidden haven. The venue was Eel Pie Island: a tiny enclave in the middle of the river Thames at Twickenham, which is now claiming its place in Britain\u2019s cultural history. A museum dedicated to the island\u2019s past glory as the centre of a British R&amp;B boom is set to have a permanent home. Curator Michele Whitby has been promised \u00a38,000 from the London mayor\u2019s office and now has until next month to raise another \u00a34,000 on a crowdfunding site to see her scheme come to life. \u201cI want to run a museum just a stone\u2019s throw from the island itself, in Twickenham\u2019s main street,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople describe Eel Pie Island as like nowhere else and so seven years ago I wrote a book about it. Now I have a fantastic wealth of material to share.\u201d Whitby, 49, now lives on a boat moored to the island, but first arrived on its shores aged 21, when she rented space for a photographic studio. \u201cThe Stones had 15 dates here early in their career and were paid around \u00a345 for a gig; good money then, although you could not get tickets to see them for that now,\u201d said Whitby. \u201cI made a montage of photographs of the band from 1963 and sent it to them. It came back signed by them all \u2018to Eel Pie Island\u2019.\u201d Once known as Twickenham Ait, the island takes its current name from the snacks once sold to passing traders from its banks. It was a leisure destination as early as the beginning of the 17th century and a map of 1635 marks a plot of land with \u201chath bin A Boulding Alley\u201d. Henry VIII is said to have used it for discreet courting. With the construction of the grand, three-storey Eel Pie Island hotel in 1830 it became a popular holiday destination for the rest of London. But its modern influence dates from the launch of the Eelpiland dance club in 1956. When an arched footbridge to the mainland was built a year later, clubbers paid fourpence admission and were wrist-stamped as they queued to join dancers in the ballroom adjoining the neglected hotel. They were given a passport instead of a ticket, underlining the notion that different social rules prevailed. The passport read: \u201cWe request and require, in the name of His Excellency Prince Pan, all those whom it may concern to give the bearer of this passport any assistance he/she may require in his/her lawful business of jiving and generally cutting a rug. Given under our hand this first day of November 1963 PAN Prince of Trads.\u201d For Whitby, and for older fans who saw the Stones or Eric Clapton play, Eelpiland is the birthplace of a youth movement, comparable to the Cavern Club in Liverpool, the Wigan Casino, the pubs of Canvey Island or the Hacienda in Manchester. \u201cFans used to have to get there by ferry before they built the bridge and even then there was very little residential accommodation here,\u201d said Whitby. \u201cIt was all boatyards. They thought the police would find it more difficult to come over and so they were free to make more noise.\u201d Last year Whitby put together artefacts and memorabilia for a pop-up museum, housed in two rooms in Twickenham library. It also told the story of the remarkable Arthur Chisnall, the antiques dealer and philanthropist who set up the club. He started by booking trad jazz stars, such as Acker Bilk and George Melly, at the weekends, but the bar and large, sprung dance floor also made it suitable for rock\u2019n\u2019roll gigs. Chisnall, a pipe-smoking guru in tweed, booked visiting American blues stars such as Buddy Guy and Howlin\u2019 Wolf. \u201cArthur really was the centre of it,\u201d said Whitby. \u201cHe was not a massive music fan, but was fascinated by young people and their problems in a genuine way. A lot of people have told me that he changed their lives for the better.\u201d The pop-up museum contained a recreation of Arthur\u2019s living room in nearby Strawberry Hill, with his original desk. In June 1961, on the club\u2019s fifth birthday, he was interviewed by the News of the World. \u201cThis place started as a jazz club. Now it is one of the biggest political discussion centres in this part of greater London. There are 8,386 members. The bands only play at weekends. During the week the members jam the bar \u2026 while discussing all sorts of serious topics. We are not tied down to any one line of political thought,\u201d he said. By the end of Chisnall\u2019s reign the club had also welcomed the Yardbirds, John Mayall\u2019s Bluesbreakers, the Tridents with Jeff Beck, and Long John Baldry and his Hoochie Coochie Men, featuring Rod Stewart. In his 1998 autobiography, All the Rage, Ian McLagan, keyboard-player with the Small Faces and the Faces, recalled supporting the Stones at Eelpiland and first meeting Rod \u201cThe Mod\u201d Stewart, dressed up and \u201con the pull\u201d. \u201cIt was one of the best places to hear blues bands at the weekends,\u201d McLagan wrote. Chisnall lived on until 2006, but lack of funds closed down his club in the late 1960s. Threatened with demolition, it briefly reopened as Colonel Barefoot\u2019s Rock Garden, when Black Sabbath and Pink Floyd performed. But eventually squatters and anarchists took over and the hotel was home to 100 hippies. \u201cOne particularly cold winter, squatters started cannibalising the building for firewood and in 1970 it was pretty much destroyed by fire,\u201d said Whitby. The coveted homes of the 1970s residential block Aquarius now stand on the site, surrounded by a small community of artists living and working in former boathouses. The maverick inventor of the wind-up radio, Trevor Bayliss, is a proud local and would surely approve of Chisnall\u2019s vision for the island: \u201cYou must realise that what goes on here is the expression of the latent desire among the young to get away from mass media and regimentation,\u201d he said during Eelpiland\u2019s heyday."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
