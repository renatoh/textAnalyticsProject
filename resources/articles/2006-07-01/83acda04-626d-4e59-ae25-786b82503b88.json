One tale and one city is Edinburgh, where Scottish politics have their own dynamic; the other city in this particular equation is London, full of feverish speculation, absorbed by the quite different question of when Blair will go. But the two, linked cities that cry hardest for attention now are the cities where devolution's pull is fiercest, where nationalism exerts the next stage of logic. Welcome to Madrid (approached via Barcelona). It's fascinating to visit Edinburgh and then go on to the capital of Catalonia, as I've done in the past few weeks. One is busy with devolved politics and preparing for elections next May which - on current forecasts - will make a Scot Nat first minister in Holyrood. The other, having extracted far greater powers and the legal language of \"nationhood\" from Spanish central government, is settling down for another round of elections this year. Is devolution on this level a point where the separating can stop? Is the current Catalan settlement a perfect model for much of Europe (including Scotland)? Is there, in sum, a steady state for mini-states within a state? That's where a weekend in Madrid raises such doubt. The Catalan moderates who, in Barcelona, thought the latest deal a decent, stable bargain are replaced here by Castilian moderates who fear something much worse. They don't see the thirst for independence - in the Basque country or Catalonia - being quenched for long. They see events being driven ever onwards until the final question is put. And it's a terrible contradiction, they say. The more we live in a globalised world without economic borders, the greater the desire to live in little national boxes. There are special factors in play here, to be sure. One is language, the driving force both of Franco's repression of the Catalans and modern Catalonia's separation. Can you (my Castilian friends ask) teach Catalan first and best in Catalan public schooling without condemning a generation of young people to speak and write Castilian too poorly to fit them for jobs in the rest of Spain? A Spanish editor says gravely that already he can't hire the young Catalan reporters he needs because their language skills are inferior. Here's the slippery slope towards less investment and gradual economic decline. Here are the ties that should bind being torn apart. Now, you may think this pretty alarmist - and you may certainly think that it will come to pass, if at all, far more gradually than the gloomsayers of Madrid prophesy. When they talk about France and residual Spain vetoing Catalan or Basque membership of the EU, you can see an issue spiralling beyond rational analysis. But that's not quite the end of the story. For most of the past decade, devolution has been a bit of bore for residual England. It was all happening up there - or over there. Our frustration was more about Belfast's continuing failure to govern itself than over Edinburgh and Cardiff's assumption of that burden. But all benign things come to an end. I'm impressed by the success the Scots have made of running their own affairs. If they wanted to do much more, within the EU, that would surely be possible in the end - with Dublin on hand to guide. Nationalism isn't always destructive. But it is dangerous wherever treated carelessly, whenever left to the fiercest believers. Is David Cameron right to stir this murky pot? Will a Scottish PM in London be best - or worst - placed to deal with it? Why should London want Blair to go before next May, so that Gordon Brown does indeed have that crisis on his hands straight away? The difficulty is how completely two cities, and two perspectives, fail to meet. The difficulty is Madrid as well as Barcelona. p.preston@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
