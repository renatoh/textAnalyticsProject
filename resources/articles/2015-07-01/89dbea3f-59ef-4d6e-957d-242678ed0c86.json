The plan includes sweeping chnages to VAT to raise a full 1 percent of GDP, moving more items to the 23% top rate of tax, including restaurants - a key battleground before. Greece has also dropped its opposition to abolishing the lower VAT rate on its islands, starting with the most popular tourist attractions, despite firm opposition from Tsipras\u2019s coalition partner. Athens also appears to have made significant concessions on pensions, agreeing to phase out solidarity payments for the poorest pensioners by December 2019, a year earlier than planned. It would also raise the retirement age to 67 by 2022. And it has agreed to only raise corporation tax to 28%, as the IMF wanted, not 29% as previously targeted. Greece is also proposing to cut military spending by \u20ac100m in 2015 and by \u20ac200m in 2016, and implement changes to reform and improve tax collection and fight tax evasion. It will also press on with privatisation of state assets including regional airports and ports; some government MPs had vowed to reverse this. In return, Greece appears to be seeking a three-year loan deal worth \u20ac53.5bn. Two obvious questions -- will this still be enough for creditors, or will they push for even tougher \u201cconditionality\u201d now we\u2019re talking about a new bailout programme. And how will Alexis Tsipras persuade his party, including the hardline Radical Left, to support it? We may find out both questions on Friday, so tune in then. Goodnight! GW The Greek proposal doesn\u2019t appear to cover debt relief. But apparently, Athens has also released one of its \u2018non-papers\u2019 to the media, explaining that they are also seeking \u201cregulation\u2019 of debt\u201d and the \u20ac35bn investment package promised by Jean-Claude Juncker. A round of applause for Greek newspaper Naftemporiki, who has uploaded the full proposal: The Greek reform proposals It does appear that Greece has, errr, compromised rather substantially: Hot out of Brussels, the Greek proposal is starting to leak. And it shows that Greece is promising to hit the surplus targets demanded by its creditors, after months of resistance And here\u2019s how they\u2019ll do it: And finally (probably), the first reactions are already coming in from outraged leftists following news of the new measures, says Helena. The communist party has called on supporters to attend a mass rally in Omonia Square at 7pm (5pm BST) on Friday to protest \u201cthe barbaric memorandum.\u201d \u201cFight now to cancel the plans to pauperise the people,\u201d it declared in a statement released in the last five minutes. \u201cLet\u2019s say NO to the barbaric memorandum.\u201d Time to dig out the OXI signs again? Panic over! A signed copy of the Greek proposal has landed in Brussels. So what happens now? Over to Athens..... Our correspondent Helena Smith has confirmed that the proposed reforms have indeed been sent to the country\u2019s creditors - and three hours AHEAD of the midnight deadline central European time. Government insiders are saying the proposals were sent at 1OPM Greek time (9 PM central European time) to all three creditors and the president of the Euro Group of euro area finance ministers Jeroen Dijsselbloem. The Dutch finance minister must sign off on the reforms before they are submitted for further discussion to EU leaders. The proposed package - a biting mix of tax hikes and swingeing cutbacks - was tabled in parliament as an emergency bill on Thursday. It will, say officials, be put to vote on Friday evening in order to invest the Greek prime minister, his deputy Yannis Dragasakis and finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos with the appropriate authority to conduct talks around the proposed reforms. Until a cast-iron agreement is reached, the vote will not be binding - rather is is aimed exclusively at furnishing the central protagonists in Greece\u2019s negotiating team with the authority to debate with creditors around the proposed reforms. Once negotiations are completed it will become law. After several drama-filled days, replete with apocalyptic scenarios, a ray of hope was seen tonight. The vast majority in Tsipras\u2019 radical left Syriza party accept that chaos lies the other way. But the devil will be in the detail. Panagiotis Lafazanis, who heads Syriza\u2019s militant wing, the Left Platform, has already expressed his wholehearted opposition to the proposed plan saying it fails to give any hope of a breakthrough to the Greek economic crisis. The Left Platform represents about a third of the party. Zoe Konstantopoulou, the president of the parliament and a member of Syriza\u2019s hard left herself, has publicly announced that no new memorandum outlining further austerity will be passed by the 300 seat House. Although, Konstantopoulou has just spent 3.5 hours with Tsipras.... and has left his office refusing to make any comment! Ah, there may be a hitch... Eurogroup president Dijsselbloem\u2019s spokesman has confirmed that the Greek bailout plan has arrived! Sounds like the Greek proposal has been fired across to Brussels; if so, that\u2019s AHEAD of the midnight deadline. Here\u2019s our latest news story about tonight\u2019s developments: Greece debt crisis: Athens accepts harsh austerity as bailout deal nears The Greek government capitulated on Thursday to demands from its creditors for severe austerity measures in return for a modest debt write-off, raising hopes that a rescue deal could be signed at an emergency meeting of EU leaders on Sunday. Athens is understood to have put forward a package of reforms and public spending cuts worth \u20ac13bn (\u00a39.3bn) to secure a third bailout from creditors that could raise $50bn and allow it to stay inside the currency union. A cabinet meeting signed off the reform package after ministers agreed that the dire state of the economy and the debilitating closure of the country\u2019s banks meant it had no option but to agree to almost all the creditors terms. Parliament is expected to endorse the package after a frantic few days of negotiation that followed a landmark referendum last Sunday in which Greek voters backed the radical leftist Syriza government\u2019s call for debt relief. Syriza, which is in coalition with the rightwing populist Independent party, is expected to meet huge opposition from within its own ranks and from trade unions and youth groups that viewed the referendum as a vote against any austerity. More here: A group of pro-EU demonstrators have gathered outside the Greek parliament tonight: Friday will be busy.... International observers have been telling us today that the package is likely to be so punitive that humanitarian aid cannot be ruled out. EU president Jean Claude Juncker had mentioned humanitarian aid as part of the \u201cdetailed Grexit scenario\u201d plans creditors had drawn up. EU diplomats based in Athens said some form of assistance is likely to be given even if am agreement between Greece its creditors is reached. Syriza MPs have been telling our Helena Smith that the big no received in the referendum on Sunday was a \u201cconfidence vote\u201d in Tsipras who like no other prime minister before now has the popular support to enforce such punitive measures. That is not how the far far left (or indeed the far left in Syriza) see things. Strikes, rallies and protests should be expected in weeks ahead. We don\u2019t yet know the details of Greece\u2019s plan, but one report says there will be \u20ac13bn of fresh austerity. A heavy blow for the economy after years of recession, and the current banking shutdown. The irony has not been lost on anyone - even though governing MPs are making light of it - that after the Greeks\u2019 resounding rejection of further biting austerity at the weekend, prime minister Alexis Tsipras has with lightning speed now agreed to put his name to the most punitive austerity package any government has been asked to implement during the five years of economic crisis in Greece. Breaking news in Athens. In an emergency meeting the Greek government has approved the package of measures it will present to creditors (hopefully later this evening) to break the impasse and reach an agreement, our correspondent Helena Smith reports. A senior Syriza MP has just told me that the radical left party\u2019s parliamentary group has been \u201casked to be on standby\u201d to vote on the package possibly as early as tomorrow. \u201cWe have all been told to be here. We may have to vote on it tomorrow,\u201d he said. The defence minister who leads the right-wing populist Independent Greeks party, the government\u2019s junior partner, has also just said: \u201cVery shortly the Greek proposal will be tabled.\u201d Time for a recap The Greek government is furiously scrambling to draw up a credible package of economic reforms to deliver to its creditors before midnight tonight, ahead of Sunday meetings that will decide its future in the eurozone. French officials are providing \u201cinvaluable support\u201d to Greece, we hear. Greek media claim that the plan could include up to \u20ac12bn of tax rises and spending cuts, more than expected. One Syriza MP has told us that he\u2019s optimistic about a deal for the first time in weeks. And Ireland\u2019s Michael Noonan has suggested there\u2019s a better than 50% chance of a deal. But there are also signs of tension in the Greek coalition. Panagiotis Lafazanis, the energy minister and influential hard-leftist, has ruled out a new tough austerity package. And Mario Draghi, the ECB chief, has warned that reaching a Greek deal is \u201creally difficult\u201d this time. European Council president Donald Tusk has thrown his weight behind calls for Greece to be given the debt relief which the IMF says is essential. Tusk said that if Greece provides a realistic proposal, then \u201cit will need to be matched by an equally realistic proposal on debt sustainability by the creditors\u201d. Tusk tweeted his message too: And threw in a bit of Latin: That\u2019s \u201cThrift is a great revenue\u201d, \u2018pparently. Tusk\u2019s comments pile more pressure on eurozone hard-liners to face up to Greece\u2019s need for debt relief. But Germany\u2019s chancellor Angela Merkel has warned that Greece cannot receive a \u2018classic haircut\u2019 on its loans. And finance minister, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble, has echoed this point, telling an audience in Frankfurt that: \u201cDebt sustainability is not feasible without a haircut and I think the IMF is correct in saying that.... There cannot be a haircut because it would infringe the system of the European Union.\u201d Sch\u00e4uble has also pushed back at US interference: Europe\u2019s stock markets have jumped by 2% today, partly on hopes of a Greek resolution soon. As analysts at City firm Jefferies explain: By Monday morning, hopefully, it should be pretty clear whether or not Greece is staying in the euro area \u2013 at least for the next few months. It seems very unlikely that over the next 72 hours the two sides will bridge the gap between Tsipras\u2019 desire for a debt write-down and the Europeans\u2019 reluctance to offer anything up-front without Greece actually implementing (as opposed to promising to implement) reforms. So a long-term deal seems illusive, but a short-term bridging loan allowing Greece to pay the IMF and, most importantly, the ECB on 20 July (the following Monday), could be on offer. And the weekend is going to be busy, with eurozone finance ministers meeting on Saturday: Followed by leaders on Sunday: European commission vice-president Valdis Dombrovskis has confirmed that Greece\u2019s lenders are working on a debt sustainability analysis, ready for the weekend. In Spain, a video is doing the rounds shows Greek prime minister Alexis Tsipras -- whether intentionally or not -- snubbing his Spanish anti-austerity ally, Podemos\u2019 Pablo Iglesias. The video, shot as Tsipras visited the European parliament on Wednesday, shows the Syriza leader greeting politicians. As Iglesias puts his hand on Tsipras\u2019 shoulder and holds out his other hand, Tsipras instead turns to French MEP Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon. Thousands have shared the video on social media, asking whether the gesture was intentional or simply an oversight by Tsipras. On Monday, Iglesias welcomed the results of the Greek referendum, but sought to dampen any speculation that Spain would follow in the footsteps of Greece. \u201cWe have a great friendship with Syriza, but luckily, Spain is not Greece,\u201d Iglesias told local media. \u201cThe circumstances are different and it makes no sense to draw parallels.\u201d Mr Sch\u00e4uble is in a witty moody today.... Don\u2019t take the offer, Jack - the Puerto Rico default is bad, but not as bad as Greece. Woah! Back in Frankfurt, Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble has said the IMF is correct that Greece needs a haircut make its debt sustainable; but alas this isn\u2019t possible under European rules. Sch\u00e4uble also played down the significance of \u2018reprofiling\u2019 Greece\u2019s debt mountain (eg, by extending maturities) Spotted: Greece\u2019s new finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, chatting with his predecessor Yanis Varoufakis in the Athens parliament today. French finance minister Michel Sapin has also weighed in on the Greek crisis. Reuters has the details: \u201cBalanced budgetary strategies are necessary and efforts are needed to boost investment,\u201d Sapin told a conference in Frankfurt. \u201cWe must find the right balance between indispensable budgetary consideration and boosting growth.\u201d Regarding Greece, Sapin said there was a need to rebuild confidence and trust to find a solution to the current crisis Over in Frankfurt, German finance minister Wolfgang Sch\u00e4uble called for the eurozone to be strengthened to avoid a repeat of the Greek crisis. Sch\u00e4uble warned: \u201cA monetary union constructed like ours is nothing but an invitation for somebody that doesn\u2019t stick to the rules and that\u2019s called moral hazard.\u201d Sch\u00e4uble added that Greece can\u2019t expect any help until it\u2019s taken \u2018prior actions\u2019, and there\u2019s no sign of that yet. Hopefully Greece\u2019s new proposal, due by midnight, will illuminate that point. For all its concern about Greece\u2019s debt sustainability, the IMF isn\u2019t planning to offer any relief itself. Olivier Blanchard, its outgoing chief economist, has pointed out that poorer countries (Fund members themselves) haven\u2019t received the kind of treatment Athens is seeking: Gloomy news from the IMF: They\u2019ve just cut their global growth forecasts. They now expect world GDP to rise by 3.3% this year, down from 3.5% back in April. For once, the eurozone doesn\u2019t get the blame -- instead, the Fund has slashed its growth forecasts for the US and Canada, and also predicted slower growth in Japan and the UK. Angela Merkel has ruled out slashing the face value of Greece\u2019s government debt, during a visit to Bosnia today. Reuters has the details: \u201cIn 2012 we dealt with the issue of debt sustainability. We stretched out the maturities, we pushed back the repayment requirement for EFSF loans out to 2020. So we are not dealing with debt sustainability for the first time,\u201d Merkel said when asked about differences with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over a debt writedown for Greece. \u201cI have said that a classic haircut is out of the question for me and that hasn\u2019t changed between yesterday and today.\u201d That is likely to play well back home. But it also doesn\u2019t rule out a \u2018reprofiling\u2019 of Greek debt -- ie, cutting the (already low) interest rates or giving Athens more time to pay its borrowings back. That could make the debt more sustainable. Speaking of haircuts..... Europe allowed the negotiations with Greece to drag on too long, says European Council president Donald Tusk in an interview published today. Tusk told Dutch newspaper NRC Handelsblad that tougher limits should have been drawn from the beginning of negotiations, after Syriza won January\u2019s general election. Instead, the two sides talked for months, meaning Greece\u2019s second bailout expired on 30 June before a deal was reached. Tusk also warned that last weekend\u2019s referendum makes it harder to reach a deal, as Tsipras will have to make proposals which go against the \u201cNo\u201d result to get a new aid package. Thanks Henk! Connor Campbell, financial analyst at Spreadex, explains why European markets are rallying: Reports have circulated this morning that the latest Greek plan could contain \u20ac12 billion in tax rises and cuts. Whilst this will be music to creditors\u2019 ears, or it will if relationships haven\u2019t been soured too much, this level of reform is more than the amount the Greek public rejected by voting \u2018no\u2019 in last weekend\u2019s referendum. Tsipras remains stuck between the creditor rock and the Syriza/Greek public hard place, and if the \u20ac12 billion reform plan reports are true it\u2019s going to be a tough sell back at home, to put it mildly. Things might be eased, however, if the growing calls for debt relief are heard by those (Germany) who are so opposed to them. Donald Tusk joined Christine Lagarde and Jack Lew in stating that negotiations do not go one way, and that if Greece\u2019s proposal is sufficient it has to be matched by an \u2018equally realistic\u2019 proposal by the creditor cabal on debt sustainability. Rumours of a French helping hand in drawing up these proposals also suggest that the Eurozone, or at least certain members of the region, remain committed to avoiding a Grexit, with Irish finance minister claiming that there is more than a 50% chance of a deal being made. European stock markets are pushing higher, following Donald Tusk\u2019s warning to creditors that they must consider Greek debt sustainability. The main indices are up over 2%, on hopes that a deal could come by Sunday. Who voted No last Sunday? The Greek poor. And who voted yes? The wealthy. And here\u2019s the proof, from my colleagues Achilleas Galatsidas and George Arnett. They\u2019ve taken the voting data from last weekend\u2019s referendum, and mapped it against average income levels across Athens. They report: Wealthy suburbs in the north such as Kifisia voted definitively in favour of a deal with Greece\u2019s creditors. However, in some of the lower-income districts, particularly in the west of the city, the no vote was backed by the vast majority of residents. Bad news for eurozone crisis watchers who fancied a quiet weekend - eurozone finance ministers will meet at 2pm BST (4pm Athens time) on Saturday to discuss Greece\u2019s proposals (once they\u2019re written): Political developments in Athens.... Donald Tusk\u2019s comments on debt sustainability could be an important development, following a double-whammy of pressure from America last night. Yesterday, International Monetary Fund MD Christine Lagarde warned that Greece is now in \u201ca situation of acute crisis\u201d; reforms and a \u201cdebt restructuring\u201d are both needed to escape it. And US Treasury secretary Jack Lew made his clearest signal yet that America believes restructuring is inevitable. He said: \u201cIn the next few days what we\u2019ll see is [whether] the parties come together and build enough trust that Greece will take the actions that it needs to take so that Europe will restructure the debt in a way that is more sustainable\u201d The IMF had already made his point a week ago; its new Debt Sustainability Analysis showed that Greece needs \u201ccomprehensive\u201d debt relief, with repayments delayed for decade. The eurozone has been trying to kick this issue under the carpet for months. Tusk\u2019s comments suggest that the message has got home to Europe; helpful for the Greek government, but problematic for the likes of Germany. The EU has just announced the timings for Sunday\u2019s leaders\u2019 meetings on Greece: Tusk has also tweeted that Greece\u2019s creditors must show how they would help Greece bring its debt pile down to a sustainable level: While I was watching Donald Tusk, the European Commission was giving its morning briefing. And it emerged that president Juncker will meet Greek opposition parties today: There are murmurings from Athens that opposition parties fear that Alexis Tsipras is either unable or unwilling to reach an agreement. Kathimerini explains: New Democracy leader Evangelos Meimarakis met with Tsipras and four other party leaders on Monday, resulting in the issuing of a joint statement. However, the conservative said on Wednesday that he refused to hold another meeting in private with Tsipras and called on him to address Parliament. Meimarakis said that he wanted Tsipras\u2019s comments to be officially recorded, which suggests that the New Democracy chief has become suspicious of the prime minister\u2019s motives. Meimarakis also decided to send ex-ministers Dora Bakoyannis and Costis Hatzidakis to Brussels for discussions with officials there. Former PASOK leader Evangelos Venizelos suggested that Tsipras is trying to trap the opposition parties so he can call snap elections without reaching any agreement with the institutions. Luxembourg\u2019s PM, Xavier Bettel, says that he will speak with Tsipras later today to push him to deliver \u2018serious\u2019 proposals. Standing alongside Donald Tusk, Bettel also signals that patience is stretched: We have had months of goodwill. we now need proposals. Donald Tusk, EC president, says we have just three days to tackle the Greek crisis. Speaking in Luxembourg, Tusk says that Greece remains the most pressing issue for Europe. We stand ready to do whatever is necessary to protect the stability of the euro area. I spoke with prime minister Alexis Tsipras today, says Tusk. And I hope that today we will receive concrete and realistic proposals from Athens. And if that happens, we will also need parallel proposal from the creditors. If Greece provides a realistic proposal, then \u201cit will need to be matched by an equally realistic proposal on debt sustainability by the creditors\u201d. Only then will we have a win-win situation. Otherwise we will continue the lethargic dance that we have been dancing for the last five months. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council is giving a press conference with Luxembourg\u2019s prime minister Xavier Bettel now, and discussing Greece. It\u2019s being streamed live here. Francesco Papadia, former director general for market operations at the European Central Bank, has put his finger on the political challenges ahead: Ireland\u2019s finance minister, Michael Noonan, has an Irish radio that he believes Alexis Tsipras will manage to reach a deal to keep Greece in the eurozone. The odds, he says, are over 50%. I\u2019m trying to get hold of the quotes - in the meantime, Twitter has the top lines: Noonan was also complimentary about Greece\u2019s new finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, calling him \u201cvery impressive\u201d (among other things...): There\u2019s no escape from deflation in Greece. Consumer prices fell by 2.2% annually in June, down from a 2.1% drop in May. This month\u2019s figures will surely be even worse, given the imposition of capital controls at the end of June. Greece\u2019s jobless rate has dipped, but is still at depression-era levels. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in April 2015 was 25.6%, according to Elstat, down from 25.8% in March 2015. Europe\u2019s stock markets are rallying this morning, partly due to hopes that the Greek government will meet tonight\u2019s deadline. The French CAC and German DAX are both up over 1%. Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, says: Optimism is rising that Greece will deliver on promised proposals, both on time (today) and extensive enough (\u20ac12bn of reforms?), to allow creditors sign off on a third bailout for the beleaguered nation rather than its exit from the single currency. Traders are also reacting to the latest twists in China - shares have soared today, after days of panic plunges prompted a ban on some shares sales. Alexis Tsipras is now meeting with his top cabinet ministers to discuss the reform plans, according to local media Hold the optimism. Greece\u2019s energy minister, the influential left-wing Panagiotis Lafazanis, has said today that he expects a deal soon - but won\u2019t accept a new bailout programme with tough austerity. A MoU, or Memorandum of Understanding, is a list of measure Greece must take in return for aid. And any third bailout would certainly include one. Lafazanis represents the radical far-left wing of the Syriza coalition, an important bloc of Tsipras\u2019s government. Analysts have speculated that the Left Platform could potentially break away, rather than sign up to a new austerity package. Greek media are also reporting that Greece\u2019s reform plan could include \u20ac12bn of cuts and tax rises -- several billion euros than previously expected. And that\u2019s because of the deterioration in the Greek economy, which plunged back into recession this year. Enikos has the details says: The report said that instead of growing by 0.5 percent this year, months of uncertainty and almost two weeks of capital controls meant \u201cthere are estimates of a recession of about 3 percent.\u201d \u201cIt is estimated that the measures of 8 billion euros that Greece had presented for 2015 and 2016 will have to be increased by 2 billion euros per year, raising the total to 12 billion euros for the two years,\u201d Kathimerini reported. That\u2019s French PM Manuel Valls, who insisted yesterday that Greece must not leave the eurozone. Over in Athens insiders are saying that French help in drawing up the country\u2019s new reform proposal is proving invaluable. Our correspondent Helena Smith reports. Officials here are saying that all hope now rests with the French connection. Paris has dispatched a team of technocrats to help finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos draft the new proposal in an effort to ensure it is as convincing as can possibly be. One insider says: \u201cIt is being done all over again, measure by measure. They are offering invaluable assistance.\u201d Tsakalotos, who returned to Athens last night, will convene with prime minister Alexis Tsipras and other senior officials to discuss the new measures \u2013 a mix of biting taxes, swingeing cuts and administrative reforms. At this point in time, the third bailout will allegedly be in the range of \u20ac52bn with Greece asking for the emergency aid to be disbursed over three years. The media here is also reporting that the IMF is pressing for the package to be higher, in the range of \u20ac60-\u20ac70bn. Events have happened so fast, that Greeks have almost not had the opportunity to digest the news that after nearly six months of drama-filled negotiations they could soon be hit with a heavier austerity package than at any other time. But for the first time in several days there is hope that a way can be found out. I spoke with Greece\u2019s pre-eminent sociologist, professor Konstantinos Tsoukalas, who also sits as a state MP with the governing Syriza party this morning, and he said: \u201cI am very optimistic for the first time in days.\u201d Greek pensioners have been queuing at bank branches today, to receive the maximum \u20ac120 they are entitled to under capital controls. There\u2019s no hope of buying or selling shares in Greek companies this week; it\u2019s just been announced that the stock market will remain closed until at least Monday night. Mario Draghi, one of the crucial players in this drama, has warned that resolving the Greece crisis will be very tough. That\u2019s according to Italian financial daily Il Sole 24 Ore today. It reports that Draghi was asked about the prospect of a Greek deal when on a flight from Brussels to Rome yesterday, and replied: \u201cI don\u2019t know, this time it\u2019s really difficult.\u201d Draghi also downplayed the prospect of Russian President Vladimir Putin stepping in, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t see it as a real risk ... and then, they don\u2019t have money themselves.\u201d (thanks to Reuters for the translation) Good morning, and welcome to our rolling coverage of the Greek debt crisis. \u201cI love deadlines. I love the whooshing noise they make as they go by.\u201d With that attitude, Douglas Adams would certainly have enjoyed the eurozone crisis. But Greece now faces one of those deadlines that one really can\u2019t miss. Alexis Tsipras\u2019s government must draw up and deliver a credible economic plan to its creditors by the end of the day, to have any chance of securing the third bailout plan it requested on Wednesday. Tsipras, back in Athens after his bruising trip to the European Parliament, will meet with his cabinet today to discuss the details. That could be a tense affair; sections of his Syriza party will surely battle against the imposition of fresh austerity measures, especially after last Sunday\u2019s referendum. But if the cabinet can stay united, finance minister Euclid Tsakalotos will draw up the details and send them winging to creditors. Germany expects them by midnight Thursday (although EC president Jean-Claude Juncker has suggested the finally final deadline is 8.30am Friday morning #whoosh). The pressure on both sides to reach a deal is hitting new heights. Yesterday, the IMF and the US Treasury urged Athens and its lenders to reach a deal, and warned that Greece must be given debt relief. Government spokesman Gabriel Sakellaridis has already been on TV today to insist that agreement can be reached. Sakellaridis told Antenna TV this morning that: \u201cI am certain the agreement will pass Syriza\u2019s parliamentary group, [and] the governing coalition. The government is doing everything it can to reach an immediate deal and end this cycle of uncertainty.\u201d That certainty will be tested today, as we rattle towards a weekend of drama that could surpass anything seen in the last five years of the eurozone crisis. If an acceptable plan isn\u2019t drawn up in time, Sunday\u2019s EU leaders summit will be about handling the fallout of Greece\u2019s departure from the eurozone. We\u2019ll be tracking all the main events though the day...."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
