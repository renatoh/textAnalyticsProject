Discuss", "bodyText": "On the front page of this newspaper yesterday, under the headline \"Former Labour allies round on Blair\", the lead story concerned a total critique of the Labour leadership by the editors of a small magazine called Renewal. Neal Lawson and Paul Thompson accused the government of squandering its majority by failing to transform the country in a social democratic direction, and gave out the bleak prophecy that unless the leader and the entire ideology was scrapped, then Labour's third term would be meaningless and its subsequent defeat practically assured. I am not going to repeat in full earlier arguments about how well or badly the government has done, save to recap the main points. If, in 1994, a Labour supporter had been told that in 10 years, unemployment would be below a million, interest rates below 5%, that there would have been the greatest increases in public spending ever undertaken, thousands more of the kind of people we always wanted thousands more of, big increases in overseas aid, third world debt reduction and significant inroads made into child poverty, then she probably would have said, Kerrylike, \"Bring It On!\" It seemed to me, reading the accompanying article by Thompson and Lawson, that their critique was deficient in two ways. The first was the old Marxism Today, inside-left problem of having a fabulous idea, where everyone else was myopic and stupid, but not offering a clue as to what to do instead. The second problem, related to the first, was that they seemed forced to maximise minor differences so as to find political space for themselves. So, for instance, the accusation that the government is intent on \"privatising\" public services, when none of its proposals would be considered much out of place in avowedly social democratic countries on the continent, is just overblown. But fine. If the argument was, in their words, that the left should now be arguing for a \"realisable radical transformation\", beyond anything attempted by Blair and Brown, then it should be taken seriously. The question, \"Is this as good as it gets?\" is the right one for progressives to ask, and the answer must usually be \"No\". So what might such a transformation look like? Let's talk in general terms first. The Renewal people do not believe, as, say, members of the SWP do, that there is an alternative system called \"socialism\" in which everyone sits round in meetings at factories, listening to the local SWP leader tell them how many placards the collective should decide to produce that year. They believe, however, that there is a tension between capitalism and the public good that must be regulated by the state or other bodies. In fact, they use this concept as a kind of sliding scale of correctness. The more left you are, the more you place into the public, collective realm; the more right you are, the more goes into the private realm. \"More of one means less of the other.\" There is a philosophical difficulty here for liberals. The idea of individual human rights, let alone consumer rights, may often bring the private citizen into conflict with the public realm. And there is the added problem that the guys from Renewal don't seem to like most of the effective \"unprivatised\" ways of controlling the public realm, such as the setting of targets. And, of course, their general notion of the role of social democracy, as harnessing the creative force of capitalism to the maximum good, is one which Blair and Brown would agree with completely. So the question is, what do they mean? Concretely, what kinds of things would the radical, transformational Labour government of their realistic dreams actually do, that this one will not? I phoned one of the authors up and would describe him as completely sincere, genuinely despairing and very helpful. No, he hadn't even the faintest idea what tax levels, say, such a government would impose, though he had complained (wrongly) about historically low levels of taxation. But he and his allies were beginning to discuss some very interesting ideas. And he sent me two papers outlining what some of these ideas were. The first outlined the idea of Citizen's Income, a basic income guarantee, paid to all citizens, regardless of circumstances - as child benefit is. As it happens, this is already Green party policy, although the Greens have not specified a level for the income. Estimates included in the Renewal paper suggested that if the level were set at 30% of average income, then funding it would require an increase in the main rate of tax of 20%. The top five deciles or so would lose, the bottom five would gain. Clearly this would be redistributive and radical. But it would mean that many middle earners (decile 7 would lose nearly 3% of income) would find themselves working harder to pay more taxes for people who did not want to work. This may not be, as Professor Ruth Lister acknowledged to the House of Commons Social Security Select Committee, the proposition for which the country thinks it has been waiting. \"So long as employment continues to be the primary determinant, direct or indirect, of incomes,\" she told them, \"it is doubtful whether an income-maintenance system that deliberately challenges the link between income and wages would command the necessary broad-based political support.\" The second paper, emphasising the role of citizen involvement in a social democracy, advocated a legal restriction on working hours so as to permit more time and energy to be devoted on standing for election, serving on committees, being school governors, and so on. And let me mark here what may be a generational point. If the main complaint of my age group (35-55) was high unemployment, all the emphasis now seems to be on over-employment, on work as being a bad thing. Even so, I don't believe that a statutory limit on working hours would have any significant effect whatsoever on participation rates. After four years as a school governor, unsuccessfully cajoling parents into attending vital meetings about their kids' futures, my conclusion is that, barring moments of crisis, they don't want to do it. Not because they don't think they can change things, but because they have other things to do. To tell them that you will be limiting their earning capacity in order to try and shepherd them into citizenish activities is also not a vote-winner. This isn't cynicism, just a belated realisation that people are not interested in the same things. Even so, these are good things to be discussing, and hopefully we will see as much of these proposals as we have been seeing of the headline-making critiques. I just have one warning, however, for the fine people at Renewal. If there is any one equation that the right (which is always with us) wants you to make, it is \"public good, private bad\". There may be good reasons why no winning Labour leader would be willing to travel that road."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
