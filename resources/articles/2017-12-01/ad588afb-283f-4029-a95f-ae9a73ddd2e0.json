In a speech in Birmingham a week before the vote, Jones hammered Moore, who has faced allegations of sexual misconduct involving teenaged girls. \u201cMen who hurt little girls should go to jail, not the US Senate,\u201d Jones said. Several hours after Jones\u2019s speech, Republican senator Jeff Flake made a $100 donation to the Democrat\u2019s campaign. Flake, a conservative \u201cNever Trump\u201d Republican from Arizona, wrote \u201ccountry over party\u201d on the check. The Alabama race has been roiled by allegations from women who say Moore behaved inappropriately with them when they were teenagers and he was a prosecutor in his 30s. Two women have claimed Moore sexually assaulted them. Others have said he dated or tried to date them. The Republican candidate has denied all the allegations and pointed to a conspiracy involving \u201clesbians, gays, bisexuals and socialists\u201d. Attacking Moore, Jones contrasted the firebrand conservative judge to the state\u2019s former governor, Robert Bentley, who resigned amid a sex scandal in April. \u201cWe didn\u2019t look away with Robert Bentley when his conduct involved consenting adults and we cannot look away now that it involves children,\u201d Jones said. Moore has twice been forced to step down as chief justice of the Alabama supreme court, for defying federal court orders. Jones set up his Republican opponent as a figure of mockery. \u201cRoy Moore has never, ever served our state with honor,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was already an embarrassment before nine courageous women chose to share their stories.\u201d He also attacked Moore for his position at a not-for-profit organization called the Foundation for Moral Law, which paid the Republican about $1m over a five-year period. \u201cI have never lived off of donations from a so-called charitable foundation,\u201d Jones said. The Democrat even mocked Moore for pulling a small pistol on stage at a campaign rally in September. \u201cWhen you see me with a gun, I\u2019ll be climbing in and out of a deer blind,\u201d he said, \u201cnot prancing around on a stage in a cowboy suit.\u201d The speech marked a shift in tactics from Jones. From being cautious in criticizing Moore over the allegations of sexual misconduct, his campaign has become increasingly vocal and aggressive. The speech came one day after Donald Trump formally endorsed Moore and the Republican National Committee, which had withdrawn support, renewed its involvement in the race. At the White House on Tuesday, Trump talked to reporters about the race. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to have a liberal Democrat in Alabama,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to have the things we represent.\u201d Press secretary Sarah Sanders also defended the endorsement, saying Trump \u201cwould rather have a person that supports his agenda versus someone who opposes his agenda every step of the way, and until the rest of that process plays out, you have a choice between two individuals, and the president\u2019s chosen to support Moore\u201d. She added: \u201cThe allegations are concerning and, if true, he should step aside, but we don\u2019t have a way to validate that and that\u2019s something for the people of Alabama to decide.\u201d CNN journalist Jim Acosta challenged Sanders, noting: \u201cThis is somebody who\u2019s been accused of child abuse, of molesting children. How can that vote in the Senate be that important that you would take a gamble on somebody who\u2019s been accused of molesting kids, of harming somebody who is under age? Has he wrestled with that question? The press secretary answered: \u201cAs I\u2019ve said, we find the allegations very troubling and again this is up to the people of Alabama to make that decision. I\u2019m not a voter in Alabama; I can\u2019t make that decision.\u201d According to the realclearpolitics.com polling average, Moore has a 1.5-point lead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
