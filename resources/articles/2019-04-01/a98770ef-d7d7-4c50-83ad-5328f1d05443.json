City are now a point ahead of Liverpool with three games to go after second-half goals from Bernardo Silva and Leroy San\u00e9 extended United\u2019s run to seven defeats from their last nine games, their worst sequence of results since 1962. \u201cI told the players: \u2018don\u2019t read [the newspapers] tomorrow, don\u2019t watch the television, just rest, sleep a lot and go in there against Burnley,\u201d Guardiola said, referring to Sunday\u2019s trip to Turf Moor. \u201cI don\u2019t think Liverpool are going to drop too many points, but it\u2019s in our hands \u2013 three games. We won the last 11 [in the league]. It\u2019s incredible what these players have done so far, but still we have a job to do. \u201cMaybe tonight we can enjoy it, but tomorrow it\u2019s over, it\u2019s gone, so we have to be focused. I know people are going to talk about how beautiful we are, how handsome we are, like this, like that, but now we have to go to Burnley - and in my two previous seasons going to Burnley was incredibly tough. If we win our last three games, we are champions and that is what we are going to try to do.\u201d United\u2019s performance drew criticism from Marcus Rashford \u2013 \u201cWe didn\u2019t play like Manchester United,\u201d the striker said \u2013 on a night when their former captain, Roy Keane, used his punditry role to castigate the current players, picking out Paul Pogba for particular criticism and talking about the \u201cbluffers\u201d in Ole Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r\u2019s dressing-room. \u201cThey [City] have set the standard,\u201d Solskj\u00e6r said. \u201cFor the last couple of seasons they have been the best team in the league. That\u2019s the challenge for us to get to and we\u2019re clearly not there now. That\u2019s for everyone to see. That\u2019s my job, when we come back in pre-season, to make sure we have the right characters around.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
