The news came as the family released new pictures of Rhys and a Mother's Day card written by the 11-year-old Everton fan. In the card, Rhys writes a poem to his mother, describing her as 'a comfortable cushion'. 'My mum is a red rose She is a dolphin My mum is kind, loving and generous,' he say. Police believe the boy was shot by a 15-year-old 'Croxteth Crew' gang member who was firing at a 19-year-old from a rival gang. Local newspapers added that the intended victim may have been tricked into going into the Fir Tree pub in Croxteth Park. He sprinted across the pub car park after the first shot, taking cover behind a shelter just yards from where Rhys was hit in the neck. The fatal shot was reportedly fired from a black handgun with a long barrel and shattered two windows of a silver BMW before hitting Rhys, who was found in a pool of blood by his mother and pronounced dead when he reached hospital. The shooting is alleged to have been ordered by a prominent 18-year-old member of the Croxteth Crew, possibly as part of a dispute over a girl. It is thought to be the third time in a year that the intended target had strayed into 'enemy territory' and been shot at by a rival gang. Acting Detective Superintendent Dave Kelly, said: 'At this stage, we are looking at a number of motives, but the strongest line of inquiry is that Rhys was the accidental victim of a targeted attack against others.' Police declined to comment on more specific details. More than 3,000 people are expected to attend a vigil in Rhys's memory at Croxteth Country Park at 4pm today. His parents Stephen, 44, and Melanie, 41, will light a candle in their son's memory and a schoolfriend will give a reading. Speakers will include the Bishop of Liverpool, the Right Reverend James Jones, and the Lord Mayor of Liverpool, Paul Clark. On Friday night, detectives released four men arrested in connection with the murder inquiry, bringing the total number of people arrested and released to 16. There are signs of a groundswell in the local area putting pressure on the killer to come forward or be turned in. One local person has circulated a poem entitled Someone, demanding the culprit be identified. It reads: 'Someone is the killer,/Someone fired the gun./someone knows the killer,/ Are you that someone?' The initials of one teenager named locally as the culprit appeared on a community website with the plea, 'Give yourself in'. A name is also believed to have appeared in graffiti on walls in the Croxteth area. Rhys's funeral will be held on Thursday at Liverpool's Anglican Cathedral. \u00b7 A teenager was arrested after a 24-year-old man was shot in the back in Liverpool yesterday. The 16-year-old, from the Toxteth area of the city, was arrested after the victim suffered a gunshot wound in the attack in Park Hill Road, Toxteth. Police said the incident was not being linked to the murder of Rhys Jones."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
