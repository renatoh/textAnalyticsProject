The 14-year-old had been diagnosed with leprosy, then a widely misunderstood disease that struck fear into its victims and condemned them to decades of appalling treatment at the hands of the Japanese state. \u201cI thought I was going to get help and be able to lead a normal life,\u201d Nakao, now 81, told the Guardian. \u201cIt felt like I was going on a little adventure.\u201d But his optimism vanished as soon as he arrived at Aiseien, a sanatorium for hundreds of leprosy patients looking out over the Seto inland sea that separates the island from mainland Japan. Nakao \u2013 thereafter referred to as patient No. 4973 \u2013 and other new arrivals were taken into quarantine, stripped of their clothes and valuables and photographed, before being made to lower themselves into a bath of hot water and cresol disinfectant. They spent a week to 10 days being observed in hospital wards, segregated by sex, age and the severity of their symptoms. \u201cIt was like entering a prison,\u201d said Nakao, who shared a dormitory with 70 other children. \u201cWe were referred to by our numbers, and of course we couldn\u2019t leave. I realised as soon as I set foot on Nagashima my freedom had vanished.\u201d But Nakao was not the only member of his family to suffer as a result of leprosy, now commonly referred to as Hansen\u2019s disease after Gerhard Armauer Hansen, the Norwegian doctor who identified the bacterium that causes leprosy in 1873. Soon after he was taken to Aiseien, health officials disinfected the home in Nara prefecture he had shared with his mother and elder brother. Their neighbours, fearing that Nakao\u2019s family could also be infected, kept their distance. This week, 20 years after Japan ended the compulsory segregation of people living with leprosy, the families of former patients launched a class action seeking compensation for decades of discrimination simply for being related to people with leprosy. More than 500 people, including siblings, spouses, children and grandchildren, are seeking 5 million yen each (\u00a332,500) and a public apology from the central government, claiming that the stigma attached to the disease had harmed their employment, housing, education and marriage prospects. They include Mitsuko Okudaira, who was brought up by her grandmother after her parents were taken to a sanatorium in Okinawa. \u201cI hope the central government will acknowledge the present situation, in which family members are still discriminated against and cannot talk about what they have been through, and do something to resolve the problem,\u201d she said, according to the Asahi Shimbun newspaper. Under the 1953 leprosy prevention law, Japan rounded up thousands of patients and forced them to live in sanatoriums located in mountains or on remote islands, although the practice had been commonplace since the turn of the century. In prewar Japan, sufferers were turned over to the secret police by medical authorities, while patients and other disabled people were considered \u201cpolluted\u201d, and \u201cstains on the flag of the Rising Sun\u201d. The segregation law, which was not repealed until 1996, forced patients to undergo abortions and sterilisation. They were made to perform backbreaking work for poverty pay, and subjected to imprisonment without trial for assaulting staff or attempting to escape. In 2001 a court ruled that the policy of segregating Hansen\u2019s disease patients was unconstitutional and should have been discontinued after effective multidrug therapies were made widely available by the end of the 1950s. In a surprise move, the then prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, offered a formal apology, and promised not to contend compensation claims former patients had brought against the state. The end of forced quarantine came too late for Nakao, even though he was declared free of Hansen\u2019s disease in 1970. His wife, Yuriko \u2013 a fellow Aiseien resident \u2013 and his mother and brother had all died in the 1990s, leaving him with no family connections. \u201cIf it had happened 30 or 40 years earlier it would have given people like me a chance to reintegrate into society,\u201d said Nakao, who suffered lasting damage to his eyesight and the peripheral nerves in his hands and legs. \u201cBut even after you\u2019re cured, the discrimination continues. That\u2019s because the symptoms are still there in the most obvious parts of your body \u2013 on your face and hands. \u201cEven the healthy relatives of people with Hansen\u2019s disease had to leave their homes. After I arrived here I heard that my old house had turned white after being disinfected. My mother and brother carried on living there, but life was awful for them. After all, I was the one who was ill, not them.\u201d Today, almost 40% of the 1,597 people living in state sanatoriums still use aliases to prevent their families from being discriminated against, according to a survey by the Asahi Shimbun. \u201cIgnorance about Hansen\u2019s disease meant that it wasn\u2019t just the patients who suffered, but their families too,\u201d said Noriko Mori, an Aiseien official. \u201cEven now, many of the people here don\u2019t know if their brothers and sisters on the outside are still alive. They have no one to come and visit them.\u201d Aiseien\u2019s ossuary contains the remains of 3,600 people who died at the facility since it opened in 1930. \u201cTheir families didn\u2019t come to collect their ashes,\u201d Mori said. \u201cEven in death, they weren\u2019t able to finally go home.\u201d Nakao is one of 204 people still living on Nagashima. Their average age is 85, and most have been on the island for around six decades. At its peak in 1943, Aiseien was home to more than 2,000 men, women and children. There were schools and leisure activities, but in every other respect, the sanatorium was little more then an open prison from which most would never escape. After leaving school, Nakao worked as a farmer, plumber and rubbish collector, and eventually became head of the residents\u2019 association at Aiseien, one of 13 state sanatoriums that are now home to 1,500 people, all of whom have recovered from the disease. The Aiseien of today is a happier place, where a large team of doctors and nurses provide medical care, and tourists come to the facility\u2019s museum to learn firsthand about Japan\u2019s uneasy relationship with Hansen\u2019s disease. In 1988, a new road bridge \u2013 the Bridge to Humanity \u2013 finally linked Nagashima to the outside world. \u201cWhen I look at that landing pier now, I think back to when I arrived here all those years ago,\u201d Nakao said. \u201cExcept that now I know I\u2019m free to come and go as I please. \u201cI enjoy my occasional trips off the island, but I\u2019ve been here more than 60 years \u2026 although it sounds strange, I can say now that this place really feels like home.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
