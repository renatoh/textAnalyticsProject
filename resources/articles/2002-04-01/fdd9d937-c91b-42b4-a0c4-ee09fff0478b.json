It's the end of an afternoon of meetings and radio in town and I'm on the way to a 'cocktail and canap\u00e9s' party - also work-related (honestly, where's my social life gone?) - and I'm early by an hour because I wanted to get across town before rush hour. Fine, I think, perfect opportunity to sit in the Italian cafe and write a piece on my palm (top). I'm in an area replete with clothes shops and my outfit feels distinctly daytime. So perhaps (I also think) I'll pop into a few shops and spruce up the look with a new shirt, maybe a pair of shoes, and hey presto, here I am, credit card swiped twice, a fair few quid lighter. And this on a day when checking my bank balance prompted me to fire off emails in an urgent quest to get some money in. Schizophrenic or what? Maybe, but at least 'they' won't think me too daytime at the do. And as I sit here peering down at my shiny new shoes, I wonder what this bit of retail anaesthetic is numbing, for to think of it as therapy is self-deluding. My internal turbulence has not been resolved with these purchases. It started for me on Sunday when, wobbling slowly along on the Intercity (are they still called that?) through a town in the heartlands which shall remain nameless, my gaze was rudely arrested by the sight of a parade. Now I've been on the planet a while and have witnessed parades of all kinds, so it's not that I'm easily shocked by such things. But this one was totally bizarre and sinister looking. What looked like at least 1,000 people - I'm assuming men because of their build and because I find it hard to imagine women engaging in such nonsense (call me sexist), though I couldn't tell on account of their helmets - were riding slowly, two abreast, through the spectator-lined streets on motor scooters, each bearing aloft the English flag, the cross of St George. I noted that everyone in the enthusiastic crowds was Caucasian, and judging by the riders' hands, necks and other visible body parts, they were, too. As far as I know, this parade never made the news, so it could have just been the annual Scooter Riders of the English Folk Music Society parade. But seeing as the town in question has a large immigrant population recently swelled by refugees from the Balkan wars, I couldn't help being reminded of both footage of Nazi rallies in pre-war Germany and scenes from Animal Farm - it certainly had that vibe about it. I felt a mixture of fear and shame. Fear, because it looked like a town gone mad, and I never knew so many people were into such parades. And if it was a neo-fascist rally, that means (to sensitive old me) that the 'madness' is spreading fast, and as I'm a diehard liberal, my particular kind of madness doesn't gel well with it. Fear, because I believe that for all the downside of growing pains and adjustment discomfort, it's the wave upon wave of immigrants to these humble shores that has made this culture the most vibrant, sophisticated and exciting of any I've seen elsewhere (and I've travelled with a big 'T'). Not to mention how lonely it would be not to be topped, tailed and sided by the glorious Celts. Shame, because though I'm proud to be English, I'm even more proud to be an Earthling, because I don't just love it from Brighton to Carlisle, I love the entire planet, with maybe the possible exception of Lordsburg, Arizona, but that's another story. And I really thought we'd grown past the kind of limiting xenophobia that I felt wafting out from under those helmets. And so I ask you, in fact beseech you, to resist any urge to narrow your vision - and to prevail on all around you to resist as well. Just before the millennium there was an exhilarating bite in the air. The bite of global consciousness - a burgeoning spiritual awakening. But as soon as the clock struck one, it all seemed to slam into reverse. It takes but a single candle flame to extinguish the darkness in an entire room. You and I, we are that flame, with a responsibility to shine and to help. The ancient Taoists, no strangers to the wily ways of men in helmets, suggested the following: imagine a breathing aperture in the centre of your chest and breathe in and out purposefully through it. As you do, focus all your awareness on the quality of absolute harmony and feel as if you're breathing that quality in and out until you feel a veritable forcefield of it around you. See this force radiate outwards in ever-increasing circles until it penetrates every mind, and then relax and carry on as you were. Or maybe just go and buy some new jeans as well. Your problems Hi Doc, I suffer from frequent colds, and continual nasalness/bad breathing. I also have a tight muscle at the neck of my bladder, for which I take medication. I think I read that nose and bladder problems are related in Chinese healing. Any advice? Simon Appleton The bladder is related to contracted kidney region/energy. Lungs and kidneys work in partnership - lungs are responsible for breathing out, the kidneys for making the lungs suck air in. The lungs control the nose etc. If the kidneys contract, the lungs can't breathe in properly and are left under-energised - hence colds etc. Have you thought of going to an experienced acupuncturist/acupressurist? If not, think about a course of sessions. Dear Barefoot, Recently I have become very absent-minded, and in the past two days I have almost burned the house down twice - once by forgetting about a pan on the stove, and then by mistaking a plastic water jug for the kettle and setting it alight. Is this the first stage of Alzheimer's? Rachel Bury At the deepest of levels, there seems to be a confusion between the elements of fire and water and earth. This relates to your heart, kidney and spleen, and does not indicate a possibility of Alzheimer's, the very thought/fear of which is indicative of this imbalance. I suggest taking a 90-minute walk at the earliest possibility, reminding yourself: 'It is I who command the conditions of my life.' Eat seaweed to boost your kidneys, radish to cool the heart and a dab of horseradish on the end of your tongue to spark up the spleen energy. If you have any problems you would like answered, please write to Barefoot Doctor at Life magazine, The Observer, 119 Farringdon Road, London EC1R 3ER, or email him at barefoot.doctor@observer.co.uk. Unfortunately, due to the number he receives, Barefoot will be unable to answer all queries."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
