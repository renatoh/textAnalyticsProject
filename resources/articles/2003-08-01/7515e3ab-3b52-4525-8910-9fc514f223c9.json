Nikau returned to New Zealand from Warrington two years ago, shortly after his wife Letitia had committed suicide. \"We will be there to support him in any way we can,\" said Selwyn Pearson, the executive director of the New Zealand Rugby League. \"It is fair to say he is one of rugby league's favourite sons and we will be there for him and his family.\" The crash occurred when Nikau crashed into an oncoming car at Ohinewai, in the North Island, on July 1. The 36-year-old had at least four operations on a broken femur immediately after the incident, but surgeons at Waikato Hospital were apparently forced to amputate below the knee late on Wednesday night due to complications. Leeds return to action at Hull in this evening's televised match after a week in which they have lost top spot in the Super League to Bradford, had two of their players sent to a young offenders' institution, and also announced that Tony Smith will replace Daryl Powell as coach next year. Powell, who will stay in charge until the end of the season, has recalled the internationals Chris McKenna and Barrie McDermott to replace Chev Walker and Ryan Bailey, who were jailed for 18 and nine months respectively on Tuesday for their part in a brawl last summer. \"It has been an extremely difficult week for the players and coaching staff but we have stuck together and we know that together we will be stronger for it,\" Powell said yesterday. \"I have to praise the players for the way they have got on with their job.\" Hull, who still have a battle to make the play-offs after winning only one of their past four matches, are hoping for a 20,000 crowd for Leeds's first visit to the KC Stadium. Mike Gregory takes charge of Wigan for the first time tomorrow at Warrington, the club he captained with such distinction 15 years ago. Gregory, who had been assistant to Stuart Raper before the Australian was sacked last Monday, has Paul Johnson and Brett Dallas back after they missed last Saturday's home defeat by Widnes. But Nick Graham and Mick Cassidy are both ruled out, so Gregory has switched Sean O'Loughlin to stand-off and recalled Stephen Wild to the second row for his first start in four months."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
