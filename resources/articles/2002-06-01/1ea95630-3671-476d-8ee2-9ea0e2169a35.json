Wearing the colours of Ecurie Wildenstein, Bright Sky was brought with a steady run by jockey Dominique Boeuf to power home two lengths clear of Dance Routine. Turtle Bow finished third, ahead of Ana Marie, but following a stewards' enquiry in which it was decided the former had hampered her rival the placings were reversed. Boeuf paid tribute to his mount, who is trained by Elie Lellouche. \"Good horses make good jockeys, and Bright Sky was certainly at the top of her game today,\" he said. \"The race went perfectly for us and we were well served by the stiff gallop set by our pacemaker, Blue Lightning.\" Bright Sky's long term target is the Prix de l'Opera at Longchamp on Arc day. Anabaa Blue, without a win since his French Derby success a year ago, came good again in the Group Two Grand Prix de Chantilly, the main supporting race on the card. Darting through a gap between Geoff Wragg's front-running St Expedit and Ange Gabriel, Anabaa Blue scored by a decisive length and a half. St Expedit, second last year, kept on tenaciously and dead-heated for the runner-up berth with Ange Gabriel. Thierry Jarnet, rider of the latter, objected to the winner on the grounds that his mount had been hampered, but the protest was overruled. Carlos Lerner, trainer of Anabaa Blue, said of Christophe Soumillon's mount: \"He was not quite 100% today but will be in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud at the end of the month.\" Domedriver continued the good form of French Derby winning trainer, Pascal Bary, when landing the Group Three Prix du Chemin de Fer du Nord. The four-year-old paid a handsome compliment to Frenchmans Bay after running fifth to Roger Charlton's colt at Longchamp last month. Midnight Angel, third behind Guadalupe in last month's Italian Oaks, reversed the form in the German version at Mulheim yesterday but could not cope with Salve Regina, who gained a decisive victory under Richard Hills. Salve Regina, a full-sister to the former German horse of the year, Samum, earned herself a probable crack at the German Derby after maintaining her unbeaten record. Midnight Angel kicked on five out, but Hills was always alive to the danger as Salve Regina asserted by two and a half lengths to make it three wins from three starts for trainer Andreas Schutz. Guadalupe, with Kieren Fallon up, stayed on under pressure to take minor honours."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
