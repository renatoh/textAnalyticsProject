It confirms three things. One: he's a shrewd self-editor - wise enough, anyway, to have kept Rockit's sub-Ian Dury cobblers and the awkward, ugly We Are Happy Landfill well away from Demon Days proper. Two: he is happiest as a crooner. While an Albarn-sung demo of Dare cries out for Shaun Ryder's funky gibbonry, the ballads (Hong Kong, featuring Chinese zither player Zeng Zhen, and Stop the Dams, a twinkling Icelandic eco-protest song with former Sugarcube Einar) are sublime. Three: there's no other musician in Britain who tries this many things at once, and gets most of them right."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
