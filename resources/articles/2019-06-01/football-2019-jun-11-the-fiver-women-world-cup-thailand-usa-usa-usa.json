USA!! USA!!! at the Women\u2019s World Cup. But still, this is football. Funny old game, etc and so forth. \u201cOf course,\u201d Thai defender Warunee Petchwiset said, \u201cwe want to score against [USA! USA!! USA!!!] and hope to surprise them.\u201d Yep, good luck with that. Thailand\u2019s coach, Nuengruethai Sathongwien, has admitted that USA! USA!! USA!!! are considerably better than the Belgium side her team faced in their final warm-up game 10 days ago. This is demonstrably true: not only do Fifa\u2019s rankings have the Americans at No 1 and Belgium in 20th, but America played Belgium in April and tonked them 6-0. And Thailand lost 6-1 to Belgium. Since winning last summer\u2019s AFF Women\u2019s Championship, a kind of south-east Asian-specific competition also involving Australia\u2019s Under-20s, because Australians are so competitive they are utterly unable to not enter other people\u2019s flamin\u2019 football and singing competitions, Thailand have lost 11 of 12 international fixtures. \u201cIt will be a very difficult game for us,\u201d honked Thailand\u2019s captain, Sunisa Srangthaisong. \u201cWe will give our best and in football anything can happen. We may get a goal and I think it will be an exciting match.\u201d It is not exactly true that in football anything can happen. Surely, even in a field as logic-defying as sport, there are limits. Victory for the Thais in their opening World Cup match on Tuesday night would be a shock to make Cameroon beating Argentina at the men\u2019s event in 1990 look positively dull, an upset to render Arya Stark\u2019s single-handed success against the Army of the Dead dispiritingly humdrum or David\u2019s slingshot-inspired takedown of Goliath ruinously run-of-the-mill. Happily for many in Thailand it is not the winning but the taking part that counts. \u201cWe are here in the 24-team finals, that is our success,\u201d cheered Sathongwien. \u201cTo play one of the best teams in the world, that is also a success.\u201d USA! USA!! USA!!! are taking nothing for granted. \u201cI respect every team over here because I think sometimes it\u2019s incredibly hard to get here,\u201d tooted their coach, Jill Ellis. Her side know anything but victory would not only significantly undermine their efforts to retain their sport\u2019s greatest title, but also be widely considered absolutely hilarious. \u201cI think if the dream comes true, we can make history to upset one of the best teams in the world,\u201d said Sathongwien. And if the dream does not come true, as already established, \u201cthat is also a success\u201d. Therefore, QED, Thailand are certain to win. So congratulations to them.
