Speaking at the party\u2019s annual conference in Brighton, McDonnell will announce plans to help the more than 3 million people in Britain who are paying far more in interest payments than they borrowed. Under the proposals there would be a total cap, meaning people would not have to pay back more than twice the amount of their credit card borrowings. Labour\u2019s plan would bring the regulation of the credit card industry into line with rules on payday loan companies, which were subjected to these restrictions from 2015. McDonnell said he was \u201ccalling upon the government to act now apply the same rules on payday loans to credit card debt\u201d. \u201cIt means that no one will ever pay more in interest than their original loan,\u201d he will say. \u201cIf the Tories refuse to act, I can announce today that the next Labour government will amend the law.\u201d In a joking reference to leadership rules changes named after him, the shadow chancellor said: \u201cCall it the McDonnell amendment.\u201d The policy is designed to appeal to consumers at a time when Labour is preparing for the possibility of another general election, with the Conservatives in turmoil over Brexit and their lack of a majority in parliament. Labour\u2019s policy comes amid deep political worry about the levels of debt being racked up by some of the most vulnerable consumers, which the Guardian has charted in a recent series about Britain\u2019s \u00a3200bn of unsecured personal borrowing. According to the Money Advice Service, there are now 8.3 million people in the UK with problem debts. The chairs of two parliamentary committees have this month urged the government to set up an independent public inquiry into the \u00a3200bn of debt amassed by households. The call by Rachel Reeves, the Labour chair of the business select committee, and Frank Field, the Labour head of the work and pensions select committee, comes as the Conservative-led Treasury select committee also plans to hold meetings around the country to examine the impact of debt on individuals and households. Andrew Bailey, the chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), said last week that he was concerned about the sheer number of people who need loans to make ends meet. He identified gig economy workers, who do not have guaranteed hours, as in special need of credit to smooth their incomes. Consumer credit, which covers personal loans, credit cards and borrowing for cars, is rising at just under 10% a year, at a time when wages are falling at 0.4% a year, taking inflation into account. Eighty-six percent of cars are bought on personal contract purchase credit deals, which in effect leave borrowers leasing their vehicle. Meanwhile, nearly half of all borrowers on credit cards are on 0% interest rate offers. The FCA is so concerned about people in credit card debt that it proposed new regulations in April that would place more obligations on companies to stop persistent debt spiralling. In July, it said it was cracking down on the high cost of overdrafts and reviewing the booming car loan market. McDonnell will use his speech at the party conference to highlight the high number of people with persistent debt \u2013 those who have paid more in interest and charges than they have repaid of their borrowing over an 18-month period. Among the 3 million people with persistent debt, the average amount on credit cards is \u00a33,464 or about \u00a314bn in total. They pay about \u00a32.50 in interest and charges for every \u00a31 borrowed, according to the FCA. The shadow chancellor will also turn his fire on the Conservatives\u2019 record on the economy, saying the last seven years have seen the slowest wage growth since Napoleonic times. He will say Labour would take a different approach to the challenges of automation and industrial change by establishing a strategic investment board to fund new technologies. \u201cHuge changes are under way in our society and economy,\u201d he will say. \u201cTechnological change is accelerating. This year Chinese scientists used quantum mechanics to teleport data to a satellite. \u201cBut we can match that: we\u2019ve got a government full of people teleported from the 18th century. While the Tories remain stuck in the language and values of the Victorian era, we are determined that Britain embraces the possibilities of technological change \u2013 scary though they may be. \u201cBy the middle of this century it is possible that up to half of all the jobs we do now could be automated away.\u201d McDonnell will express an ambition to get rid of \u201cexploitative, dangerous, degrading and dead-end\u201d jobs and create only employment that is \u201cfulfilling and meaningful, in communities where pride and prosperity has been restored\u201d. To achieve this, Labour would create a \u201cnew institutional framework\u201d that makes better links between the financial system and the economy of research, development and production. \u201cThe Strategic Investment Board will scrutinise and co-ordinate the delivery of essential funding out of the hands of the speculators and into the technologies and industries of the future,\u201d he said. \u201cSo to the technology sector, to the universities, to the researchers and the innovators we say: help is on the way.\u201d Liz Truss, the chief secretary to the Treasury, said on behalf of the government that Labour was \u201ctaking it too far\u201d with its proposals. \u201cWe set up the Financial Conduct Authority which is ensuring credit card firms do more to help their customers clear debt and, from January, rip-off credit card charges will be outlawed,\u201d she said. \u201cThe best way to help people with their personal finances is with our balanced approach to the economy, which is creating more well-paid jobs and cutting taxes for working people.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
