In a new interview, Zuckerberg also said it was \u201cjust wrong\u201d to think that Facebook is driven by conservatives. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the service is a rightwing echo chamber,\u201d Zuckerberg told Axios on HBO in an interview published on Wednesday. \u201cEveryone can use their voice and find media they trust that reflects the opinions and life experiences they\u2019re having.\u201d In the interview, Zuckerberg rejected the proposition that history will remember Facebook for hastening the destruction of society. \u201cI have a little more confidence in democracy than that. And I hope my confidence isn\u2019t misplaced,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWhat we do, and I think a lot of what the internet does overall, is give individuals more power.\u201d Critics of the tech CEO were quick to argue the platform does create an echo chamber for rightwing opinions. Parker Molloy, a writer and cultural critic at Media Matters for America, said Facebook had proved itself an echo chamber when it allowed hundreds of inaccurate ads funded by pro-Trump organizations. The ability of rightwing content related to the QAnon conspiracy theory, misleading claims about voting, and anti-LGBTQ+ content to spread easily on the platform despite supposed bans showed that Facebook was indeed \u201chighly partisan\u201d, said Malloy. \u201cZuckerberg may disagree with the characterization of Facebook as a rightwing echo chamber, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less true,\u201d she said. \u201cConservatives are thriving on Facebook, and they\u2019re able to do this thanks to inconsistently applied policy enforcement, internal ideological advocacy, and general rightwing favoritism.\u201d Zuckerberg acknowledged that conservative voices and opinions ranked as Facebook\u2019s most engaged content. \u201cIt\u2019s true that partisan content often has kind of a higher percent of people \u2026 engaging with it, commenting on it, liking it,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s important to differentiate that from, broadly, what people are seeing and reading and learning about on our service.\u201d Also in the Axios interview, the Facebook chief said he would not remove anti-vaxxer posts, even as the leading virus experts express cautious optimism that a Covid-19 vaccination may become available late this year or early next year. \u201cIf someone is pointing out a case where a vaccine caused harm or that they\u2019re worried about it \u2013 you know, that\u2019s a difficult thing to say from my perspective that you shouldn\u2019t be allowed to express at all,\u201d Zuckerberg said. But he denied that Facebook\u2019s algorithms are designed to push viewpoints \u201cthat are going to kind of enrage people somehow, and that\u2019s what we try to show people\u201d. \u201cThat\u2019s not actually how our systems work,\u201d he added. Zuckerberg reasoned instead that many people in the country \u201care very exercised and I think, frankly, for a lot of good reasons. And we have real issues. There is a fine line between an important level of high energy around an important issue and something that can kind of tilt over into causing harm.\u201d In an acknowledgment of Facebook\u2019s power in promoting misinformation, the company last week said it would block political advertising on the platform for seven days ahead of November\u2019s presidential election to help prevent the spread of misinformation. But he rejected a 30-day hold on political ads, saying that would be different because \u201cpeople want to be able to run get-out-the-vote campaigns\u201d, as well as respond to attacks and make closing arguments. Zuckerberg added that one red line he would decisively draw would be over threats to election officials \u2013 threats that \u201cwould obviously undermine the legitimacy of the election\u201d. Facebook, he said, would \u201cvery aggressively take down any threats against those people who are going to be involved in doing the counting and making sure that the election goes the way it\u2019s supposed to\u201d."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
