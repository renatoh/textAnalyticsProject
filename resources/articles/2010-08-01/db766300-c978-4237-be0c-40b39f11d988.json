Far too early, as usual, but it was possible to admire the wisdom of the decision, intentional or otherwise, to start off with the lower divisions. A week before the return of the behemoths, their supposed inferiors provided a day of outstanding entertainment, in which the outlines of proper football could be discerned. There were plenty of empty seats at Elland Road on Saturday, thanks to Ken Bates's pricing policy, but those who did turn up, and a much bigger television audience, were rewarded by an unpretentious and often exhilarating match between Leeds United and Derby County, illuminated by the midfield finesse of Kris Commons and the goalkeeping brilliance of Kasper Schmeichel. Elsewhere in the second tier there was an eye-opening display from a brilliant 17-year-old, Wilfried Zaha, at Crystal Palace, and a 30-yard strike from John Bostock, a former Palace prodigy on loan from Tottenham at Hull City and demonstrating that, at 18, the promise so richly evident at 15 might still be alive. All of them, and Schmeichel in particular, were helped by a ball which, instead of pinging around in the near\u2011weightless manner of the accursed Jabulani, was susceptible to the basic arts of control, pass, strike and save. But it would be premature to herald the launch of the Championship season as the start of a new age of enlightenment. The forthright Delia Smith, for example, spoke on Saturday morning of the absurdity of pouring millions into Fabio Capello's bank account while allowing Chester City to die. \"There's something radically wrong with football in this country and it needs a major thought,\" she told Radio 4, her words given authority by the millions of pounds of her own money invested in Norwich City. But football's sickness is not confined to England. Three cheers, then, for Michel Guyot, the chairman of Stade Brest, whose players are no longer allowed to wear headphones while on the club's business. Other clubs in France's Ligue 1, equally irritated by the way their stars symbolically cut themselves off from contact with the outside world, are following suit, and a similar ban now operates at Didier Deschamps's Marseille, the champions. It's a small gesture, but a worthwhile one. The French, of course, reacted to their World Cup squad's surly incompetence with a degree of revulsion that made the English public's response to the pathetic efforts of Capello's team seem like an exercise in benign tolerance. Only a personal visit from Thierry Henry, it is said, dissuaded Nicolas Sarkozy from rolling out the guillotine for the country's first public executions since 1939. But in England as much as in France, those headphones are a signal of the increasing distance between the players and the people who, through match tickets and satellite TV subscriptions, pay their grotesquely inflated salaries. Some of the players would claim that they are simply isolating themselves from those in the media whose only ambition, having built them up, is to cut them down. But since many of them choose to behave like fools (and right on cue, just days before an England match and in the week of the resumption of the Premier League, came another tabloid expos\u00e9), that particular line of defence convinces no one. Beware, too, of false indicators. On Sunday, a group of reporters waiting to talk to the players of Manchester United and Chelsea after the Community Shield noticed something unusual about the London club's representatives as they walked from the Wembley dressing rooms to their coach. Not one of them was wearing headphones. Not even Nicolas Anelka, who likes to use them to emphasise his remoteness from the rest of humanity. Had Carlo Ancelotti heard the news from France, and followed suit? Apparently not, according to a club spokesman yesterday. It was just a coincidence. No story there, then. The Premier League kicks off this weekend, but we may have to wait a little longer for a new dawn to break. Why silence of riders spoke volumes Since sport is so often criticised for its lack of an awareness of the world beyond its own boundaries, it seems worth recording an event that took place last Friday, when a stage of the Tour of Poland set off from Oswiecim, the Polish town better known since the second world war as Auschwitz. Before the start, the riders assembled outside the gate of the main extermination camp. Stijn Devolder, the Belgian champion, was the first to remove his helmet and sunglasses, and the rest followed suit. Silence reigned while a rider from each of the 34 countries in the field stepped forward to place a rose at the spot. \"The emotion,\" La Gazzetta dello Sport reported, \"had no nationality.\" It all falls into place for Platt once again Followers of David Platt's career in management may have been a little surprised to see him appointed as Manchester City's first-team coach, rejoining his former Sampdoria team\u2011mate Roberto Mancini. It was at the Genoese club, immediately after the end of his playing career, that Platt was installed as head coach in 1998. Eyebrows were raised by his decision to acquire Lee Sharpe on loan from Leeds. Sharpe made three underwhelming appearances and Platt resigned before the club were relegated at the end of the season. Two years later he was eased out of the Nottingham Forest manager's job, having spent millions on players, including three obscure Italians who hardly got off the bench. Next he was put in charge of England's Under-21s, a job from which he resigned after failing to qualify for the 2004 European Championship. Platt is a man who generally falls on either his feet or his wallet, the latter presumably providing a softer landing. It'll be interesting to see how this one goes. Monty the captain no match for the player Colin Montgomerie's wonderful record as a Ryder Cup player is as much the defining distinction of his career as his eight European Order of Merit titles, but his captaincy may be another matter. His unwise musings on the possible effect of Tiger Woods's broken marriage on the United States team, published in a recent newspaper column, sounded like a harbinger of disaster."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
