NFL team owners voted for New Orleans on Tuesday ahead of Miami, which had sought a record 11th Super Bowl, and 2008 host Glendale, Arizona. It is the 10th time New Orleans has been named as venue for the Super Bowl. New Orleans last hosted the event in 2002, when Adam Viniatieri's 48-yard field goal as time expired helped New England to a dramatic win over St. Louis."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
