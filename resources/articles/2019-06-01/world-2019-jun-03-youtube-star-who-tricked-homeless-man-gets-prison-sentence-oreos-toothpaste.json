A judge in Barcelona also banned Kanghua Ren, better known as ReSet, from having any social media accounts for five years. ReSet, who was born in China but grew up in Spain, was among the 200 most popular YouTubers in Spain and Latin America, with 1.1 million followers. In 2017 he accepted a dare to scrape the cream out of Oreo cookies and replace it with toothpaste. He found a Romanian man who was living on the streets of Barcelona, handed him the doctored biscuits and a \u20ac20 note, and filmed the encounter. The man later vomited. \u201cMaybe I went a little too far, but look on the bright side: this helped him clean his teeth,\u201d ReSet, 21, said. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s brushed them since he became poor.\u201d The video caused an uproar and was taken down after a few days. ReSet then sought out the homeless man and gave his daughter \u20ac300 to persuade her not to take legal action. The judge, Rosa Aragon\u00e9s, noted it was not an isolated event and the social media star had a propensity for \u201ccruel behaviour\u201d and preying on \u201ceasy or vulnerable victims\u201d. She found him guilty of violating the man\u2019s moral integrity. According to the sentence, seen by the Spanish newspaper El Pa\u00eds, Aragon\u00e9s concluded ReSet had \u201chumiliated and harassed a much older, vulnerable, homeless person \u2026 whose life had been blighted by alcoholism and living on the streets\u201d. The judge said he had done so \u201cto attract the sick attention of his followers\u201d and to boost the advertising revenues generated by the video. \u201cI do things to put on a show,\u201d ReSet had told the court. \u201cPeople like sick things.\u201d In Spain, custodial sentences of less than two years are suspended for first-time offenders."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
