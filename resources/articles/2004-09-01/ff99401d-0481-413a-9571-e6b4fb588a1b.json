Vikram Solanki: See off Glenn McGrath Vikram Solanki's latest reincarnation has renewed hope among the many who had sadly concluded that he was too loose to forge a successful England career. He has averaged nearly 40 this summer in five ODIs, and might yet become an inspiration to Britain's Anglo-Indians. But Glenn McGrath - even McGrath at the tail-end of his career - will test the extent of Solanki's improvement to the limit. New Zealand were one ball away from ending McGrath's mediocre new-ball spell prematurely; minutes later, he had three wickets and the match was as good as won. 2. Michael Vaughan: Go back to basics Michael Vaughan conceded yesterday that his one-day form had been \"a bit indifferent\". His average has plummeted to 23, and even though Australia's captain, Ricky Ponting, agrees that \"he is too good a player not to work it out,\" England urgently need answers. Vaughan could do worse than study videos of India's Rahul Dravid to remind himself how technical excellence can bring one-day success. His excessive desire to innovate has resulted in some costly misjudgments, the latest against Sri Lanka at the Rose Bowl on Friday. He needs to expand his game, not reinvent it. 3. Andrew Flintoff: Play it again, Fred Vaughan called Flintoff's hundred against Sri Lanka \"phenomenal\" and sees him as \"a player in full control of his game - a batsman who can score against any opponent on any wicket.\" But Australia represents the ultimate challenge. They have not missed an opportunity to suggest that Flintoff is bearing an onerous responsibility, that he is short of support, that he cannot remain successful for ever. A couple of steepling blows over the pavilion would suggest that the force is still with him. 4. Ashley Giles: Silence the critics In England, Ashley Giles commands new respect. The barrackers who briefly made him consider retiring from international cricket this summer were silenced with the most productive Test-bowling spells of his life. He can now fire it into the rough outside leg-stump with English nods of satisfaction at his durability. But Australians refuse to change their tune. Start a conversation about, say, Italian architecture and, minutes later, they still are harping on about how England are crazy picking Ashley Giles. It will take a stack of wickets to shut them up. He could start with a couple today. 5. The England side: Prove you can field This sounds a bit of a long shot. England have two dashing outfielders in Solanki and Paul Collingwood and even Solanki has dropped two comfortable catches in this tournament. As for the Australians, tuition from Mike Young, a former baseball coach, has toughened throwing arms and encouraged perpetual aggression and accuracy. England should remind themselves that this Australian side is getting old. Whatever Australia can achieve, in their advancing years, England need to emulate. And, if the first three catches go to Collingwood, all the better."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
