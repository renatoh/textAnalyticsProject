She has written some fine, pained and thoughtful songs, often dealing with ageing and unhappy relationships. Now comes a brave reworking of 10 of her songs, backed by a 63-piece orchestra and 15-voice choir, turning them into an imaginary film soundtrack: it works best when Vince Mendoza's arrangements don't disrupt her carefully observed storytelling. An epic buildup is fine for the grand and atmospheric Goodnight America, but a well-sung, delicate study of loneliness, Ideas Are Like Stars, is not helped by the swirl of strings and voices at the end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
