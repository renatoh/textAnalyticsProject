Manchester City gave the worst display of defending I have ever seen. There was a vacuum in their midfield, their backline held a dangerously high line and I can't remember City making one decent challenge for the ball. Thierry Henry, Dennis Bergkamp, Patrick Vieira, Robert Pires and Sylvain Wiltord must have thought they were playing a testimonial. If this had been a game Arsenal had to win to take the title ahead of Manchester United, I think the FA would have ordered an enquiry. Going forward City were decent. Nicolas Anelka was probably the best striker on view and Robbie Fowler is starting to shake off the rust. But if City want to make the top six they will have to put more emphasis on making life hard for the opposition. Time and again their attacks broke down and Arsenal went straight down the other end and either scored or created a chance. When Sol Campbell won the ball, he could feed it to an unmarked Gilberto Silva and the Brazilian had all sorts of options. Without City's wing-backs tracking the runs of Wiltord or Pires, and Vieira and Bergkamp free, Arsenal had acres of room. Marc-Vivien Foe doesn't have the discipline for a holding player and City would have been better off with Kevin Horlock than Djamel Belmadi. It didn't help that the City defence held such a high line. Henry had the pace to get behind them and you can't play offside if there's no pressure on the ball ahead of you and the opposition have time to pick a pass. Richard Dunne made three glaring errors for goals but at least he was near the danger area, unlike too many of his team-mates. The only way City won possession was when Arsenal played a careless or over-ambitious pass. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger will know his team cannot play at the same tempo against Ajax on Wednesday and expect the same result."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
