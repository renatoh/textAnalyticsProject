Kicked into the mainstream by Serial in 2014, given life by shows such as Dirty John, Dr Death, West Cork and To Live and Die in LA, true-crime podcasts are wildly popular. Usually I have to filter them out when it comes to reviews: there are so many of them, and often they\u2019re too disturbing and salacious for me. Still, to dismiss an entire genre is slack, and there\u2019s no denying that, like detective novels, some true-crime shows are excellent. Which ones you like will depend on what you\u2019re looking for. Do you want a case a week? If so, your best bet is Criminal (US) or They Walk Among Us (UK). If you\u2019d prefer a multi-episode narrative, there are many. They usually divide into cleanly solved murders and cases that still feel ambiguous. The solved ones focus on why it took so long for the murderer to be caught. The ambiguous ones build a story that the authorities have got the wrong guy. Culpable, from the US, is one of the latter. This is a new, investigative, true-crime podcast that \u201cexplores unsettled cases where the people who seem deserving of blame have somehow eluded justice\u201d (now there\u2019s a sentence that has been bashed into submission by lawyers). The first three episodes of its debut series have come out. Classy, with an S-Town-like theme tune and sympathetic presenting from US journalist Dennis Cooper, this series takes a long, hard look at the 2014 death of Christian Andreacchio. Andreacchio, 21, from Mississippi, supposedly shot himself in his apartment. The police closed the case in 45 minutes (!) and the investigating officer did not respond \u2013 ever \u2013 to the Andreacchio family\u2019s repeated efforts to get in touch with him. The family did not think that Andreacchio killed himself. So they tried getting local newspapers and TV stations interested, to no avail. They weren\u2019t even permitted to do a Three Billboards-style ad campaign. Still, the Andreacchios kept hold of all the information they could: police reports, photos, notes, everything. They believed the truth would out. Culpable is a careful podcast, and is respectful of the family. It spends the second episode delving into the life of Andreacchio himself, which seems correct. It\u2019s slow-moving, and you have to settle into its pacing, but it\u2019s shaping up to be an excellent show. I hope it results in something that relieves the family\u2019s distress. Man in the Window is very different. Pulitzer-prize winning journalist Paige St John is the show\u2019s researcher, writer and presenter, following the grim path of a Californian serial killer \u2013 the \u201cGolden State Killer\u201d \u2013 who raped and murdered his way through the 1970s and 80s. St John does an excellent job, but this is the type of podcast that I find difficult. Though she is careful to focus on the victims, this means that they simply get to tell an awful tale of rape, or near-rape, or of watching family members die in front of them. The show\u2019s sponsors, a home-security system, trade on the fear this engenders (Culpable also has adverts from a home security system). All true crime is there to scare you silly. Paradise, from 5 Live, which has just finished, is less upsetting. It\u2019s a gripping, and thorough, re-examination of a 1978 murder case in which a couple of young Mancunians, Chris Farmer and Peta Frampton, went to Belize on holiday and ended up at the bottom of the sea. It\u2019s presented by the excellent Stephen Nolan and Daniel Maudsley; I could have done without Nolan moaning about the number of flights he had to take, while I\u2019m never quite convinced by reporters claiming a personal interest (Maudsley\u2019s nan\u2019s house was around the corner from where the couple grew up), but these are small niggles. This is a gripping tale, without the usual BBC structural and pacing problems, and it goes to places you don\u2019t expect. Recommended. And finally, Death in Ice Valley, the successful re-examination of the Norwegian \u201cIsdal woman\u201d case, has an extra episode! Listeners have uncovered new evidence (sometimes literally) about the 1970 case of the woman found dead in Bergen, so fans should catch up. Phew. That\u2019s enough death for me, thanks. Three new funny female-centred podcasts Daddy, Look at Me A provocative title, but this is essentially a \u201cmates chatting\u201d show. Comedians Helen Bauer and Rosie Jones talk to another comedian, such as Nish Kumar, Sophie Duker and Ed Gamble, about their early family life. Jones, who has cerebral palsy, talks in a manner that requires concentrated listening, which I like, and the atmosphere is convivial and amusing. Also, sometimes, a smidgen too hyper, which means that everyone chats over each other. Once Bauer and Jones settle down and remember to concentrate on the guest, this is an engaging listen. Fat Lot of Good Presented by one half of the excellent Scummy Mummies, Helen Thorne, this new podcast looks at every aspect of having a body that\u2019s deemed too fat for a thin world. Thorne is intelligent as well as hilarious, unafraid of examining both the positive and negative sides of how we feel and what we do with our bodies, as well as how our relationship with them changes over time. Her guests are wild swimmers, fat activists, cancer sufferers, tattooists and self-confessed showoffs. Honest, interesting and celebratory. Who Exploded Vivien Stone? From Kill the Beast theatre company, this comedy-horror drama is packed with excellent comic actors and a daft concept explored to its nth degree. Vivien Stone is \u2013 was \u2013 a Hollywood actor who was once, says the blurb, \u201call over the silver screen. Now she\u2019s all over the wall.\u201d Set on a film set in 1973, with requisite time-warp cast, is the murderer still on the loose? (Yes.) Packed with awful puns, the show\u2019s high jokes-per-minute ratio batters you into laughter. All eight episodes have been released at once, so this one\u2019s ripe for bingeing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
