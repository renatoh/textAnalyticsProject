From its launch in January 2014, Looking was weighed down by expectations it could never truly deliver on. Is HBO\u2019s Looking the great gay TV series some of us have been waiting for?, read a headline when the show was first announced in 2013, summing up the pressure Looking\u2019s creator, Weekend writer/director Andrew Haigh, had in making a series centered mostly on gay characters. As the first series to center on the lives of gay men since Showtime\u2019s Queer as Folk, which concluded in 2005 after a five-season run, Looking was cause for celebration by a community that\u2019s often shown the cold shoulder by major TV studios and Hollywood. But with that goodwill also came intense scrutiny. Starved for representation in mainstream media, gay audiences rightly wanted to see their experience reflected in the show. Looking ultimately didn\u2019t deliver on that universal front \u2013 instead opting to focus on the specific journeys of a group of close gay friends in San Francisco. The first season started out unsteadily, with uneven characterizations and a rather torpid pace. It found its groove mid-season during an episode titled Looking at the Future, which devoted all of its time to tracking an eventful day between the show\u2019s protagonist, video game designer Patrick (Groff) and his hairdresser love interest Richie. Suddenly, Looking felt alive and singular. By the time the second season concluded, which included the introduction of an HIV-positive character, Looking had begun to find its voice as a sexy, graceful and deftly moving series depicting a group of imperfect gay men slowly coming into their own. That voice will have its swansong in HBO\u2019s upcoming feature-length special, Looking: the Movie, which the cable channel greenlit shortly after canceling the show. It\u2019s too early to say if the film will tie up loose ends left by the show\u2019s finale (will Patrick, returning to San Francisco for a wedding after moving to Colorado, end up with Richie?) to offer fans a definite conclusion. Regardless, the trailer looks stellar. \u201cSometimes you got to leave things behind to move forward,\u201d Richie says to Patrick in the trailer, most likely conveying Haigh\u2019s sentiments to the TV industry and Hollywood (his last film, 45 Years, was hugely acclaimed and earned Charlotte Rampling an Oscar nomination). Although Looking ended much too soon, hopefully the gap it left should encourage a diverse slate of gay-themed shows and films to emerge. Looking: the Movie airs on HBO 23 July."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
