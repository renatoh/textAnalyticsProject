The football year in revue", "bodyText": "The venue is new, there have been untold production problems and numerous changes of personnel but from the moment when Sven the hapless Swedish philatelist announces \"I must urgently fill the dishwasher\", only to be met with the response from a raffish Leslie Phillips, \"I think you'll find she's actually a typist, old boy\", the audience knows it is in safe hands with this latest in the long-running line of Football Association farces. While lacking the knowing sophistication of vintage Swiss comedies such as There's A Brown Envelope In My Soup, the British farce has robust charms of its own and they are wantonly displayed here. Anyone who enjoyed Ooh La La There Goes Our Manager! When Did You Last See Your National Stadium? (now in its fourth rollicking year) or last season's Three Piece Swede will undoubtedly find plenty to tickle them in Swede FA! While the acting director of directing actors David Davies's production includes a few modern flourishes - a Greek chorus of men in smug shirts, Hansen (Ronnie Corbett), Reidy (Stan Boardman) and Lawro (Larry Grayson), and an operatic interlude during which Sven's travelling companion, the mysterious Nancy (a spectacularly over made-up Anita Dobson), impales herself on one of her fingernails while singing that lovely aria from the Barber of Seville, Una Voce Poco FA - he has not tinkered too much with the principle laid out decades ago by the father of Lancaster Gate farces, Sir Bert Millichip: \"When in doubt, have a man enter the room and jangle some balls in a velvet bag.\" So, true to type, Swede FA!'s plot is extremely slow-moving, the set designs (by Sir Norman Foster) are rickety, there are peripheral characters with ridiculous names (Athole, Grip, Loos), and so many blazered cast members it is hard to remember who anyone is. But the formula is plainly popular with audiences and on the night I saw it they were clutching their sides, rolling in the aisles and wheezing, \"Good God, this is even funnier than the Glenn Hoddle World Cup Diary farce.\" Much of the enjoyment is down to some superbly judged central performances, not least by Billy Bob Thornton, who reprises his title role from the film The Man Who Wasn't There as the FA chairman Geoff Thompson. Molly Sugden is also on imperious form in a hilarious cameo appearance as the love interest for Wayne Rooney. But the three lions' share of the plaudits must be reserved for Sven-Goran Eriksson. The actor, who made a name for himself in Bloody Swede And Tears opposite Ulrika Jonsson, is superb as the bespectacled stamp collector, managing to squeeze out the laughs while all the while appearing so bland and lifeless he seems to be perpetually teetering on the edge of a coma. Swede FA! begins when Sven wanders into the offices of the Football Association thinking it is a post office. Here he blunders into an interview for the national team manager's position (\"Yes, I am here about the post\") and - echoes of Chance the Gardener in Hal Ashby's Being There - quickly impresses the committee men with a series of dull comments about stamps (\"The marking must not be smudged. A complete envelope is of untold value\") that persuade them he is a football genius. Sven is soon not only awarded the job but handed a massive salary after taking an apparently tough negotiating position: \"In every country for first-class service it is necessary to pay a little extra.\" Ensconced in his office, completely unable to fathom what is going on around him, the bemused Norseman nevertheless creates chaos everywhere he goes - not least for his boss, the tough-talking Palios (Brian Blessed). Our hero is knowingly aided by Sir Reginald Blazer (the superb Leslie Phillips), whose lifelong service to football has not dulled the twinkle in his eye. \"It's generally a desk job but, if you're lucky, you'll get to do it on the swivel chairs as well, you swine,\" Sir Reginald advises Sven with a wink. Enter new secretary Faria (a welcome return to the stage for Pamella Bordes). \"My name is Alam,\" she announces. \"Well, well,\" growls Sir Reginald, \"you've certainly set my bells ringing.\" Faria claims to be \"committee-man phobic\" but quickly falls for Palios. Sadly his claim to be the hard man of football administration proves not to be quite the double entendre she hoped, even after her offer to help him with greater transparency in all areas. Faria's debut meeting with Sven is not promising. \"Philately will get you nowhere,\" she quips as he attempts to interest her in a first-day cover. But like so many others before her, she soon finds herself seduced by the Swede's banal references to his hobby, swooning with delight when he looks her in the eye during a romantic lunch of pickled herrings and smoked puffin and announces that \"to the true collector, it is the imperfect ones that are the most valuable\". Unhappily, word quickly gets out about the couple's liaison and they find themselves pursued by cocaine-snorting journalist Frank Gutt (Leslie Grantham) - a man with a nose for a scoop and vice versa - and a character named Max Clifford (Ricky Gervais), whom I found the least convincing in the entire production. As in all farces, the whole rapidly accelerating train of silliness could be brought to a juddering halt at any time simply by somebody holding up his hand and telling the truth. This being Soho Square, however, nobody even considers doing that. Instead, when the press demands answers, the FA communications director Colin Gibson (John Sessions) tells Palios to hide in a cupboard and gets Sven to stand in the corner with a lampshade on his head. He then tells the assembled reporters that neither man actually exists while pointing at Sven and mouthing the words \"serial shagger\". Gutt's reply - \"what, he has sex with cornflakes?\" - is hardly what Gibson was seeking and soon he has quite literally spun himself into the ground, fracturing a gas main as he does so. The resulting explosion brings down FA HQ and the curtain with a sudden crunch. Swede FA! is not subtle or intellectually challenging in any way but it does provide weeks of uncomplicated and truly British entertainment. And those who complain there is little innovative in it are advised to remember the words one of the most successful farceurs of all time, Graham Kelly: \"If Lancaster Gate ain't broke, then give a few bob to the Welsh when no one's looking.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
