Indeed, Liverpool's Rafael Benitez can count himself in a minority of one. Twice in recent months he has been denied a coveted trophy by Benitez - first in last season's Champions League semi-final, then subsequently in the tortuous summer battle for the heart and mind of Steven Gerrard. Unusually for Chelsea, they go into Wednesday's Champions League group tie seeking vengeance. Benitez, though, has already moved on from his side's dramatic victory last April and claims to have watched the tape just once. One more time than he has watched a video of the final triumph over AC Milan. Certainly he has not been taken in by early season talk of Chelsea's invincibility. 'They have a stronger squad which counts over the season, but we showed last year that in any given game we can match them,' he said. If the Anfield victory demonstrated Chelsea could be beaten on the pitch, albeit by a goal even Benitez accepts didn't cross the line, the success in keeping Gerrard offered hope that Roman Abramovich's billions won't always talk loudest when it comes to contract negotiations. 'The most important thing for Stevie is that he is here with his people,' Benitez said. 'It is not a case of whether he can win more or less trophies. To be in a stadium in an atmosphere when you know you are really, really important. You are not one more player, you are the key player for the club and I think that for him, that what is important for him. 'Chelsea have a lot of good players, and some key players. Here, he is the captain. He can be a legend here. Now he is a legend, but by winning two or three more things people will talk about Gerrard for years.' After their late, late home win against the unregarded Thun, Arsenal travel to Ajax in the latest round of games in Group B on Tuesday and Arsene Wenger is well aware that the young Dutch side, who drew 1-1 away to Sparta Prague, can be dangerous. 'There is a lack of maturity to command the championship, but they can be very dangerous against the big teams,' he said. 'If they stay together they will certainly become a big team again. At the moment they are a bit young, but if you let them play they can beat any team in Europe.' Ajax are in trouble in their domestic league, seven points behind leaders AZ Alkmaar. There is danger in the side, however, with new Sweden international striker Markus Rosenberg, South Africa winger Steven Pienaar and 18-year-old Ryan Babel, all playing up front in a 4-3-3 formation. At 21, Wesley Sneijder is the authoritative force in midfield, but he is struggling to carry a team that has only won one of their past 10 Champions League games. Manchester United - without the suspended Wayne Rooney after his red card in the 0-0 draw with Villarreal - welcome Benfica to Old Trafford, the Portuguese champions having beaten Lille 1-0 in their first game. The goal was scored by former Italy international Fabrizio Miccoli. He links well with Portugal striker Nuno Gomes in attack. At the San Siro, Rangers take on the talented, but inconsistent Inter. Brazilian Adriano, one of the best forwards in the world, should be partnered by Obafemi Martins, who runs 100m in 10.8sec. In midfield, coach Roberto Mancini tries to balance the attacking instincts of Dejan Stankovic, Juan Sebastian Veron and Luis Figo with the tenacity of Real Madrid-reject Esteban Cambiasso. The defence should be much better this season after the arrival of Walter Samuel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
