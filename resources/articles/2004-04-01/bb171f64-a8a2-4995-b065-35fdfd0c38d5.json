Now, as if from nowhere, the Frenchman finds himself facing the supreme test of his managerial abilities. Having gone four games without a win and with difficult opponents to come, should Arsenal fail to beat Liverpool this afternoon or Newcastle on Sunday then come Monday I wouldn't be surprised to see them playing catch-up to Chelsea in the league. The turnaround in Arsenal has been incredible but their reaction will determine the fate of the Premiership title. Had Arsenal beaten Manchester United in the FA Cup semi-final and then edged beyond Chelsea in Europe they'd have won both their league matches this weekend on adrenalin alone, no problem. Instead they've come away bedraggled and weary, perhaps more in the mind than in body. Now they are going to have to show their character as much as they ever have - one or two senior players are going to have to stand up and be counted if they are to salvage something from this season. Even to admit that as much would have sounded ridiculous seven days ago but, to a certain extent Ars\u00e8ne has only got himself to blame. Certain incidents change games and give teams confidence. Ashley Cole's last-minute header against Dynamo Kiev in the Champions League group stage was one, allowing Arsenal to really take off. They won at a canter for a while after that and looked untouchable. But Wenger's substitutions in their league game with United at the end of last month could prove to be another defining moment. By substituting Jos\u00e9 Antonio Reyes, Robert Pires and Freddie Ljungberg towards the end of that game when their lead was only slender, then replace the Swede with a centre-half in Pascal Cygan on the left wing, the manager handed the initiative to United. It gave the visitors the confidence to push forward and test just how invincible Arsenal really were. They subsequently scored, the gloss was taken off, and United carried the confidence they had gained over to the semi-final at Villa Park a week later. Those were a massive 10 minutes in the season. By retreating into their shell Arsenal showed vulnerability for the first time. If United had lost that league game there is no way they would have gone on and won in the Cup. Instead that was the first chink of light they had seen all season and they seized it. They no longer looked like a side who thought Arsenal were by far the best team in the country. So the air of invincibility was lost and the decision to play J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Aliadi\u00e8re from the start in that match still baffles me. As well as Nwankwo Kanu, Wenger had Sylvain Wiltord coming back, champing at the bit to earn himself a new contract at the club and surely his experience would have been a better bet. It was just another sign that the initiative was being surrendered. If you'd told Arsenal they'd be 12 points clear of Sir Alex Ferguson's side going into Easter it would have been beyond their wildest dreams. Now they're desperately reaching for the finishing tape and wouldn't mind scraping the title by a single goal. It's like a golfer who's two up with three to play and suddenly feels a bit out of nick; he's leading the pack, but he's also running out of form while the chasers are coming into their own. At least Wenger shouldn't need to deliver much of a team talk today. His players should be desperate to get out there and make amends. All the manager has to do is keep emphasising the fact that they are not tired. He has to tell them they're as fresh as daisies, as if it was the first game of the season, but that people are expecting them to slip up now. That will bring the character out of them. If I was in his shoes I'd make a few changes, though nothing radical. The goalkeeper Jens Lehmann is better than the David Seaman of last season, but I still think there are a few flaws in him, which is worrying. Thankfully the back four are still solid. I'd drop Ljungberg in midfield - he isn't showing anything like the form he's capable of - and go with the solidity of someone like Gilberto Silva. But it's up front where I'd really change things. If Thierry Henry fails his fitness test, I'd go with Dennis Bergkamp and Kanu and hope one of them dinks one in. I know Reyes did well against Chelsea, but he isn't the out-and-out leading man yet and it may be asking too much of him at the moment. They need some of the older heads to come good again because, given what's happened to them this week, they'll definitely need a win this weekend to prevent their season turning into a disaster."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
