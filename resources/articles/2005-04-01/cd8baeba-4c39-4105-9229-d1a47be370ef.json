I would like to put money aside for them but am not sure of the best way to go about it. I work in the National Health Service and my income has recently improved, so I would like to save \u00a3500 a month, or possibly more, for their benefit. After the recent death of my brother, I have discovered that he appointed me trustee of a sum of \u00a3300,000 to invest for his four children aged four, six, eight and 10. I have little idea of what to do with this money. My personal circumstances are comfortable and unlikely to change. I live in London, renting a flat that is perfect for my needs and remarkably good value. It is worth \u00a3600,000, so to buy something comparable would be impossible and I have no wish to do so anyway. My parents helped my siblings to purchase their own properties, so my mother's house in Northern Ireland will pass to me when she dies and I intend to live there when I retire. I have some savings (\u00a320,000) spread between a bank account and cash Isas. I have no debts. I already have life insurance, critical illness cover, and an NHS pension. I pay \u00a3100 a month into an AVC scheme with Lincoln that I was persuaded to start around 15 years ago. I earn significantly more than my five siblings without all their costs. We are a close family and I see my responsibilities as being to assist the others financially. I want to be equitable to all my 'niblings' and assist mainly with their higher education and early adult life costs. However, one - now nine years old - is severely autistic, and will require lifelong support. Should I consider a single pot in my name or should I do something for each individually, and where should I invest?' You need to save more for the older ones With 16 children to save for, across a wide range of ages, it will be hard to save fairly for all. The simplest approach would be to split your monthly saving equally, but this will disadvantage the older ones because your savings will not have as much time to grow. Barry O'Neill of independent financial adviser Clark Thomson Shepherd suggests you stagger your savings: 'The savings for those aged 10 or over should be at least \u00a350 a month, with the balance spread between the others on a sliding scale, with the smallest amount to the youngest. As and when Paul stops saving for the eldest ones, when they reach financial independence, he can divert their savings to the younger ones.' You may want to make a further adjustment to reflect the greater needs of your autistic nephew and you may also wish to bear in mind that the baby of the family will qualify for a Child Trust Fund voucher from the government worth at least \u00a3250, which his parents can invest for his future and to which you can add. The risk of putting the savings into the children's names is that they will be able to access the money themselves when they reach 18, if not before. By investing the money in your own name you would retain a greater degree of control. Darryll Connor of financial adviser Towry Law says you could set up a family trust fund or individual trust funds for this purpose, but you would need to seek professional advice. The advantage of investing in the children's names, on the other hand, is that their tax allowances can be used, rather than your own, so any interest could be set off against their personal allowances. But if you decide to invest for each individually, it will be hard to stick to one investment type. Justin Modray of independent financial adviser Bestinvest says: 'Cash might be most appropriate for those entering higher education and likely to want to use the money within the next five years. However, stock market-based investments will be more appropriate for the younger children, who might have 15 years or more until they want to use the savings.' For the cash savings, a high-interest account in the child's name would be appropriate. The eldest two would be eligible for mini-cash Isas, which are open to anyone aged 16 or over. These accounts usually generate higher rates of interest than ordinary savings accounts. For the stock market investments, Modray recommends unit trusts as the simplest option. He suggests using the same fund for all to avoid future arguments. Modray likes Jupiter Merlin Growth fund, while O'Neill's favourites include Rathbone Global Opportunities, Templeton Growth, Newton UK Opportunities and Jupiter Undervalued Assets. But the drawback with these funds is that the minimum monthly savings are \u00a350-\u00a3100. A more suitable trust for your purposes may therefore be the M&amp;G Index Tracker fund, which mirrors the performance of the UK stock market, has very low charges - 0.3 per cent a year - and a minimum investment of just \u00a310 a month. Giving specific advice about how the \u00a3300,000 trust money should be invested is difficult without more information, say advisers. Connor points out: 'It is important to consider what calls may be made on the capital and at what point. It depends on the type of trust that is set up in the will. For example, does income need to be generated for the maintenance of the children and if so how much?' As trustees have a legal obligation to manage the trust properly, it is essential that you obtain suitable investment advice from an independent financial adviser. It is also important not to lose sight of your own financial position and longer-term security. You are fortunate to be a member of the NHS final salary pension scheme, but your choice of AVC is of concern. Modray says: 'This is likely to be a free-standing AVC and a potentially poor option compared with contributing more money directly into the NHS scheme to buy additional years' service, or into the AVC connected to the NHS scheme.' You may have a case for having been mis-sold your FSAVC if this was not pointed out to you at the time. Write to Lincoln stating your complaint. If you do not get a satisfactory reply contact the Financial Ombudsman Service. In any case, you should review the performance of your FSAVC. You may be able to make a switch but you will need to consider possible penalties. Finally, don't forget that you need to make a will. Paul's to-do list 1. Decide whether you want to stay in control or put your savings into your 'niblings' names. 2. Consult an adviser if you want to set up a trust - otherwise decide how much to save for each child. 3. With individual savings, use cash accounts for money needed in the next five years or so, but consider unit trusts for longer-term savings. 4. Seek professional advice on how best to invest the \u00a3300,000 trust set up for your brother's children. IFA promotion can provide names of suitable advisers (tel 0800 085 3250, or www.unbiased.co.uk). 5. Consider a mis-selling complaint to Lincoln about your FSAVC; review their costs and performance. 6. Make your will."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
