It's a big three points \u2013 it gets us to 42. No one can even start to predict how many you need to stay in the league but no way is 50 going to be enough. But we are on a good run. We threw away 21 points at the start of the season, but we're catching up.\" Paul Ince said the loss of midfielder Barry Ferguson to a head injury is a big blow to Blackpool's own fight against the drop. \"He's pivotal to the way we play. We have to understand that we're in a fight now.\" Sheffield Wednesday 0-2 Cardiff City The former Cardiff manager Dave Jones backed his old side for the title after they ended a three-game winless run at Hillsborough \u2013 but was unimpressed by their performance. \"It looks like they're going to limp over the line. They're the ones in pole position, they've spent an awful lot of money so I'm sure they have to go up.\" Malky Mackay, though, was delighted with what he saw. \"We've been top since 24 November and it's a long time to be there and be shot at, discussed, debated \u2013 I'm very pleased with our mental strength. We were up against a side who need to win games to stay out of the relegation zone so we knew it would be a battle.\" And the rest \u2026 Derby ended their eight-game winless run by beating play-off chasing Leicester 2-1. \u25a0 Millwall manager Kenny Jackett praised Shane Lowry for his \"Gareth Bale-style\" free-kick that sealed a 2-0 win at Charlton. Jermaine Easter, signed on loan from Crystal Palace, scored the opener with his first touch. \u25a0 Leeds were beaten 2-1 at home by Huddersfield, prompting Neil Warnock to confirm he expects to be replaced in the summer \u2013 and has held talks with the club's owners about helping choose his successor. \u25a0 Barnsley beat promotion-chasing Watford 1-0, a result that left manager David Flitcroft \"completely buzzing\". \u25a0 Ipswich ended Bolton's surge towards the play-offs, winning 1-0 via a late Carlos Edwards strike. \u25a0 And Middlesbrough suffered another setback, beaten 1-0 at home by Birmingham."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
