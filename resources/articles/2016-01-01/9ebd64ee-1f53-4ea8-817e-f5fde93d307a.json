Cutting emissions in cities is critical: they make up only 2% of the world\u2019s total land area, but produce up to 70% of its climate emissions from human activity, according to a 2011 United Nations report. As they work to reduce emissions, governments and public agencies \u2013 which often lack the resources to tackle the weighty global warming problem alone \u2013 are increasingly looking to the private sector for help, says Robert Puentes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program thinktank. \u201cTackling climate change \u2013 particularly from a transportation perspective \u2013 will require these kinds of partnerships largely because traditional governments and public agencies are underperforming,\u201d Puentes said. \u201cThe public sector often does not have the capacity or expertise to design, finance, execute and sustain policies that work, so these partnerships are helping fill the vacuum with a new kind of problem solving.\u201d In one of the most recent examples, the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, a consortium of the world\u2019s largest cities, has enlisted an unusual partner to help reduce tailpipe emissions: MasterCard. It\u2019s one of the largest public-private partnerships aimed at fighting climate change so far. The consortium \u2013 which includes more than 80 cities around the world, including London, Bangkok, Cape Town, New York and San Francisco \u2013 says its members collectively emit over 300m tons of carbon dioxide per year from transportation alone, or close to Poland\u2019s total emissions from fossil fuels. The partnership, announced last month, will set up what\u2019s called a mobility management network, which will connect city staff members to each other and to experts to come up with ideas to nudge people to use public transportation more often. \u201cThese types of measures are all relatively low-cost, compared to investing in a new transport infrastructure, and are therefore of interest to a number of cities,\u201d says Gunjan Parik, director of C40\u2019s Transportation Initiative. \u201cThey also allow money to flow back into city coffers to deliver further improvements to public transit.\u201d Through face-to-face workshops and other events, as well as virtually through webinars, phone calls and a private online forum, cities and transportation experts will have ample opportunities to share their knowledge and brainstorm for answers on topics including parking, ticketing, congestion and integrating different modes of transportation. MasterCard is working with cities to enable commuters to pay for bus and subway fares more easily, instead of needing to buy tickets in a separate step or having to carry cash or exact change. In London, for example, the company has helped create a system in which riders can use contactless bank cards or mobile phones to pay for fares. \u201cAround 85% of the world\u2019s transactions are still done in cash, which not only weighs as an inconvenience and a cost on our economies, but also facilitates crime,\u201d says Hany Fam, president of MasterCard Enterprise Partnerships. A study by Tuft University found that using cash costs American society about $200bn per year, from fees paid for using ATMs to lost tax revenues from unreported transactions. C40 officials said their approach to solving transportation problems has achieved success in other initiatives. San Francisco created SFpark programme, which adjusts meter and garage pricing according to demand, helps drivers find available parking spaces quickly and reduces air pollution and congestion in the process. Milan\u2019s Area C programme, which requires each vehicle that enters the city center on weekdays to pay a roughly \u20ac5 ($5.46) congestion charge, reduced the number of cars entering the restricted area by nearly one third this year compared to 2011, before the program was launched. According to Fam, the success of the initiative with MasterCard will be measured over the next three years by looking at the number of lessons shared and adopted between cities and assessing how much these sustainable transportation projects contribute to the reduction of carbon emissions in cities. \u201cThe biggest thing we can do to truly make a difference in terms of emissions is to get people out of single occupancy vehicles and using whatever combination of bike sharing, walking, shuttles and so on,\u201d said Sharon Feigon, executive director of the Shared Use Mobility Center, a national, public interest organization which advocates for car- and bike-sharing. \u201cAll of these modes together are enormously more efficient than the private automobile.\u201d While new payment systems can greatly improve the public transportation system, they alone aren\u2019t enough to nudge people to forego driving or owning cars. Finding the right strategies to encourage people to take buses and trains is a big challenge. It remains to be seen whether simpler payments and better communication will make a significant difference. \u201cInformation and technology transfer is very important in the adoption of shared mobility concepts,\u201d said Susan Shaheen, adjunct professor and co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take many different strategies to accomplish these goals, and we need a vast set of transportation options.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false}}}
