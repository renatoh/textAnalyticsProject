Irina Andriyanova, of the emergency situations ministry, said that a short-circuit caused a hot water pipe to burst. Workers hoped to restore power later in the evening, but with temperatures of around -37C (-35F), workers were emptying water from the system to prevent main supply pipes from freezing, she said. She added that most homes had small heating stoves that could keep rooms from freezing entirely but there was no hot tap water."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
