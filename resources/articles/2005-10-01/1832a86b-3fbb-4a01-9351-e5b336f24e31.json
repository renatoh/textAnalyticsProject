Press it and you're in a world of interactive broadcast possibilities, but its prosaic name reflects the prosaic uses that TV advertisers have so far put it to. An ad for a Chemical Brothers album (called Push The Button, appropriately) allowed you to sample some tracks, an Adidas spot offered some bonus ball play between Jonny and Becks, and that's about it. So it's great to see another advertiser putting the red button to good use. A new commercial for Smirnoff allows viewers to choose different explanations as to why a man in a car takes the ring off his finger and gives it to the woman sitting next to him. There's the Jude Law reason - he confesses to an affair and, as a result, is no longer in love with her. There's the Sienna Miller reason - he announces his knowledge of her affair and as a result is no longer in love with her. And there's the romantic reason - he wants to give her his ring because he's truly, madly, deeply in love with her. A triple ending that enriches your viewing experience, just as triple- distilled Smirnoff enhances your drinking experience. Of course it's a great example of an advertiser using a piece of new technology that all advertisers must tackle sooner or later, and without the usual gaucheness that often accompanies technology-embracing advertising. But perhaps it's even more interesting as an inadvertent solution to one of advertising's eternal divides. For as long as I can remember, there have been two schools of advertising thought. The first believes that great advertising is populist advertising; advertising gets down with the people and tries to be their mate and tries to slip some new catchy language into their everyday parlance such as \"Wassup\" (inspired) and \"Zoom zoom zoom\" (lamentable). Many argue that this is the right approach. Commercial business talks in terms of competitive indexes and margin parameters and it's the job of advertising to translate business preoccupations into simple propositions to which \"normal people\" can relate. This approach has its critics though, one of whom is Steve Henry, creative head of HHCL Red Cell and one of the most famed brains in advertising. \"I don't understand why 99% of advertising shoots for the lowest common denominator and fails to respect the intelligence of the consumer,\" he says. He is firmly of the other school of thought: that great advertising always shows respect for the consumers and one way to do this is to respect a consumer's brainpower. Vorsprung Durch Technik, the Economist posters, and Henry's own avant-garde work for First Direct - showing ordinary pictures of wellington boots and radiators for an extraordinary bank - are all good examples of this approach. But there are dangers here too. Communication that \"pitches it up\" can often feel smug, or, worse still, arty and pretentious - witness last year's baffling ads for 3 featuring giant jellyfish and singing cherries. Henry is also wary of another potential pitfall. \"I worry about the vacuous way in which advertising asks you to aspire. Yes, we're all Thatcher's children and so aspiration is in our DNA, but is that a nice or responsible thing to appeal to?\" To ingratiate or to stimulate? That is the question, and one that interactivity can unexpectedly answer. When I buy a CD on Amazon, it's an incredibly interesting transaction. Throughout the selection process I never feel that Amazon is talking to me in a smug or pretentious way or asking me to climb a vacuous social ladder, but when I click that last click and buy, I feel incredibly clever. And when I do a food shop on Ocado, I feel almost a genius. And that's because I'm participating, not spectating. If the Smirnoff commercial was merely a spectacle - another 60-second ad consumed as a piece of linear communication - then yes you could accuse it of being smug and pretentious. You could sit back, fold your arms and critique the commercial for being too arthouse in the way it's shot, or for being too quirky and Bohemian in the way it's cast. But thanks to the red button, the Smirnoff commercial is not a spectacle, it's a story and a story that you're right in the middle of. When you watch the ad, the protagonist isn't the Bohemian man, it's you, and so the ad makes you feel good. Because you're controlling the plotline, the ad makes you feel clever. Flattery, as they say, gets you everywhere. Make mine a Smirnoff. The industry has been on tenterhooks about the BA pitch, more than for any other I can remember. Was it going to stay with M&amp;C Saatchi? Could DDB snaffle it to Paddington? Rumours flew, odds grew and shortened, and then finally last week we got the verdict. And so the World's Favourite Airline is now Bartle Bogle Hegarty's favourite too. Its rumoured pitch-winning line, \"Upgrade to BA\" is certainly not the balls-out line that \"The world's favourite airline\" was. But maybe this is not a balls-out age. BA's work through Saatchis and then through M&amp;C Saatchis put Britishness elegantly at the centre of the world, but as the years went by and the century changed that tack was starting feel increasingly anachronistic. BBH's line suggests a drive for business customers combined with a pitched battle against the low-cost leisure carriers, and as such feels a whole lot more pragmatic. If this is a more pragmatic time, and if BA have the product and service differences to support such a claim, then maybe it will work. It will be fascinating to see. \u00b7 Naresh Ramchandani is creative partner at Karmarama advertising and design agency"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
