The rain is lashing against the window, and opposite the pub the water in the harbour looks dangerously close to flooding the road. After our journey from Belfast, when a wave crashed over the road on top of our hire car, we're in no hurry to move on. Thankfully the pub is the perfect place to while away a few hours. The Londonderry Arms in Carnlough is a handsome ivy-clad inn that was built in 1848 and once owned by Churchill. As you walk through the front door, the green Victorian wallpaper and mounted moose's head in the hallway make you feel as if you've stepped into an old country home. Eventually the rain clears and we decide to drive north. As the sun breaks through the clouds we're glad we dragged ourselves away from the fire. The coast road that cuts through the Glens of Antrim is spectacular and ever-changing. One minute we're in a deep valley lipped by a gentle bay, the next on a windswept headland. We drive through the pretty villages of Cushendall and Cushendun, and through a more sheltered area of enclosed farmland with fields of impossible green hemmed in by ancient hedgerows. We take a turning for Torr Head and drive down a muddy farm lane to park. Following a track bordered by gorse, we then climb a steep path to a disused military observation point. Below, a piece of marshy land dotted with slabs of white marble gives way to cliffs and the crashing waves below. It's at this point that the sun comes out, lighting up a glittering path all the way to the Mull of Kintyre, just 13 miles to the east. We're amazed to read in our guide book that local Protestants once rowed this stretch of water to get to church in Scotland. Moving on, we head for the Giant's Causeway. Despite seeing countless pictures of the site, nothing prepares you for the sheer weirdness of the place. The hexagonal stones are apparently the result of lava cooling after a volcanic eruption. The result is a mass of tightly packed hexagonal basalt columns - ranging in height from 40 feet to ones barely emerging from the sea - that makes you forget science and just stare in wonder. It's easy to see why the place was once billed as the eighth wonder of the world. In the evening we stop in Portrush for dinner at the Ramore Wine Bar. In contrast to the ancient mysticism of the Causeway, the bar is a modern, upbeat restaurant that serves dishes such as bang-bang chicken and grilled turbot around a curving sweep of bar. The next day, under more grey sky, we take a walk in Murlough Bay, a small stretch of coastline that belongs to the National Trust. It's a bracing climb from a rugged bay up through old woodland and over crunchy, fern covered fields. Today Scotland is obscured by cloud but this doesn't spoil things for us. We meet no one and, despite being just a couple of hours from the bustle of Belfast, we feel as if we're in an untouched wilderness. Lunch that day, a delicious bowl of chowder washed down with yet another pint of Guinness, is in Mary McBride's tiny bar in Cushendun. The village bears more than a passing resemblance to a Cornish fishing hamlet. The landlord, Lord Cushendun, commissioned Clough William-Ellis, the architect behind Portmerion in Wales, to build the place. The result is a collection of pretty yet sturdy white washed cottages sitting under slate roofs. The next morning there's time for a last stop en route back to Belfast. Heading north on our first day in thick rain, we had passed through Glenarm, the southernmost town in the glens, and barely seen the place. Today, we discover a pretty village with a Scottish accent - solid looking houses painted in soft pastel colours. We have a quick browse in Steensons, wishing we had just a little more money for its exquisite handmade jewellery (apparently the choice of one of the Corr sisters for her wedding). Then it's on to the broad main street and through a proud looking gateway leading into thick forest. Above us tower spruce, sycamore and ancient oak trees and below, to our right, is a raging river. Through the trees, we catch a glimpse of the Gothic turrets of Glenarm Castle. It's not the rain but our pressing flight that finally makes us turn back and head to the car. It's a reluctant and sad farewell. Rain or shine, the Antrim coast has been a delight.
