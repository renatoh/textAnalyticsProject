Later, he was to display the kind of pinpoint accuracy with golf clubs in hand which endorsed his enduring levels of ability. There can be a frustration attached to watching Garc\u00eda play. The Spaniard seems to take every bad break personally, with body language - even to amateur onlookers - frequently poor. It is beyond dispute that Garc\u00eda\u2019s talent should have been replicated by at least a single major championship victory by this stage of his career. During round one of the WGC-Cadillac Championship, an epic tantrum on his penultimate hole saw Garc\u00eda throw a club at his golf bag and punch said bag before simmering down to a rant. The incident, which was captured on television, will inevitably lead to a fine from the PGA Tour. It can at least be said that Garc\u00eda cares. He did likewise towards a scathing assessment from Brandel Chamblee, the respected Golf Channel pundit, who asserted that Garc\u00eda\u2019s \u201cattitude\u201d leaves plenty to be desired. Chamblee also suggested Garc\u00eda doesn\u2019t have the mental capacity to compete in back-to-back tournaments. The 36-year-old\u2019s retort came via social media. \u201cYou must be right Brendal [sic] Chamblee, Golf Channel. According to you my bad attitude has made me a top 17 player, 15 out of 17 years, sorry!\u201d And then the follow up. \u201cHe is so important in my life that I can\u2019t even write his name right.\u201d Chamblee will care little about this incident, the like of which he has encountered a hundred times. It provides the latest insight, however, into how prickly Garc\u00eda can be when subjected to criticism. Privately, it seems obvious that Garc\u00eda will be hurt by that major drought. The subsequent, deeper answer in Florida was a strong one; Garc\u00eda carded a third round of 67 for a five-under-par aggregate which leaves him firmly inside the top 10 at Doral with 18 holes to play. He bogeyed just a single hole, the 14th, and played an otherwise stunning back nine in just 33 shots. In the context of the toughest scoring conditions of the week, this was striking stuff. \u201cThat was a good day,\u201d Garc\u00eda said. \u201cI can\u2019t complain about it. I played solid. The course was playing different today, different wind. It\u2019s not easy to get used to it. I thought I played nicely and I would have taken 67 on a tough course like Doral is right now. I hit a bad tee shot on 14 and that cost me a little bit. I could have got away with it with a good putt but I mis-read it a little bit. Other than that, I played really well. \u201cI\u2019ve played a little bit better as the week went on, nothing has been that different. It\u2019s just a couple putts that have dropped that have been lipping out the first couple of days. I\u2019m giving myself a lot of good chances at birdies and eagles. So when you can manage to do that, usually you\u2019re going to score fairly well.\u201d Last Sunday, and linked to Chamblee\u2019s jibe, Garc\u00eda was beaten into second place at the Honda Classic by Adam Scott. And yet, don\u2019t dare mention to Garc\u00eda that falling short at West Palm Beach had some deep-rooted impact on his state of mind. \u201cIt probably took me to as soon as I shook hands with Adam, it was over,\u201d he added. \u201cIt was fine. I mean, everybody \u2013 I don\u2019t want to say everybody \u2013 but a lot of people want to take it the wrong way. I don\u2019t. I was coming off a terrible week at Riviera, which is a place I really, really enjoy and I was very disappointed with that. \u201cI went to another week that I really enjoy with a great golf course and I played really well. I hung in there without feeling great with my swing and everything and I almost won. This week, I\u2019ve been kind of getting a little bit better as the week went on. So obviously all those things are positives and that\u2019s the way I\u2019m always going to take it, win or lose; that\u2019s all I can do.\u201d Barring something miraculous, Jordan Spieth won\u2019t be adding this WGC title to his lengthy list of achievements. Still he had the pleasure of \u201cvictory\u201d in the company of his friend Justin Thomas. Spieth signed for 73 as Thomas slipped to a 78, leaving the pair on two under and three over respectively. Russell Knox, who won the WGC event in China last November, has matched Spieth\u2019s 54 hole score after a Saturday 72; ruined only by a bogey on the 18th. Louis Oosthuizen is a shot better off following a 69."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
