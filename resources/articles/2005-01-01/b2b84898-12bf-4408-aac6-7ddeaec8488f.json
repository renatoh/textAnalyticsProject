Cork is European Capital of Culture in 2005 and the city is hosting a programme of more than 5,000 art and cultural events. It's the smallest city to be awarded the Capital of Culture honour, so join the party with 123,000 Corkonians. EasyJet launches flights from Gatwick this month, so expect some bargain fares as it takes on Ryanair. Where to stay: Keep it cultural at the Imperial Hotel (00 353 21 427 4040) which since its beginnings in 1845 has hosted the literary likes of Thackeray and Dickens. What to do: The Crawford Municipal Art Gallery boasts the most important collection of 19th- and 20th-century Irish art outside Dublin. The 'C2' exhibition celebrates visual arts in the last decade by artists associated with Cork, until 29 January. For details on other cultural events see www.cork2005.ie. Where to eat: Cafe Paradiso (16 Lancaster Quay; 00 353 21 427 7939) is regarded as one of Europe's best vegetarian restaurants. Chef Denis Cotter and his sidekick Bridget rustle up original dishes such as braised celeriac galette of chestnuts, leeks and Cashel blue cheese with a red wine sauce, sunchoke mash and Brussels sprouts for \u20ac22. If you're inspired, buy Cotter's The Caf\u00e9 Paradiso Cookbook . The big night out: The Coal Quay (Cornmarket Street; 00 353 21 427 9087) is an ultra-cool beer stop, while the Vineyard (Market Lane) is a sophisticated cocktail bar. Bodega (46 Cornmarket Street; 00 353 21 427 2878) - a large converted warehouse with whitewashed walls, wooden floors and exposed beams - is one of the top spots at weekends. Getting there: EasyJet (0870 600 0000) launches Gatwick-Cork flights on 28 January from \u00a331 return. Alternatively, try Aer Lingus (0845 084 4444) from Heathrow; British Airways (0870 850 9850) from Glasgow and Manchester; Ryanair (0871 246 0000) from Stansted; Bmi (0870 607 0555) from Leeds-Bradford; and BmiBaby (0870 264 2229) from Cardiff, East Midlands, Gatwick and Manchester."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
