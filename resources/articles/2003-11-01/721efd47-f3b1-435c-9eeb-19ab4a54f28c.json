Senior figures in the party have started an informal but systematic study of successful, long running administrations around the world. The aim is prevent the inertia and fatigue that seeps into any government. The study, involving the Downing Street policy unit, has looked at examples as diverse as Canada, the Clinton Democrats, Japan and Australia. It has identified ingredients for success: new people at the top of government, restatement of purpose, fresh policy directions, and successful interaction with the public. In a central element of the plan, Downing Street is preparing a joint initiative between the Labour party and the government setting out a prospectus for the country. Yesterday Ian McCartney MP, the party chairman, told a meeting of its national executive committee (NEC) in London that the consultation would bring together the prime minister, MPs, and constituency parties. A document is likely to be presented to the national policy forum meeting in Newport at the end of the month. The NEC was also told that the Queen's Speech on November 26, normally a collection of disparate bills, will be promoted as a campaigning day for Labour, with its bills fitted into four likely themes. There will be an emphasis on reconnecting with the party's core vote. The aim was to make the occasion of the Queen's Speech as political as Gordon Brown's Budget, one government source said. The prospectus, or \"fresh challenges\" document, may be accompanied by a democracy week in which local parties are asked to conduct consultations with the public over the issues facing the country. The consultation will run substantially longer than a week. Downing Street has been taken by remarks made by the former US president Bill Clinton in a lecture in London in the summer when he warned: \"The burden of progressive politics is that we have to treat every single year of office as if it were our first.\" As part of renewal, Mr Blair has for a variety of reasons installed fresh faces at Downing Street: David Hill, the head of communications; Matthew Taylor, the third term manifesto author; and Geoff Mulgan at the head of a more strategic policy unit. A new party general secretary would replace the outgoing David Triesman by late December, the NEC was told yesterday. Mr Blair told the same meeting that the chances of constructing a clear explanation of what the government stood for had been enhanced by the emergence of Michael Howard as Conservative leader. The government had become blurred by the opposition weakness since 1997, Mr Blair said. A stronger opposition party, replacing the role taken by default by the media and by Labour dissidents, might reconstruct a distinctive and genuine political divide. The so-called \"conversation with the nation\" is also being presented as finding new, \"less top-down\" ways to communicate. Previous innovations included a longer prime minister's questions, televised press conferences by the prime minister, and the twice-yearly cross examination by the Commons liaison committee. Ministers say lack of trust in the government presents them with a paradox. \"The constant refrain from ministers is that 'everytime we say we are doing well, no one believes us',\" said one source. Better direct communication between the government and voters is seen as one answer. This is likely to include traditional means - regional tours, intensive MPs' visits, and public meetings (used successfully in America) - as well as the possibilities of the internet. So called citizens' juries, which allow voters to explain their views to ministers, and informal referendums (pioneered by MPs such as John Mann's current constituency vote on identity cards) could also play a role. \"Whatever we produce is bound to be imperfect,\" one government official conceded of the experimentation. He added: \"Parties often find they are behind what the country wants, and has to catch up with public thinking.\" The \"key challenges\" document will not be a definitive prospectus for a Labour third term. It is intended as a frank assessment of the difficult challenges still facing the country. It is likely to highlight continuing low social mobility, high health inequalities, low overall productivity, the decline in trust, and the scope for reinvigorating local democracy. An important theme is likely to be improving children's services, and expanding the Sure Start scheme. The paper may also concede that Britain has not yet made enough progress on improving underlying productivity, despite Treasury efforts. It will also consider evidence that little has worked in reducing overall levels of worklessness or economic inactivity. The government is looking at a more dedicated approach to skills training, including a stronger sectoral approach. The document is also likely to suggest an interventionist approach to alcoholism, obesity and smoking. Compulsory pensions are also certain to feature, as is asking how company boards ought to be made more accountable. Nobody does it better - Or do they? Some ruling parties New Labour will look at to discover secrets of longevity: Japan New Labour would do well if it emulated Japan's Liberal Democrat party - it has dominated since taking power in 1955 and is on course to stay. Other than this, the lessons are discouraging. Rather than find stability, the party has renewed itself by dint of using internal instability to present a changing face to voters. The charismatic premier, Junichiro Koizumi, has only held the post since 2001 Canada Jean Chr\u00e9tien has been Canada's prime minister longer than Tony Blair has been Labour leader. Yesterday was his 10th anniversary in office, though he retires in 2004. He cultivates an image as a flexible man of the people battling dogmatic opponents. Blair does the same Australia John Howard's conservative Liberal party threw out a modernising and long-lasting Labor government that influenced New Labour. Labor hung on for a decade by a switch that made the finance minister into the prime minister halfway through - an example for Labour? Since then Howard's hold is a warning to those in New Labour who believe the Tories can never win again. He dominates through a mix of sound economic management and right-of-centre policies on asylum, crime and Iraq: the New Labour agenda without social action"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
