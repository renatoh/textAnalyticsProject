The French-Swiss tearaway-modernist-turned neoclassicist is still something of an unknown quantity as far as UK audiences are concerned, and one is grateful to Jurowski for attempting a reappraisal. Hearing Honegger on a regular basis, however, raises questions about his compositional consistency. Last December, Jurowski and the London Philharmonic revived the Christmas Cantata, which proved revelatory. Their latest concert, which scrutinised Pastorale d'Et\u00e9 and the Fourth Symphony, was altogether less appealing, despite playing of considerable panache and the passionate commitment of all concerned. Dating from 1920, the tango-based Pastorale d'Et\u00e9 is a work of easy charm and great sensuality. The Fourth Symphony, written in 1946, is more curious. It carries the Latin subtitle Deliciae Basiliensis (\"the Delights of Basle\"). The delights, however, seem rather austere. The first movement is oddly episodic. Elsewhere, there's some lean, acerbic woodwind and string writing, and flurries of brittle percussion. You couldn't fault the performance, but it was hard to like the piece. The evening's principal delight proved to be Saint-Sa\u00ebns' Fifth Piano Concerto, triggered by the composer's visit to Egypt in 1896. Inhabiting territory between beauty and camp, it was played by the fabulous Portuguese pianist Artur Pizarro with a combination of filigree grace and deft precision. It was flanked by two short works by Debussy: the Rhapsody for Alto Saxophone and Danse Sacr\u00e9e et Danse Profane, the latter for harp and orchestra. Like the rest of the works in the programme, they are not major scores, but were persuasively played by Martin Robertson and Rachel Masters respectively."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
