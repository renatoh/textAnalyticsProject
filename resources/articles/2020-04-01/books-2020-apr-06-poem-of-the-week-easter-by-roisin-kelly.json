Are those flowers for your girl? I imagine her dressed up like an Easter egg in yellow and pink. I\u2019d tap at you like an egg, cracking your thin chocolate shell. If I were made of chocolate too, I\u2019d break off parts of myself to give to you and your girl. Once, I gave my words for garden and water and moonlit and love to a man who kissed me. After he rolled a stone over my heart and shut me off from the world, I had no words left to describe the dark dream that followed. Now you\u2019ve walked by, godlike in jeans and an old t-shirt, the sun glinting on one silver earring. Now a rose is once again not only rose but also soft and red and thorn and bee and honey. Now a bird is singing song and tree and nest in a high place and blue speckled egg. You yourself are glowing with words, they move up and down you as if they\u2019re alive. The words bring themselves to me and tell my tongue sweetness over and over. The words are everything. With them, I\u2019ll turn water to wine at your wedding. From Mercy, the first full-length collection by the young Belfast-born poet, R\u00f3is\u00edn Kelly, Easter seems to have a special glow to it. And no, the glow isn\u2019t only that of romantic love. The latter is a strong contributory factor, of course: its pains are rekindled for the speaker when her ex-boyfriend walks by \u201cholding a bunch of flowers\u201d. The question \u201cAre those flowers for your girl?\u201d contextualises it a little, while retaining the tonal mystery. Is the voice angry, sarcastic, sorrowful? We might guess it\u2019s all three. I like the mixed emotions playing throughout the earlier passages of the poem, and how they are finally resolved. Easter eggs initially supply the poetic calories. All three players in the love triangle are turned into chocolate, the man\u2019s current girlfriend being a particularly sickly and triumphant example \u201cdressed up \u2026 / in yellow and pink\u201d. The man is seen as the more vulnerable. Writing a kind of verse letter to the man in question, the speaker imagines tapping him and \u201ccracking your thin chocolate shell\u201d. Birth may be suggested, but death occurs first. She imagines her own comic-extreme self-sacrifice, breaking off parts of her chocolate self to give the man and his girl. Later on, imagery from the Passion of Christ recalls the numbness and sense of being buried alive \u201cafter he rolled / a stone over my heart / and shut me off from the world\u201d. Probably the same boyfriend was the culprit, though not necessarily. Kelly\u2019s change of pronoun leaves it ambiguous. The \u201csepulchre\u201d analogy is pitched high, yet it\u2019s also faithful to the experience of severe depression, a suffocating stone that\u2019s all too real. Now the speaker returns the ex-lover to mortal form, a little self-mockingly at first \u2013 \u201cgodlike in jeans / and an old t-shirt, the sun glinting on one / silver earring\u201d. The mood has changed, perhaps with the recovery of simultaneously erotic and sublimated feelings. Words withheld and words given become the dominant theme. In line nine, the first of the special, italicised words and phrases, garden, helps the transition to biblical analogy. There is an implied betrayal. But the words are magically potent. They ignite the rose, although they include thorn. They produce birds who lay \u201cblue speckled egg(s)\u201d in nests high in trees. Kelly\u2019s italics slow the reader, so we savour these archetypal symbols, these ordinary happy words, and, importantly, imagine them as the especially meaningful gifts originally offered in the poet\u2019s native Irish language. Six lines from the end, the poet turns on her full power with that marvellous image of the man clothed in, covered in, words that \u201cmove / up and down you, as if they\u2019re alive\u201d. Most significantly, \u201cthe words bring themselves to me / and tell my tongue sweetness over and over\u201d. They enable the speaker to find her own words and \u201cThe words are everything\u2026\u201d Once more, I was reminded of a passage from the New Testament: \u201cIn the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God. And the word was God.\u201d Out of the rediscovery of inspiration and language comes the generosity of forgiveness \u2013 and, of course, the miracle. A miracle was first attributed to the man in the poem\u2019s second line: now, an old-new miracle is performed by the speaker. What could be more generous than turning water to wine at a rival\u2019s wedding feast? And of course the wine is also the poet\u2019s gift-to-self \u2013 part of her own word feast, now freely flowing. \u2022 Easter is reproduced with permission from R\u00f3is\u00edn Kelly\u2019s collection, Mercy (Bloodaxe Books, 2020)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
