Chuck Close's new paintings do not exactly deny the wealth and power of America: the first thing that strikes you is the way they flaunt New York's opulence, like Gustav Klimt paintings in their mineral colours and jewelled shimmer. The faces of his friends and family, larger than life, are seen as liquid mosaics, undulating patterns of paint in colours that do not even attempt to replicate skin, but instead have a decorative luxury. Close is a portraitist who rejects the conventional understanding of what a portrait is. His paintings subject everyone to the same rule, the same grid of representation. He is a suspicious artist, unsure whether he knows the people he knows. If there is anything you take away from his paintings, it is a feeling that personal relationships are treacherous. His self-portrait in this show is as baffling as C\u00e9zanne's self-portraits. Like C\u00e9zanne's system of marks, Close's even more organised patterns of colour do not make the artist unambiguously present to us, but instead question the identity of the man looking back at us and at Close. On one level, Chuck's circle of friends is as absurdly remote as the celebrity chat-show community Rupert Pupkin longs to join in Martin Scorsese's The King of Comedy. This exhibition is almost heavenly in its depiction of a certain highly civilised, relaxed American city. But this complacency is mocked by Close's opaque style: he is agonisingly aware of the difficulty of real communication with anyone, even friends and family. What is certain is his love for the people he strives to understand, or at least record. There is no need to know what Emma, Close's eight-month-old niece, is thinking to trust and love her. Like all these portraits, it is an act of reverence. \u00b7 Until March 15. Details: 020-7749 7475."}, "isHosted": false}}}
