However England are over the first hurdle and out of the pool stages, heading for Marseille and a quarter-final against Australia, and their coach is starting to take a few swings at the critics he feels have been on England's back since the squad arrived in France a month ago. There are signs of life, then, and although it is probably too optimistic to say England are alongside the twice champions Australia, they are certainly going the right way after the damage done to morale during the 36-0 beating by the Springboks down the road at Stade de France two weeks ago. Brian Ashton admitted that last night's win over Tonga was not yet something to make a song and dance about. \"We know we didn't put in anything like a perfect performance,\" said the England head coach. \"There were times when we were under pressure,\" he said, but there was new life in a team \"that according to some people two weeks ago was down and out. Now we are going forwards\". Ashton was too smart to say that surviving what, in effect, have been two knockout matches inside a week would help during that Marseille quarter-final, but he did add: \"It's not something Australia have had to do. When you get to the knockout stage it's a two-horse race and anything can happen. Any side can beat any side. \"We are not going to get carried away with this. We are not playing to our potential, and we know that, but we will improve and need to go up a gear.\" Whether that gear is third or fourth is questionable but there were signs last night that England's midfield is gaining confidence and is having increasing faith in itself. After taking an early pounding and going behind to a cleverly worked try which involved a couple of missed tackles, the backs began to ask questions of Tonga's tiring defence in a way which was beyond the Springboks for much of their encounter with Tongans in Lens last week. In fact, according to last night's captain, Martin Corry, England are still a developing side. \"Two consecutive wins have each shown improvement,\" said the Leicester flanker. \"We don't know how good we can be but we are always looking to push on. \"From where we were two weeks ago we have improved dramatically, but we can still improve every aspect of our game. Where this team has been for the last four years has been a character test. We know we are not the finished article, but there are reasons to be optimistic.\" Tonga's coach, Quddus Fielea, said: \"This is a very big step forward for Tongan rugby. We achieved some of our targets. We fell just short of what was our second target, the quarter-finals. \"We became our own enemies; our execution wasn't what we expected but we scored the last try. I guess the most disappointing thing for us is not keeping our concentration over the full 80 minutes. England scored two quick tries before half-time. I think that was the turning point.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
