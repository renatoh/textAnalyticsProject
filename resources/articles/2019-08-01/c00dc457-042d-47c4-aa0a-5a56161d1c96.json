In an interview with the Times, Sajid Javid indicated he was willing to consider the policy, which was said to have been favoured by Boris Johnson during the Tory leadership campaign, among others. Asked about the proposal, Javid told the paper: \u201cI\u2019m looking at various options. I\u2019m a low-tax guy. I want to see simpler taxes.\u201d The Tory chancellor said he wanted to see \u201csimpler\u201d taxes, while suggesting the lowest paid would be first in line for any cuts. Asked about taxes for higher earners, he said: \u201cWait and see for the budget ... but it wouldn\u2019t be any surprise that I think taxes should be efficient. \u201cWe want to set them at a rate where we are trying to maximise revenue, and that doesn\u2019t always mean that you have the highest tax rate possible. Generally, I want to see lower taxes, but at a level that is going to pay for the public services.\u201d He said the Treasury would consider whether to make changes to the fiscal rules including eliminating the deficit by the middle of the next decade before he delivered the budget \u2013 but that he had not yet decided whether to hold it before 31 October. \u201cWhen we have the budget, I will be thinking about whether we need to make any changes to the fiscal rules. It is obvious to me that when you\u2019ve got some of the lowest rates on government debt this country has ever seen I wouldn\u2019t be doing my job if I wasn\u2019t thinking seriously about how do we use [that opportunity].\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
