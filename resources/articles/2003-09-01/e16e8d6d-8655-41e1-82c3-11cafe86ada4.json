The sort of album you can take home to mum, or that you can play in the company of jazz agnostics without reinforcing their worst prejudices. You know what I mean. There are otherwise great jazz albums - classics, even - that contain embarrassing moments (ugly sounds, passionate lapses of taste, freakouts) that you can only appreciate in the presence of consenting jazz fans; anyone else would ask you to turn it down or fast-forward. The band's three-letter acronym stands for the Esbjorn Svensson Trio: Dan Berglund on bass and Magnus Ostrom on drums and percussion, with the leader on keyboards. So it is a piano trio, but they have a sound and feel that is completely their own. They use the technology of the modern recording studio to present a delicious banquet of timbres, melodies, harmonies and feels. The compositions and arrangements are spot on, and they know how to produce and sequence an album as a satisfying home-listening experience rather than as a frozen gig. Seven Days of Falling is thoroughly contemporary, too, as immersed in the here and now as, say, Soweto Kinch's Dune album. Incidentally, it was great to see Kinch deliver a little speech in support of live music at the Mercury, an award that doesn't seem to have yet resolved the differences between \"promising debut\" and \"classic word-of-mouth\" albums. Despite its studio gloss and expertise, EST's music is rooted in touring. Talking of awards, they had no trouble delivering an intense performance, as anyone who saw them play Behind the Yashmak (from 2002's Strange Place for Snow) at the recent BBC Jazz Awards. That brief appearance was heralded by a surreal incident when Ulrika Jonsson walked on stage. Cue gasps, and a collective, silently mouthed \"Why?\". Jonsson explained that her presence was nothing to do with jazz. \"I'm here because I'm Swedish,\" she said. She then handed the award for best international act to EST. Vic and Bob would have been proud. McCoy Tyner's Land of Giants (Telarc, \u00a314.99) uses all the techniques of the contemporary recording studio - state-of-the-art analogue/digital converters, DSD (direct stream digital) recording, etc - to make his quartet sound like... well, like four old friends (who happen to be world-class musicians) jamming together. Producer Elaine Martone's art is one that conceals the art, and the band - essentially a piano trio plus Bobby Hutcherson on vibes - is on top form: a top band playing top tunes. Yet this is \"modern\" jazz rather than contemporary - the harmonic and rhythmic advances of Tyner's 1960s adventures have been harnessed and consolidated into a stylistic whole. If Tyner's music is rooted in the jazz of the pre-rock era and EST speaks the language of now, is Matthew Bourne the future? Bourne's debut The Electric Dr M (Sound, \u00a313.99), a suite of eight edgy group improvisations plus a weirdo \"hidden\" track - integrates the leader's jazz keyboard prowess with beats, noises and samples. It is bursting with honest - if unfocused - energy and much of what the quintet plays is musicianly, well structured and at the groovier end of experimental jazz. The open, two-drummer sound is a bit Bitches Brew; the Rhodes piano reminiscent of Crossings-era Herbie Hancock, and the guitarist seems to be playing in a different room altogether; but Bourne's electronic explosions are defiantly 21st century. Bassist Riaan Vosloo is the rock around which everyone else swirls. The dodgy moments keep this 47-minute album firmly in the \"consenting jazz fans\" category, but Bourne is unquestionably a talent to check out."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
