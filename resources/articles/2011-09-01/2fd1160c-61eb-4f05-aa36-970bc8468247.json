Volumes 1-3 It's a common occurrence: you buy a box set of a show you fondly yet vaguely remember, then, after you've got the buzz of seeing the title sequence again and reacquainted yourself with the characters, you find that maybe the whole series wasn't as good as your rose-tinted vision had you believe. That's why these compilation discs are such a great move. All the shows here (one episode of each) are from ITC, a UK production company run by the legendary showbiz impresario Lord Lew Grade and responsible for much of our world-class TV output during the 1960s and 1970s. ITC shot everything on film rather than video (so everything here looks stunning) and made full use of all the writers, directors, actors, craftsmen and technicians the British film industry had to offer. Over three separately available discs you get the pick of such classics as The Prisoner (as well as the great Danger Man, the show it span off from); pre-Bond Roger Moore in The Saint; the groovily camp Department: S, Randall &amp; Hopkirk (Deceased); more Moore, this time with Tony Curtis, in the Euro-fluff romp The Persuaders!; Richard Greene in the phenomenally successful The Adventures Of Robin Hood and many more. Lots of great guest stars appear, too, with some fine on-the-way-up performances from such actors as John Hurt and Anthony Hopkins.
