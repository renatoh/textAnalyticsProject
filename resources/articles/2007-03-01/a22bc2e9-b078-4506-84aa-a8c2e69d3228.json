His first included Stravinsky's little known The King Of The Stars alongside the box office security of The Firebird ballet, and his second appearance this week includes a Prokofiev choral rarity among works by Debussy and Stravinsky. Prokofiev's cantata Seven, They Are Seven was composed in 1918, in the wake of the Bolshevik Revolution. It's based on a Balmont poem about seven giants who destroy the world through their violence. At that particular point in Russian history the symbolism would have been unmistakable and Prokofiev's fierce primitivist music, heavily indebted to Stravinsky's Rite Of Spring (also included in the programme), is full of innovative instrumental effects and unearthly sounds - exactly the kind of thing that brings the best out of Gergiev's sense of theatre. \u00b7 Barbican Hall, EC2, Thu 29 Sakari Oramo Birmingham, Nottingham It says much about the confident way in which Sakari Oramo has put his own distinctive imprint on his music directorship with the City Of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra that he can now put together programmes that set up inevitable comparisons with his much feted predecessor. Oramo's CBSO concert this week, in which Mahler's Third Symphony is preceded by Thomas Ad\u00e8s's Asyla, is one that Simon Rattle could well have come up with when he was in charge a decade ago. In fact Asyla was a CBSO commission, which Rattle introduced at Symphony Hall in 1997, and which he later included in his first concert as the Berlin Phil's music director too. But Oramo has his own exemplary track record in contemporary music, and and it will be fascinating to hear how he tackles Ad\u00e8s's vivid, virtuoso piece and also how he presents the great canvas of Mahler's Third. \u00b7 Symphony Hall, Birmingham, Thu 29; Royal Concert Hall, Nottingham, Fri 30"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
