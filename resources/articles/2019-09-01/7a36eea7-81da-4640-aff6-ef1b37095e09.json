Top stories More than 250 Australian academics have publicly backed school climate strikes around the country, telling schoolchildren civil disobedience is required to \u201cdefend life itself\u201d in the face of political inaction. Tens of thousands are expected to march at more than 100 locations across Australia today, with professors and researchers writing that it is \u201cunconscionable\u201d that current and future generations will have to bear the \u201cterrifying brunt of this unprecedented disaster\u201d. \u201cWhen a government wilfully abrogates its responsibility to protect its citizens from harm and secure the future for generations to come, it has failed in its most essential duty of stewardship,\u201d the open letter states. Follow coverage of the strikes throughout the day on our live blog, from 8.15am AEST. A third blackface incident involving Justin Trudeau has been revealed, just hours after the Canadian prime minister apologised \u201cprofoundly\u201d for wearing what he described as \u201cracist\u201d makeup to a costume party in 2001. The latest images came in a short, undated video clip published by Global News in which Trudeau \u2013 his face, arms and legs painted black \u2013 waves at the camera and sticks out his tongue. The opposition Conservative party \u2013 now neck-and-neck with Trudeau\u2019s Liberals with an election weeks away \u2013 confirmed it had sent the video to Global News. The immigration services provider Serco has been awarded a tender worth nearly $10m by the Australian government to return non-citizens to their home countries, despite the UN already providing such a service. Costing $415,000 a month for the next two years, Serco\u2019s assisted returns program has drawn criticism from refugee advocates, given historic allegations of mistreatment during the company\u2019s management of offshore detention centres. World The US and Canada have lost more than one in four birds since 1970 \u2013 a total of 3bn \u2013 culminating in what scientists who published a new study are calling a \u201cwidespread ecological crisis\u201d. Britain\u2019s supreme court has been urged to back parliament\u2019s recall next week, as a three-day emergency hearing into the legality of Boris Johnson\u2019s proroguing of parliament concluded.

Lawyers in the Netherlands have been given emergency protection after the murder of a top defence lawyer, amid media claims the country is descending into a narco-state. The US secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, has cooled rhetoric against Iran, saying Washington is seeking a \u201cpeaceful resolution\u201d of tensions with Saudi Arabia. Opinion and analysis After a painting that was essentially \u201ca riff on a riff\u201d sold for $14.8m, the art world was quick to round on its creator as \u201cconceptually bankrupt\u201d. But is there more to the artist known as Kaws than just a pop culture craze, asks Steph Harmon. \u201cThe figures are often talked about as cartoon or fun or whatever \u2026 but I think he\u2019s responding very clearly to the rise of loneliness in our society,\u201d says the curator Simon Maidment, as the National Gallery of Victoria launches a 25-year retrospective, including more than 100 works by the artist. Brigid Delaney is travelling through Mongolia. She sits with nomads, eats their food, drinks cheap vodka and swims in lakes. Everything is going well, until ... \u201cI\u2019m lying \u2026 on a camp bed as hard as a door frame, when I get a sharp, stabbing pain in my abdomen. It\u2019s like my digestive tract is studded in razor blades (similar to those rumours about razor blades on the waterslides at fun parks in the 1980s) and I\u2019m trying to digest Mongolia\u2019s biggest chunk of mutton. My stomach is making gurgling noises like ... like \u2026 something is trying to escape.\u201d Sport Arsenal have demolished Eintracht Frankfurt in the Europa League, bouncing back from a disappointing performance in the Premier League against Watford, with their young stars spearheading a 3-0 win in Germany. The Rugby World Cup has always been a tournament that demands consistency above all else. Yet the evenness of this year\u2019s competition throws up the real possibility of a team losing a pool game and still managing to win, writes Bret Harris. Thinking time: Pop music\u2019s constant need for \u2018new stuff\u2019 The studio album was once the pop industry\u2019s most valued commodity, with the US music industry earning 92.3% of its revenue in 2000 from the sale of CD albums. While albums were released in the 1950s and 60s at the same breakneck pace as singles, driven in part by the immense commercial success of bands like the Beatles, by the 70s the rise of the LP changed \u201chow we perceive and remember what was once the most evanescent of the arts\u201d, according to the famed critic Robert Christgau. With stars like Ariana Grande releasing new albums just six months after their last, and even indie acts such as Foals and Big Thief producing new music at a prolific rate, quick is back. But what\u2019s behind the explosive pace of production? Aimee Cliff takes a closer look.
