As the Ukip leader, Nigel Farage, warned that his party would trigger a political \"earthquake\" in next year's European parliamentary elections, the foreign secretary dismissed calls for an immediate EU referendum and said there were no \"quick fixes\". There were suggestions on Sunday night that Downing Street may try to reach out to disaffected Tory voters, who have complained about plans to legalise gay marriage, by omitting any reference to the equal marriage bill in this week's Queen's speech. The Liberal Democrats are making clear that the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, which is being carried over into the new parliamentary session after completing its commons committee stage on 12 March, will not and cannot be dropped. But one leading figure on the right accused Hague of failing to understand the depth of the threat posed by Ukip whose success is not a \"flash in the pan\" along the lines of the 15% the Greens won in the 1989 European parliamentary elections. The senior MP said: \"William Hague is once again proving that he is always wrong on strategy.\" The criticism of the foreign secretary came as the Conservative party embarked on a mild panic after Ukip won almost a quarter of the vote in wards where it stood in last week's English local elections. Farage, who predicted his party would win next year's European parliamentary elections in \"an earthquake in British politics\", stoked Tory tensions by saying that he would be open to talks if the party removed Cameron as prime minister. The Ukip leader told the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1: \"If David Cameron gets removed \u2026 and somebody else was put in place who wanted to come and talk to us and say, 'Shall we find an accommodation?' we would consider it. But it is not my priority. My priority is to build a new political party, a movement in this country that actually wants to stand up for the interests of ordinary people.\" David Davis, the former shadow home secretary, called on Cameron to speed up the process of a vote on the EU by holding a \"mandate\" referendum in this parliament to strengthen his hand in negotiations. This would be followed by an in-out referendum after the conclusion of negotiations to rewrite the terms of British membership. Davis said that the Liberal Democrats should not be allowed to hold up the referendum. He said on the Sunday Politics show on BBC1: \"Well, look, the Lib Dems are, what \u2013 one sixth or one seventh of the coalition MPs? Should they have a veto on everything? I don't think so.\" But Hague said it was not possible to introduce a government bill, although he held the possibility of the Tory leadership supporting a backbench bill. The foreign secretary told Sky News: \"We are prepared \u2026 to look at ways of strengthening that commitment [to hold a referendum by 2017]. But we have taken no decision yet about that and everyone has to bear in mind we don't have a Conservative majority in the House of Commons of today.\" Hague used an article in the Sunday Telegraph to say it would be wrong for the Tories to embark on a shift to the right as he rejected \"quick fixes\". He wrote: \"There is always a temptation for politicians to offer quick fixes; to say we can cut taxes, increase spending, bring down the deficit and solve our problems with a magic wand. When times are hard the temptation to do this is even stronger. People are tired of bad news. \"Many want to hear that there's a Plan B or C or D that is a shortcut to success. But to offer shortcuts that will not work would be to cheat the British people, offering them a dead end \u2013 and frankly it is patronising to them too.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
