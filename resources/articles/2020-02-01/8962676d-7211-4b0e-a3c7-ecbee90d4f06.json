The Double Cluster is a pair of side-by-side star clusters, both of which are about 13 million years old and located at a distance of 7,650 light years. Although they will appear together as little more than an elongated smudge, there is a unique satisfaction in seeing these \u201cdeep sky objects\u201d. It\u2019s like you\u2019ve uncovered a secret in the sky. To stand any chance of success, you\u2019ll need to head out of the city and the light pollution. The chart shows the view looking north-west in the evening sky from the UK. First locate the W of Cassiopeia, then extend the line between the stars Navi and Ruchbah. It may be necessary to wait some 30-40 minutes for your eyes to adjust to the dark, so you could take a pair of binoculars with you. Although not strictly necessary, they could make it easier as you wait for your eyes to adapt."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
