Read the first article, which explores the question of whether US retailers are becoming regulators, as well as stories about new chemical policies by Walmart and Target. Arthur C Clarke wrote that \"any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic\". Today, we scarcely have to look past our smartphone screens to find his proof. From supermarket shelves to the cushions on our stain-proof couches, technological magic surrounds us, and for that we must thank the wonders of chemistry. Virtually all of the materials we need and the luxuries we enjoy rely in some way on this remarkable science. But there is a dark side to our chemical dependency; we have produced such an extraordinary variety and quantity of chemicals so rapidly and with so few controls that they have now spread unseen into every corner of our increasingly contaminated environment. And we have learned too late that many of these chemicals are in our bodies (PDF) and may be making people sick. Recent scientific research has show that common chemicals can disrupt our endocrine or immune systems. Others can harm our brains, damage our reproductive abilities, or may even trigger cancer. Some even believe that chemical toxins are at least partly responsible for the obesity epidemic. Many companies have responded admirably to this crisis. They've worked overtime to find new, non-toxic alternatives to dangerous compounds and introduce substitute products that work without harm. In the retail sector, chains such as Target and Walmart have begun to eliminate poisonous products from their stores. Such market-based reforms are badly needed and eagerly welcomed. But by themselves they'll never fully stem the toxic tide that threatens us. The problem is that it is easier and cheaper to invent and utilize chemicals without considering their toxicity, and in a free market economy, easier and cheaper always wins. You simply use the first inexpensive compound you come to that does the trick. That's the strategy that best boosts bottom lines, and we see it at work in the chemical industry's vehement pushback against efforts to reign in bisphenol-A, phthalates, and many other toxic threats. I can tell you from experience, for example, that it's far simpler to make a cleaning product that uses carcinogenic solvents and endocrine-disrupting surfactants to meet consumer expectations than it is to make a competitively priced alternative that achieves the same results with plant-based, nontoxic, biodegradable ingredients. What's needed is a level playing field that requires all manufacturers to play the same game and make toxicity a primary concern. For that, new regulations are required. Currently, chemical safety is largely regulated by the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), a 1976 law that's done a dismal job of protecting public health. The law requires no pre-market safety testing for the roughly 85,000 chemicals in the market and the 1,000 new chemicals introduced each year. Instead, a perennially underfunded EPA must prove that a chemical is unsafe before its use can be dialed back. If even just 10% of the estimated 85,000 different chemicals currently in production were toxic, a conservative estimate, one would expect a viable TSCA to have banned or controlled roughly 8,500 of them. Instead, in nearly 40 years, this toothless law has regulated just five and assessed only 195 others. It's time to change that. Currently Congress is considering reforming the way chemicals are regulated with the Chemical Safety Improvement Act (CSIA). Regulation is desperately needed, but as currently written CSIA is a lacking substitute. Recently, a coalition of leading consumer brands, including Seventh Generation, formed Companies for Safer Chemicals to ensure that chemical safety reform protects families and not corporations. To achieve this, major changes must be made to the proposed law: Protect the most vulnerable: Chemical policy reform must protect the most vulnerable among us, including pregnant women, children and workers True transparency: We believe that the public should have access to information regarding the safety of chemicals. Raise the bar: Federal law should be the floor not the ceiling, and compliment States that create innovative laws and regulations that protect human health and the environment. Reward innovation: Foster solutions that lead to safer and sustainable products and technologies. Require the Environmental Protection Agency to take fast action on the most harmful chemicals. The oft-suggested trade-off that asks us to accept a polluted environment and a mounting human health toll or live in caves without modern necessities is a false dichotomy. We can have our chemicals and use them, too. We just need to be as smart about controlling them as we are about creating them. Strong proactive regulations would go a long way toward building that far healthier future. The clock is ticking. And our children are counting on us to succeed before it runs out.
