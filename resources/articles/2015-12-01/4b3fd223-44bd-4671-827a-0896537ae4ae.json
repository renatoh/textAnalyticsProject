Fixity of purpose is important but without flexibility nothing would get done. Even Margaret Thatcher, held up by admirers as a paragon of unyielding determination, knew the value of a compromise. Until she forgot it, at which point her downfall began. David Cameron is a different kind of leader, with resolve that is hard to discern amid the blur of tactical wobbles. The steel he has is coated in soft plastic. In some ways, this has served him well. He would not be prime minister if swing voters in marginal seats had not decided that he was an unthreatening family man, who exuded a mild but confident sense of what he was all about \u2013 even if all that he was about was being prime minister. That is his brand. To maintain his image and his position, Mr Cameron has often ducked confrontation. This is how he has ended up with the obligation to hold a referendum on Britain\u2019s EU membership, after a renegotiation that diehard sceptics were always going to denounce as a sham. The whole process has been designed to defer civil war in the Conservative party. Mr Cameron celebrated his 10th anniversary as Tory leader this month. Throughout that decade the question of Europe has had the potential to undo him. He has kept that potential from being fulfilled by a combination of opportunistic gambits and tactical retreats. But the price of temporary unity for the party has been the absence of a strategy for the country. And the price keeps going up. The prime minister has managed his own backbenches like a debtor, returning to a pawnbroker every few months, offering some new item to purchase a spell of peace.In the run-up to Christmas, Mr Cameron\u2019s Eurosceptic creditors were pestering him to put another item in hock \u2013 the doctrine of collective cabinet responsibility. Exactly how many secretaries of state want to campaign for Brexit is unknown. They can postpone a declaration until the terms of the renegotiation are settled (and therein lies much of its utility as a device for party management). The \u201cleave\u201d camp believes its cause would be boosted with big-hitters if the cabinet were given a free vote. On their side is the precedent of 1975, when Harold Wilson abandoned thoughts of whipping his divided government behind membership of the EEC. The counter-view is that the renegotiation is a central pillar of government policy and so ministers who reject it should, by force of protocol and conscience, resign from the government. Mr Cameron looks certain to yield on this point. Refusing a procedural concession to the sceptics would be out of character. Besides, cabinet unity will not be the decisive factor in the vote and the prime minister will be keen to manage the campaign in a way that maximises the chances of putting his party back together again after polling day. That points to a free vote for the frontbench. The hope inside Downing Street is that a deal with EU partners can be done early in 2016, with a referendum late in spring, before a seasonally predictable migration surge over the summer. Televised refugee chaos, it is feared, would persuade more voters that the question on the ballot paper was really a choice between porous and closed borders, with leaving the EU cast as the safer bet. In reality, Britain will have to cooperate with its continental neighbours on migration, as on so many other questions, whether it is in or out of the EU. But staying in makes for a more effective collaboration; a seat at the top table. The border cannot be sealed and there is no economic, cultural or strategic merit in pretending it should be. This may not be the simplest argument in the debate but it is an important one that many Conservatives, even those of Eurosceptic disposition, including the prime minister, grasp. Soon Mr Cameron will have to make the case for Britain\u2019s continued engagement with the European project, which is not the same as doing a quickie sales job on his renegotiation. The deal he strikes is born of expediency for the Conservative party; the EU question itself is of historic importance for the country. He can claim that the two work in tandem; that renegotiated terms renew the strategic imperative. Up to a point they will. But the two aspects of the prime minister\u2019s position come from different sides of his political personality \u2013 his resolve in wanting to keep Britain in Europe and plasticity in the way he has pursued that ambition. It is time for Mr Cameron to show more steel."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
