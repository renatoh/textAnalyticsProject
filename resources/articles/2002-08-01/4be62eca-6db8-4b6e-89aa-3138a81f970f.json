Asprilla's initial application had been rejected on the grounds that he had not played a significant enough proportion of Colombia's competitive internationals over the last two years to qualify. But chairman George Reynolds and manager Tommy Taylor launched an immediate appeal, arguing that he would be a valuable addition to the Nationwide League. And after a hearing in Sheffield today, the club were able to announce: \"George Reynolds, the chairman, is pleased to announce that the board of appeal have decided on the appeal for a work permit for Tino Asprilla. \"The club will receive a letter in the morning giving approval for a permit to be issued. The Football League have also given approval. \"Tino will definitely sign for Darlington this week.\" The 32-year-old could now make his debut at Kidderminster on Saturday, provided that his registration is completed and international clearance comes through in time. Earlier this month, after returning to St James' Park for Newcastle's friendly clash with Barcelona, Asprilla admitted that he would love to play in the Premiership once again. However, he has since clearly chosen to set his sights lower, meeting with Darlington chairman Reynolds last Sunday in an initial bid to resurrect his career with the Third Division club. \"I am a friend of the Darlington president and I want to help him to manage and take the team into the Second Division, so I am going to play again in England,\" said Asprilla. \"I am ready to hear what the coach wants from me and I am ready to learn more things and to give all I know. \"I've kept good links with England. I have great friends there and it would be great to play again in the Premiership.\" Asprilla arrived in England for the first time in 1996 after Kevin Keegan paid Parma \u00a37.5m for him in a failed attempt to boost his side's Premiership title challenge. He produced many moments of magic - most notably a superb Champions League hat-trick against Barcelona - during a stay of almost two years on Tyneside, but eventually returned to Italy in January 1998 as Keegan's successor Kenny Dalglish remoulded his squad. Darlington may not have been the destination he first had in mind when he decided to relaunch his career, but few could deny the club's ambition. Reynolds has invested heavily in a new 25,000 capacity stadium on the outskirts of the town and during the summer, attempted to lure former England star Paul Gascoigne into manager Taylor's squad."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
