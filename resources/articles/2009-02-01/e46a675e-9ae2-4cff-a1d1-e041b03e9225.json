Manchester United have encouraged Internazionale and that is their punishment for not ending this Champions League contest when they had a welter of opportunities before the interval. Sir Alex Ferguson's side show superb coordination and technique, but they do not score abundantly despite their superiority in most games. Expect the next fortnight to be crammed with talk by Mourinho of the pressure United are under, the feasibility of an away goal or, failing that, triumph for his men in a penalty shoot-out. If ability were any guide, though, the realistic expectation would be of an outstanding United beating opponents who are merely capable. Annoyance with themselves should sharpen Ferguson's players. While a record for the Champions League of 20 consecutive games undefeated was set last night, that will have scant relevance for United. They will realise that Esteban Cambiasso could have devastated them by forcing home a corner eight minutes from the end to give Inter victory. The statisticians inform us that Edwin van der Sar has broken the European record by reaching 1,392 minutes without conceding a goal in top-flight football, but there will be some nervousness about thwarting the visitors at Old Trafford. Nonetheless, most of the first leg implied that Ferguson was the master. While Mourinho's prediction that the visitors would not meet his team \"eye to eye\" was fulfilled, he must have forgotten to add that his opposite number's strategy would be well gauged. Wayne Rooney was among the substitutes, with the manager preferring to put the emphasis on out-and-out midfielders. The headstrong Rooney was introduced for the closing six minutes, only to be booked. It cannot be argued that United were blunted by denying themselves his influence. Inter were shackled until the second half as the visitors forged a long chain of chances. Cristiano Ronaldo tested the goalkeeper Julio Cesar with free-kicks and called on him for a good save to his left from a Ryan Giggs corner. The Welshman, for his part, turned away from Nelson Rivas, a centre-half replaced at half-time, to break through but Cesar positioned himself astutely and the finish could not be squeezed beyond him. Inter have a great store of know-how in their squad and it was drawn on heavily in that period. The much-discussed problems the visitors could have had assembling a back four were forgotten. United must have been satisfied with their state of readiness. John O'Shea and, more surprisingly, Jonny Evans were fit to play. But in the 10 minutes before the interval, the Serie A side did start to make more of an impression. Mourinho and his backroom staff came to life after 43 minutes, erupting in protest when a foul was given against the right-back, Maicon. The referee, Luis Medina Cantalejo, singled out the reserve goalkeeper Francesco Toldo for a caution. United could afford to be serene. The five men employed in two midfield layers had outnumbered Inter in a key area as well as outclassing them. Heretical as it is to suggest such a thing of Mourinho, the use of two outright forwards in Adriano and Zlatan Ibrahimovic looked like a mistake when there was little service from the centre of the pitch. Of course, Mourinho will have felt that Inter, having survived, were bound to be encouraged. For the first time, United looked as if they could be in jeopardy. Cambiasso flighted a cross from the left that Ibrahimovic dummied, only for Adriano to misconnect with his finish. In the 49th minute the Brazil striker went down in the goalmouth, but while Ferdinand had touched him, as centre-backs do when marking, that hardly accounted for him crashing to the turf. Even so, Inter were a far greater presence. Mourinho's powers of organisation and motivation in a dressing room at half-time are clearly not on the wane. His side were encouraged to impose themselves more forcefully, even if the tougher attitude led to cautions for Cristian Chivu and Maicon. Without being entirely muted, United had to adopt more of a counter-attacking approach. Their opponents had started to see possibilities and the physical strength of the Inter side, much remarked on beforehand, was demonstrated. A tie, straightforward at the beginning of the night, has a tinge of enigma about it now. Still, United did not let themselves be pinned down as comprehensively as their opponents had been. By the close, they were once more showing their threat as the veteran Giggs again lasted the pace remarkably. United are sure to feel that they have the depth of energy and talent to swamp Inter in the end."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
