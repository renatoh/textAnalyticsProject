Strong Place is an apt title, because she seems surer of her ground as both writer and player and this group \u2013 guitarist Mary Halvorson, pianist Kris Davis, bassist John Hebert and drummer Tom Rainey \u2013 sounds more organised yet spontaneously conversational than ever. Laubrock, whose creative independence took off after her move to New York, has acquired a new certainty about mingling the songlike phrasing of her earlier years with her Evan Parker-influenced recent past. Compelling themes and collective conversations emerge from clean-toned soprano-sax swirls, or dark, melancholy low-tenor exhalations. Halvorson supplies harp-like jangles, oblique swing or squalling noise (and the title track finds her at her warmest and richest, in partnership with Hebert's sumptuous bassline), pianist Davis can be abstractly percussive or lyrical, and Rainey is delicately textural or joltingly propulsive as the circumstances shift. Strong Place represents a step-change for Anti-House, offering budding jazz composers fresh ideas and inspiration."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
