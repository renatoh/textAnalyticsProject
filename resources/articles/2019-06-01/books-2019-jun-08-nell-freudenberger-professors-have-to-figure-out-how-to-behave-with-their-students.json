For her new novel, Lost and Wanted, which follows Helen, an eminent theoretical physicist and single mother, as she mourns the death of her closest friend, Freudenberger set out to teach herself as much physics as she could. Growing up in New York City, she was, like so many other young women, encouraged to believe she didn\u2019t \u201chave the right kind of brain for it\u201d. After doing badly in a maths test in her teens, she was told by a teacher that she might as well quit, and by the time she reached Harvard, hoping to study medicine, she was so far behind that \u201cI couldn\u2019t even take a remedial math class\u201d. Abandoning the idea of medical school, she travelled in Asia after college, teaching English for a year in Thailand, and then found early success as a writer, publishing her first story in the New Yorker in her mid-20s after being discovered during an internship there. She hopes her own two children will keep going with maths, \u201cespecially my daughter\u201d, but fears they won\u2019t. \u201cIt breaks my heart,\u201d she says of the new book, \u201cto see people on social media, especially women, saying: \u2018I\u2019d like to read this book but I\u2019m a little intimidated, it sounds like it might be hard.\u2019 Please give it a chance. It doesn\u2019t have to be my book; you can read any of the books in the acknowledgments, just read one and prove to yourself that you can understand it. Someone has told you you can\u2019t.\u201d She notes that, unfortunately, it\u2019s not only in schools that people are hearing these harmful messages. Indignant, she mentions a lecture given last year at Cern by Italian physicist Alessandro Strumia, who said that physics was \u201cinvented and built by men, it\u2019s not by invitation\u201d, and claimed that women receive fewer citations in the field because differences in brain structure make them less capable of high level research (Strumia has since been suspended by Cern). \u201cIt seems almost like those arguments aren\u2019t worth answering \u2013 but apparently they need to be answered,\u201d says Freudenberger. For her own part, she found the process of researching the scientific concepts in Lost and Wanted \u201cthrilling\u201d, spending hours in conversation with physicists and reading papers on quantum entanglement. \u201cOne of the really beautiful things about the physics world,\u201d she says, is that all the literature is made available online for anyone to read, and she found that researchers were \u201cexceedingly warm and open and eager to explain their work\u201d. Such was her excitement that a friend who read an early draft of the novel had to gently tell her to cool it on the science. All three of Freudenberger\u2019s previous works of fiction, Lucky Girls, The Dissident and The Newlyweds, focus on cultures she did not grow up in, and for her, as she worked on Lost and Wanted, physics became \u201csort of another country\u201d, giving her \u201cthat heightened sense of experience that I get from travelling\u201d. After her early success in the New Yorker, Freudenberger\u2019s story collection Lucky Girls won the PEN/Malamud award, she received a Guggenheim fellowship and a Whiting award and appeared on the New Yorker\u2019s \u201c20 under 40\u201d list in 2010. This time around, she \u201cdid not start out to write a book about a physicist\u201d, and had first intended the novel to be \u201cmore personal\u201d \u2013 in an early abandoned version, the first-person narrator was a novelist: \u201cI should have known how boring that would be,\u201d she laughs. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I was thinking!\u201d She found that she couldn\u2019t sustain her own interest when \u201ctrying to do something that\u2019s too close to home\u201d. \u201cI wanted to write a book about a woman who was passionate about her work,\u201d she says, \u201cbut the book was just sort of dead on the page.\u201d There was an astrophysicist in that draft, \u201ca minor character, and he was male, like the only astrophysicists I had ever known\u201d. Then it occurred to her that she could rewrite it, giving her protagonist a new profession. When Freudenberger\u2019s publishers initially asked her, \u201cDid you intend to write somebody who was so cold?\u201d she replied: \u201cI was just trying to write about myself!\u201d More seriously, she talks about wanting to explore a narrator who \u201ckeeps secrets from herself. I was thinking about Chang-Rae Lee\u2019s A Gesture Life or Kazuo Ishiguro\u2019s The Remains of the Day \u2013 of someone who has a real distance between what they\u2019re thinking and what they\u2019re feeling, their feelings are not always clear to them.\u201d Not that she espouses the notion that scientists see the world differently from nonscientists in any fundamental way. When she asked one physicist whether there was something in daily life that he thinks about differently because he\u2019s a physicist, he eventually said: \u201cWell, I\u2019m not afraid when I\u2019m on a plane, because I know exactly how planes work.\u201d Lost and Wanted is divided into sections titled \u201cEntanglement\u201d, \u201cGravity\u201d and \u201cUncertainty\u201d, but Freudenberger was aware of the dangers of misusing scientific metaphor, knowing that a person like her protagonist \u201cwould disdain the lazy use of the uncertainty principle \u2013 novelists and playwrights love the uncertainty principle.\u201d Nonetheless, she says, \u201cthe concepts just seemed to go with what was happening emotionally for the characters: entanglement is such a beautiful metaphor for friendship, and the collision of two black holes and the gravitational waves that emanate from them is so much like what happens with grief.\u201d Her approach changed after a conversation with a physicist who was using figurative language to explain something to her about black holes, and who gave her something like a \u201cpermission slip\u201d for metaphor. \u201cHe said: \u2018You know, our three-dimensional brains are not equipped to understand these things without analogies \u2013 you just have to make sure that the analogies are the right ones.\u2019\u201d The emotional centre of the novel is grief, and while revising the book, Freudenberger lost a close friend, the composer Michael Friedman, who died unexpectedly in his early 40s and to whom the novel is dedicated. She compares the initial shock of losing someone to the feeling she had after childbirth: \u201cI couldn\u2019t believe that there were people just going about their regular business. I thought I must be a different type of creature, like I didn\u2019t really feel human any more. You just feel so separate from anybody else who hasn\u2019t had the exact same experience.\u201d In one memorable scene Helen goes to the Harvard office of a professor, whose inappropriate advances towards her late friend Charlie had ended her promising academic career years before. The professor is suave and engaged, discussing the finer points of Helen\u2019s book on black holes, giving her his insights on Rousseau, modernity, love and moral ambiguity. It takes him a short while to figure out her connection to his former student. Freudenberger, though she \u201ccertainly didn\u2019t set out to write something that had to do with #MeToo\u201d, was interested in how common it is for people to \u201cdescribe their lives being completely derailed\u201d by small, subtle interactions. It\u2019s rarely a clear case of wrongdoing that can be called out, she observes, and yet so many people have ended up in entirely different careers from the ones they intended to pursue because, say, \u201cthat would have entailed asking him for a recommendation and I didn\u2019t want to do that\u201d. She gives her professor character arguments taken from Pankaj Mishra\u2019s Age of Anger, though, she says: \u201cI hate to borrow from somebody who I really admire personally and intellectually and give some of their ideas to a nefarious character. But I wanted him to be intellectually appealing in the way that professors are, to be able to make his case.\u201d The argument made so often by creepy professors to justify crossing the line with their students \u2013 \u201cbut literature is about love, teaching is about seduction\u201d \u2013 strikes her as important to address. We all fall in love with professors, male or female, regardless of sexual preference, she says. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really have to do with that. You fall in love with someone\u2019s mind. And professors have to figure out how to behave with their students.\u201d So many different obstacles can scotch a woman\u2019s academic career, whether in the arts or the sciences. Freudenberger experienced sexism early in her own trajectory, all the small indignities and public underminings that came along with her first lucky break: \u201chaving my picture taken, having articles written about whether I was just having the story published because my picture looked nice, because I was 26\u201d. Now, though, she is above all \u201cgrateful\u201d to have fulfilling work that involves the pursuit of ideas, that fills her days with the \u201cdislocated dreamy feeling\u201d that comes from hours of writing, and that she captures in describing Helen\u2019s experience of her research in physics. Freudenberger knows very well how rare a gift that is. \u2022 Lost and Wanted by Nell Freudenberger is published by Viking (RRP \u00a314.99). To order a copy go to guardianbookshop.com.
