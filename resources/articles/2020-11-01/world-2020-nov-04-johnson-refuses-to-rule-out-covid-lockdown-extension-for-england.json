In a mixed message before an afternoon Commons vote on the lockdown, which is due to start on Thursday, the prime minister had earlier told the CBI conference that the restrictions would definitely end in four weeks. In a video message to the event, produced after the prime minister pulled out of a scheduled speech on Monday, he told CBI delegates: \u201cBelieve me, we will end these autumn measures on 2 December when they expire.\u201d But under pressure from Keir Starmer at prime minister\u2019s questions on Wednesday, Johnson would say only that the lockdown rules would expire on 2 December, which they will do under law. He declined twice to fully engage with questions from the Labour leader about whether the government could then propose an extension to national restrictions if the R rate was still above 1, meaning the number of Covid cases was still rising. \u201cWill the lockdown end on 2 December, come what may, or will it depend on circumstances at the time? People need to know that,\u201d Starmer asked. Johnson responded: \u201cThese autumn measures to combat the surge will expire automatically on 2 December, and we will then, I hope very much, be able to get this country going again, to get businesses, to get shops going again in the run-up to Christmas. \u201cBut that depends on us all doing our bit now to make sure that we get the R down. I have no doubt that we can.\u201d Starmer pressed the PM with his next question, asking specifically if lockdown would end if the R rate remained above 1 on 2 December, with Johnson avoiding the question. The Labour leader expressed exasperation, saying: \u201cI just want some basic honesty. This is serious \u2013 we\u2019ve got to look the public in the eye.\u201d Earlier in the Commons exchanges, Starmer had asked Johnson to justify his delay in imposing a national lockdown, saying that on 21 September, when government scientists advised a \u201ccircuit breaker\u201d period to reduce infection rates, the daily Covid death toll had been 11. \u201cOn Monday, 42 days later, the number of people who tragically lost their lives to Covid-19 was 397 \u2013 that\u2019s a staggering 35-fold increase,\u201d Starmer said. \u201cDoes the prime minister understand the human cost of his delay in acting?\u201d In an answer seemingly aimed as much to the Conservative rebels who plan to vote against the lockdown, Johnson said there had been no choice but to change course, while insisting it had been right to first try a system of tiered regional restrictions. \u201cIt is precisely because we understand the economic cost, and it is precisely because we understand the social, the psychological damage of lockdown, that it was right to go for the local and the regional solutions,\u201d he said. Starmer urged the PM to use the lockdown to improve the performance of the test-and-trace system, saying it was not reaching enough contacts, and that too many people were not self-isolating when told to. Johnson praised the performance of the system overall, but added: \u201cI am perfectly willing to accept the failings of NHS test and trace, of course I am. And of course I take full responsibility for the frustrations people have experienced with that system.\u201d At the CBI conference, Johnson said he knew many companies had taken major steps to comply with restrictions. \u201cI want to thank you for the heroic efforts you\u2019ve made to look after your employees, to make your premises Covid-secure, putting in Perspex screens, all the trouble you\u2019ve gone to in complying with the kinds of diktats that I never believed we would have to impose, which, I assure you, go completely against every free market instinct I possess.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
