Rix, 19, scored after just 12 minutes to give his team the lead, but how Terry Yorath's team failed to earn at least a replay and the chance of a fourth-round meeting with either Rotherham or Southampton is a complete mystery. The Worthington Cup semi-finalists Wednesday controlled the first half and could have taken a fourth-minute lead but for the wasteful finishing of the Dutch forward Gerald Sibon who, having escaped the attentions of his marker Efetobore Sodje, could only shoot wide of goal from 18 yards. It proved to be a costly mistake as Crewe quickly found themselves ahead courtesy of a well taken goal by Rix. He was rewarded for his burst into the Wednesday penalty area by Rodney Jack, whose lob over the defender Ashley Westwood allowed Rix to strike a left foot volley past goalkeeper Kevin Pressman. Wednesday responded well though. The defender Marlon Broomes brought a fine save from the goalkeeper Ademole Bankole before Matthew Hamshaw finally scored a deserved equaliser for the visitors on 23 minutes, lobbing home from 18 yards. The half-time break helped Crewe as they were brighter after the restart. Rix, fresh from his goal, picked out Rob Hulse with a raking ball that deserved an effort on target at the very least from the beanpole striker but, with Pressman stranded, Hulse failed to connect properly with his goalbound header and it was cleared to safety. However, with 68 minutes on the clock, defender Steve Foster showed Hulse how it should be done with a powerful far post header from Lunt's corner to restore Crewe's lead."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
