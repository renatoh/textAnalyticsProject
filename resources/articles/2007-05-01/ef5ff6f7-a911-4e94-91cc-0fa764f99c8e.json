To a witty and elegant text by John Gay, with a few snippets of Pope thrown in, it describes how the shepherd Acis's love for the nymph Galatea is destroyed by the violent intervention of the jealous giant, Polyphemus. On paper, it is an artificial conceit; but Handel's exquisite score humanises all three characters to the point where we genuinely feel for Galatea as she mourns her lost love. Handel's first performance, in 1718, may well have been staged, but nowadays we are used to concert performances with substantial choral forces. For this version, given by the Gabrieli Players in the baroque splendour of their London base at Spitalfields, conductor Paul McCreesh opted for a choir of five, comprising the principals themselves (though Rosemary Joshua, with a lot to sing as Galatea, was let off choral duties; Rebecca Outram filled in neatly). Joshua shines in this music. Her pearly, pristine tone has a sweetness but also a sexiness that perfectly captures the lovelorn nymph. Tenor Paul Agnew presented her tender swain with immaculate grace, with vivid support from Christopher Purves singing the comic-grotesque Polyphemus, who shatters their Arcadian idyll. Two other tenors - Robert Murray and Richard Butler - fleshed out Damon and Coridon, a couple of junior shepherds to whom Handel gives more and better music than such parts usually attract. McCreesh and his players kept the score light on its feet, the recorders revelling in picturesque highlights, as birds hushed by Galatea's voice and as mocking accompanists to Polyphemus's clumsy love song. The resonant acoustic, however, smudged some of the instrumental detail, especially in the overture, which was taken at quite a lick."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
