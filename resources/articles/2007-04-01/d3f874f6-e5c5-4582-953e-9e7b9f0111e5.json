One was dead, one was mad and one was himself - and he had forgotten it. Knowledge of the British pension fund system is only fractionally wider. If 10,000 people understand the nexus of rising life expectancy, falling interest rates, complex asset allocations, contribution rates and dividend distribution policies that create pension fund deficits, I'd be surprised. Yet pensions have become a political hot potato without anybody understanding why they are in trouble. Over the last five years a growing number of funds that offer a guaranteed pension on retirement have closed their membership to new members, while those who make no such promise have been telling their beneficiaries to lower their already low pension expectations. Private pensions are becoming meaner. Somebody must be blamed, and the front line candidate for the Conservative party is the chancellor. For years they have told anybody who would listen that pension funds, whose investment assets are worth \u00a3800bn, need another \u00a3100bn on top to compensate for the lost income that the chancellor \"stole\" in his first budget. In his most infamous \"stealth\" tax he took \u00a35bn in today's value away from pension funds when he abolished their privilege to claim back tax credits on dividends they received from UK firms. To deliver \u00a35bn of income in interest and dividends pension funds today, they would need \u00a3100bn of assets. As it happens, the gap between what they have and what they need to have to pay the pensions they promised is \u00a3100bn. Thus it was Brown's raid in 1997 that has caused the crisis; he is the guilty man - a charge they aim to press home in a debate the Commons this week. The aim, of course, is to tar and feather the probable next Labour prime minister - and as nobody understands anything except stealth tax, pensions crisis and Brown's reputation as somehow tricksy, it's an easy win. What has brought the issue to life is some determined journalism by the Times, which has used the Freedom of Information Act to get the Treasury's background papers at the time, revealing that officials warned Brown what would happen. Brown is doubly condemned. Except the papers reveal something rather different, and much more interesting. Officials in the financial institutions division, whose job was to represent pension fund interests, predictably made strong warnings about what the impact would be and how it would be presented as a disaster by the industry. That is what they are paid to do. Officials in the Treasury's savings and investment division, the economics unit and the Inland Revenue, on the other hand, were more sanguine. Pensions were well funded and any costs would be transitional - only two thirds of the tax credits went to pension funds in any case. And what everyone knew was that \u00a34bn of the \u00a35bn (in today's value) was earmarked for cuts in company taxation to boost investment, a better use of taxpayers' money than making fat pension funds even fatter. For at the time pension funds were in surplus, as they were for another three years. Then three huge problems hit. Suddenly actuaries realised people would live up to two-and-a-half years longer than expected; pension funds would need another \u00a3100bn to compensate. Interest rates fell to a 50-year low, so the funds needed another \u00a3100bn. The stock market crashed. In the past, everybody would have hoped markets would reverse themselves (as they have) and kept calm. But the accountancy profession chose to make firms announce their fund deficits every year, as if the share prices and interest rates on the last day of the accounting year would never change - one of the most asinine and destructive accounting conventions ever invented. Companies took fright, and so the pensions crisis was born. Meanwhile Britain has enjoyed a sustained increase in investment in not only physical assets but, more important, in so-called intangible assets (from software to research and development), partly as a result of the 1997 tax cuts on companies. If the tax credit had been retained there would still have been a pensions crisis but the economy would have grown less rapidly. In any case, the notion that Brown could have anticipated what happened is moonshine. Brown has made judgment calls on pensions with which I disagree: his opposition to linking growth in the state pension to earnings, rather than prices, was wrong. But the wider debate on the pension fund tax credit is not about difficult calls. It is about damaging Brown, just as was the weekend attack on him for selling gold six years ago at lower prices and allegedly losing the UK \u00a32bn. Out of context it looks bad. In context most other countries were selling gold at the time, not least because it pays no interest. David Miliband is not going to stand as the Anybody But Brown candidate, backed by disaffected Blairites. Therein lies defeat, political oblivion and a split party. Brown will succeed Blair. So he is likely to be the object of massive vilification, of which this week's debate is just the hors d'oeuvre. He and progressive Britain should beware. \u00b7 Will Hutton is chief executive of the Work Foundation will.hutton@observer.co.uk"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
