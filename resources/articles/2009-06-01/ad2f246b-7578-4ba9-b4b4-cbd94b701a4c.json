On 4 April, I applied to transfer the whole Birmingham Midshires Isa to NatWest. I calculated this would be around \u00a37,000. I experienced various problems but received a final letter which I believed resolved the issues and showed an opening deposit of \u00a36,812. But Birmingham Midshires sent only \u00a33,815 to my NatWest account. The rest of my money is lost. If the transfer had gone smoothly, I would have been eligible for a higher interest rate at NatWest. HC, Oldham Birmingham Midshires has different products \u2013 one for new Isas and another for transferred Isas \u2013 paying different rates of interest. After your call, it set up an account to receive the money transferred from NS&amp;I. You sent a completed application form with \u00a33,600 for a new Isa. When Birmingham Midshires realised it opened another Isa for the money, unknown to you. The money from NS&amp;I then arrived but, instead of going to the transferred-Isa account, it went into the new-Isa account. If that wasn't bad enough, the cheque, says Birmingham Midshires \"appears to have bounced\" and the money was returned to NS&amp;I. Then NS&amp;I sent a replacement but again this was paid into your new-Isa account. After an internal report, the mistake came to light and the transferred money was sent to the correct account. When you asked to move the money to NatWest, you quoted only one account number because that is all you knew about, but it is why only half the amount went over. When you queried this with Birmingham Midshires, it wrongly sent you a transfer form, whereas the clerk should have told you to get the form from NatWest. This has now been sorted out. Birmingham Midshires is sending you \u00a350 to apologise and \u00a34.74 for the interest you lost by not having a higher balance with NatWest from the outset. \u2022 Email Margaret Dibben at your.problems@observer.co.uk or write to Margaret Dibben, Your Problems, The Observer, Kings Place, 90 York Way, London N1 9GU and include a telephone number.
