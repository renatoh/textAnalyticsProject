The Italian, who has received no indication from Chelsea that he will be allowed to see out the final year of his contract and is yet to discuss potential transfer targets with the Londoners, will take charge of what is likely to be his final game at Evertonon Sunday with his team virtually guaranteed to finish in second place in the Premier League. He anticipates speaking to the club, most likely the chief executive, Ron Gourlay, and the chairman, Bruce Buck, rather than the owner, Roman Abramovich, at their Cobham training complex next week. Yet he will not go into that meeting intent on fighting his corner. \"We will arrange a meeting to discuss our issues but I'm very quiet, very calm, and I just want to wait and see what the club have decided,\" he said. \"I continue to have a fantastic relationship with Ron Gourlay and Bruce Buck. I had a meeting with Bruce Buck today [at an end-of-season barbecue] with no problem. I'm not 'desperate' to keep this job. My desire is to stay here because I feel happy here but it's not my decision. I won't beg. I don't want to 'fight' to keep my job. \"That's just my character \u2013 I don't know if it's a weakness or not. But the club have to judge me over the two years of my job. If they think that my job was good for this club, I will stay. If they think that it was not so good, I will have to go. \"When I started my experience here in England, if someone had told me that we would win the FA Cup and the Premier League in the next two years, I would have been happy. This year was not so good, I know, but we can learn from this experience. If they decide to change, you won't see me crying. I will accept the decision and find another solution.\" Ancelotti claimed Chelsea's support for him had never wavered, even during a mid-season slump that effectively cost them their league title, and that at no time had he been put under undue pressure or, indeed, undermined by the hierarchy. Even so, he again declined to offer any comment on the surprise decision to sack his assistant, Ray Wilkins, back in November to be replaced by Michael Emenalo other than to reiterate that it was the \"club's decision\". \"At a 'difficult' club, you are not able to do your job while you're there,\" he added. \"Here, I have a lot of responsibility. I didn't have pressure in these two years, to put this player or that player in the team. I was very much in control and had my own ideas. They've supported me at every point, but that doesn't mean that, if they want to change\u2026 It's their decision. I am proud of what I have done over the last two years. I have felt good, and I continue to feel good here. I love this atmosphere and the training ground. The people who are working around me are very honest and professional. I think, together, we did a good job.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
