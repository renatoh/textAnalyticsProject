Belgium controlled much of the first half, showing why they are top of the world rankings, and led after an early penalty from Romelu Lukaku. \u201cI think it was a really high-level game,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cWe got caught with a few counterattacks and that sort of unhinged us. They caused us problems down the sides but we resolved those issues. It was a huge test to come through that and stay in the game.\u201d England rallied after the tricky start and had a chance to level when Jordan Henderson won a penalty after making the most of minimal contact from Thomas Meunier at a corner. Marcus Rashford equalised from the spot. Southgate said: \u201cThe penalty came at a critical moment and meant we could go in at half-time when we needed to regroup.\u201d England earned the points thanks to Mason Mount\u2019s deflected winner in the 65th minute. \u201cIn the second half the way they used the ball showed composure,\u201d Southgate said. \u201cThey defended as a team and in these games you have to. Bar the one incredible pass Kevin De Bruyne hit in the second half, every time one man got beaten there was someone else to clear up. \u201cI was proud of what they did. When you think the front players, plus Declan [Rice] and Trent [Alexander\u2011Arnold], are so young, to go and win should give them a sense of what might be possible over the next few years.\u201d Henderson joked about the penalty incident with Meunier but insisted he did not go down easily. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t sure it was a penalty but I was pretty sure it was,\u201d the midfielder said. \u201cI was in front of him and he pulled back on my shoulder. After that we grew in confidence in the game, after speaking about a couple of things tactically at half-time.\u201d England started without Kane because the striker had felt muscle tightness during training, while a weary Henderson had to be substituted. Kane replaced Dominic Calvert-Lewin in the second half and Southgate is confident his captain will play against Denmark at Wembley on Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re hoping Harry will progress. With Jordan it\u2019s a little more complicated. We\u2019re going to have to assess him,\u201d Southgate said. Ben Chilwell could be involved, having missed the Belgium game because of illness."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
