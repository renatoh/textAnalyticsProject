Today Switzerland is inviting guests to doze and dash with the opening of the world's first McDonald's hotel. Visitors to the Golden Arch hotel in R\u00fcmland, close to Zurich airport, can take naps on disposable \"comfort light\" mattresses, breakfast on McMuesli and send McMails from bedside computers. Hotel bosses, who are hoping to be awarded with four stars soon, stress that the 211-bedroom establishment aims to attract \"a higher standard of customer\" than its normal fast-food outlets, although a quick turnover of guests is expected. Families are expected at weekends - for 189 Swiss francs (\u00a377) a night - and business clients will pay the same amount for single rooms on weekdays. The golden trademark \"M\" has been replaced by an \"H\", so that customers do not think the establishment is a low-market motel. Guests should feel cossetted in the McDonald's world, say those behind the concept. The original plans to create rooms with hamburger-shaped beds and pomme-frite bed lamps were outvoted by managers, but red and yellow still dominate the colour scheme and guests will sleep under golden arch bedsteads. \"There is nothing here to remind you that you are in Switzerland,\" a McDonald's spokesman, Andy Bantel, said proudly. Rooms are equipped with sit-and-sleep sofa beds which guests set up themselves. Metal clothes racks replace wardrobes, and instead of bathrooms, \"wet areas\" in the middle of rooms boast \"immaculate hygiene\" and \"mini-WCs\". Red and yellow curtains to conceal views of the airport runway, bright yellow carpets and M-shaped chairs complete the look. A Swiss newspaper called the sound-proofed rooms as \"cosy and charming as a freshly-scrubbed intensive care ward\". The hotel, it added disapprovingly, was aimed at those \"who prefer to eat with their fingers\". McDonald's president, Jack Greenberg, said the hotel was the result of \"Swiss resourcefulness\". \"Since its start in 1976, McDonald's Switzerland has constantly looked for new ways to strengthen the brand and look for new customers,\" he said via a video link-up with Switzerland. So far, Swiss ventures have brought McDonald's to trains, planes and mountain tops. From next month they will expand to autobahns, when a second hotel opens on the edge of the French-speaking town of Lully, in western Switzerland. A third is in the planning stage near Geneva. Switzerland has 116 McDonald's restaurants."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
