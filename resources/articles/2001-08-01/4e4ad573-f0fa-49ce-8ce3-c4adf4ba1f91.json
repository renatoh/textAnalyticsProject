Company East's Japanese version of Medea, in which traditional Noh theatre gets a modern makeover, begins with a war and ends in a massacre. This Medea is bathed in the red glow of blood. From the moment Medea slaughters her brother and sets sail with Jason, it is as if something has been unleashed: the genie is out of the bottle, the virus has escaped. The company fling themselves around the space until you feel that the walls might burst. You hear the sound of women who could be weeping or laughing. The noise is such that it feels unbearable, like the pain inside Medea's head. Medea, played as is traditional in Noh theatre by a male actor, glitters malignantly and bides her time. In her gold sequins she catches the light like the blade of a lethal knife in the moonlight. She hugs her children, already dressed in sacrificial white, to her breast. In a clap of thunder the killing begins. There is no going back, just a hurricane of destruction. The production demands that the viewer knows the story and is almost a little too compact in its telling. It also ends rather curiously with the company introducing themselves to the audience, taking the edge off a production that otherwise leaves you shattered. \u0095 Until August 27. Box office: 0131-221 9009."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
