This month's renewal is living up to its reputation, with a series of ante-post favourites having come and gone. Today's TFM Cyntergy Juvenile Novice Hurdle at Newbury could just provide a much-needed clue to the four-year-old puzzle. The powerful stables of Nicky Henderson and Martin Pipe are represented by Lord Joshua and Lunar Crystal, respectively. Both are still in the Triumph. Kirat is not, but it will be interesting to chart his progress after he took the scalp of one-time Triumph favourite, Volano, at Sandown. Lunar Crystal (2.10) , one of 12 Pipe entries in the big race at Cheltenham, barely caused a ripple in ante-post betting when second on his hurdles debut at Wincanton last week. But victory today would see him enter calculations. Useful at his best when trained by David Elsworth on the Flat, Lunar Crystal was pitched in against older novices at Wincanton and ran as though the experience was needed. Held up in a race run at a sedate pace, he came through strongly in the closing stages, without undue punishment from Tony McCoy, to chase home stable-mate Jaybejay, who is a well-regarded New Zealand import. The lasting impression was that Lunar Crystal would be a lot sharper next time. Lord Joshua has been prominent in Triumph betting, but he was an expensive flop when third behind Domirome at Kempton, where soft ground was given as an excuse. Conditions will be no better today. The Henderson stable will not be contemplating defeat for Irish Hussar (2.40) following his highly encouraging second behind Eternal Spring over the course last month. Foly Pleasant was cut from 6-1 to 5-1 joint-favourite by Coral for the Mildmay of Flete Handicap Chase at Cheltenham after it emerged yesterday that Siberian Gale, who had been a well-backed 8-1 chance, would miss the race through injury. Siberian Gale's trainer, Jonjo O'Neill, otherwise continued his fine run when Native Man scored at Ludlow yesterday and the trainer is hopeful of reaching the 100 mark in a season for the first time as a trainer. O'Neill said: \"This is obviously my best season, and my first based at Jackdaws Castle, so I'm thrilled. You can never be confident in this game, but I will be doing my best to get 100 winners, I can assure everyone.\" Of Native Man, he commented: \"The fitting of a tongue strap and the step up to three miles seems to have suited him. We'll give him a month or so off now to freshen him up and then bring him back as he wants good ground.\" Timmy Murphy has shelved plans to return to action at Newbury tomorrow after aggravating a shoulder injury while riding at Kempton last weekend. \"He's having physio but he doesn't feel 100% right about it so he's going to sit it out for another few days,\" his agent Chris Broad said yesterday. Murphy, who is currently having his best ever season with 81 winners, might not have been at his best on the Paul Nicholls-trained Sud Bleu, who finished second in the Adonis Hurdle at Kempton. Connections retain their faith in the French import and feel Sud Bleu can turn the tables on Giocomo in the Triumph. Frankie Dettori opened his Classic account for the year when winning the UAE 2000 Guineas on Essence Of Dubai for Godolphin at Nad Al Sheba yesterday. The Pulpit colt, who won two of his four starts when campaigned in America last season, took the mile race on dirt from his stable companion Firebreak, the mount of Jamie Spencer. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
