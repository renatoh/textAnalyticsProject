Wars can be harder to call. In our tricky away fixture against lowly Iraq, manager George W Bush, who seems to have learned everything he knows from Steve McLaren, claimed all three points were in the bag. But it transpired we had barely reached half-time. The visitors were favourites, but if you concede that many own goals, you will be punished; there are no mugs at international level these days. Now we are deep in injury time and the part-timers of Iraq Disunited are going through to the next round, probably against Saudi Arabia. Well, they got so many bodies in the box we couldn't break them down. Yep, it's all over bar the post-match interview with Garth Crooks. And who does Bush's slippery inside left, Tony Blair, blame for our early exit? He can't diss the ref - Kofi Annan warned of red cards for violent conduct - so he claims it was the media wot lost it. The army can't defeat the militias, so cynically fouls the media, banning ITN. The BBC is accused of being tapped up by the opposition after giving too much time and space to a star al-Qaeda striker. Oh, and Downing Street gives newspaper galacticos, like my new Observer team-mate, midfield general Henry Porter, the hairdryer treatment for not keeping 'perspective'. Whose side are hacks on? How dare they doubt Iraq is infused with Babylonian bonhomie? Hmm. Perhaps Blair consider Baathist strongholds scarcely rowdier than Bath on a Friday night; all they need are a few Asbos and Falluja dinner parties will twitter about soaring house prices after the arrival of Foxtons and that slot on Location, Location, Location. Blair's notion of a bobby's lot in Baghdad is quaint indeed: \"Allo, 'allo, 'allo. What's all this then? Are you terrors scrumping? Out with those apples stuffed down your jumpers. Oh, lucky for you they aren't golden delicious and only suicide bombs or I'd clip you round the ears. Inshallah.' If Blair still has a strategy, it has changed from 'win ugly' to 'lose quick, then claim victory'. Bush floated this new cunning plan last week: 'I'm trying to figure out a matrix that says things are getting better.' 'Says', you notice, not 'makes' things better. Then it becomes Operation Shock and Awe Let's Scarper. But it needs the fiction of victory. And as hacks won't play this game, it is shoot the messenger time; well, there are no other obvious targets left standing. This is so mad and bad it is painfully funny. As Bush threatens to 'punish' Iraqi ministers - not himself, not Rummie - for the chaos, tears roll down my cheeks. He and Blair are in such rich comedic form Rory Bremner can retire. Borat's next movie should be Cultural Learnings for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Great Britain; our leadership is that tin pot, that deluded. In 1945, we won the war but lost the peace. In 2006, we lost the war and there will be no peace. Match abandoned, pools panel verdict: home win. Judge ye not Let us not ooze too much cultural condescension about that playful Muslim cleric from Down Under who suggested that unveiled women deserve to be raped as they are 'uncovered meat'. Until a few years ago, this view was accepted by the average British high court judge as received wisdom. If you cherish England's heritage, start worrying now A harsh wind might rattle through the stately homes of England, but the establishment still toasts its tootsies by the fire. With few of us noticing, a new head of English Heritage was to be appointed. A key post, this. With ministers always obsessed with the new, never the old, we need a bod to stand before the bulldozers. Yet it took the vulgar intrusion of the rozzers' criminal investigation into the cash for coronets scandal to floodlight the appointment process. Tory treasurer Lord Marland was favourite to be crowned King Heritage until it was realised the filth might interview him during their extensive inquiries. His qualifications? He has trousered squillions from insurance and touched Tory tycoons for fortunes, but there is little to suggest he knows his artefacts from his elbow. Oh well, if Marland is otherwise engaged, Culture Secretary Tessa Jowell can always ring the only other name on the shortlist, Lady Cobham, left, who collects quangos like others collect Penny Blacks. Lady C has already proved her love of Britain's landscape by trying to cover it with casinos. And she knows about ruins: she shacks up with that monstrous carbuncle, David Mellor. Oh, and this is surely a coincidence, but she is also a 'friend' of Ms Jowell. Have we been quangoed? Masked balls? Far too revealing Few phrases sap the soul like 'fancy dress'. It is up there with 'last orders' and 'next up: Trisha'. I would rather attempt anal sex with the mummified remains of Leonid Brezhnev than attend another fancy dress party. Hell, I'd even watch Celebrity Squares But the demi-monde was out last week at a masked ball. Disguise might have helped Kimberly Quinn, David Blunkett's former friend, ease back into rude society. But for others, there should be health and safety warnings against masked balls. Imagine the poor guest, delighted to lure some disguised lovely into the shrubbery, who then slips off her mask, gown and leg and is revealed to be Heather McCartney. One guest, Kate Moss, did look suitably minxy, but then she would look minxy at a Cherie Blair lookalike contest. The rest of us don't. And I speak as one due to attend a Boogie Nights party dressed as a Seventies porn star. I know I will just look like Noddy Holder. Men appear especially silly: they imagine they look like suave blades at a Truman Capote ball; they actually look like Jonathan Ross after a trip to his overly inventive tailor. Perfect geometry at the museum From the glory of Leonardo da Vinci to the arguably even greater glory of Kylie's arse. I encountered swollen crowds last week at the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum to admire the Italian's perfect geometry, but the swelling will be even more pronounced when Minogue's outstanding proportions are exhibited there next year. Stand by for 'we are not amused' harrumphs that the V&amp;A should not forsake antiquities for such modern treasures as the chanteuse's gold, bootylicious hot pants. The V&amp;A is, indeed, a long way from Neighbours, but if it takes arse to lure folk towards art, then why not? My niggle is with the cant of curators. 'What we are interested in,' witters one, 'is the way she has crafted an image through her wardrobe.' Hmm. Why not just admit the reason for the show is that Kylie has a fantastic arse? Tories play hunt the minority Back to anal sex. A Lib Dem MP only has to find himself crouched over a glass table in the company of a young man and bang goes his career. Hell, bang almost goes the party, ridiculed by commentistas. But when a married Tory MP leaves his family to spend more time with his male interior decorator, he is tipped for promotion. I would hope it is because Tories now embrace minorities. But I suspect it is because Tories are desperate to pretend they now embrace minorities."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
