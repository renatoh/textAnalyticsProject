The Democrats were reproached for joining Republicans to give the legislation a veto-proof majority. The bill, called the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act (Safe), would have to win a similarly large majority in the Senate to become law, which was considered unlikely. \u201cI am terribly disappointed in this vote,\u201d wrote one self-identified constituent on Delaware Democrat John Carney\u2019s Facebook page. \u201cBy voting against admitting Syrian refugees, the House of Representatives has legitimated the fear that ISIS aims on spreading. This vote is rooted in baseless fear and a lack of compassion for those most deeply hurt by ISIS.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m disappointed that you\u2019re caving to fear,\u201d a self-identified constituent wrote to Minnesota Democrat Rick Nolan. \u201cWere the existing checks inadequate? Regretting my vote.\u201d Though Democrat Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts did not post on social media about his vote, he was still criticized on Facebook. \u201cThe process in place to assess refugees was already adequate,\u201d wrote one voter. \u201cYou\u2019re playing into fears and into the agenda of ISIS by voting for this bill. I\u2019m ashamed that a Democrat from my state of Massachusetts would have gone along with this anti-refugee Republican legislation.\u201d In advance of the vote, senior Democrats in the House presented colleagues polling data showing that lawmakers who didn\u2019t support tighter restrictions would be in the sharp minority, the Huffington Post reported. Despite the warning, only 25% of Democrats in the House supported the legislation. The 47 Democrats who voted in favor of restricting refugees came from congressional districts scattered across the country, from blue states and red states, from cities and rural areas. Only 17 of them face competitive re-election races next year, in the judgment of the Cook Political Report. Many Democrats who voted for the bill issued similar statements explaining their thinking. After last week\u2019s Paris attacks, they said, more security was better. President Barack Obama has said he would veto the bill, which requires all refugee cases from Syria and Iraq to be subject to an FBI background check in addition to Homeland Security Department checks. It was unclear how much more difficult the new legislation would make the process for admitting refugees. Applicants already face daunting hurdles to admission, including in-person interviews with homeland security officials and background checks by multiple agencies, in a process that typically takes 18-24 months. The details of the checks are secret. To date, the United States has admitted 2,034 Syrian refugees for resettlement, according to figures supplied to Congress. An estimated 4 million people have been forced out of Syria in four-and-a-half years of conflict. Only one Democratic House member who faces a competitive re-election race next years, Elizabeth Esty of Connecticut, voted against the Safe Act. \u201cNot admitting refugees after an extensive and lengthy review process flies in the face of our country\u2019s moral leadership and prevents our nation from protecting vulnerable victims of the same kind of terror that struck the streets of Paris and Beirut,\u201d Esty said in a statement.
