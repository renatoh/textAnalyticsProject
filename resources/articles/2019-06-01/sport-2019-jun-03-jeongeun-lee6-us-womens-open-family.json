The South Korean broke down as victory was secured at the Country Club of Charleston \u2013 as, endearingly, did her translator during post-tournament interview duties \u2013 with family heartache the underlying theme. Now 23, Lee6 was only four when her lorry-driving father, Jung Ho Lee, was left paralysed after a serious accident. Beyond the obvious challenges for the family at that time, Lee6\u2019s amateur golf career subsequently required an abundance of journeys and hotel stays. Consigned to a wheelchair, Jung Ho Lee was still a regular at tournaments. \u201cBy looking at my family situation back then, I thought about wanting to play golf because I wanted to support my family no matter what,\u201d Lee6 said. \u201cI told my family that I wanted to play on the LPGA Tour for a long time. I want to thank my family, who are in Korea watching me on TV and supporting me all the time. I couldn\u2019t imagine it without you guys, with all your support.\u201d The feeling, one presumes, is mutual. Lee6 likes to be known simply as \u201cSix\u201d with the number an addition owing to the makeup of the Korean Tour. \u201cThere\u2019s six different players who have the same name, Jeongeun Lee,\u201d the champion said. \u201cIt goes by one, two, three, four, five, six. I\u2019m the sixth Jeongeun Lee player, and that\u2019s why they put it down as Jeongeun Lee6. But this is my lucky number too, so I would love to put down Lee6 as my last name.\u201d Fittingly, Lee6 won at an aggregate of six under par in what is her rookie year on the LPGA Tour. Earlier, she had grown disillusioned with professional golf in her homeland to the point where she wanted to stop despite seven victories. Her major credentials had been obvious; last year she finished in the top 10 in two of them. A newly introduced qualifying series, which Lee6 won, allowed her to take her professional talents to the US on a full-time basis. Lee6\u2019s rounds of 70, 69, 69 and 70 sealed glory in Charleston by two from Angel Yin, Ryu So-yeon and Lexi Thompson. As more illustrious names wilted in the North Carolina heat, Lee6 had the cushion of being able to bogey two of her last three holes. There appears no chance of Lee6 letting a $1m prize \u2013 boosted only last week \u2013 go to her head. \u201cSo my goal was, if I win the tournament, I can eat ramen,\u201d she said. \u201cThat was my goal. If I finish the top five, I can buy shoes. But I can buy shoes and eat ramen. So it\u2019s a double.\u201d A penny for the thoughts of Hank Haney, who caused outrage before the US Women\u2019s Open: when asked who he thought would win the tournament, Haney had said he would \u201cpredict a Korean\u201d and that he could not name six players on the LGPA Tour unless he could \u201cgo with Lee\u201d without a first name. The winner of the 74th edition of this major shrugged off the sentiment of Tiger Woods\u2019s former coach. \u201cI didn\u2019t really understand him that much,\u201d Lee6 said. \u201cSo I didn\u2019t really think about it.\u201d Haney, who was suspended by his radio show at the request of the PGA Tour, had apologised for his comments but has since dug himself a deeper hole with a series of tweets that suggested Lee6\u2019s victory had vindicated his prediction. \u201cKorean women are absolutely dominating the LPGA Tour,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf you asked me again my answer would be the same but worded more carefully.\u201d Lydia Ko finished in a share of 39th having failed to break 70 all week but the former world No 1 did produce a hole-in-one, at the 11th on Sunday. Incredibly, this marked only Ko\u2019s second career ace as a professional. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty cool record is that my first one was at the Olympics in Rio, and then my second one is at the US Women\u2019s Open,\u201d Ko said. \u201cMaybe I should go for the career grand slam holes\u2011in\u2011one or something. My goal is career grand slam. But career grand slam hole-in-one, I don\u2019t know if anyone\u2019s done that.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
