Weeklies are the new black; the accessory that no self-respecting magazine publisher can afford to be without. There are now some 20 serious contenders in the sector and although golden oldie Take a Break still tops the charts with a weekly sale of 1.2 million, at least half of the titles are recent entries, pushing turnover to more than \u00a3400m; a quarter of the entire magazine market. This week it was the turn of National Magazines, more usually associated with stalwart monthlies such as Good Housekeeping and Cosmopolitan, and certainly not a natural contender for the cutthroat weekly market. Yet Reveal, with a print run of 600,000 given away free, a future cover price of \u00a31 and a \u00a310 million marketing budget, shows no signs of being an also-ran - despite the fact that it bears an uncanny resemblance to Emap's super-successful Closer ( circulation 477,000) and is late on the scene behind IPC, Bauer, Emap and, of course, Richard Desmond. Judging by the tension and secrecy surrounding the launch, this is 'heads-on-the-block' time. As Nat Mags is well aware, the thing about weekly magazines is not the amount of money you stand to make if they are successful, it's the amount you'll lose if they're not. Editor Sarah Edwards is remarkably calm given what is at stake (\u00a316m over three years). Trained on news and features by legendary Sun editor Kelvin MacKenzie, she clearly thrives on tabloid pressure but having edited, among others, That's Life, she also understands the very different ebb and flow of magazines. Is she worried that Reveal, on the outside anyway, looks exactly like all the other celebrity magazines? 'This is not a celebrity title,' she says confidently, 'this is a modern women's weekly. We have celebrities on the cover because that's what makes people pick up a magazine but Reveal has much broader appeal than the others.' Edwards wants her readers to 'laugh, gasp and cry' but also to know which boots to wear with which skirt, what to throw on a pizza base for a quick supper and how to deal with the health issues that really matter. These are the ingredients of the traditional women's weeklies and her plan is to give them a modern spin with great celebrity stories. ('It's no good just having the photos,' she says), real-life features that 'talk to women's insecurities and help them through life', plus 'targeted TV listings for added value'. She agrees that Closer ('a fantastic magazine') is attempting the same package, but claims readers can see through the wrapping. 'There's no point in flinging 50 skirts on a page without showing how to wear them and there's no way readers will pick up the emotional punch of a real-life story unless it is presented properly.' Reveal is cleverly edited to deliver at a pace that suits time-hungry modern living. Edwards refers to 'a little hook on every page; a little button that you just have to press. We make everything achievable and then add a bit extra. Everybody likes a little extra fact.' The result means you can flick through and not feel disappointed; highlighted boxes on every feature give you a quick precis of what's in store so that you don't have to waste time with the full text if it doesn't appeal. Fashion and beauty start with the reader rather than the products; problem, solution, shape, choice - simply find yourself and off you go. And then there's that 'little extra fact': '9 out of 10 women wear shoes that are too small' etc, etc. Spread over 100 pages it certainly feels like value for money; too much, almost. But how will the average consumer, already bombarded by a bewildering choice of titles, select one over another? The answer is she probably won't. 'She'll buy a number of magazines, both weeklies and monthlies,' says Edwards. 'I know plenty of mummies' (she has two children, ages three and five) 'who buy, say, Good Housekeeping and a celebrity title one week and then a couple more weeklies the next with maybe Prima thrown in.' This multiple buying is what has made weeklies so popular with publishers. Given that loyalty to any one title is becoming a thing of the past it's infinitely more attractive to have four shots at a buyer during the month than just one. If you can sell, say, 500,000 copies a week, why on earth would you restrict yourself to a mere 500,000 a month? 'There's still plenty of energy and growth in the monthly market,' says Simon Kippen, publisher of Conde Nast's extraordinarily successful monthly Glamour. The title has recently soared to a circulation of 605,000, the biggest-selling women's monthly in Europe and all 'whilst the market has been flooded with these new weeklies', he says. The secret for monthlies, of course, is that they have two very healthy revenue streams - circulation and advertising - whereas weeklies have to rely principally on circulation. Jessica Burley, publisher of Reveal, hopes that once her title is up and running it will attract about 15 pages of advertising an issue. She points out that her other weekly title, Best, brings in the largest amount of advertising of any women's weekly, 780 pages a year. Heady as this may seem, it's nothing by comparison with Glamour's average of 45 per cent advertising which, given that the next issue is over 450 pages, is riches indeed. Kippen, as ever, is generous in his success, marvelling at the rapid growth of weekly titles whilst confirming that Conde Nast has no desire to join the fray. 'I suppose it depends on what appeals; if you like snacking on biscuits then you're a weekly person, but if you prefer a decent meal then it's a monthly.' Many advertisers used to dismiss weeklies as being too 'throw away', whereas monthlies pile up readers through 'pass on'. However, this has become less crucial. 'As long as a title offers high traffic and the right environment it doesn't matter if it's thrown away,' confirms Mark Gallagher, director of Manning Gottlieb OMD. 'These new weeklies will be very attractive to advertisers as long as they speak to different groups of readers. The danger is if they just add frequency.' Gallagher thinks the new breed of weeklies will give the monthlies a run for their money. 'These magazines are giving readers what they want in a nice jacket. They can read Closer or Reveal or one of the celebrity titles on the train without feeling downmarket.' 'Mass with class' is how National Magazines refers to it and it's something the creative team at Clemmow Hornby Inge, which produced Reveal's TV ads, have latched on to. 'People in media like to say celebrity is dying,' says director Danny Josephs, 'but Reveal was researched for over a year starting with almost no celebrity content and people didn't want it. It's the celebrities that take readers in and allow the publishers to add all the other bits.' But aren't these 'other bits' universal throughout the women's weeklies? 'To rely on content alone is dangerous; any publisher can buy content,' says Daniels. 'What differentiates one title from another is tone and how it markets itself.' Presuming that Reveal has captured the right tone and marketing approach, National Magazines plans to become a real player in the sector through its new joint venture with Australian Consolidated Press; ACP-NatMag. It believes that it can take on IPC and Emap despite Nat Mags' parent company, the giant American Hearst Corporation, having no experience in this market. Duncan Edwards, managing director of National Magazines, says: 'The Americans are watching what is happening in the UK with very great interest.' I bet they are.
