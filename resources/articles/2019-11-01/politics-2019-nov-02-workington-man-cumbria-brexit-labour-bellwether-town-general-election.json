They voted Leave and they\u2019re fed up\u2019", "bodyText": "Workington Man was having a peaceful smoke outside the Henry Bessemer pub when the word \u201cpolitics\u201d triggered a furious torrent. \u201cPolitics? You mean Brexit and all that? I\u2019m sick of it, absolutely sick to death. Let them do what they want, I don\u2019t give a shit any more, excuse my language. I\u2019m sick of listening to them, no one gives you a straight yes or no. I know I should vote, but sod that. I can\u2019t be bothered any more,\u201d said Anthony McMillin, 60. McMillin comes from a \u201cwhole family\u201d of Labour voters, and he voted Labour in every election until two years ago, when he switched to Ukip. He left school at 16 for a job in the local steelworks, which lasted three years until the plant closed in 1975. Then he was a swimming pool attendant, and later played in a band until the gigs dried up. Now he just about gets by, treating himself to the occasional pint at the Henry Bessemer, a Wetherspoons establishment named after a 19th-century engineer and inventor. McMillin\u2019s biography largely fits the profile of \u201cWorkington Man\u201d, the invention of a right-leaning thinktank Onward to describe the cohort of voters it says the Conservative party must win over if Boris Johnson is to secure a majority at next month\u2019s election. Onward\u2019s report said Workington Man was over 45, white, without a degree, voted Leave in the 2016 referendum, worried about crime, and \u201cfavours security over freedom\u201d. Workington, on the Cumbrian coast, is \u201cone of the places where the eponymous archetype is most common among the local electorate\u201d and is \u201cthe ultimate bellwether seat, despite being a longstanding Labour stronghold\u201d. According to Will Tanner, the thinktank\u2019s director: \u201cIt is clear that the Conservatives\u2019 path to victory runs through working-class rugby league towns like Workington, Warrington and Wigan \u2026 as well as the party\u2019s leafy heartlands in the south of England.\u201d Workington Town, the local rugby league club, swiftly issued a statement setting out its \u201capolitical\u201d credentials. Implicitly disassociating itself from Workington Man, the club said: \u201cWe cater for a broad church of fans, players and volunteers of all backgrounds, ages and gender, and always have done.\u201d Like Worcester Woman, Mondeo Man and other erstwhile target voters, Workington Man may disappear as quickly as he rose to prominence. Nevertheless, the Conservatives wasted no time in announcing a multibillion-pound funding package for towns in marginals in England\u2019s north and the Midlands, aimed at revitalising high streets and supporting small businesses. Meanwhile, Nigel Farage said he would visit Workington this week as part of the Brexit party\u2019s bid to win over disaffected pro-Leave voters from both the Conservatives and Labour. The sitting Labour MP, Sue Hayman, who is defending a majority of 3,925, dismissed the Workington Man epithet. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely old fashioned to try to put people into narrow, cliched categories,\u201d she told the Observer. \u201cTo assume all people who have a certain type of job and enjoy a certain type of sport and have a certain type of education are all going to vote in the same way is deeply patronising. I also couldn\u2019t believe, in this day and age, that women have been completely ignored.\u201d Apart from a three-year aberration, Workington has elected a Labour MP for the past 100 years. But its once muscular industrial base of shipbuilding, coal and steel has long gone, and in recent years traditional identities have fractured. Now, the main employers are the nearby Sellafield nuclear plant and a Swedish-owned paper factory, which has hinted at job cuts in the coming months. Tourism, farming and small food production form the basis of the local economy. It is Britain\u2019s least diverse constituency, said Hayman, and has a population ageing at twice the average national rate. \u201cDue to lack of industry and job prospects, young people leave, and older people come to retire because it\u2019s beautiful.\u201d Unlike almost 60% of her constituents, Hayman voted Remain in 2016. \u201cI\u2019ve had a number of people come to my surgeries to say, \u2018Why have you voted against Brexit?\u2019 I always say I\u2019d be irresponsible if I did not hear what businesses are telling me about the economic impact on my constituency.\u201d She listened to everyone, she said. \u201cSome constituents tell me they want to leave with no deal, some ask me to negotiate a good deal, some are desperate for me to promote Remain and a public vote, some don\u2019t care. Not everybody cares about Brexit.\u201d She was sceptical about whether the Tories would invest significantly in targeting her constituency, pointing out that the Conservative party was defending even smaller majorities than hers in two other Cumbria seats, Carlisle and Copeland. She will base her campaign on defending the NHS and expanding local transport infrastructure \u2013 \u201cthe things that people really care about day to day, what affects their lives\u201d \u2013 but acknowledged that Brexit would be a significant factor. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any point in worrying. I\u2019ve been the MP for four and a half years, a lot of people know me, and I think people will vote on different issues. I will just have to wait and see what people want to vote on. And if ultimately that means I lose my seat, then that\u2019s what happens.\u201d The Conservatives\u2019 hopes of taking Workington will have been boosted this weekend by a Survation poll for the Daily Mail which found that they were on course to win by more than 4,000 votes, with a 10-point swing from Labour. It may be ill-advised to give credence to any poll. But of the dozen or so Workington Men approached by the Observer last week, none said they intended to vote Labour. More than half insisted they would not vote; a few said they were undecided; one planned to vote for an independent candidate, and one said he would vote for either the Conservatives or the Brexit party, \u201cwhichever gives the clearest promise to come out\u201d. Tony Wareing, 71, a local businessman and chair of the Workington Heritage Group, said he recognised Workington Man among friends, associates and neighbours. \u201cHe is typical of most of the industrial towns throughout northern England that have traditionally voted Labour. That\u2019s changing because of Brexit. This is a Labour town but it\u2019s on the brink of change. Most people voted to leave, and it hasn\u2019t happened, and they are very fed up. It will be the issue that decides the election here. Labour voters might not switch to the Conservatives \u2013 they will probably just not vote.\u201d The local Brexit party candidate, Philip Walling, a former barrister who writes books on rural issues and has never belonged to a political party before, hoped to persuade disaffected Labour voters to back him. \u201cI\u2019ve heard a lot of people saying they are sick of the political classes and they won\u2019t vote,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there are also an enormous number of people saying, \u2018I\u2019ve always voted Labour, and I can\u2019t stomach the Tories, but I\u2019m prepared to vote for you.\u2019 They are Labour Leavers, and there\u2019s no other place for them to go.\u201d In the European elections in May, the Brexit party topped the poll in Allerdale borough, which incorporates Workington. On a 34% turnout, it got 38.5% of the votes cast, with Labour on 13% and the Conservatives on 9.5%. Farage\u2019s visit to the town this week is likely to make a splash, and no doubt prominent Tory and Labour figures will be hot on his heels. Hayman feared it could become \u201ca quite unpleasant and aggressive election\u201d. Despite an \u201cenormous amount of abuse: \u2018traitor\u2019, \u2018witch\u2019, the death-threat thing\u201d, she had never considered standing down. Instead, she was braced for a challenging campaign, the outcome of which was far from certain. \u201cI think it\u2019s going to be very volatile and it\u2019s difficult to judge what\u2019s going to happen at this stage.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
