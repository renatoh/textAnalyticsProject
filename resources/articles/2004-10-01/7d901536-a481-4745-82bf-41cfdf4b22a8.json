Healy's attempt, awarded for a foul on Cresswell by Marcus Bignot, was saved by Chris Day, a controversial incident given that Eddie Lewis had \"scored\" after the infringement only for referee Andy Hall to point to the spot. Moments later, however, Gino Padula handled in the area and Cresswell scored. There followed a touchline brawl. Three yellow cards for the participants and the dismissal of the Rangers coach Tim Breacker seemed the least Hall could do. \"Tim is the most honest fella I've ever met and somebody threw a punch at him and he got sent off,\" countered QPR's manager Ian Holloway. \"Apparently he went on and grabbed someone who was wearing a tracksuit and was involved. It was their physio and you can't send a physio off. I don't understand. We didn't start it, we didn't instigate it and we get punished. You have to look at [Preston's] Paul McKenna's behaviour and I felt the referee caused a bit of frustration with his earlier decisions.\" It all added up to an eventful evening for Healy, the subject of a \u00a3600,000 bid from Leeds United which was rejected yesterday. \"David is still a Preston player and he has reacted very well to the situation, working his socks off and doing everything we ask of him,\" said his manager Billy Davies. \"He has a decision to make about his future but, while he's with us, I hope he can keep this up.\" Healy claimed Preston's equaliser after 11 minutes when Georges Santos misread a long kick from Andy Lonergan. Two minutes earlier Santos had headed in Lee Cook's corner. Before the interval Kevin McLeod headed against the bar, an incident that left Preston's keeper Lonergan with two broken fingers, and Santos headed against his own post before an already eventful evening ended in bizarre fashion."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
