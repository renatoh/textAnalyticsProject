New release Prince of Persia barely scraped into the top 30, while Animal Crossing fared little better. And the older, but still recently released, likes of Gears of War 2, LittleBigPlanet and Wii Music are also out of the top 10. Surprises? Fallout 3 is doing surprisingly well and is easily the hardest-core game in the 10 - and probably the best too. The post-apocalyptic RPG obviously reaping multiformat success compared to platform exclusives like Gears 2 and Resistance 2. The new \u2013 and painfully average - Need for Speed game is hanging in there but seemingly failing to match the success of older versions. Also it will be interesting to see if Tomb Raider survives in the top 10 till Christmas. If so it proves there is life in Lara yet, or at least that PS3 owners in particular remain smitten. Anyway, with Call of Duty sitting pretty is it now time to shut the book on the Christmas Number 1? Or do you think something else may yet topple it?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
