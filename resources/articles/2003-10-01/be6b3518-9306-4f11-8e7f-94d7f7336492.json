Four years later, victories over Fiji and Romania took them into a quarter-final with New Zealand, but disappointingly failed at the group stage in the last two tournaments. Darkest day: Dismissal of Gareth Rees and Rod Snow in 1995 free-for-all against South Africa. Won't let you forget: That 1991 quarter-final when they took New Zealand to 29-13, having earlier drawn the following comment from All Black skipper Gary Whetton: 'They were as tenacious as any side we've come up against in the competition and that includes England.' Svengali factor: Since his appointment after the 1999 World Cup, David Clark has reinvigorated Canadian rugby but not before he was sacked in 2000. A players' strike saw him reinstated and a return of six wins and one loss last season indicates he knows his stuff. How do you beat them? Get among them from the off, keep the ball from their forwards and stop their rhythm. Otherwise they are awkward customers. How do they beat you? Under Clark, they are used to winning so if they can move the scoreboard early, then Al Charron's men have the nous to hold on. Lost without: Scrum-half Morgan Williams scored against Namibia and grabbed a brace against France during an effervescent display in the 1999 World Cup. Avoid in a dark alley: Mike James. Four seasons with Perpignan then Stade Fran\u00c0ais can only have made the big lock meaner. OSM prediction: After recording victories over Scotland, Wales and Ireland in the mid to late Nineties, the Canucks failed to progress until Clark took over. Could be the tournament's surprise team. The squad Backs: M Di Girolamo, E Fairhurst, M Williams, J Barker, R Smith, J Cannon, M King, N Witkowski, J Pritchard, D Lougheed, W Stanley, S Fauth, Q Fyffe, B Ross.
