The short opener, Right There, is a classic Gustavsen piano theme of gently soulful enquiries. Then saxophonist Tore Brunborg fuels an intense account of the traditional Norwegian hymn Eg Veit I Himmerik Ei Borg, built on Jarle Vespestad's snare-drum patterns and swelling to a warbling incantation. The Gift is an episode of eerily slow jazz balladeering, Staying There a gripping passage of snorty tenor-sax over a seamless Jarrett-like thunder, but there's also plenty of evidence \u2013 such as the static yet vibrant Glow \u2013 that Gustavsen's persuasive fragility is still intact."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
