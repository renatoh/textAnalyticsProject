While fisheries in Scotland have been treated as a priority in Brexit talks, Scottish seed potato farmers \u2013 one of the biggest exporters for the production of chips and crisps in the world \u2013 have been told they will be unlikely to be able to export to Northern Ireland from 1 January as things stand. Seed potatoes are potatoes from which others are grown but with strict EU-wide health checks for blight, pest and other diseases before being sold commercially. The Scottish industry accounts for 75% of UK production and is worth more than \u00a3200m a year, six times the value of the recently signed fisheries deal with Norway but dwarfed by the \u00a31.4bn overall UK fishing trade. Mairi Gougeon has written to Lord Gardiner of Kimble, the parliamentary under secretary of state for rural affairs, to say Scottish potato farmers, many of them running family businesses, have been put under \u201cincredible strain\u201d. At the centre of the issue is Northern Ireland\u2019s special place after Brexit, following EU customs rules on food and animals coming in from Britain whether there is a trade deal or not. But Gougeon complained that while the UK was offering the EU a six-month transition period to allow European seeds and plants to be sold in Britain, \u201cthe reciprocal arrangement is not available to us\u201d. This leaves EU markets and Northern Ireland closed to Scotland\u2019s producers. \u201cI must request again that you urgently contact the EU to press for an early resolution of the UK equivalence applications,\u201d she wrote in a letter seen by the Guardian, adding that the industry faced an initial \u00a315m financial loss \u201cas a result of not having access to the EU or NI\u201d. Officials at Defra have said they are waiting for the EU to recognise equivalence but farmers say they can\u2019t run a business on such uncertainty with just 59 days to go before the end of the UK\u2019s transition period. Iain Barbour, who runs the decades-old JBA Seed Potatoes in Dumfries with his father, said the situation was making people\u2019s lives \u201cmiserable\u201d. \u201cIf there was a huge disaster and the Northern Ireland potato crop failed, we would not be allowed to send in seed potatoes to help them. Even Asda and Tescos, they wouldn\u2019t be allowed to have eating potatoes from us,\u201d he said. Scottish seed potatoes are considered a global gold standard because they are less prone to diseases because of the climate, which puts them at a higher standard than EU regulations, he said. With the first seed potatoes planted around 17 March for early harvests at the end of May, \u201ccustomers in Northern Ireland are rushing to stock up,\u201d said Barbour in case the Scottish spud is banned from 1 January. Boris Johnson claimed the EU were threatening to \u201cblockade\u201d food supplies to Northern Ireland last month, taking the issue to an explosive political level. Seed suppliers are now fearing they will be collateral damage. \u201cI\u2019m actually really annoyed about it. We\u2019ve seen a 6,000% increase in demand from some of our customers who are stockpiling,\u201d said Paulo Arrigo, who runs Italian vegetable seed supplier Franchi in Harrow. \u201cDo you know what Defra\u2019s advice was? Tell everyone in Northern Ireland to get their stocks in before Christmas,\u201d said Arrigo. A Defra spokesman said it understood the importance of seed and other propagating material exports for UK horticultural businesses, and remained committed to securing market access beyond the end of the transition period. \u201cWe have already formally submitted the equivalence application, on behalf of the UK, to the European commission \u2013 and await their response,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
