Surprising lockdown pen pals A five-year-old girl wrote a touching letter to her elderly neighbour to check he was OK and remind him he is not alone during the coronavirus lockdown. Kiran \u201cfrom number 9\u201d sent a drawing of a rainbow along with the letter, which read: \u201cI have to stay at home because of the coronavirus. I just wanted to check to see if you\u2019re OK? I have drawn you a rainbow to remind you that you are not alone. Please write back if you can.\u201d Ron \u201cat number 24\u201d, aged 93, said he was so pleased to receive the message, and had placed the drawing in his window. \u201cLike you I am in isolation so it was so nice to hear of your concern for me,\u201d he wrote back. \u201cI was the first person to move into the crescent in 1955 and I have been here ever since. The situation with coronavirus is very bad and we must all do our very best to overcome it and hopefully come out of it in good health again.\u201d Louisa Smith, 23, posted the letter on Twitter and said her grandad Ron, who lives alone in Wolverhampton, was self-isolating but in good health. \u201cHe was just overwhelmed by it. I think he was quite shocked that they\u2019d thought about him, and the fact she\u2019s only five,\u201d said Smith. \u201cBut that\u2019s what\u2019s so beautiful about it, the age gap.\u201d Staff get creative to cheer up care home residents Staff at a care home in Newcastle have gone the extra mile to cheer up residents during the lockdown, helping them write messages to their loved ones and even creating their own in-house ice-cream van. With the local ice-cream van no longer able to visit as it usually does, staff at West Farm Care Centre recreated the experience with their own \u201cMrs Whippy\u201d station, using an online ice-cream jingle. \u201cI hate taking things away, I absolutely hate it, so we\u2019ve just had to think more creatively and out of the box,\u201d said Lucy Craig, owner of Craig Healthcare which runs the residence along with nearby Cramlington House. \u201cIt helps create smiles, energy and the feeling that things are as normal as they possibly can.\u201d Across both care homes, workers have also been helping residents connect with their loved ones, who are no longer able to visit, by taking pictures of them holding up messages, and arranging video calls. \u201cCoronavirus can do one,\u201d read the sign of one resident, while another said: \u201cI love you\u2019s. Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m okay.\u201d Local families who live next to Cramlington House have also reached out to the residents with letters and video calls, to help keep them company while they\u2019re separated from family. \u201cIt gives them a sense of reality beyond the front door, and tells them there\u2019s a community out there that genuinely care,\u201d said Craig. Clap for survivors A video of NHS staff applauding an 84-year-old granddad as he leaves hospital after beating coronavirus has gone viral on Twitter, with over 2m views. Staff wearing face masks and aprons line the corridor at Manchester Royal Infirmary and applaud as Solomon McFarlane is transported in his wheelchair towards the doors, after spending two weeks in hospital with the virus. \u201cOne of the nurses said it was a guard of honour. It was beautiful. Absolutely beautiful,\u201d said McFarlane\u2019s daughter, Esther. \u201cWe called him in hospital and encouraged him, said: \u2018You\u2019ve got to fight this.\u2019 And we all prayed for him.\u201d \u201cIt just shows that this Covid can be beaten, it\u2019s a video of hope,\u201d she added. Posting the video to Twitter, his granddaughter Rokaia, known as Sapph, said: \u201cHe had tested positive for Covid-19 then ended up having pneumonia. \u201cThe drs said he was \u2018deteriorating\u2019 and the next 24hrs are \u2018critical\u2019 but God! My Granddad is 84 years old and has beaten Covid-19. Thank you NHS staff.\u201d McFarlane is now back home in Manchester with his wife and son. Coronavirus medics put on a friendly face Medical staff have been pinning pictures of themselves over the top of their protective gear to help patients see the faces of those treating them. A photo posted on Twitter shows three Israeli medics with pictures pinned over their hazmat suits. With their face masks and hoods, patients can only see the eyes of those caring for them. Over in California, Robertino Rodriguez took similar action by pinning a laminated photo of himself with his name and job role over the top of his protective suit. \u201cYesterday I felt bad for the patients in my ER when I would come in the room with my face covered in PPE,\u201d he said. \u201cA reassuring smile makes a big difference to a scared patient. So today I made a giant laminated badge for my PPE so my patients can see a reassuring &amp; comforting smile.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
