Ernie Wise is affectionately represented throughout as a miniature smiling dummy, but as the show makes clear, it was his business acumen and generosity that made the partnership work: everything earned was split down the middle, it didn't matter who got the laugh. It was also founded on hard work, and not a little luck. The work meant endless practice: four frenzied weeks to get a bare four minutes of material; years of graft to hone 10 minutes. But happenstance played a part in their rise to fame, too: they were lucky enough to arrive on the prewar scene when there were still enough Alhambras and Hippodromes to hone their talent at the bottom of the bill, before rising to the top just at that moment when TV was taking off and there were only two channels to watch. More than half the population tuned into one of their Christmas specials, although the pair's first TV appearance was a crushing disaster. Their popularity is conveyed in Tim Whitnall's cunningly constructed script, which seamlessly mixes biography and gags, and Bob Golding's winning performance. You feel that he might not be acting but actually channelling Morecambe. It's a wonderful turn, which is based less on a passing physical resemblance, and much more on capturing his stage persona, a man entirely without side who retained a quick-witted innocence and wide-eyed wonder at the world even into middle-age. There is something almost joyful about the evening that honours Morecambe without embalming him. This is probably a niche show for a niche audience, and at almost two hours, it feels over-stretched, particularly in the second half that loses momentum after the unnecessary interval. There is a limit to how many mother-in-law jokes that one show can support. But this is neatly packaged nostalgia providing the kind of family entertainment that Morecambe and Wise purveyed, and a reminder of a far more innocent era when comics smiled rather than snarled and audiences smiled back."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
