The journalist who uncovered the Cambridge Analytica data scandal has inspired a new thriller aimed at teenage readers. \u201cI would describe it as Nancy Drew meets The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\u201d said Icelandic novelist Sif Sigmarsd\u00f3ttir, referring to the fictional American teen detective and to Stieg Larsson\u2019s Lisbeth Salander to sum up the mix of styles in her Nordic tale. Sigmarsd\u00f3ttir, 40, who lives in London and is a published author in Iceland and Britain, sees Cadwalladr as a true role model. \u201cI wanted to do my part. Carole is amazing, because going up against power is hard and can be even dangerous. I have seen some of the online abuse she gets. We need more like her to inspire younger girls,\u201d Sigmarsd\u00f3ttir said. The Sharp Edge of a Snowflake, published by Hodder later this month, tells of the tireless investigations of a young journalist who, while reporting on a murder, uncovers the dubious practices of a data-driven marketing agency called London Analytica \u2013 an organisation determined to protect its efforts to capitalise on people\u2019s personal data. \u201cThe story is set in London and Reykjav\u00edk,\u201d said Sigmarsd\u00f3ttir. \u201cMy journalist is called Hannah Eir\u00edksd\u00f3ttir and she has red hair, not blonde, but she does wear Carole\u2019s cool leather jacket. \u201cI want to get teenagers to think about the Cambridge Analytica scandal. They should know what these companies are doing with the information they gather. In my book it is used to target vulnerable young girls, selling them weight-loss pills.\u201d The Pulitzer-nominated Cadwalladr, 49, is delighted to hear of the book: \u201cI\u2019ve been racking my brain about how to bring this story to a wider audience, and particularly a younger one, so I\u2019m delighted that Sif Sigmarsd\u00f3ttir has written this. These are such big issues. Finding creative ways of getting across what is a difficult and complex story is really key,\u201d she said. She is also pleased by the publisher\u2019s term \u201cfeminist Nordic noir\u201d. \u201cThis might be my dream genre. The world needs more journalists and I\u2019d be thrilled if a generation of young women were inspired by Sif\u2019s writing to join the fray.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
