Claudio Bravo saved two Wolves penalties before Sergio Ag\u00fcero scored the decisive spot-kick and while Guardiola was pleased with the victory, he expressed displeasure at the Mitre ball which is usually used in Football League matches. \u201cIt is not acceptable, the ball was unacceptable for a high-level competition,\u201d Guardiola said. \u201cIt is too light, it moves all over the place, it is not a good ball. It is impossible to score with a ball like that and I can say that because we won, I\u2019m not making excuses. All of my players said: \u2018What is that?\u2019 I\u2019m sorry Carabao Cup is not a serious ball for a serious competition. It\u2019s [for] marketing, money, OK but it\u2019s not acceptable \u2013 [it has] no weight, nothing.\u201d Asked if his players had had time to practise with the ball that was introduced at the start of the season for all EFL competitions but not the Premier League, the 46-year-old was dismissive. \u201cOne day or two days, but the ball is bad for one year or two years, it\u2019s not acceptable. All the players complain,\u201d he added. Of Bravo, who also made four crucial saves during the match, Guardiola said: \u201cClaudio gave us the chance to go through, I\u2019m so happy for him, the way he\u2019s trained, a good performance and good penalties. I\u2019m happy to win in this way.\u201d Bravo was signed in the summer of 2016 as Joe Hart\u2019s replacement but lost his starting berth due to a series of high-profile mistakes. Guardiola accepted it has not been easy for the player. \u201cYes, of course,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was not easy last season for him but he\u2019s a keeper at a high level \u2013 you can\u2019t be [the] Barcelona and Chile [goalkeeper] without being a high level. He deserved the performance. Without him we would not be in the next round.\u201d The manager added: \u201cIt\u2019s not easy for him, like with Yaya [Tour\u00e9, who also had a rare start], he wanted to touch the ball but it\u2019s difficult because the space was tight. For Claudio he\u2019s here to play but he\u2019s a good professional and he has to be ready \u2013 you never know what happens in football. But it\u2019s not easy to come in for games like this.\u201d Of the win, Guardiola said: \u201cMaybe now people will understand why things are difficult in football \u2013 it\u2019s so complicated in this competition. From tomorrow we have to focus again for the Premier League. In the first half we deserved to score one or two goals \u2013 we had chances in the first half but in the second half there were some counterattacks, they were so fast.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
