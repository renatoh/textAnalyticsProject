The club's hierarchy had accepted proposals for a \u00a370m share purchase from Morgan after more than a month of negotiations. Yet he revised that offer after checks during the process of due diligence suggested the cost of the proposed new stadium in Stanley Park had risen significantly. He then submitted a \u00a370m package that would have placed around \u00a350m directly at the club's disposal. But agreement could not be reached as to how the \u00a370m would be split between the club and shareholders."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
