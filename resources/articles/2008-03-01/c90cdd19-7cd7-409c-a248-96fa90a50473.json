Darren Mackie was the Dons' hero, scoring the goal which sets up a semi-final with Queen of the South. Celtic, whose season had promised so much, now only have the league to focus on. On a night of upsets St Johnstone of the First Division also progressed to the last four with a 3-1 victory at the home of Premier League St Mirren, and next face Rangers or Partick. Gordon Strachan had bemoaned the quality of the match-day experience on offer to fans in advance of this tie, with the Celtic manager's impassioned speech apparently striking a chord here. Straight from kick-off there was a noticeably more lively atmosphere than had been the case in recent weeks, a matter aided by Aberdeen's large and vociferous following. The consensus that opposition teams only get one chance to beat the Old Firm in cup competitions had been sufficient to render Aberdeen the underdog. Jimmy Calderwood's men conceded an equaliser to Jan Vennegoor of Hesselink at Pittodrie 10 days ago in the closing 30 seconds to set-up this replay, but they opened brightly this time round. Vennegoor of Hesselink, though, passed up the period's best two opportunities as Celtic gradually found some rhythm. Aberdeen were also fortunate not to concede a penalty, Zander Diamond appearing to block a header from the Dutch striker with a hand. A fine move involving the influential Shunsuke Nakamura and Vennegoor of Hesselink resulted in Scott McDonald firing a shot narrowly wide six minutes before the interval, then Aberdeen's Ricky Foster narrowly failed to capitalise on Stephen McManus's short back pass. Calderwood introduced the on-loan Sone Aluko at the interval in a bid to add some much-needed guile to proceedings, but then received a blow as Diamond was forced off with a head injury. Celtic had grown increasingly dominant at the time but Mackie broke the deadlock, finishing cleanly after Lee Miller headed into his path. The home defence, which has come in for recent criticism, had failed to clear an Aluko corner. Strachan's team resorted to desperate tactics in the final 20 minutes, Vennegoor of Hesselink again guilty of profligacy, but they barely worried the Dons. The Celtic manager cut a dejected figure as fans headed for the exits, all too aware that Saturday's trip to Rangers perhaps represents their last hope of salvation this season."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
