Since then, the book has been turned into a successful film (starring Meryl Streep) and sold hundreds of thousands of copies. But there\u2019s another reason to read it in 2019. The audacious conceit of The French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman was that it was a novel of 1867 written a century later. Fowles had his Victorian characters act within the constraints of their own time period, but he judged them by the standards of the late 1960s \u2013 and made a point of telling us about it. \u201cWhat are we faced with in the 19th century?\u201d he asked. \u201cAn age where woman was sacred; and where you could buy a 13-year-old girl for a few pounds \u2013 a few shillings if you wanted her for an hour or two. Where more churches were built in the whole previous history in the country; and where one in 60 houses in London was a brothel \u2026\u201d All good questions, even another 50 years later in 2019. After all, weren\u2019t Victorians also fond of saying \u201cjudge not, that ye be not judged\u201d? I\u2019m curious to see how Fowles measures up now. How will he fare in our own puritanical and hypocritical times? Will we share his concerns, or will we feel as removed from Fowles as he did from the Victorians? There\u2019s certainly the potential for some interesting frisson. And even if it turns out that we get along with Fowles just fine, I\u2019d still be keen to re-engage with him. Like plenty of other writers who turn up on this Reading group, his current reputation seems uncertain. I haven\u2019t read anything negative about him recently, because I haven\u2019t read anything much about him at all. Not so long ago, he was everywhere. Even in 2010, the Times named him as one of the 50 greatest novelists since 1945. Would he make such a list nine years later? Perhaps we\u2019ll have a better idea after revisiting The French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman. It\u2019s also worth saying that it\u2019s not all about judgment. There\u2019s also plenty of fun to be had in this book. One of the things I most clearly remember from when I read The French Lieutenant\u2019s Woman as a teenager is that it has a cracking story, a real emotional heart and a good sense of humour. The book may have a few metafictional fireworks and at least three endings (we\u2019ll look at them later in the month), but Fowles was also very good at the fundamentals. He makes you care and he makes you want to read on. The first sentence is a case in point: An easterly is the most disagreeable wind in Lyme Bay \u2014 Lyme Bay being that largest bite from the underside of England\u2019s outstretched southwestern leg \u2014 and a person of curiosity could at once have deduced several strong probabilities about the pair who began to walk down the quay at Lyme Regis, the small but ancient eponym of the inbite, one incisively sharp and blustery morning in the late March of 1867. I hope you\u2019ll join me in deducing strong probabilities this month.
