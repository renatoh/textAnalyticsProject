But - because it's common to accuse television of damaging children or being unpatriotic - the most interesting bricks thrown were two which at least had a fresh message wrapped around them: two public figures complained that reality TV has changed the entire nature of public life. The Manchester United manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, argued that the savage criticism recently received by England boss Steve McClaren and his team had been shaped by shows in which contestants are viciously evaluated and voted off: \"Even on that ice-dancing programme, they mock and criticise each other. It's just a mocking culture that we're in.\" This view was echoed by the lawyer for Joanne Lees, the English woman whose boyfriend Peter Falconio was killed in the Australian outback, when he complained about the refusal of some commentators to accept her version of events, which convinced a jury to jail Bradley Murdoch for murder. According to Lees's brief, the public now judges major trials on the basis of who they think most deserves to win, rather than the weight of the evidence. This, he suggested, came from too much exposure to American Idol. The lawyer's comments were partly prompted by the fact that his client's case has been turned into TV entertainment: not yet a gameshow, but a docu-drama which invites viewers to vote, at least mentally and metaphorically, on whether they support her story. But the coincidence of these worries - which, you feel, would be shared by many politicians, including Sir Alex's old chum, Tony Blair - raises the question of whether a relatively recent form of television can have such a rapid effect on national psyches. Personally, I would date the beginning of the \"mocking culture\" to 15 years ago, the time when John Major and George Bush the elder, after their economic policies collapsed, became the first politicians to experience the terrible contempt of the electorate for politicians, which has now become commonplace. With princes divorcing, ministers resigning and celebrities exposed as delinquents of various kinds, a coconut-shy mentality became the national default, in which reverence disappeared and respect diminished. That trend then collided with another: the industralisation of dissatisfaction. In 1993 Robert Hughes published The Culture of Complaint: The Fraying of America, in which he argued that citizens were increasingly encouraged to view themselves as victims, litigants or disgruntled customers. Everyone was a wrong - racial, medical, educational, marital - waiting to be righted. The tangible rise in public anger - typified by the suddenly headline phenomenon of \"road rage\" - was another manifestation of this refusal to submit to the rules or rights of another. These parallel movements, a decline in belief in political authority, combined with a rise in personal importance, marked a huge shift in public attitude. It's no coincidence that a central aspect of reality TV is voting: moreover, voting which has immediate and quantifiable effects. Kick-out talent shows are democracy made enjoyable and genuinely reactive. The realisation of many voters that politics is a kind of talent-show in which they can't affect the result no matter how often they push their buzzers encouraged a generalised rage against authority and celebrity, which found its expression in elimination entertainments such as Big Brother, Pop Idol and The X-Factor. So, as is so often the case, when television is accused of leading a trend, it was actually chasing a change in the public mood. That mood is also responsible for the savagery of the reaction to an under-performing England manager and team: fans identify themselves as customers of the team, who have the right, and even duty, to refuse shoddy goods. They are also aware that the national manager - unlike Pop Idol contestants, or even politicians - is not voted for, but appointed through a private process. So Sir Alex was right about what's happening, but wrong about what caused it. The fact that he shares with Dario Gradi of Crewe the remarkable distinction of having kept one management job for 20 years perhaps blinds him to the irony of being a soccer boss who accuses television of encouraging a culture in which people are coldly evaluated and then thrown out. If anything, reality TV shows might be thought to have learned from football. The Manchester United boss also seemed to have forgotten his worries about the \"mocking society\" when, on Wednesday night, he mocked the authority of the referee following his team's defeat by Roma. At least there's very little chance that fans will ever vote for managers in football. Lawyers who complain about the impact of reality TV have a bigger problem: trials, especially in America, are already talent shows in which jurors vote for the attorneys and testifiers they would most like to go through to the next round. But, whatever manager and the counsel say, this refusal to be told what to do began not on the box, but on the streets. comment@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
