Gibbs hit 29 fours and a six in his 236-ball 179 - and his captain Smith added 25 boundaries in a career-best, unbeaten 178 from 257 deliveries out of 398 for one to underline the wisdom of his decision to bat first on a pitch of easy pace and even bounce. Hussain, back in charge after his country's NatWest Challenge and Series successes under Michael Vaughan, rang the changes through seven bowlers but could not stop the South Africans posting the sixth-best opening stand in cricket history and the highest ever against England. It was not until Vaughan's occasional off-spin had Gibbs slog-sweeping to Mark Butcher in the deep that England managed their first and only wicket, in the 75th over. By then Gibbs and Smith had become the first Test batsmen ever to register two triple-century stands together, today's effort following the 368 they put on against Pakistan at Cape Town in January. Smith was joined by the regularly immovable Gary Kirsten in an unbroken stand of 60 which helped South Africa bat out nine overs of the second new ball to ensure there would be no late fightback by England."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
