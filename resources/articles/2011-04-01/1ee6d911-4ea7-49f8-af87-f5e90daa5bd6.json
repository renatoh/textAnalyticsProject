The FA Cup final does happen to be a major sporting event held in this country every year, and while commendably stopping short of Uefa's rapacity in charging up to \u00a3300 for Champions League tickets at Wembley in May, the FA can ask more or less what it wants for admission. It is not a tourist destination like Centre Court at Wimbledon or the final green at the Open, where it hardly matters who is playing as long as the occasion has been bagged. Supporters will pay through the nose to watch their team in an FA Cup final and be glad to do so. Especially if, like Bolton and Stoke in today's semi, the chance comes around only once in a lifetime. But Bolton and Stoke are already playing at Wembley. Quite a high percentage of the once-in-a-lifetime experience will have been used up by the time of the final. The new Wembley is not such a thrilling spectator experience it leaves people clamouring for more, it is only team loyalty that does that. And while semi\u2011final prices may have been pegged they would still not strike anyone as cheap, because the FA has a \u00a3767m outlay to recover and every possible opportunity must be taken to make Wembley pay its way. Even in these straitened times fans could put up with a price hike for the final, however unjustified, but to make people travel to Wembley for semi-finals, then ask them to shell out even more for the final because it is a unique sporting event is the sort of double whammy most businesses would be wary of foisting on customers. Not to worry, though, because according to Matt Phillips of the FA, playing the semis at Wembley does not take away the magic of a final at the stadium. \"Wembley is set out in a different way for each round so fans who come for the semi will have a different experience from those who come for the final,\" he explains. How much of a different experience can that be, though, to make it worth over \u00a3100? One hopes he is not simply referring to sitting in a different seat, or getting a new perspective from another part of the ground. Because the core experience is going to be pretty much the same: A muted atmosphere due to all the corporate guests. Twenty quid to park. Almost as much again for a hot dog and a match programme. Sodom and Gomorrah at the tube station. It would be churlish to pretend that the new Wembley is not a vast improvement on the old Wembley \u2013 once you are inside the ground you can almost see where all the money has been spent. Yet English football's \u00a3767m statement has not made much of a change to its immediate environs. Getting to and from the ground is just as problematic as it has always been, whatever your chosen mode of transport. The last thing this column would wish to be accused of is putting a damper on the excitement of fans experiencing the magic of Wembley for the first time this month or the next, though if spine\u2011tingling excitement, with side orders of dramatic tension and unforgettable atmosphere, is what you are looking for it seems more likely to be on the menu in Spain at the moment, where all attention is on the upcoming four games between Barcelona and Real Madrid. There is nothing in England to match such a rivalry, the recent three games between Chelsea and Manchester United did not really come close and neither would Arsenal-Spurs or United-Liverpool. Both Barcelona and Real boast the sort of homes that obviate the need for a national stadium anyway \u2013 it way well be the case that Wembley is a comedown for the victors of the final showdown at the Camp Nou on 3 May \u2013 but when a neutral venue is needed, for an event such as the Copa del Rey final, a switch to Valencia's Mestalla was all that was required. No one appears to be complaining about any loss of magic. Only in this country would you get supporters complaining about having to go to Wembley twice to help pay off the debt on the stadium, then having to fork out more than ever for a Cup final ticket, while officials reassure them with a straight face that the magic is still intact. It is going to have to be pretty strong magic to overcome growing hostility and resentment. After pitch problems, price hikes and police preventing anyone getting a drink on all the trains down, there is a limited appetite for any more of the Tommy Cooper stuff. Why not look closer to home? Look, here they all are again. Here's Jose Mourinho, there's Guus Hiddink and Frank Rijkaard, Rafa Ben\u00edtez and Pep Guardiola will doubtless be along soon and even Didier Deschamps is making an appearance. If Chelsea are in the market for a new manager then it goes without saying it must be a foreign one. It seems Roman Abramovich would no more think of installing a home-grown coach than he would have thought to save himself \u00a350m in January by telling Carlo Ancelotti to give Daniel Sturridge a first-team run instead of sending him out on loan. Maybe there are no suitably qualified English or British coaches out there, given that Abramovich is believed to desire a Champions League trophy above all else, but after eight years in this country it might be time to accept that the continental route has not really worked out either. While Chelsea almost got it completely right straight off the bat with Mourinho, none of the European specialists they have brought in since has gone as far in the Champions League as Avram Grant, who oddly enough does not figure among the favourites to replace Ancelotti. Chelsea can only afford to chase European glory from a position in which their top-four status is secure, and for much of the season that has not been the case. A major overhaul of an ageing team is now required, and while it does not necessarily take a home-based coach to supervise that, it calls for a longer-term approach than merely identifying previous European Cup winners then tiring of them when they fail to repeat the achievement."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
