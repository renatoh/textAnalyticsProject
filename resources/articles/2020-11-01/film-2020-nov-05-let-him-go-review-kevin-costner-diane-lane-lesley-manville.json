In a jolting, gonzo act of violence, the film, which initially presents itself as a polite, handsomely made, awards-aiming picture starring one Oscar winner and two nominees, lurches into a grindhouse thriller, a bombastic B-movie whose earlier pretensions of grandeur burn up into flames, quite literally, in the gory all-out finale that soon follows. It\u2019s a fun switch-up, and one that audiences are better off preparing for as they enter, for it forgives some of the film\u2019s clunkier early moments, rather like accepting this year\u2019s adaptation of The Invisible Man as schlock horror instead of the sleek psycho-thriller it pretends to be. It\u2019s not that the set-up of the film, an adaptation of Larry Watson\u2019s bestselling 60s-set novel, isn\u2019t engaging in itself, it\u2019s just so rooted in dusty Oscar-bait tropes that we don\u2019t expect it to go so drastically from mild to wild, from prestige to pulp, to distinguish itself as something other than been-here-seen-that Sunday afternoon viewing. It\u2019s the story of married couple George (Kevin Costner) and Margaret (Diane Lane) who live a contented, quiet life on their Montana ranch. But when their son gets killed in an accident and their daughter-in-law Lorna (Kayli Carter) remarries, they\u2019re forced into a difficult position. Her new husband Donnie (Will Brittain) is brisk and short-tempered, and without warning, he takes both Lorna and her son, George and Margaret\u2019s grandson, away. The pair are then propelled on the road, led by Margaret, all the way to Donnie\u2019s notorious Weboy family, led by the fearsome matriarch Blanche (Lesley Manville), who won\u2019t, you know, let him go without a fight. Underneath the slick studio surface, there\u2019s something compellingly discordant about Let Him Go, as one might expect from a violent thriller brought to the screen by the guy who made The Family Stone and Monte Carlo. For the most part, there\u2019s an earnest, old-fashioned sturdiness to writer-director Thomas Bezucha\u2019s tale, anchored by the reliable, old-shoes pairing of Lane and Costner, who last parented in 2013\u2019s Man of Steel. The simplicity of their quest (get him back) and the straightforward propulsion of the first act makes it hard not to get at least moderately involved even if the specifics of the predicament are less easily explained (the amount of times Lane has to detail that it\u2019s the boy of the remarried wife of their dead son they\u2019re looking for becomes drinking-game worthy). What\u2019s most interesting about the couple\u2019s dynamic is how Lane takes the lead, the active to Costner\u2019s passive, driven not only by a mother\u2019s love but also a righteous anger. Too often, women who lose children on screen are painted as deranged while men get to be stoic, so it\u2019s refreshing to see this tired and sexist cliche upended, and Lane, whose acting can often be a little mechanical, rises to the challenge with a commanding, often fiery, performance. But it\u2019s only when the pair meet their final destination that things get really juicy, facing off against the film\u2019s boss-level foe: an unlikely doozy of a role for Manville, the result of a Hollywood bump from her recent Oscar nomination, styled like a faded 50s bombshell with a bite that\u2019s as bad as her bark. Like all good villains, she\u2019s used minimally, and in just a few scenes, Manville yanks the film out of the hands of her higher-wattage co-stars, devouring her prickly dialogue while amplifying her room-stopping death stare from Phantom Thread tenfold \u2013 and then some. While she can\u2019t quite convince with a comically uneven accent, she\u2019s so electric to watch that it doesn\u2019t really matter, and it\u2019s her fierce, full-throated performance that thrusts the film into its ferocious last act. There\u2019s a certain giddiness to Bezucha hurtling from a buttoned up A-movie to a balls-out B-movie, as if he can finally just breathe and as Let Him Go lets go, in a furious finale, my only quibble was that I wanted a bit more of the mayhem that takes centre stage, too much too late almost. With its handsome, and expensive, period recreation, a wide rural American canvas and an audience-provoking last act, it\u2019s a shame that more of us won\u2019t get to enjoy Let Him Go on the big screen, where it truly belongs. But for those who will, they\u2019re in for a wild ride. Let Him Go is released in cinemas in the US on 6 November and in the UK on 18 December"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
