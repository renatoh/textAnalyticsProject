Nice to Meet You", "bodyText": "Dev Hynes's transition \u2013 via his Mike Mogis-produced debut \u2013 from dance punk saboteur of Test Icicles to an English Conor Oberst is continued on his second album as Lightspeed. And what the songwriter (he's recently written for Solange Knowles and X Factor's Diana Vickers) does \u2013 simple country-twinged, piano/guitar music \u2013 he does very well. Take Faculty of Fears, with its odd little hints of Queen, gaunt strings and references to Pythagoras, exemplifies everything that's likable here. There are also nudges to Hynes's pals and collaborators, too: single Marlene's bouncy high bass-note rhythms isn't too dissimilar from Arctic Monkeys' Fluorescent Adolescent. But it's Hynes's charm that shines through. How could it not, with lines like the Dead Head Blues' couplet \u2013 \"I know you're happy ... and I think that's lovely\"?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
