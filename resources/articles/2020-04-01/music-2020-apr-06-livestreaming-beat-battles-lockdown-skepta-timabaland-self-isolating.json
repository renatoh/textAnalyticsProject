Promoted like a heavyweight championship fight, these lockdown boredom-beaters have a simple premise: two rappers or producers go head-to-head on Instagram live, taking turns to play their biggest tracks. Fans in the comment section decide the winner. Skepta, with a wealth of clash experience as an MC, was able to see off J Hus\u2019s go-to producer with ease; rappers including Brit-winner Dave, Chip, and Novelist joined fans in debating the clash in the comments, firing up flame emojis with each new song. Battles like these are keeping rap and grime fans across the world entertained during the coronavirus pandemic, and show the genres\u2019 agility in the face of adversity. US hip-hop superproducers Swizz Beatz and Timbaland kicked off the movement in March, and paved the way for a series of face-offs under their Verzuz banner. Boi-1da overpowered Hit-Boy with Drake hits, while 2000s mainstays Mannie Fresh and Scott Storch went back and forth until Storch pulled for his biggest hit, the Dr Dre classic Still DRE, and took the win. On Saturday night, Lil Jon sipped from a bejewelled chalice and blasted Turn Down for What while his opponent, Auto-Tune fanatic T-Pain, showed off his gold discs to the sound of collaborations with Kanye West and Flo Rida. Usher and Chance the Rapper were among the 280,000 people watching live. Since the lockdown came into force, everyone from Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin to metalcore band Code Orange has been livestreaming performances to keep fans\u2019 morale up. Beat battles, however, with their unpredictable nature and interactive audiences, feel closer to the spontaneous nature of a great gig. DDot Omen, rap producer and manager, holds the unenviable task of scoring the Verzuz battles. Brought on board by friend Swizz Beatz, he says the key to winning a battle is \u201chaving the better songs\u201d \u2013 but you need more besides. \u201cIt\u2019s about the heat of the moment. Some people can reference sales figures but how has that song aged? Real-time reaction matters and you\u2019re having to counter someone else\u2019s music, too.\u201d Speaking from New Orleans, Mannie Fresh is still smarting from his recent loss \u2013 \u201cThis is not a jab at Scott but he played a lot of R&amp;B songs. I was told it was a hip-hop battle\u201d \u2013 but concedes that there are no rules in a face-off. \u201cNothing\u2019s off-limits,\u201d the producer best known for his work with Lil Wayne says. \u201cIt\u2019s a battle! You just have to be entertaining.\u201d He\u2019s also keen to point out the history behind the trend. \u201cHip-hop is based on this. If you go way back, to Kool Moe D and Busy Bee, people have always gone up against an opponent in this way. Things get said but we know it\u2019s all done in love and friendly competition.\u201d Unlike the glossy stateside events, Skepta\u2019s battles with Jae5 and another recent one with grime pioneer Jammer have felt more organic and in keeping with the spontaneous nature of the genre\u2019s founding pirate-radio clashes. Jae5, speaking from his home studio the morning after his Skepta clash, admits he didn\u2019t know what he was getting himself into. \u201cIt was my first ever clash and I learned a lot. He dominated me. Skepta has had hits before I even knew how to load up FruityLoops,\u201d he laughs. Regrets over his song choices aside, he feels that this moment will last beyond the lockdown period. \u201cObviously this is the only way we can do this right now but I think it might stay. I could see Wiley and Skepta clashing like the old days and doing it on Instagram. You don\u2019t have to leave your house to touch big numbers.\u201d He\u2019s right: the beat battle train shows no sign of slowing down. Next up in the Verzuz series will be a contest between songwriters Babyface and Teddy Riley \u2013 catnip for 90s R&amp;B fans. How this will all play out long-term is less clear. The beat battles capitalise on the fact that everyone \u2013 musicians and fans alike \u2013 is stuck indoors and bored stupid. Will the same be true when touring, club appearances and being able to see friends resume? DDot Omen is bullish, revealing talks are already ongoing with brands about monetising the Verzuz battles. Moderation, however, is key. \u201cYou don\u2019t want to oversaturate it and make it corny,\u201d he says. \u201cOtherwise, next thing you know, other people who are less appreciative of history will jump on it and it\u2019ll get diluted.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
