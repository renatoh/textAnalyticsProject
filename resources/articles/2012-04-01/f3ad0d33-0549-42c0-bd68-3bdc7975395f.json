The right exclusive photograph, sold worldwide, can still be worth over \u00a3100,000 \u2013 but they are hard to come by. To make matters more difficult, the amount that the news media are prepared to pay for pictures is falling, and tabloid picture desks worry increasingly about harassment and intrusion after a succession of adverse judgments. Amid such pressure it is not surprising that corners can be cut. Jeff Moore, the chairman of the British Press Photographers' Association, recalls working on a photoshoot with the singer Rihanna, at the Corinthia hotel near Trafalgar Square, in London, earlier this year, in which there were \"six photographers inside, and about 25 guys waiting outside trying to get a picture of her leaving\". The waiting photographers are hoping to snatch a shot that will be used by any one of the growing number of celebrity websites \u2013 but Moore says that it is a business that \"the older guys are being pushed out of\" because \"there is no money in it\". A simple picture of a star coming out of a hotel might only be worth \u00a330 or \u00a340 on a website. In newspapers, or other print media, it depends on the size of the image, but a modestly sized news photograph could be worth perhaps \u00a3130 a time \u2013 not much given that there will be agency fees to pay for a mostly freelance trade. Odds may improve slightly if you wait outside a London club for a celebrity to emerge, preferably falling over (the Box club being the new favourite) but the strategy is so obvious that it is hardly worth considering as a fresh way to make a living. There are plenty of ways of getting an edge, the most obvious being official accreditation, although veteran snappers complain that having a pass to take photographs at Downing Street has its disadvantages, because it is cold, even in the middle of summer. Meanwhile, the owner of Heathrow, BAA, licences a small number of photographers who are allowed to be based airside, so they can get the first shots of whoever is coming from planes that day. At the same time, the airport owner offers celebrities and well-heeled members of the public the chance to avoid all potential photographers, if they are prepared to pay for the privilege: \u00a31,500 plus VAT. Just waiting around is hardly likely to be productive in a world where exclusivity is the most important commodity. Tip-offs from a network of sources are how any branch of journalism works; celebrity publicists frequently report that hotel or restaurant staff will let photographers know who may be arriving on any particular night. It is the sort of publicity that venues will often want too. Whatever the competition, the celebrity news business is dominated by a handful of agencies, including Big Pictures, whose founder, Darryn Lyons became well known for his dyed hair and toned abs after appearing on Celebrity Big Brother. On the other hand, there is no shortage of the famous or mildly famous who will work with a photographer in the hope of getting a little extra publicity \u2013 which is easier work all round. The celebrity would look for a cut of any image that is sold \u2013 demanding anywhere up to 40%, depending on the name involved. Some agencies will even pay for D-listers to travel, perhaps as part of a tie-up with a hotel \u2013 as evidenced by the number of pictures of The Only Way Is Essex stars in bikinis in Dubai in articles where the venue is inevitably named. Just knowing somebody is in the country can be critical, and airports are often good places to start. Publicists report that the most intense car chases happen in Los Angeles, where it is necessary for the biggest stars to hire ex-military drivers and employ a decoy car to avoid the chasing pack. As former News of the World reporter Paul McMullan told the Leveson inquiry, journalism was the only job in which you could have celebrity car chases \u2013 \"such good fun\" \u2013 but making a sustainable long-term living is much harder."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
