Despite the obvious beauty of the city - it boasts some of the most stunning architecture in Europe - there is a serious danger that some tourists will not bother returning there for a second time. The problem is the sheer number of bums, thieves and conmen operating in the main tourist areas such as Las Ramblas and Catalunya Place in the city centre. It is becoming increasingly difficult to walk around without being molested by well-organised gangs that target visitors, particularly women. The charming squares just off Las Ramblas are now home to urinating drunks who beg small change from tourists trying to eat dinner in front of them. And, despite the increasing menace, there is rarely a policeman in sight."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
