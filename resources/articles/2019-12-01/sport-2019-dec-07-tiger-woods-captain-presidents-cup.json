When considering a Woods captaincy for the Presidents Cup, which begins on Thursday at Royal Melbourne, the subliminal message was obvious: by late 2019, he would be looking at a life beyond individual competition. If that assumption was once wholly logical, Woods has defied even his own pessimistic outlook and not only on the basis he will break with convention as a playing captain of the US team against the Internationals. Woods as a ceremonial golfer, or one reduced to backroom roles, will have to wait. This year, he won his 15th major and later matched Sam Snead\u2019s record of 82 PGA Tour victories. \u201cI was just hoping that things would turn out,\u201d says Woods of his initial Presidents Cup thoughts. \u201cIf my back would get good, I could somehow find a swing that would work, then just piece it together and see where the chips fall. I was fortunate enough to have made the Ryder Cup team last year and now the Presidents Cup team.\u201d That Woods remains front of house in a competitive sense need not diminish analysis of him in fresh territory, as a leader of men. At his peak, and for much of his career, Woods was so obsessed with the pursuit of individual glory that team events proved problematic. The notion that Woods could morph into captaincy mode, let alone one so obviously in tune with youthful players, was troublesome. How things have changed. \u201cI already know he\u2019s going to be a great captain just by how seriously he\u2019s taken it so far and how much he wants this for us,\u201d says Justin Thomas. \u201cThe conversations and the communication started a while ago in terms of what we\u2019re going to do, things that I can do to help, things that he feels he can do. It\u2019s going to be great.\u201d Thomas is a key player in this scene, owing to a friendship with Woods, strengthened when the 43-year-old was attempting his latest and successful comeback from a serious back injury. \u201cJT opened doors in terms of the younger guys,\u201d says Xander Schauffele, another member of Woods\u2019s Presidents Cup team. \u201cWe are basically a product of Tiger\u2019s greatness: our competitive edge, willingness to compete or grind and basically everything he did when he was younger. This is cool for him, to see what he has done for the game.\u201d Beyond that, Woods is clearly grateful for the assistance Thomas in particular provided when he was in a stricken state. \u201cI spent a lot of time at home with him having dinners, him coming over to the house and chipping around and talking about a bunch of different things,\u201d Woods says. \u201cThen I started playing again and I played a lot at home with JT. It\u2019s been a lot of fun to get to know these guys.\u201d Woods\u2019s mere presence, let alone as a player, benefits the Presidents Cup. This is a competition that struggles for relevance, partly because of the wild animal that is the modern-day Ryder Cup and partly because there is a perceived mismatch. The US has been defeated once in 12 stagings of the Presidents Cup. Should the favourites be toppled by an International team on Woods\u2019s watch, it would rank as a serious embarrassment. \u201cHe has loads of experience, not on the captaincy side but as a player,\u201d says Schauffele. \u201cThe best hope anyone can give us rookies as individuals is from a playing standpoint and he provides that. He has seen it all.\u201d How Woods makes decisions, interacts with players and reacts to a moving picture in Australia will prove fascinating. He has supplied evidence at the Hero World Challenge in the Bahamas, won by Henrik Stenson on Saturday, that his game and swing remain in strong shape ahead of a trip to Victoria. Woods\u2019s driving, in particular, has been impressive at Albany. \u201cPutting things in boxes has always been something I\u2019ve been good at,\u201d Woods says. \u201cBecause when I\u2019m out there playing, I\u2019ve got to get into my little world and take care of that. When I\u2019m off the course, I\u2019ve got a lot of other responsibilities. \u201cThe only difference is next week it will be I\u2019m responsible for 11 other guys. I won\u2019t be able to see them play practice rounds because I\u2019ll be playing a practice round. So that will be a little bit different and I\u2019m going to have to rely on what my guys say and what my vice-captains say and get a feel for what\u2019s going on.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
