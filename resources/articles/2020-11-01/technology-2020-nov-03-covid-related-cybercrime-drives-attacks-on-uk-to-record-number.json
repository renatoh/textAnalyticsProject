The intelligence unit said that while Russia and other states \u2013 such as China \u2013 had targeted British vaccine research, it was criminal gangs who frequently targeted other parts of the NHS, often to attempt online fraud. A frequent method of attack used by both groups was spear phishing, creating plausible emails targeted at key individuals designed to encourage them to click on a link to malware or to obtain more information by deception. \u201cNation state actors are using Covid as a theme, sending what appear to be news articles from popular media outlets in an attempt to encourage targets to click on what are dangerous links,\u201d warned Paul Chichester, director of operations. The NCSC official said that British researchers were targeted \u201cby a range of nation states\u201d although he would only cite Russia by name. The country was previously accused in the summer of trying to steal vaccine secrets. Hackers connected to Beijing are widely believed to be involved in trying to take the work of western scientists, although Chichester said \u201cthe ultimate decision to call a country out rests with the Foreign Office\u201d and that \u201cwe have made a conscious decision to call out the Russian attacks\u201d. Criminal groups meanwhile posed as PPE suppliers, offering to supply equipment to NHS organisations in the hope of persuading a busy purchaser to hand over money to a company that did not exist, NCSC officials added. A newly created service where anybody could report a suspicious email to NCSC at report@phishing.gov.uk was inundated with 2.3m emails, which led, the agency said, to 22,000 internet sites being taken offline. The pandemic threat also meant that the NCSC found itself engaged with unexpected businesses, including the supermarkets, whose supply chain systems were identified as part of the UK\u2019s critical national infrastructure when the crisis first emerged in the spring. Taken together the extra threat posed by state and criminal hackers meant that NCSC dealt with 10% more incidents in the year to 31 August, a total of 723, the highest level since the organisation was first formed in 2016. There were around 1,200 victims, up by a third, reflecting the fact that the most serious attacks targeted multiple actors. \u201cThe second half of the year was massively dominated by Covid,\u201d said Lindy Cameron, NCSC\u2019s chief executive. Both public and private sector organisations can call in NCSC to deal with a serious cyber-attack, and in a crisis a squad of cyber-experts can be deployed alongside the company or unit\u2019s IT department to tackle the threat. Ransomware incidents \u2013 where a hacker disables an IT system or steals sensitive data and demands a payment for restoring or returning it - rose threefold in the past year, and the tactics of criminals have also changed. \u201cRather than simply preventing access to data, criminals are stealing it and threatening to leak the most sensitive parts publicly,\u201d NCSC\u2019s annual report said, echoing \u201chack and leak\u201d attacks used by Russian actors to influence the 2016 US election with the targeting of Democratic party emails. Targets during the past year included an unnamed \u201cEnglish football league club\u201d which suffered a \u201ccrippling attack\u201d on its corporate and security systems, which prevented its CCTV and turnstiles from working and almost led to a fixture being called off at short notice."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
