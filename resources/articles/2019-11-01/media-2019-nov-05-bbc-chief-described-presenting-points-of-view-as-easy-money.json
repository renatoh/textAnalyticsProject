Jon Swain, then head of unscripted productions for BBC Studios, suggested stand-in presenters for Points of View were happy to be paid \u00a31,000, describing it as \u201ceasy money as it\u2019s little work\u201d. The BBC presenter Samira Ahmed launched a landmark equal pay case last month, claiming she was paid 85% less than her male equivalent. Ahmed states she was paid \u00a3440 an episode for presenting Newswatch since 2012, at a time when Vine, her male equivalent at the BBC, was initially paid \u00a33,000 an episode for presenting Points of View. The negotiation to reduce Vine\u2019s pay per episode was discussed in a January 2018 email between Swain and Lisa Opie, managing director, factual at BBC Studios, which was submitted as part of a bundle of documents at the employment tribunal in central London. Roger Leatham, director of business affairs, referred to the email in a witness statement. In the email Swain wrote: \u201cJeremy has been pretty understanding and indicated to David that he wants \u00a31,500 (think that\u2019s half his current rate) but hinted that he would probably settle at \u00a31,300. I believe stand-in presenters have been paid \u00a31k and been very happy (easy money as it\u2019s so little work). Let me know if that\u2019s enough ammo/information to get him to \u00a31,300.\u201d In 2018, the BBC agreed to commission two more series of Points of View, 20 programmes in total, at a lower tariff. The BBC spoke to Vine offering him \u00a31,300 per episode plus employer\u2019s national insurance contribution, which would bring it up to a cost to the BBC of approximately \u00a31,500. The public broadcaster has said it was justified in paying Ahmed less than Vine due to differences between news and entertainment shows. The BBC has argued that Newswatch is a news show which requires different presenter appeal to Points of View, which is an entertainment programme. Simon Miller, the series producer for Points of View, argued against the suggestion that the show required minimal effort, and told the tribunal, \u201cThat is not a fair description, and does not reflect Jeremy\u2019s role in the programme.\u201d He added that as a presenter Vine had a \u201cglint in his eye\u201d and in his witness statement said the show had always been a bit \u201ccheeky\u201d and was able to deal with issues in a lighthearted way. When Claire Darwin, representing Ahmed, asked whether Vine was \u201ca bit of a lad\u201d, Miller responded that being cheeky was a personality trait that was not dependent on one sex or another. Anne Robinson, who presented Points of View from 1987 to 1997, \u201cis famous for doing the wink,\u201d Miller added. James Mallet, the series producer at Newswatch, said audiences did not want the personality of a presenter to be introduced in news programmes. \u201cI would not expect that to happen because the feeling amongst the audience is that they want the news and news programmes to be delivered straight and neutral,\u201d he told the tribunal. Earlier on Tuesday, the BBC presenter Emily Maitlis voiced her support for Ahmed. She said: \u201cAs somebody who has been in a similar position, my heart goes out to her. I think it\u2019s a really important thing that she\u2019s doing, fighting for other people who\u2019ve got unjust and unequal imbalances.\u201d She added: \u201cPresumably it is a nationwide or an international problem that we\u2019re all trying to understand and get to grips with, and whether we need more transparency or not is clearly the big issue.\u201d Ahmed is suing the public broadcaster for \u00a3693,245 in lost earnings over claims of unequal pay. She has told the tribunal that Vine was \u201cgifted\u201d his primetime Radio 2 show by BBC management and handed opportunities that were not available to ambitious female presenters. The tribunal continues."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
