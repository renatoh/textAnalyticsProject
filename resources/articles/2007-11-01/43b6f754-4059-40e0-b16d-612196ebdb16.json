The US beat hosts China to the gold; the Open team confronted Norway in the Bermuda Bowl. The Norwegians, who had come close to winning the Bowl on more than one occasion in the past, were determined that this would be their year. They beat a strong Dutch team easily in the semi-final, and continued their run of form against us. Today's deal shows you what we were up against, as Geir Helgemo produces a wonderful piece of opportunism. Game all, dealer West. North-South have 21 points, East-West 19, and no one has much in the way of distribution, so the spectators were not expecting a big swing. In the Closed Room West opened 1\u2666, East responded 1\u2665, West rebid 1NT and East removed to 2\u2665. The cards did not lie kindly for declarer and the final contract was three down, 300 to the US. In the Open Room this was the bidding: West North East South Zia Helness R'berg Helgemo 1\u2666 Pass 1\u2665 Pass 1NT Pass Pass Double! Pass Pass Pass That was a penalty double by Helgemo, which normally indicates a strong hand with East's heart suit under control, so Rosenberg gave no thought to retreating to two hearts (not that it would have helped much). North led a club to the jack and queen, and South returned a low club. I led a diamond to the king and Helness's ace. He played a club to Helgemo's queen, and South switched unerringly to a spade. We had three aces, and three tricks was all I made - 1100 and 13 IMPs to Norway from nowhere."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
