Playing in their first official fixture since being created when Lincoln Ladies controversially relocated at the end of last season, County took a surprise lead through Jess Clarke but had to settle for a draw after Scott's goal six minutes into the second half. A crowd of 1500 were at Meadow Lane to see County make their debut, with former Lincoln captain Casey Stoner lining up for serial trophy winners Arsenal. But she was given a torrid time by Clarke, who wasted an early opportunity to give her side the lead when her shot went just past the post. The England international made no mistake with her second chance before the break, dispatching a cool finish under pressure from Stoner to hand County the advantage at the break. Arsenal came out in determined mood for the second half and it didn't take long for Scott to draw them level. Rachel Yankey raced down the left-hand side and delivered an inch perfect cross for Shinobu Ono. Rachel Corsie did well to deny her, but could do nothing about Scott's follow-up effort. Some heroic defending prevented Arsenal from snatching all three points but County will be more than satisfied with their debut performance."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
