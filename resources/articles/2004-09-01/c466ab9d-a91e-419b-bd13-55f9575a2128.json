The last thing these scientists anticipated was that their research would be met with deep resentment by large sections of the deaf community. That's because they have not taken into account what deaf people want. Many \"believe they are not sick and do not need curing\", said Hagan. To some, \"it's a personal right to remain deaf,\" and the idea of removing that right is \"akin to eugenics\" or \"genocide\". Many of those who are profoundly deaf immerse themselves in the deaf community from an early age, and define themselves as \"a minority with their own rich culture and language\", which they have no wish to leave and instead want to preserve. This feeling of identity is strong enough for some deaf people to ostracise those who have had treatment to improve their hearing. But the problem poses a dilemma: is it \"ethically defensible to restore or refuse hearing to a deaf child too young to decide for themselves\"? Hearing is vital for language acquisition, so if a decision is not taken early enough, a child's ability to speak could be impaired, noted Hagan. Forget vegetables and vitamins: the real secret of long life lies in insects and abstinence, according to a special edition of Scientific American. Karen Hopkin looked at the physiology of animals that live far beyond their life span hoping to glean something to make us live longer. The most striking result discussed by Hopkin came from experiments in which long-living flies were bred by delaying when the insects reproduced. \"Like 'good' teenagers, they don't waste their energy on sex,\" said Cynthia Kenyon of the University of California in San Francisco. By the time the flies are elderly, \"they're flying around, fornicating and having a good time while the regular flies are dying,\" she continued. But don't be fooled, warned Hopkin: \"Delaying parenthood would not affect your own life span - although it might help your descendants live it up 100 generations down the line.\" Assuming we do all live to reach triple figures, there's a chance that we might have to contend with robot enemies, claimed Focus (September). Sunny Bains asked whether advances in robotics could endow machines with the \"means, motive and opportunity\" for world domination. Most experts believe that \"machine intelligence will eventually be cracked\", and with machines already being used for nefarious purposes, in the form of stealth fighters and smart bombs, a world of Terminators is not entirely inconceivable. But they will be let down by their lack of teamwork, Bains argued. Robots will be purpose-built and different models will have little in common. As such, it would be difficult for them to \"identify with one another and cooperate\" in any grand conspiracy. If you are finding a problem difficult to solve, your best bet could be to call it a day and go to bed, according to Nature (August 26). Our ability to perform complex tasks \"can be better the morning after a practice session the night before,\" claimed Laura Nelson. This is due to \"procedural learning\" that takes place during periods of deep sleep that surround each bout of REM. \"During the training, the brain tags the task as something to be improved upon later during sleep,\" she explained. It learns in pieces and sleep puts it all together. Scientists are unsure of what actually occurs during these periods of deep sleep, which have been termed \"slow wave\" after the \"synchronised waves of electrical activity that can be seen on electroencephalograph traces undulating across the brain at fewer than four cycles a second\"."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
