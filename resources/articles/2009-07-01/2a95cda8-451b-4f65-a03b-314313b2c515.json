What a cheery chap Cowdery is. In truth, Friends chairman Sir Adrian Montague was in destructive mode: he nailed down everything that is wrong with Resolution's takeover approach. First, there is virtually no premium and almost no cash. Resolution, at this stage of its life, brings little to the party other than an ambition to mop up several mid-sized life assurance companies. The other deals may happen one day \u2013 who knows? But Cowdery cannot possibly expect Friends Provident to roll over and applaud the advantage of being part of a financial conglomerate that doesn't yet exist. Then there is Resolution's corporate structure. The vehicle is incorporated in Guernsey for tax purposes and proposes to hand 10% of any value created by the intended deal-frenzy to Cowdery and his team. As Montague said, the governance is a long way from best practice and the management's rewards would amount to substantial dilution for shareholders. Cowdery's hope is that Friends' institutional shareholders come out to bat for him. He was careful when raising \u00a3600m for Resolution to ensure that he collected all the big City names on his own register. But a campaign to cajole Friends' board into selling out cheaply won't get far if its only supporters have one foot in Resolution's camp. The lobbying would be seen as a naked attempt to stitch up Friends' small shareholders. The only sure way to get Resolution rolling is to offer a proper takeover premium in cash. Whether that can be done without inflicting substantial damage on Resolution's own share price is another matter. It is hard to see how the sums could be made to work. Cowdery's best bet is probably to give up on Friends and concentrate on talking to large banks that wish to offload unloved life assurance subsidiaries. They are more likely to be persuaded to accept payment in the strange currency called Resolution shares. But, for companies in Friends' position \u2013 with a newish, and still popular, chief executive \u2013 there is no reason to play along with Cowdery's vision for consolidation. The life assurance sector may well be in need of deals, but the normal rules of the takeover game have not been suspended to aid his attempt to make a second fortune. On the buffers We'll wait for prices to improve, then we'll flog a few shares and see what happens. That, roughly speaking, is the gist of a large part of yesterday's annual report from UK Financial Investments, the body overseeing the taxpayers' interests in Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland. Quite why UKFI needed to devote acres of space to this simple point is anybody's guess. It's not news to learn that disposing of bank shares worth \u00a370bn-plus (if we get back to the break-even point) is not something that can done overnight and might require several approaches over several years. Nor is it a revelation that institutional investors are underweight bank stocks: that's because governments have nationalised and part-nationalised so many banks. The overall impression left by UKFI's report is that attempting to guess when, and if, the taxpayer will make a profit on the great bank rescue is pointless at this time. Share prices aren't even the first place to look \u2013 the asset protection scheme, or APS, is. The APS has allowed Lloyds and RBS to pay to insure themselves against losses on \u00a3585bn of soggy loans. The banks will take substantial \"first losses\" themselves but once those buffers are exhausted 90% of the bill falls directly on the taxpayer. If the buffers turn out to be big enough to absorb the full horrors within Lloyds and RBS, then the taxpayer's position improves vastly \u2013 we'll be collecting a big insurance premium on a policy that isn't called. Will it happen? We're probably two years from knowing. Nothing Ventured Is it game over at Venture Production, the North Sea gas producer? It certainly looks that way. Centrica has 29.9% of the shares in its back pocket and has declared its \u00a31.3bn bid \"final\", meaning the price of 845p a share cannot be improved unless an interloper appears. Centrica, undeniably, is in a powerful position. But there may be life in this battle yet. Venture's management has a couple of loyal shareholders, including founder Larry Kinch. It's not beyond imagination to think they could find a white knight. Gas prices are low now but not everybody thinks they'll stay that way. nils.pratley@theguardian.com"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
