In articles written when he was in his mid-30s, the prime minister also wrote that the police had been cowed by the Macpherson report \u2013 which found that the Metropolitan police were institutionally racist \u2013 and claimed that officers were too busy on \u201cracial awareness programmes\u201d to respond to crime reports. Johnson has been repeatedly criticised for statements he made during his career as a columnist, writer and editor, including referring to black people as \u201cpiccaninnies\u201d with \u201cwatermelon smiles\u201d and arguing that Islam has caused the Muslim world to be \u201cliterally centuries behind\u201d the west. Last week he was condemned by the shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner \u2013 who had her first baby at 16 \u2013 for once writing that single mothers were to blame for \u201cproducing a generation of ill-raised, ignorant, aggressive and illegitimate children\u201d. \u201cI might be the shadow education secretary, but inside I\u2019m that 16-year-old that didn\u2019t think I was worth anything,\u201d Rayner said. \u201cAnd people like him make women who are already vulnerable feel that they\u2019re the problem. They\u2019re not the problem.\u201d In the most recently discovered comments, written in the Spectator magazine in 1999, Johnson said: \u201cAcross the country, there are many Tories who wish their party leadership would speak up more strongly against, say, gays in the military, or the cowing of the police by the Macpherson report, or the arrest of General Pinochet, or the impending abolition of the oath and the cap badge of the RUC [Royal Ulster Constabulary], or the abolition of the hereditary peers and foxhunting. They are, of course, right.\u201d The Macpherson report, produced following the murder of the black teenager Stephen Lawrence in 1993, sparked a debate about racism in policing. In a column in the Daily Telegraph in 2000, Johnson wrote that the reason why police were unable to investigate crime was because they were \u201cstuck on racial awareness programmes; or deployed in desperate attempts to catch paedophiles in ancient public schools; or lurking in lay-bys in the hope of penalising a motorist; or perhaps preparing for the great moment when they will be able to arrest anyone who allows his dogs to chase rabbits, let alone those who go foxhunting.\u201d Responding to the comments, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor John McDonnell said it was clear the prime minister was \u201ca deeply unpleasant individual\u201d and \u201ca danger to our country\u201d. \u201cThe more we learn, the worse it gets,\u201d he said. \u201cHe is a danger to women, to single mothers, the working class, minorities, LGBT+ people, and to anyone who doesn\u2019t look like him. He thinks he is born to rule and stands against everything that holds our communities together.\u201d During a special edition of the BBC\u2019s Question Time in November, audience members pressed Johnson on whether his writings had fuelled racism. The prime minister said he had \u201cgenuinely never intended to cause hurt or pain to anybody\u201d, but defended his right to \u201cspeak out\u201d. \u201cIf you go through all my articles with a fine-tooth comb and take out individual phrases, there is no doubt that you can find things that can be made to seem offensive, and of course I understand that,\u201d he said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
