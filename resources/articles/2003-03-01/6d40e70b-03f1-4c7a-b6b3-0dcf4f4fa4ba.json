The five-year-old travelled for four-and-a-half furlongs at a good pace with Richard Hills, who will ride him in the big race, in the saddle. Twelve months ago Nayef won the Dubai Sheema Classic on turf at Nad Al Sheba, and though he has never raced on anything but grass, the signs are that the desert sand will suit him every bit as well. \"He needed to do a little bit because he gets pretty fresh sometimes, but he really is in great form,\" Marcus Tregoning, Nayef's trainer, said. \"He was pretty impressive when he won at the meeting last year and I think he is in the same sort of form now. If anything, he is a little bit more mature and a bit stronger. \"We just don't know about the dirt, and I don't know much about training horses on dirt, but he is quite a strong horse so there is enough evidence to suggest that he will handle it.\" Hills, too, seemed confident after yesterday's final exercise. \"We had Ekraar and Albareq on either side, but it is not a case of getting him used to the kickback, he has been drilled in that department for the last two or three weeks and taken it well,\" the jockey said. \"He gives me the same feeling he did before he won the Sheema Classic here last year and if we get lucky again, I'll be running around the plane on the way back to Heathrow on Saturday night.\" Nayef is the 11-8 market leader with Coral for the richest race in the world, ahead of Moon Ballad and Grandera, Godolphin's two runners, on 3-1 and 9-2 respectively. Aquarelliste, the French challenger who will also be making her debut on dirt, is a 6-1 chance, while Harlan's Holiday, the better of two American runners, is 7-1. Todd Pletcher, the trainer of Harlan's Holiday, arrived in Dubai in the early hours of Thursday morning and was at the track to watch the four-year-old work under lights a few hours later. \"He has started the year very well,\" Pletcher said. \"We had this race in the back of our minds for some time and then when he won the Donn Handicap, we knew we had to go for it. \"He is a seasoned horse that has travelled all over the States, and although there are some serious horses up against him, what he has in his favour is that he is a true dirt horse. You've got to have a lot of tactical pace in the race and he has plenty, and as he handles a mile and eighth [nine furlongs] so well, I think he will stay the [10 furlong] trip on this track.\" Horses and humans alike were dripping with sweat in the sticky heat, though there was little sign of the sun below a cover of cloud, and heavy thunderstorms were forecast. No matter how much rain arrives, though, there is little chance that the race will be abandoned, as happened six years ago when a year's-worth of rain arrived in three hours. \"The track then had lots of cement dust mixed in with the dirt,\" Michael Osborne, a member of the World Cup Committee, said. \"We won't have that problem again.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
