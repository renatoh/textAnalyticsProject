Private housebuilding \u201cslowed considerably\u201d during the first three months of the year, despite the government\u2019s promise to support new infrastructure and building programmes, and its pledge to deliver 200,000 new homes by 2020, the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics) said. A Rics survey of the construction sector found that workloads among housebuilders increased at the weakest rate since the second quarter of 2013. It revealed a slowdown across all parts of the construction industry and showed that confidence about the outlook for the sector over the next 12 months had fallen. Simon Rubinsohn, the chief economist at Rics, said: \u201cOur survey tells us that planning delays are one of the biggest barriers to growth in the construction sector. We have recommended that councils work together to create a team of emergency planners who can parachute into boroughs that are experiencing significant delays, therefore reducing a major growth barrier. \u201cThat said, we cannot discount the climate of uncertainty caused by the forthcoming EU referendum. We know that a range of sectors have been affected by these issues as investors look to delay any decisions until a final outcome has been determined, and construction is no exception.\u201d Rubinsohn suggested that a slowing construction industry seemed at odds with George Osborne\u2019s \u201cwe are the builders\u201d pledge at the 2015 Conservative party conference. \u201cOne might well ask why growth in private housing workloads is softening at a time when policy is firmly focused on the creation of new starter homes. We have long held the view that starter homes cannot be the only solution,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an issue around the availability of land on which new houses can be built and we would like to see more being done to free up private brownfield sites.\u201d A breakdown of the Rics survey showed that only 36% more of those working in the private housebuilding sector saw workloads rise than fall over the first quarter of 2016. It was the weakest figure since the second quarter of 2013 and compared with 50% in the first quarter of 2015. On a more positive note for the construction industry, respondents expected head counts to rise by an average of 2% over the next 12 months, following employment growth of 4% in 2015. The UK construction sector was badly affected by the financial crisis and output is still not back to its pre-recession level. Construction output grew by 0.3% in the last quarter of 2015 and economists are expecting a small positive contribution to UK GDP in the first quarter of this year. The Office for National Statistics will publish an estimate of first quarter growth on 27 April. Economists at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research expect the data to show that overall growth halved from 0.6% to 0.3% between the last quarter of 2015 and the first three months of 2016. This would be the weakest UK growth rate since the fourth quarter of 2012."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
