The Football Association determined last month that no charges would be brought against Clattenburg after investigating a claim by Mikel's team-mate, Ramires, that he had heard the official describe the midfielder as \"a monkey\" during the 3-2 defeat by Manchester United on 28 October. While Ramires stands by his testimony, Chelsea subsequently expressed regret over their handling of aspects of the formal complaint lodged to the FA and the Premier League with club, player and official all seeking to draw a line under the controversy. \"I think now it is done I am glad it is over,\" said Mikel. \"I am sure he is glad it is over as well, and the FA is glad it is all put to bed and we can move on from here. [The issue of racism] is just one of those things in football. It has been there for years and, you know, hopefully everyone will work together \u2013 the players and the FA \u2013 to make sure we try to stop things like that.\" The Chelsea chairman, Bruce Buck, had met Clattenburg at the National Football Centre in Burton upon Trent to discuss the issue with the 16 elite referees, the Professional Game Match Officials Limited general manager Mike Riley, and the Premier League's chief executive, Richard Scudamore. He had stressed that the club would have no issue whatsoever if the official took charge of a match involving the London club in future, with Mikel now expressing similar sentiment. \"I think sure, why not,\" said the Nigerian. \"Everything is put to bed, we move on. If he refereed a game there would certainly be no problem [with me].\" The 25-year-old is currently one game into a three-match domestic ban after confronting the referee in the officials' room after the loss to United, the FA having taken into account the fact he was under the impression at the time that Clattenburg had racially abused him. He will miss next week's fixtures against Leeds in the League Cup and Aston Villa in the Premier League. No further police action is to be taken against a supporter who was arrested on suspicion of racist behaviour following Chelsea's League Cup victory over Manchester United only three days after the league fixture between the clubs. Pictures taken during the fourth-round tie appeared to show a fan making an alleged \"monkey\" gesture at the visitors' striker, Danny Welbeck. The 28-year-old was arrested, other fans interviewed and CCTV footage scrutinised but on the basis of the evidence collected, no prosecution is to be pursued. \"A decision was taken with the Crown Prosecution Service to proceed with no further action,\" said a police spokesman. \"The Metropolitan Police service takes any allegation of racist chanting and/or behaviour very seriously and if any matters are brought to our attention they will of course be thoroughly investigated.\" The supporter, who was neither a season ticket holder nor a member at Chelsea and had been sitting in a seat allocated to another fan, has been banned from Stamford Bridge, with that situation not expected to change."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
