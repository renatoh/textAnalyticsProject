David Beckham, Ashley Cole and Emile Heskey, in particular, were among the England stars who might have found themselves in the dock, only for Uefa to announce last night that the video evidence was inconclusive. Instead Uefa has charged both the English and Turkish football authorities with the improper conduct of their players after concluding, to widespread surprise, there was \"no evidence\" to indict Heskey or any of his team-mates or, for that matter, Alpay Ozalan and Hasan Sas, the most provocative Turkey players. It is the first time the Football Association has faced such a charge but there was an unmistakeable feeling that England's players have got off lightly. A fine is expected when Uefa's disciplinary committee meets in Nyon, Switzerland, on Thursday, but it is not likely to be big enough to have any serious impact on an organisation that has enough financial worries already. Heskey, perhaps more than anybody, has cause to be grateful to Uefa's apparent leniency. Television pictures show the Liverpool forward reacting with uncharacteristic temper after Sas apparently spat at Cole. Heskey can be seen lunging at the Turkish substitute through a m\u00eal\u00e9e of players, security guards and other officials in the bowels of Fenerbahce's stadium. But the FA does not intend to take any action itself, whatever the punishment on Thursday. Uefa's disciplinary officials say they cannot be certain that Heskey threw a punch but, to put it into context, there seemed to be more aggression by him than by many of the Manchester United and Arsenal players charged with a multitude of offences, under the FA's umbrella, after the Old Trafford match last month. Turkish TV also showed John Terry, Sol Campbell and David James were involved in the m\u00eal\u00e9e and, off camera, Beckham and Wayne Rooney were reputedly involved in an altercation with opponents, notably Alpay, in the tunnel. Alpay can consider himself extremely fortunate not to face any offence, having apparently instigated the trouble by jabbing his finger into Beckham's cheek as they left the pitch at half-time. Beckham chased him into the tunnel and that is where the fighting began. Alternatively there is a case that the Turkish centre-half, whose contract at Aston Villa was terminated last week, has been punished enough already, having effectively been driven out of England in the fall-out of the match. Uefa explained last night that, to bring charges against individuals, it was imperative to have a watertight case and the TV pictures and witness statements did not provide one. The referee Pierluigi Collina, who could have shown red cards to several players regardless of the trouble off the pitch, submitted a detailed account but did not cite anyone for violent behaviour. \"There was no evidence against any single player that would enable a charge of violent conduct to be brought,\" said Mike Lee, Uefa's director of communications. The FA said it would not make any detailed comment until after Thursday's hearing. Uefa confirmed that the FA, if found guilty, should expect \"some sort of a fine,\" though Turkey's federation will probably have to pay a heavier sum. The Turks also face an offence of failing to control their fans, specifically because of flares being lit and missiles thrown on to the pitch. Beckham is understood to have handed Collina a small stone when he went to take a corner. It is the seventh time in five years that Turkey have been in trouble with the authorities, more than any other nation under Uefa's remit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
