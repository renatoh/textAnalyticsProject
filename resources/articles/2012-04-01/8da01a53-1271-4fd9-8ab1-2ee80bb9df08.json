With the Championship's leading two sides, Southampton and Reading, facing each other on Friday, this was an opportunity for West Ham to enhance their chances of returning directly to the Premier League but Birmingham City's opportunism and their own slipshod defending meant they made up only minimal ground. West Ham enjoyed early possession but Birmingham were solid and soon exposed the fragility of a home defence that has been impeccable for most of the season but has now conceded seven goals in two home matches. Chris Hughton's team went in front in the 27th minute when West Ham gave the ball away in midfield. Jordon Mutch was allowed to carry the ball towards the box before sidestepping Abdoulaye Faye and firing a low 20-yard shot into the net. Green did not even move to save it. West Ham were penetrated again three minutes later, Wade Elliott slipping a pass through to Marlon King who finished expertly. The home side rallied and Nicky Maynard curled a delicate shot against the bar a minute before Vaz T\u00ea cut the deficit, heading in from close range after James Tomkins had nodded a corner back across goal. That was in the 44th minute but West Ham could not make it to the break without conceding again. After a Birmingham corner was cleared to the edge of the area, Burke volleyed at goal and Curtis Davies appeared to apply a touch from close range to help it past Green. \"Our first\u2011half suicide was unbelievable,\" said Allardyce. \"We punished ourselves by giving the ball away cheaply and they got two great finishes. Vaz T\u00ea's goal should have been the start of the recovery but there wasn't enough determination when defending the corner \u2013 not enough players saying, 'These boys aren't going to score and, if I have to get my teeth kicked out and jaw broken , so be it.' Instead we committed suicide again.\" West Ham dominated the second half but most of their attacking was predictable and it seemed Birmingham had only to retain their shape and win the many aerial duels to stay ahead. The loss of Guirame N'Daw to injury in the 68th minute was a significant blow ithin two minutes that defence was breached. Kevin Nolan was given too much time to collect a punt into the box and feed it back to Carlton Cole, who drove low into the net. Birmingham nearly responded at once when Nikola Zigic, who had come on moments before the goal, headed a cross by Burke inches wide. But three minutes from time West Ham got a break when they were awarded a penalty after Henri Lansbury's 20-yard shot crashed into Burke's arm. Vaz T\u00ea walloped into the net from the spot. \"While it was a magnificent comeback, we wanted three points and only got one,\" grumbled Allardyce, who says he is now relying on Reading unravelling. \"The only way back for us now is if Reading drop points on Tuesday [against Brighton &amp; Hove Albion] and Southampton beat them on Friday and even then we'll have to win all four of our games.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
