The punters are eager to witness their new heroes in the flesh - even if they are unlikely, self-effacing heroes like Steve Harmison, Matthew Hoggard or Graham Thorpe. Oh, that it was so simple in 2004. For a start, the conquering heroes may not be on view until the first Test against New Zealand begins at Lord's on 20 May and in all probability they will remain invisible throughout the county season. England players, especially those who perform in both disciplines of the game, do not play county cricket now. Yet their absences are mere pinpricks compared to the potential difficulties faced by the English game this summer - despite the national team's unprecedented triumph in the Caribbean. The England and Wales Cricket Board and the counties are forever stuck between Scylla and Charybdis with no Odysseus to guide them to safety, whatever the personal qualities of David Morgan and Tim Lamb. In an increasingly litigious world, any decision taken at Lord's has reverberations in Calcutta, Auckland and Melbourne, not to mention Harare. Any form of self-regulation is now an archaic notion. I refer to the sore of Zimbabwe. Here the counties are, as ever, in the hands of the ECB. They can only fret about the consequences of not going there in October (the threat of expulsion from the International Cricket Council and the subsequent bankruptcy of the English game), or the consequences of going (infuriating some of the game's key sponsors and facing the charge of moral bankruptcy). On one level this is an absurdity. How can a Test series in Zimbabwe that would be watched in the flesh by about 1,000 people each day and is likely to produce a cricketing spectacle of forgettable mediocrity for TV viewers cause such major ructions around the globe? As a sporting contest it has all the significance of a mid-season meeting between Tranmere Rovers and Crewe Alexandra. Yet this issue could still tear the cricketing community apart. Decades ago Gubby Allen would have sent a solitary telegram saying, 'Sorry, can't make it', and that would have been the end of it. The counties look on nervously as the lawyers study all the implications. They face further problems that stem from the outpourings of the legal profession. Following the resolution of the Kolpak case (a Slovakian handball player who won the right to play in Germany as a 'non-overseas' player), it seems that just about anyone can play in English county cricket this season, wherever he was born or brought up. It does not matter that he cannot play for England. Claude Henderson, a reasonable left-arm spinner with seven South Africa caps to his name, will be turning out for Leicestershire, but not as an overseas player. Already the game has been infiltrated by countless EU-qualified cricketers at both ends of the divi sions (this year Derbyshire will have seven, Sussex four); now the lawyers say that the influx of Henderson and his ilk cannot be stopped either. The counties cannot protest too much about their service to the national game and their ability to produce future international players if they keep signing up cricketers who cannot play for England. An unofficial agreement between the clubs has been suggested to halt this trend, but even that might have the lawyers sniffing around. The Professional Cricketers' Association are up in arms yet they have been so successful in negotiating favourable terms for their players that everyone from everywhere wants a slice of the action - and the income. England remains the only country where domestic cricketers are able to earn a decent wage. Now that I've retired I'm beginning to wonder whether this is a good thing. The final source of angst has less to do with lawyers but centres on the perennial debate about the structure of domestic cricket. Another report is imminent. Here the conflict stems from the commercial needs of the counties, who want to play enough cricket to maintain membership levels, and the received wisdom, mostly from the England hierarchy, that our players play too much. Those that play too much are those in the England team, but this fact seems to bypass most critics of the current domestic system. Often the counties are cast as Luddites in this debate. Yet in swift succession they have embraced two-divisional cricket, central contracts, Twenty20 cricket and the necessity for establishing expensive cricketing academies. They cling on to power at the First Class Forum, much to the dismay of the Reform Group, simply because they are desperate for an absolute guarantee that they will not be dissolved by the reformers. Who can blame them for that? My plea is for a domestic structure that retains the integrity of the competitions. They should matter and their format should be easily understood. Therefore the proposed changes of the Reform Group or the musings of Matthew Engel in this year's Wisden - that somehow the four-day and one-day competitions should be combined to produce one winner - hold little appeal. The current system is not perfect. A conversation with a committee man from Middlesex revealed that neither of us had any clear idea which clubs - apart from our own - were in which division. This is exacerbated by the three-up, three-down system, which was a compromise for timid counties who feared being lodged in the second division for evermore. Finally, we can turn to a club who might win something. Sussex, remember, are the champions and they have signed shrewdly. Ian Ward and Mohammed Akram (not an overseas player) join them. Yet I would be surprised if they repeat their triumph of 2003. More batsmen should be able to decipher Mushtaq Ahmed this summer. Surrey are the usual candidates, but they are in a state of flux, with Jonathan Batty facing the tricky task of replacing the charismatic Adam Hollioake as captain. Lancashire, with their ancient overseas run-scorers (Stuart Law and Carl Hooper), look best equipped to take the pennant, provided the arrival of Dominic Cork does not disturb the unanimity of the dressing room. Gloucestershire and Northamptonshire will do well to retain their newly acquired first-division status. In the second, Nottinghamshire, who have signed extensively, Yorkshire, Somerset (with Ricky Ponting sometimes on hand) and Hampshire (under Shane Warne when available) are viable promotion candidates. Warne and Ponting, proper overseas players, in county cricket - now, that can't be bad."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
