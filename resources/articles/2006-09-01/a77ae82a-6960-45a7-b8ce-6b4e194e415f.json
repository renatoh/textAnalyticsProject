Certainly - but watch out for actors wearing codpieces", "bodyText": "The Royal Shakespeare Company proposes that every child at school in Britain should be compelled to see at least one live Shakespeare play. This, they argue, would dispel children's widely held belief of the bard as boring, irrelevant and difficult to comprehend. I unexpectedly find myself in a position to offer valuable advice to the RSC, based on vivid personal experience. That advice - it's more of a warning, really - can be simply stated: costumes, costumes, costumes. I speak as someone who was, as a schoolboy, once taken on a compulsory outing to see a Shakespeare play. So I know. (All this took place in South Africa rather than Britain, but that makes no difference). Our class had been taught Shakespeare by a tired English teacher who made little effort to enthuse or excite us. His were among the most boring of many boring lectures, and his dampening influence retarded my appreciation of Shakespeare by many years. But we were once taken to a real performance of Henry V - that year's set book - which, according to RSC theory, ought to have awakened us from our torpor and indifference. It did so, but not in the way the RSC would have envisaged. It was the codpiece that did it. I don't think any of us had ever seen a play in which the main character's costume obliged him to wear the appendage. And boy, did he inhabit his codpiece with panache. The young actor who played Henry filled it - how shall I put it - tightly and commodiously. His first appearance on stage provoked a loud communal gasp, then, unstoppably, laughter. Any attention we might have paid to his words disappeared as we fixed our eyes downwards. His every move drew a new guffaw. We tried, I remember, to behave, but the scene in front of us was too powerful. It was worse (or perhaps better) for the audience that came from the girls' schools. They were, like us, 16 or 17, and largely unsophisticated in the ways of the world. To their embarrassment and hilarity was added - I learned later from one who was there - a tinge of sexual awakening. Whatever the inner emotions of those watching the play, the outward result was a cacophony of sniggering, giggling and whispering that continued until the final curtain. We were all kept in detention the following day for our misbehaviour, but the effect of that evening lasted far longer. For years afterwards, the very mention of a Shakespeare play was coupled in my mind with the image of Henry's codpiece. Which is why I say to the RSC: if you want children to appreciate Shakespeare's plays, watch out for the costumes. It was when I read or heard it for the 14th time in a single day - this was during the recent Brown-Blair hysteria - that I realised it had become the phrase I most hated in the whole world: \"The elephant in the room\", which is defined as an issue of dominant importance that, for some reason of political or social embarrassment, is never openly mentioned. When, last week, the talented graffitist Banksy did a witty send-up by painting a real elephant in a fleur-de-lis design and placing it in a living room that was part of his Los Angeles exhibition, I assumed that no self-respecting journo, politician or media commentator would ever have the nerve to use such an overworked cliche again. Not a bit of it. Back it came this week, in spades, unashamed. I have given up counting. It is only in the past year or two that the phrase has come to be used so lazily and prolifically. But where did it come from? I couldn't find any reason for its sudden, recent emergence in media-speak, but I traced it back to a 70-minute BBC television film by the late Alan Clarke, shown in 1989. Called Elephant, it is a bleak, almost wordless sequence of 18 murders in Belfast. Clarke said he had taken the title from the Belfast writer and Booker prize-shortlisted Bernard MacLaverty, who had described the troubles in Northern Ireland as \"having an elephant in your living room\". MacLaverty emailed me, remembering it slightly differently. \"I was asked what it was like to live in Northern Ireland during the troubles. My reply was that it was like living in a room with an elephant and trying to ignore it. Occasionally it stood on your toe or crapped on your head, but mostly you tried to get on with things.\" MacLaverty had used the idea of an elephant in a room in a children's story he had written and illustrated, A Man in Search of a Pet (1978), in which the man tried out various pets before deciding on an elephant, even though it took up so much room in his flat. The slight reservation I have about stating definitively that MacLaverty is the sole begetter of the benighted cliche is that the way he defined it - with its emphasis on something you get accustomed to - is not quite the same as its use in current media circles. I also came across a hint that it is based on an old Irish saying. Whatever its origin, I wish people would stop saying and writing it. (And yes, I do know that the Rolling Stones' Sad, Sad, Sad contains the lines, \"The elephant's in the bedroom, throwing his weight around\", but I do not think it refers to the same elephant.) There must be a shorter and pleasanter way of communicating to the public all the horrors that children today are allegedly going through. In the past week alone I've had to read six separate stories (and probably there were others in newspapers I don't read) about the plight of, or danger to, kids. It's all repetitive, confusing and never tells you anything you didn't know. Here's a simple way to save newspaper space and readers' time. It's a chart, which can be published everywhere, weekly. Across the top are four sections: Good news/Bad news, Says who? and What's the government doing about it? Down the side is a list of everything that's wrong with children: obesity, teenage pregnancies, yobbishness, rubbish parents, depression, incorrect child seats in cars, illiteracy, teenage abortions, drugs, junk food consumed, crime etc, etc. Then just fill in. This week, for instance, under \"rubbish parents\" you would have filled in \"never home\", \"the Archbishop of Canterbury\", \"nothing\". On obesity: \"more\", \"10,000 surveys\", \"nothing\". And so on. Every week a summary of children's misery - without all the boring details. This week Marcel read And They All Sang: \"Great musicians of all kinds - Armstrong to Birgit Nilsson, Brendel to Big Bill Broonzy - speaking to the supreme interviewer, Studs Terkel; insightful and entertaining.\" Marcel watched Bringing Up Baby on DVD, with Katharine Hepburn and Cary Grant: \"Still the funniest screwball romantic comedy of them all.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
