British safety experts have begun an investigation into the deaths of the two American sailors. Specialists from the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) are to interview two other sailors from the USS Minneapolis-St Paul who survived the accident with minor injuries. The submarine has continued on its voyage but its skipper, Commander Edwin Ruff, and his officers will be questioned when it returns to port. The US navy named the two victims as Senior Chief Petty Officer Thomas E Higgins, 45, of Paducah, Kentucky, and Petty Officer Second Class Michael J Holtz, 30, of Lakewood, Ohio. The Americans have also started an inquiry into the accident, which happened as the crewmen were clearing the deck of the submarine as it left Plymouth Sound on Friday. Lieutenant Chris Servello, of the US 6th fleet headquarters in Naples, said: \"The cause of the accident remains under investigation.\" The British inquiry is being conducted jointly by the police and the MAIB, who will also be interviewing the crews of two British boats that helped in the rescue. The American crewmen were hit by breaking waves as the ship left the shelter of the harbour and were exposed to the full force of the sea and the wind. They were on deck wearing lifelines, which kept them attached to the ship after they were swept into the sea. They were dragged behind the submarine as it slowed and were rescued by British sailors from a pilot boat and two launches that were escorting the boat out of harbour. They were taken to Derriford hospital in Plymouth, where two died and two others were discharged to the sick bay at the HMS Drake base in Plymouth. Coastguards said there was a severe gale force-nine at the time with winds gusting to 47 knots, and the sea was very rough. The 6,000-tonne USS Minneapolis-St Paul was launched in 1983 and has a top speed of more than 25 knots. It is nuclear powered and in 1992 became the first submarine to fire a Tomahawk cruise missile."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
