He made his debut at the Wigmore Hall as a fresh-faced twentysomething pianist exactly three decades ago, a milestone the Hall has celebrated by making him the second recipient - after Matthias Goerne - of the Wigmore Medal. Schiff marked the occasion with even greater solemnity, with a pair of performances of Bach's Goldberg Variations. This was the second. Schiff's performance, as we have come to expect, was scrupulously thought through. The way he had decided to play the theme, though, belied this, making it sound almost careless, the languid right hand hanging just fractionally behind the left, decorating the melody with roving trills and turns. As the variations picked up pace, Schiff often drove the music from the bass line, placing more importance on that than on what seemed mere melodic frippery. If he were in a string quartet, Schiff would be the cellist. Three long pauses punctuated the flow, with Schiff holding absolute silence each time. There was space for playful decoration: nimble hand-crossing somersaults in the first variation, swinging spins in the seventh, and a joyous, frenetic scampering in the 14th that landed on the final unison with mischievous certitude. Yet, as the work went on, Schiff's insistence on structure rather than surface glazing occasionally led to some grunting repeated notes. And in the melody of the long Adagio variation, where some other pianists go for introspection, Schiff - fervent, direct and relentlessly loud - was close to hectoring. The result won't have been everybody's desert island Goldbergs, but it was idiosyncratic, uncommonly direct and ultimately satisfying. When after 75 minutes the theme finally returned, it was no ghostly apparition. But nor was it a final valediction. Like Schiff's own bow, it was more of an au revoir."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
