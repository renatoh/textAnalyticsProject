My kids - Georgia, Freya, and Bertie - are really into it. We all went last year and had the most wonderful time. It was just like having the best, biggest party on your doorstep for four days. My daughter Georgia can actually sit on her bed and see the pyramid stage. We can walk in and out - come back and have a bath. It's a phenomenon - you go in and the first person you see is someone you've got to take in. Everybody is just there to have a good time, that's how the atmosphere is. It's totally ageless too - you get some real old ravers there. When we first arrived in Pilton, we were terribly worried about whether we were going to be OK. Last year was the first year of the ring of steel, and Michael Eavis was fantastic - we were looked after really well. There were about 10 security men around here 24 hours a day. Michael has put into play an enormous amount of measures to try to make sure people in the village don't suffer as much as they did last year, when it really was pretty frightening. People who had turned up without tickets started marauding around the village, a certain number of people suffered very badly and there was a lot of crime. But this year hopefully the new measures - masses of CCTV in the village, more police presence - will help. It's not necessarily true that Glastonbury isn't popular in the village - the more people I speak to the more I get a feeling of: \"It's a good thing because it's good for the local economy, and it's a world renowned festival.\" I think they're incredibly proud of the fact that Glastonbury is in their village. There is this amazing community of people here, they all know how they've got to batten down for the festival. For four or five days they know they're not going to be able to move. They all look after each other."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
