A scoping study commissioned by the department in 2013 found that some high-ranking military officers thought Australia\u2019s capacity for strategic thinking in conflicts had diminished. During the course of the report, which was led by consultants Noetic Group, a number of senior military officers said the defence forces were \u201cnot good at strategy\u201d. But in response to a freedom of information request from Guardian Australia, the department said it could not provide interview records from then major general Angus Campbell, one of the participants, because transcripts from the study were not retained. The Defence Department said Noetic Group had advised them: \u201cNoetic subscribes firmly to a policy of non-attribution in the development of its lessons learnt reviews. \u201cSome direct observation from interviewees were reflected within the study, to highlight an area where additional study could be warranted by [the department]; no individual names were attributed to specific comments. \u201cBecause of this insistence on non-attribution, on finalisation of the report, no interview transcripts were retained on file by Noetic.\u201d The prime minister, Tony Abbott, has indicated he will not rule out following the US into a further conflict in Iraq, as conflict with insurgents has once again flared in the country. Despite the department\u2019s response, the report directly attributes comments given by other senior military officials in previous reports and public engagements. The original report, which was obtained by the Australian under freedom of information laws, conducted interviews with 14 senior defence participants who had been heavily involved in command and control or supporting operations. The study was critical of defence\u2019s strategic policy making, and said it was \u201cnot well examined or articulated\u201d. \u201cDefence needs to improve the quality of its policy advice to government and to do this it needs to seek ways to meet the deliberative \u2013 inclusive \u2013 integrative approach discussed above.\u201d The report also examined Australia\u2019s involvement in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and said Australia\u2019s role shifted from being an \u201cintimate alliance partner\u201d with the US to \u201cone among many\u201d of an outer circle of contributions. \u201cDuring recent operations the strategic objectives were apparently too weakly articulated to enable the costs of action to be properly evaluated. The result was that avoidance of costs overwhelmed achievement of benefits and the apparent strategic rationale for commitment to both Iraq and Afghanistan, bolstering the US alliance, was undermined by tactical risk avoidance.\u201d Under commonwealth freedom of information law, government agencies must take steps to ensure documents from contractors that relate to the performance of a government contract can be later sent to the department. A spokeswoman for Noetic Group said: \u201cAs per the terms of our agreement with defence we will not be commenting on this project.\u201d The department has not responded to questions about the review."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
