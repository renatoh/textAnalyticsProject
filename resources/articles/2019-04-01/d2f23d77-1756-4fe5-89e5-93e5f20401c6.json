Well, we are in the semi-finals now. And we have eliminated two of the favourites in the last two rounds,\u201d he said. \u201cThe next games will be very difficult, but so were these ones. So who knows?\u201d We don\u2019t know what we can achieve but we are never satisfied. There\u2019s so much potential in this team, we are all still quite young and you see us grow every game.\u201d Ajax fell behind to Cristiano Ronaldo\u2019s header in the first half before Donny van de Beek\u2019s equaliser drew the tie level on aggregate, with De Ligt\u2019s winner just reward for superb second-half display. \u201cWe dominated after the break and were well worth our victory,\u201d said Frenkie De Jong. \u201cIn fact, we probably should have won by more.\u201d De Jong will join Barcelona in the summer for \u20ac75m and appears likely to be joined by fellow youth team graduate De Ligt. Speaking after his side\u2019s 3-0 win over Manchester United that also took them into the semi-finals, Bar\u00e7a director Guillermo Amor hinted that a deal may have already been struck for the teenager. \u201cHe\u2019s a player of Ajax and we respect the club,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about players from other teams although I know where he will play next year.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
