The 28-year-old is understood to have broken an ankle and suffered a serious head injury after chasing two burglars. Crolla caught one of the intruders, according to the Manchester Evening News, but was then attacked by the other with a brick or a lump of concrete. Crolla\u2019s trainer, Joe Gallagher, told the MEN: \u201cHe\u2019s seen people climbing over a fence from next door and he\u2019s given chase. He\u2019s managed to get hold of one of the two but the other has picked up a brick or a concrete slab and attacked him. He could have been killed.\u201d Eddie Hearn, the Matchroom promoter, tweeted: \u201cGutted to confirm that @ant-crolla is in hospital with a head and ankle injury after confronting burglars at/near his property.\u201d Known as \u2018Million Dolla Crolla\u2019, the WBO inter-continental lightweight title holder had been due to face the Cuban Richard Abril on 23 January for the WBA world title at the Phones 4U Arena in Manchester, but Gallagher admitted that will no longer take place. \u201cI\u2019ve just spoken to him on the phone and he\u2019s heartbroken,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s all plastered-up and waiting for a CT scan. His title dream is gone. Whether he will ever get another shot at it in the future, I don\u2019t know. His dreams are in tatters.\u201d Hearn later added: \u201cAnthony is in a stable condition in Oldham hospital. Unfortunately the Jan 23rd fight is off but concerns right now are with Ant and family. You ask anyone in boxing doubt you kind find a nicer kid than Crolla, absolutely gutted for him.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
