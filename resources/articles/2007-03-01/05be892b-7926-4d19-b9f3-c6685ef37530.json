Matthews), Hall\u00e9/ Elder", "bodyText": "Mark Elder's account of La Mer is an impressively controlled if rather cool affair, a reminder perhaps that it was the English Channel that inspired Debussy (he famously finished the score while staying in the Grand hotel, Eastbourne), rather than the warmer colours of the Mediterranean. Elder doesn't forget that the work is subtitled \"Three symphonic sketches\" either, with a superb grasp of the work's architecture and a slow-burning intensity which pulls everything into sharp focus in the final movement. But it's the other pieces that makes this disc so special. The Hall\u00e9 commissioned Colin Matthews to make orchestrations of all 24 of Debussy's piano Preludes in 2001. He finished the set last year, and here Elder includes a selection drawn from both books; the Hall\u00e9 will record the remainder for another disc in a few months. They are all brilliantly realised miniatures. Matthews does not hesitate to break out of the original's framework when he thinks it necessary - adding a few extra bars to extend the melody in Brouillards; establishing the introduction to Ce Qu'a Vu le Vent d'Ouest; and crystallising a theme out of the piano's left hand in Les Tierces Altern\u00e9es. And he more radically recomposes both Le Vent dans la Plaine, in which he adds a whole development section, and Le Fille aux Cheveux de Lin, slowed to half speed and changed in character completely. They are remarkable achievements."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
