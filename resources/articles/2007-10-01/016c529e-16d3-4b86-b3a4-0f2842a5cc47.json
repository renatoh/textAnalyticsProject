Goals were so cheap that they were practically giving them away. Portsmouth scored seven to Reading's four and everybody appeared to enjoy the fun, although the losing manager, Steve Coppell, looked as if he had just had some root canal work done without an anaesthetic. Harry Redknapp, the Portsmouth manager, got quite carried away, comparing the match to Real Madrid's memorable 7-3 victory against Eintracht Frankfurt in the 1960 European Cup final, which is regarded as one of the greatest games of football ever played. It was not quite in that category, but the hyperbole was understandable given the rarity of the occasion. In the early 1960s more than a few teams were still blessed with the Corinthian ideal of scoring more goals than their opponents rather than trying to prevent them scoring at all. Real and Eintracht had no concept of closing players down or denying them space and offsides occurred more by accident than design. On a normal afternoon in the Premier League Portsmouth and Reading would have played cat and mouse with each other rather than Tom and Jerry. Modern football needs these occasional extravaganzas if only to show that it is still capable of rising above the restraints of tactics, formations and advice from the bench. But no more than two or three a season, if that many. Too many cheap goals cheapen a competition. In the 1950-51 season Merthyr Tydfil won the old Southern League while scoring 156 goals in 44 matches. The bottom team, Hastings United, conceded 143. Some of the fans must have pined for a decent save. Yet the idea that the game will be better if scoring is made easier still dies hard. Cockeyed suggestions for making the goals bigger can be laughed aside, even if they do emanate from the Fifa president's office, but still the offside law, or rather its interpretation, is subject to random tinkering. The only major change to Law 11 was made 82 years ago when the number of opponents needed to keep an attacker onside was reduced from three to two. The immediate effects were dramatic: whereas Huddersfield had retained their league title with 69 goals in 1925 they completed the hat-trick the following year with 92. In the long term, however, the game became more defensive and even the more recent modifications, such as allowing an attacker in line with the last defender to be onside and identifying interference with play as actually making contact with the ball, have not halted the trend towards crowded midfields with only one out-and-out striker. Lucky are those old enough to remember the days when teams had forward lines. At least the offside trap has all but had its day. Any teams using such tactics now take their lives in their hands, given the lottery of offside flags waved (or not waved) by linesmen who have clearly become so confused that some decisions might have been made by Ben Turpin, the cross-eyed cowboy. Last week a couple of goals wrongly disallowed in recent matches persuaded the referees' body to advise match officials that it was better to allow a goal that might be offside than to rule out one which was probably onside. According to Paul Rejer, the referees' coach, everyone wanted more goals and Fifa wanted attackers to be given the benefit of the doubt. Few spectators would argue with the principle of this argument unless, of course, their teams happen to be the victims of a more liberal approach. Either way the main aim of referees and their assistants should surely be to get decisions right, which did not happen at White Hart Lane on Monday. Amid the thrills and the furore of Tottenham coming from 4-1 down to draw 4-4 with Aston Villa, few cared that Villa's second goal and Spurs' fourth, scored in stoppage-time, both involved touches from players in or coming from offside positions. This match, like its prolific predecessor at Fratton Park, was distinguished more by the unusual number of goals scored than the overall quality of the football. The scoreline evoked memories of a 4-4 draw between Tottenham and West Ham three days before Christmas in 1962, a tumultuous affair on a muddy pitch which promised Ron Greenwood's team a narrow win until Dave Mackay charged through in the closing minutes to gain Spurs a point. Hindsight can play tricks and maybe the quality of the earlier game was not that much better than Monday's match, but it is a fair bet that all eight goals were legal, and Bill Brown, the Tottenham goalkeeper, surely had a better match than the error-prone Paul Robinson. Spurs scored 111 goals in the First Divison that season but only came second. Bill Nicholson's job was not thought to be in danger."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
