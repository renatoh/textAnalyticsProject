Even Mumford &amp; Sons described the musicians who endorsed it \u2013 including Madonna, Daft Punk and Rihanna \u2013 as \u201cnew school fucking plutocrats\u201d, while Lily Allen said the service\u2019s $19.99 monthly fee would send listeners \u201cback to pirate sites\u201d. However, Jack White, who was among the lineup of musicians at the launch, has come to the service\u2019s defence on a Tidal-themed Q&amp;A with fans on Third Man Records\u2019 website. White is putting his label\u2019s artists on Jay Z\u2019s service, whose USP is higher-quality sound than rival streaming sites and, it says, a fairer deal for musicians than they would get from the likes of Spotify and YouTube. Responding to a fan who said \u201cI have zero interest in making Jay Z more money,\u201d White said that the site was \u201cnot about the rich getting richer\u201d. Referring to the launch, White said: \u201cIt takes artists that can get people\u2019s attention to be able to make a scenario possible for those artists that don\u2019t have a voice to get in a position where they aren\u2019t struggling, and believe me Third Man Records is full of artists the mainstream\u2019s never heard of and have no voice or power in the system. \u201cHave you heard of Rachelle Garnier? what about the Smoke Fairies? Drakkar Sauna? Pujol? The Gories? Those are just some of the up and coming artists on Third Man that try to make a living in music. And if you stream their songs \u2026 they get paid for it. And they get to LIVE and not take second jobs \u2026 and make MORE music! I support keeping musicians you love in business.\u201d Replying to a fan who said that Tidal is elitist, White responded: \u201cWhat is elitist about it? Who\u2019s speaking for the little guy?\u201d He added: \u201cTidal is going to help a lot of artists out. I\u2019m talking about the punk band that has 50k hits on Youtube and doesn\u2019t see a dime.\u201d White said that while many listeners now expect to get records for free, making them is expensive. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of misinformation about music in the last decade, people know that it costs a lot of money to make a superhero movie, but they don\u2019t know that it costs millions to make a country album too.\u201d White responded to a fan who said he refused to pay for music by asking: \u201cHow much did you pay for that last movie you saw at the theater? And how much did that movie cost to make? Don\u2019t devalue musicians man, support them. Making records is expensive, believe us. I don\u2019t see people saying we should go to the movies for free, or Netflix should be free. That state of music is in flux, be on the side of supporting creativity, not taking from it. [Tidal] gives you that chance.\u201d White also said that even successful musicians deserved payment for their work. \u201cDo we tell Steven Spielberg we don\u2019t need to pay him anymore to watch his movies? He\u2019s made enough off of us right? He should show his new films for free right? Haha.\u201d White said that he got on with the rest of the musicians who launched Tidal, which also included Alicia Keys, Deadmau5 and Madonna. \u201cWe spent all last night talking and discussing ways to make it very cool.\u201d Referring to the services enhanced sound, White wrote: \u201cHere\u2019s the shocker: musicians want you to hear their music in the best ways possible. We mix on very nice speakers and systems only to have 90% of it be heard on tiny components that cut out half the information.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
