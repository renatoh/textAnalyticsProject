Visits to retail and recreation establishments in Rutland, Britain\u2019s smallest county, were down 100% compared with the pre-February baseline, while four other areas \u2013 Bath and North East Somerset, Midlothian, Nottinghamshire and York \u2013 all recorded drops of 90% or more. However, the data suggests the sight of bare shelves could be coming to an end: at grocery and pharmaceutical shops there was a large increase in footfall at the beginning of last month, peaking at almost 30% by mid-March, but in the last two weeks the trend sharply reversed, with the retailers seeing huge drops in traffic \u2013 46% nationwide \u2013 despite being exempt from the lockdown. That pattern, of a spike followed by a slump, is common across almost the whole nation. But some areas bucked the trend: in Dundee, for instance, there was almost no increase in foot traffic to grocers, suggesting the panic buying that swept the nation bypassed the Scottish city. Conversely, Thurrock in Essex had one of the largest spikes, topping out at 40% higher than normal, and one of the steepest falls with traffic now down 53%. Google\u2019s data also enables international comparisons: the US, for instance, is far behind the UK in encouraging widespread physical distancing. Retail and recreation is down just 47% there, while grocery and pharmacy visits have fallen 22%. But the car-centric nation has recorded a proportionally steeper decline in public transport use, down 51%, suggesting more Americans were able to cut back on that than on shopping. The data comes from the vast corpus of information Google collects on all its users in order to offer services such as Google Maps, as well as targeted advertising. \u201cInsights in these reports are created with aggregated, anonymised sets of data from users who have turned on the location history setting, which is off by default,\u201d the company said. \u201cNo personally identifiable information, like an individual\u2019s location, contacts or movement, is made available at any point.\u201d The company said the reports, which cover almost the whole world \u2013 with China a notable exception \u2013 \u201cwill be available for a limited time, so long as public health officials find them useful in their work to stop the spread of Covid-19\u201d. The release demonstrates the sort of information that governments have been requesting from technology and communications firms since the crisis hit. In the UK, for instance, the government has received aggregated location data from mobile carriers, allowing it to track the success of its physical distancing guidelines. In the US, some Facebook data, filtered through the company\u2019s disease mapping project, has served a similar purpose, although the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has also received location data from mobile advertising companies."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
