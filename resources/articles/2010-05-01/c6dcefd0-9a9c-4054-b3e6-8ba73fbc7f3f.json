The purpose of the foundation is to keep alive the spirit of Florence Nightingale by investing in leadership in nurses and midwives, through raising funds to provide scholarships for nurses and midwives to study at home and abroad. Why is this a special year? This year marks the centenary of the death of Florence Nightingale and this evening, on her birthday, we are holding a special service in Westminster Abbey to commemorate Florence Nightingale's life and work. When did you become chief executive of the foundation? I started at the beginning of April. Why did you want the job? I won a scholarship from the foundation in 2006 and it gave me a tremendous opportunity to develop a piece of work on reducing avoidable hospital mortality, which was published in the British Medical Journal last month. From a personal, professional and patient-care point of view, it was a pivotal moment in my career and gave me exposure to a range of thinking beyond anything one would normally have within NHS training. So when the opportunity of this position came up, I thought it would be brilliant to have that impact on other people's careers. What do you bring to the role? I have a background in nursing and midwifery. I have also done academic work and I've been very involved in evidence-based healthcare. I'm keen to engender academic scholarship in nurses. I believe very strongly that being a graduate nurse makes you understand the evidence behind what you're doing. But of course it doesn't mean you rule out care and compassion \u2013 that's ridiculous. I'm a graduate and I'm happy to wash patients. What is your leadership style? There are times when you have to lead from the front, but I'm a great worker in teams. I like to enthuse and motivate people, and this role will give me a huge opportunity to do that. How has Florence Nightingale inspired you? Florence Nightingale herself is a real inspiration. She was a real leader, not only of nurses but of women, at a time when many things were almost impossible for women. She managed to get many changes by using statistics. She was one of the first people to use pie charts, to demonstrate simply that more soldiers in the Crimea were dying from infection than from their wounds. She was able to work on a broader canvas and we need that kind of inspiration for nurses today, about understanding the impact of people's lifestyle and emotions, as well as their physical needs.
