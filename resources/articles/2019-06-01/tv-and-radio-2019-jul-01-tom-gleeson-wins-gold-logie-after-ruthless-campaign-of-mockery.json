Gleeson \u2013 who hosts the ABC comedy quiz show Hard Quiz, and appears on The Weekly \u2013 brought a glass of red wine to the podium at the end of the long ceremony, and admitted he had been \u201cdrinking heavily\u201d throughout. \u201cI have ruined the Logies, and it\u2019s never going to happen again,\u201d he declared cheerfully to the room of industry figures gathered at the Star Casino on the Gold Coast. \u201cOur industry is dying, and I\u2019m part of that!\u201d Administered by the listings magazine TV Week, the Logies are often criticised as a cheesy celebration of celebrity culture, with many major awards boiling down to popularity contests. The Gold Logie, for instance, is championed as one of the industry\u2019s top honours but to win it, nominees are expected to campaign for public votes. In place of a serious campaign this year, Gleeson unleashed a \u201cludicrous\u201d one. Launched by The Weekly, he ran a series of faux attack ads on social media against his fellow nominees, including the beloved TV personalities Waleed Aly, Amanda Keller, Costa Georgiadis and Rodger Corser. He also axed his own show, promising to bring it back if he won. The stunt did what it was meant to: it seemed to rub Gold Logie hopefuls the wrong way, and made headlines in the process. Keller, a favourite to win this year, called it \u201cirritating\u201d (\u201cthere\u2019s no need to make it personal\u201d), and Denyer \u2013 who won the 2018 Gold Logie thanks, in part, to another mocking campaign by Gleeson \u2013 lamented that the prize had \u201cbecome a joke \u2026 I\u2019m worried if [Gleeson] wins, that\u2019s it for the Logies forever.\u201d Accepting a prize he had been ridiculing for years, the comedian acknowledged he was in a \u201ctricky spot\u201d. \u201cI like it and I hate it at the same time ... I do host the highest-rating gameshow in Australia. So somewhere in the joke people forgot that this is mine.\u201d Gleeson said he was \u201cgoing to take this as a win for the ABC\u201d. The public broadcaster hasn\u2019t won a Gold Logie since 1976, when the satirist Garry McDonald collected the prize in character as Norman Gunston. Gleeson wasn\u2019t the only one to stir up this year\u2019s Logies. After being inducted into the Hall of Fame, the retired journalist Kerry O\u2019Brien delivered a powerful, no-holds-barred speech celebrating the ABC, criticising government attacks on it, and calling for Indigenous reconciliation and action on the climate emergency. O\u2019Brien, who stepped down as the host of Four Corners in 2015 after 40 years at the public broadcaster, was introduced by Waleed Aly as \u201ca master\u201d and given a standing ovation. Opening his speech, O\u2019Brien said although he had worked at every commercial network, his \u201cnatural home\u201d was always the ABC, where \u201cthe pursuit of excellence wasn\u2019t just permitted, it was expected\u201d. \u201cThere have been the tough times; the budget cuts to the ABC \u2013 again, and again, and again \u2013 driven more by a desire to punish and by an ideological obsession than because the public broadcaster was inefficient,\u201d he said. He said the ABC had never been threatened more than it was today and was still \u201cconfronting the same sad \u2013 and now even the federal police, some of whom have themselves leaked to us in the past, have seen fit to raid the place\u201d. O\u2019Brien\u2019s passionate speech was at odds with what tends to be a lightweight TV event. He didn\u2019t let journalists off the hook, delivering a call to arms to the profession which shares \u201cgreat responsibility for the great failures of our time\u201d \u2013 including society\u2019s failure to act on climate change. \u201cWe the journalists have not cut through the fake news effectively. We have not properly held politicians to account.\u201d He also spoke of \u201cthe failure to reconcile Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australia,\u201d and called for the ratification of the Uluru statement of the heart. \u201cThe Uluru statement represents no threat to a single individual in any corner of this country, and certainly no threat to the integrity of parliament \u2013 and if you\u2019re told that, don\u2019t you believe it,\u201d he said vehemently. \u201cWe like to be seen as one nation made up of many parts. Now it\u2019s time to prove it.\u201d It was a big night for the ABC, which won in 10 of the 20 categories it was nominated in \u2013 including two for Gardening Australia. The show, which celebrated its 30th year this year, was awarded most popular lifestyle program, with the host Costa Georgiadis winning most popular presenter against fellow Gold Logie nominees Gleeson, Aly and Keller. The animated series and runaway success Bluey won best children\u2019s program, Four Corners won best news coverage for its program on the Thai cave rescue, Mystery Road won most popular drama, and Bloom won most outstanding miniseries and best supporting actress, for Jackie Weaver. The basketball and tennis champion Dylan Alcott, who hosts the ABC music show The Set, won the Logie for most popular new talent, and delivered a moving speech about the importance of disability representation on screen. \u201cI used to absolutely hate having a disability,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the reasons was that when I turned on the TV I never saw anyone like me, and when I did see someone like me it was a road safety ad where someone drink drives and has a car accident and the next scene is someone like me \u2013 whose life is over. And I was like, that\u2019s not my life. \u201cI wanted to get a job on TV because I love sharing stories but also to show that people with disability can be talented, funny, humorous \u2013 just normal people enjoying their lives.\u201d But Luke McGregor, who won most popular actor for his role in Rosehaven, was responsible for one of the shortest and sweetest speeches of the night: \u201cI\u2019m single, I\u2019m at the afterparty, thanks.\u201d Other major awards went to Deborah Mailman (most popular actress for Nine\u2019s Bite Club and ABC\u2019s Mystery Road); Scott Ryan (most outstanding actor for Foxtel\u2019s Mr InBetween); and Jenna Coleman (most outstanding actress for ABC\u2019s The Cry). Ten\u2019s Have You Been Paying Attention? won most popular comedy show and most outstanding entertainment program and Wentworth (Foxtel) won most outstanding drama series."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
