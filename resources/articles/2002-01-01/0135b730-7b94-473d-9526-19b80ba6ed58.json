It should, I think, be round and fat, and be served so hot you have to blow on each forkful before you put it in your mouth. No waxy-fleshed trendy varieties please, just a plump King Edward as big as your hand, and butter, lashings of it, to mash into the snow-like flesh. A good baked spud is as much about luck as good planning - a fact that will infuriate those who think successful cooking is all about following recipes. As often as not, you just chuck them in the oven without a second thought and they come out perfect: the baked tatty from heaven. Another day you can get the correct 'floury' variety, bake it with a little sea salt in a hot oven and serve it within seconds of it leaving the oven and yet it still won't be right. You can follow all the rules and yet food sometimes does its own thing. In this case a skin that is unwilling to crisp up nicely and flesh that refuses to turn to froth. Sometimes cooks just have to cross their fingers. Forget everything you have heard about wrapping each potato in tin foil. Someone is having you on. It produces flabby skins and doesn't, as is occasionally suggested, hasten cooking. A nice fat spud takes about 45 minutes to an hour, a fact we have no choice but to swallow. So just run a bath, pour yourself a drink and wait for the nutty smell of crisping potato skin to fill the kitchen. I get a big buzz from perfecting simple everyday cooking. By my calculations it is a thousand times more useful to get a baked potato right than filling the cracks in your rendition of oeuf en gel\u00e9e or lobster thermidor. Partly because most of us want to eat a baked potato about a thousand times more often than old-hat French cooking, and, partly, because there is somehow nothing more pleasing to getting a simple thing spot-on. Some nights, a jacket potato is what I want on the side of my plate, other times it is my entire supper. It can be a humble meal with nothing but butter and some grated, sharp-flavoured cheese (or even that forlorn, dead lump of cheddar at the back of the fridge) or it can be a performance meal, with all the bells and whistles a cook can conjure up. Either way, the texture of the inside really matters. Yes, the variety of spud makes a difference, as does the cooking temperature and the speed at which it is served, but true perfection depends on how you open the potato. The karate-chop method works best. I was told about this long ago by cookery writer Rosie Stark and it works unfailingly. You need practice to get it right. Too slow and you burn your hand. Too hard and you shower the kitchen with potato shrapnel and nobody gets any supper. Ideally, you bring your hand down fast and sharp as if you were doing a karate chop, but only hard enough to crack open the potato skin. It sounds silly but the point is that it lets the steam escape in one great woosh, causing the flesh to turn instantly to snow. Slice it open instead and the result will be solid rather than fluffy. I should add that it is a good idea to cover the potato with a tea towel first. I mention this in light of a reader who wrote (kindly) to tell me of a scalded hand she got using my method. \"You should have done it quicker\" must have sounded unsympathetic as a reply, but you do have to look sharp. Thhwack! I do without the protection I suggest above. Not out of machismo, but to save a clean tea towel. We can stuff a spud to our heart's content - if it is one of those times when only butter and cheese and bacon and cream will do - or it can be a spartan supper with a slice of goat's cheese, just so long as its skin is crisp and salty and its flesh is as deep and soft as the driven snow. The variety To get a really fluffy baked potato you need 'floury', the sort that have white rather than yellow flesh and crumble when you cook them. Varieties such as King Edward, Maris Piper, Wilja, Ailsa and Golden Wonder are what you want. The size Two small baked potatoes are ready sooner but lack the majesty of a big one. Those in between 350 and 400g take about an hour to cook and are large enough to look the part. If you are going to stuff your potatoes, then deep round ones will be easier to work with than those that are flat and stone like. Preparation Those bought from a supermarket need their plastic wrapping removing so they don't sweat and put somewhere dark, dry and cool. They will turn green in daylight. Rinse all potatoes of any mud then scrub them well with a vegetable brush, making certain to get the soil trapped right down inside the eyes. Prick here and there with a fork; a sure way to stop them exploding in the oven. Let them dry for a minute or two before baking. I dust mine lightly with fine sea salt while they are still wet. That way you get a crisp and savoury skin. Baking Bake somewhere between 200C/gas mark 6 and 230C/gas mark 8, until the skins are crisp. This will take around an hour - maybe less - for a medium-sized 400g potato. They are done when the flesh gives to a little pressure from thumb and forefinger. If you prefer, test them with a skewer, which should slide in with little pressure. The longer you keep the cooked potato warm the softer and tougher its skin will go. Baked potatoes with salt cod and parsley A beautiful marriage of textures this: creamy salt-cod pur\u00e9e and crisp potato skins. As baked potatoes go this is a lot of work, much washing up, too, but the result is worth the trouble. Salt cod is not easy to track down: Spanish, Italian and Portuguese grocers and major supermarkets are your best bet. The recipe makes rather too much filling, but it is not worth dealing with a smaller quantity of salt cod. There's no hardship anyway, simply keep the leftover pur\u00e9e in the fridge and eat it the next day with fingers of hot toast. Serves 2. 500g dried salt cod 2 large baking potatoes 150ml milk 150ml extra virgin olive oil 1 large clove garlic the juice of a lemon a small bunch of parsley Soak the salt cod in cold water for a good 24 hours, changing the water constantly. After scrubbing the potatoes well and pricking them here and there with a fork, put them on to bake at 200 C/gas mark 6. Once the potatoes have been baking for half an hour or so, drain the fish, put it in a deep pan, cover it with cold water then bring it to the boil. When the water is bubbling, turn off the heat and cover the pan with a lid. Let it sit for 15 minutes then drain it and remove and discard the bones and skin. A messy job, and one of the few kitchen jobs for which I will put on a pair of Marigolds. Tip the salt cod into a food processor. Warm the milk (I use the steam nozzle on the coffee machine) and the olive oil separately. Peel and roughly chop the garlic and add it to the fish. Blitz gently, pouring in the milk and olive oil in a steady stream, letting the mixture whip to a sloppy cream. Remove the potatoes from the oven, cut them in half, scoop out the flesh with a teaspoon, then tip it into the salt cod. Blitz briefly to mix, then add the lemon juice, the chopped parsley leaves and a few grinds of the pepper mill. Pile the pur\u00e9e into the potato skins and return to the hot oven for 15 minutes. Baked potatoes with leeks and Fontina I say Fontina because that is what I had in the kitchen - it's a fondue cheese and melts sublimely, and doesn't overpower the leeks. Taleggio, another milky Italian, would be just fine, too. Serves 2. 2 medium-sized baking potatoes, about 350g each 2 or 3 medium-sized leeks 70g butter 90-120g Fontina, coarsely grated or Taleggio cut into thin slices Scrub the potatoes, then while they are still damp dust them lightly with salt and leave them to dry for a few minutes. Bake them at 200 C/gas mark 6 until the skin is crisp and the inside soft and fluffy - a matter of 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the variety of the potato. Half an hour or so before you expect the potatoes to be ready, start cooking the leeks. (It is worth remembering that baked potatoes are good natured, so a few minutes either way won't hurt.) Split the leeks in half, wash them thoroughly, then cut them into finger-thick slices. Melt half the butter in a heavy pan, add the leeks and let them cook, slowly and covered with a lid over a low heat, until they are soft and translucent. This will take longer than you might think, as much as 15 or 20 minutes to completely soften. An occasional stir will prevent them from browning. Split the potato in half and scoop the flesh into a mixing bowl, then drop in the leeks, the remaining butter and most of the cheese, and beat to a creamy mass with a wooden spoon or electric beater. Taste and season with salt and black pepper. Pile back into the skins, dot the last of the cheese over and return to the oven for a good 15 minutes until piping hot."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
