City can reach their first semi-final in any competition since 1981 if they beat Arsenal in the Carling Cuptomorrow. The alternative, however, is a grim prospect for Hughes on the back of a seven-match run of draws in the league that has exasperated the club's supporters, and with the daunting challenge of a visit from Chelsea, the Premier League leaders, to follow on Saturday. Hughes spoke to the chairman, Khaldoon Al Mubarak, today and reflected that the mood in Abu Dhabi was one of disappointment about the inability to build on an impressive start. \"That is the top and bottom of it,\" Hughes said. \"They are frustrated that these draws have not been turned into wins. We haven't been beaten in that run, but we haven't had enough wins and that's the frustration for everybody. I discuss it on a weekly basis with Khaldoon and will discuss it after the game as well.\" While Hughes appears to have the complete backing of the Abu Dhabi United Group, who have always been sympathetic to his requests for patience, there are also murmurs from the Middle East that the support is beginning to wane and that more was expected from their \u00a3250m outlay on players. \"I'm not surprised by the speculation,\" Hughes said of his own position. \"It's quite predictable, and something I've had to put up with ever since I came here. It's not something I lose sleep over. It's predictable when you have a run of results that are frustrating from our point of view.\" A win tomorrow could drastically change the outlook and City, looking for their first trophy since winning the League Cup in 1976, will play a full-strength side, in sharp contrast to Ars\u00e8ne Wenger's policy of using this competition to give younger players first-team experience. \"We haven't been in a domestic cup semi-final since 1981 and we want to change that,\" Hughes said. \"The motivation is there for everyone \u2013 to do something a City team hasn't done for many years.\" City, though, have been undermined by problems in defence and Hughes spoke of Kolo Tour\u00e9, the \u00a314m summer signing from Arsenal, \"struggling for form\". The same applies to some of the other big-money signings, most notably Joleon Lescott, while Emmanuel Adebayor's form has deteriorated since his three-match ban for stamping on Robin van Persie when the sides met in a 4-2 victory for City in September. \"He was playing outstandingly well before he went out of the team but he also got an injury when he came back, which has hampered him of late,\" Hughes said\"He's been playing with that for a number of games now so that has to be factored in.. \"Kolo has had a few injury problems, too, and at times he has been playing when he shouldn't. At times he should have been stronger with himself and said he's not right but because he's the captain he's always prepared to play. You can't criticise him for that.\" City were booed by their own supporters after Saturday's 1-1 draw against Hull City and Hughes and his backroom staff were verbally abused by supporters sitting close to the dug-outs. \"We should be in a better position than we actually are, so that frustration will obviously come out, but I think the supporters understand that it wasn't going to be an easy progression and rise, and that at times in the season we will struggle and things won't quite go for us. If that means the worse part of our season is now, we will take that.\" Manchester City (probable) (4-2-3-1): Given; Zabaleta, Tour\u00e9, Lescott, Bridge; De Jong, Barry; Wright-Phillips, Tevez, Robinho; Adebayor.
