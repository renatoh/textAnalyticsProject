It was valid until 1 December this year. Last month she tried to use it on its website but was told that without the original receipt this was not possible. I had thrown it away \u2013 who keeps receipts from a year ago? I contacted the store directly (no help), then the helpline (five times; twice they promised to call back but never did), then I sent a registered letter to customer relations (which they never replied to). When I finally made contact, the main issue is still the need to produce the receipt. Because I paid cash it cannot be traced via bank or credit card. I was not supplied with an e-receipt. The catalogue number has changed so it cannot be traced that way. I was not told at the time of purchase I must keep the receipt as it was essential for booking the spa day. The voucher just states that the only thing needed to book is the activation number printed on it, which, of course, we have (why can\u2019t Argos trace the transaction using this code?). I\u2019m left almost \u00a3100 out of pocket and my wife has threatened to leave me (joke!). PG, Crowborough, East Sussex These vouchers are on sale at numerous retailers, including Morrisons and Marks &amp; Spencer, as well as Argos, now owned by Sainsbury\u2019s. The company promises over 1,000 gift experiences from just \u00a310. However, when things go wrong, it becomes rather complicated as it means Argos is acting as an agent for (The) Activity Superstore Ltd which issues the voucher. We note online that others have complained of difficulties making contact with the company. Fortunately Argos/Sainsbury\u2019s stepped in quickly to sort this out after we made contact. Sainsbury\u2019s says: \u201cWe have apologised to PG for his experience and arranged a replacement voucher.\u201d This underlines the importance of getting a receipt if you pay cash.
