The hosts confront Lars Lagerback\u2019s side at the Stade de France without the suspended N\u2019Golo Kant\u00e9 and Adil Rami, but still as favourites to progress into a semi-final against Germany or Italy. Yet Iceland\u2019s startling progress, likened to that of Leicester City back in the Premier League, at their first major tournament has left the French wary before the teams\u2019 eagerly anticipated meeting. The demise of Hodgson\u2019s team in Nice has at least served as a warning for Les Bleus. \u201cI thought England would win because they have a young and talented team, and I\u2019m used to playing against most of them,\u201d Sagna said. \u201cBut, all the same, I was quite happy for this Iceland team because they gave England a lesson in dignity. Why didn\u2019t the English go through? I don\u2019t know. In football anything can happen in a game and, from what I saw, Iceland deserved it. It\u2019s not just one player with them who makes the difference. Their whole team will cause problems for us. \u201cI think, after the Euros, a lot of clubs will come in for their players because they\u2019ve shown they can play well, they can cope with the pressure and that they can cause teams problems. For a lot of people they\u2019re the surprise team of the tournament. They\u2019re a bit like the Leicester City of Euro 2016, but they totally deserve to be here and they showed in qualifying that they could beat good teams. They twice beat Holland, they beat the Czechs and finished top of their group. They\u2019re a quality team and you can\u2019t underestimate them. \u201cAnything can happen, but we\u2019ve been warned about them. They played well against Portugal in the group stage and now England in the knockout, so it\u2019s down to us to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen to us.\u201d Sagna, who has spent the past nine seasons at Arsenal and Manchester City, echoed his team-mate Patrice Evra\u2019s suggestion that England may have underestimated Iceland in Monday\u2019s last-16 tie. \u201cIt was a shock for the country because England are England,\u201d he said. \u201cI think a lot of people in England underestimated Iceland. After our match against the Republic of Ireland, most of the English journalists asked me about the France-England quarter-final, which shows that they were pretty confident. But they\u2019ve taken a good slap. \u201cThe criticism can be a bit harsh when you\u2019re a player. But, obviously, when there\u2019s a lot of expectation you have to accept it. With regards to the English system, I don\u2019t think they will change an enormous amount of things. The coach will change, obviously, because Roy Hodgson has left. But I think they will try and get back to basics and build a united team on the pitch, and to cope with pressure better as well.\u201d France, up to now, have dealt with the weight of expectation relatively well despite all their games having proved tight. Their progress has been secured with late wins both in the group stage \u2013 against Romania and Albania \u2013 and the knockout, where Antoine Griezmann\u2019s brace eventually beat the Irish in Lyon. The Iceland joint-manager Heimir Hallgrimsson has suggested Didier Deschamps\u2019 team could struggle with the pressure on Sunday because a loss \u201cwould be horrible for the French nation\u201d. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are particularly tense,\u201d Sagna said. \u201cYou can see that it\u2019s been difficult for everyone at this Euros, except for Germany. Maybe because we\u2019re the host side we\u2019ve put ourselves under a bit more pressure. The danger in this match is not only the Iceland team, but also ourselves because we know we\u2019re capable of playing really well, we\u2019re among the favourites and we have a status to defend. Maybe, we are trying too hard to do well. Perhaps that\u2019s holding us back. \u201cBut I\u2019m not worried. It\u2019s a good form of pressure we\u2019re under now. We had to play two years of friendlies which wasn\u2019t easy, and now we have a positive form of pressure. You see the images from the fan-zones when we score and it warms your heart. We have to use that.\u201d Deschamps is expected to start with Crystal Palace\u2019s Yohan Cabaye in Kant\u00e9\u2019s midfield berth, with Samuel Umtiti \u2013 who has agreed a \u00a322m move from Lyon to Barcelona \u2013 replacing the suspended Rami at the back. \u201cWe have players who play in big clubs, most of them are playing in the Champions League, so we have to start games better and impose ourselves from the outset,\u201d Sagna said. \u201cThe earlier we can make the difference the better. It will take the pressure off everyone. We have to be ready from the off, not at half-time. \u201cEveryone has to be aware that we\u2019ve had a little bit of luck to keep coming back every time. It won\u2019t work every time. But we want to go further than this. To stop in the quarter-finals would be a failure for me. We have the ability to go all the way and I\u2019m only thinking about the final. \u201cI\u2019m not thinking about defeat right now. I can\u2019t see myself going on holiday so early, I can\u2019t see myself letting the France fans down. We will prepare as well as possible, without underestimating them. But we believe in ourselves.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
