I\u2019m the first man, I think, and certainly the first ambassador to take surrogacy leave at the Foreign Office. It\u2019s a challenge fitting family life around representational duties. Half the time I\u2019ll do those on my own, and half the time Scott has to come with me. I\u2019m pretty strict that weekends are for family \u2013 it has to be the king, or the PM, or a visiting secretary of state to drag me out then. We are always on display as same-sex parents, not least because of the way our marriage in China was publicised. It took place in the ambassador\u2019s residence in Beijing, even though China doesn\u2019t recognise same-sex marriage. We have to stand up and be counted, not hide in a corner. Scott Chang, 38 The diplomatic partners who get it right are the ones who are able to hold on to their personality and be fully themselves while still representing their countries really well. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve quite figured out the balance yet. We don\u2019t need to be the last ones at the party, so we can come home and be with the kids for a while. The mornings have been surprisingly nice \u2013 it\u2019s not my favourite thing to wake up at 5.30am, but it means we have three hours\u2019 family time before we have to go to work. We often hold hands in public. Now that we\u2019ve got young kids, it may be that other people find it more relatable when they see a family unit, as opposed to just two men. \u2022 If you have a story to tell about who you live with, fill in this form and tell us a little about your set-up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
