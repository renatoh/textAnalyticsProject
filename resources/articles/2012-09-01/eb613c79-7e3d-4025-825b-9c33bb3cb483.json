At times it looks like a parade of celebs, but the film comes belatedly to the point when it discusses Corbijn's parents, particularly his late father, whose approval Anton sought but perhaps never quite got. The film has a tender, painful moment when Corbijn interviews his elderly mother, who discloses that she had been in love with someone else, and that the subsequent marriage to Anton's father was a kind of second-best. Then it is back to international hotel rooms, exhibitions, photo shoots, and stars. The hint of human anxiety behind the glamour is intriguing."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
