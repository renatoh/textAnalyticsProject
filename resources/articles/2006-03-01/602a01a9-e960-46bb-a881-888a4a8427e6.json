The EU says nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels need to stay below 40 micrograms per cubic metre of air. But Heathrow, Gatwick, Newcastle and Birmingham Airports exceed this recommendation by up to 75%, the report published by the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (CSP) showed. NO2 readings at Manchester, Liverpool, Blackpool, Sheffield, Humberside, London City, Southampton, Exeter and Gloucester Airports were up to 50% higher than the EU target, the CSP said. Respiratory physiotherapists say the consequences of being exposed to NO2 can be especially severe among people with existing lung conditions such as asthma, bronchitis and emphysema. CSP spokesman Professor Grahame Pope said: \"The effects of airport emissions on air quality and public health are of serious concern to physiotherapists. \"It's not just NO2 polluting the environment around airports; our study reveals high ozone concentrations at some sites too.\" He went on: \"There's no doubt that aircraft contribute to the problem, but it should be noted that cars, buses and taxis ferrying passengers to and from these sites are dominant sources of pollution. \"With cheap flights making air travel more affordable, several airports want to expand capacity. We would urge the government to consider ways of balancing passenger convenience with improving public health when looking at these (expansion) proposals.\" This table shows latest readings for levels of nitrogen dioxide in the air surrounding airports.
