Many smokers don\u2019t use as much nicotine as they should when trying to quit, says Leonie Brose, of King\u2019s College London\u2019s National Addiction Centre. \u201cThe general thing is not to be afraid of nicotine replacements. A patch is a good baseline, but you also need something that acts quickly when you get a craving.\u201d Try e-cigarettes If nicotine patches don\u2019t work, e-cigarettes are definitely worth a try. A recent study found them to be almost twice as effective at helping smokers quit. \u201cThere\u2019s that behavioural component, which some other medications for stopping smoking don\u2019t have,\u201d says Nicola Lindson, a behavioural medicine researcher at the University of Oxford. \u201cVaping gives people something to do with their hands and can help with the social element of smoking, too. We do still need more data on the safety of e-cigarettes, but we are pretty certain that they\u2019re a lot less bad for your health than smoking.\u201d Seek support National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines emphasise that behavioural support, not just pharmacotherapies, is crucial to successfully quitting smoking. Whether this comes in the form of family or friends, or counselling from your local Stop Smoking service, this can help give smokers a motivation to quit. Avoid triggers Every smoker has triggers that make them crave a cigarette. Aveyard says changing your daily routine to avoid those temptations is important in the early stages of quitting. \u201cPeople usually smoke in a very stereotyped manner, at particular times. If you can break those routines, then you will reduce the chances of giving in to temptation and allow your brain to recover.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/lifestyle", "pillarName": "Lifestyle"}}}
