It also said that the \u201clapping scummy froth\u201d seen in the film as soldiers wait by the surf\u2019s edge was caused by oil and snow; it was in fact natural sea foam (From the jaws of defeat, Nolan snatches a triumph, 18 July, page 11). \u2022 A TV review referred to the Paris Commune of 1971. That should have been the Paris Commune of 1871 (The weekend\u2019s TV, 24 July, page 17, G2). \u2022 Our obituary of John Heard (24 July, page 29) said the actor played Genevieve Page\u2019s son in the 1985 film The Trip to Bountiful. Heard played Ludie Watts, the son of Mrs Watts, who was actually played by Geraldine Page. \u2022 Other recently corrected articles include: Clint Dempsey\u2019s record goal helps USA past Costa Rica into Gold Cup final Porn warps culture.
