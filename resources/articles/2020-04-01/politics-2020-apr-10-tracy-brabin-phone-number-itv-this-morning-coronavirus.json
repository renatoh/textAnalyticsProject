The Labour MP for Batley and Spen, who is a former Coronation Street actor, appeared on the show to discuss funding being made available for MPs to cover the costs of closing their constituency offices. As she appeared via FaceTime, her phone number appeared across the top of the screen. The interview was then repeatedly interrupted as she started to receive calls to her mobile. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m getting calls at the moment,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is why it\u2019s dropping. Oh, there\u2019s another one.\u201d Brabin later wrote on Twitter: \u201cJust done This Morning and my phone number was posted on screen and I\u2019ve been inundated so will have to change my number. Please TEXT.\u201d One viewer tweeted: \u201cHer signal isn\u2019t bad, instead, her number was leaked live on TV and everyone is trying to call her.\u201d Another wrote: \u201cYou can\u2019t stop receiving calls during your FaceTime to This Morning because your phone number was broadcast so people rang it.\u201d Brabin, the former shadow culture secretary, appeared on the show to speak about the \u00a310,000 that is to be made available to MPs to cover their extra office costs incurred during the coronavirus pandemic. The money comes in addition to the \u00a326,000 MPs can claim to cover office costs and is designed to be used by MPs and their staff to buy equipment \u2013 such as laptops and printers \u2013 so they can work from home. The host Eamonn Holmes told Brabin: \u201cYou might need it [the extra money] for a new computer or wifi there because your signal is dropping out.\u201d He later apologised for the error. \u201cThere is something I want to refer to, a quick word about an item in the programme at the start of the programme today,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was an interview with the Labour MP Tracy Brabin, and some of you will have noticed a technical error during that transmission and we want to say sincere regret and we are very sorry to Tracy for any stress or trouble that that may have caused.\u201d A spokeswoman for This Morning said: \u201cIt was a technical error, which was swiftly rectified.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
