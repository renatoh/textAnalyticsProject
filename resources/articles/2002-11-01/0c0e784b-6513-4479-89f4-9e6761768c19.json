The best of the new-wave Alpine hostelries are lovingly constructed from old wood and stone, with balconies spilling over with spring flowers at the end of the season. When you step inside, the focal point is a roaring log fire, with wooden beams, rugs and cushions adding to the atmosphere. Self-catering seems a sensible way of cutting the cost of a ski holiday, but most of us are put off by the lack of size and the limited facilities of the ubiquitous French apartment. However, what is largely unknown is that a genre of superior rental apartment also exists. At this level, you can expect to find accommodation that is on a par with a good chalet or hotel, with aesthetically pleasing decoration, a high ratio of baths to bedrooms, and an efficiently equipped kitchen. Hotels Les Fermes du Hameau Albert 1er, Chamonix, France Two meticulously restored 18th-century farmhouses in the grounds of the hotel Le Hameau Albert 1er.

Hotel Hermitage, Cervinia, Italy Set among the pine trees above the resort, The Hermitage looks like an over-large chalet from the outside. It has the relaxed atmosphere of a family home, and an exquisite collection of antique alpine drawings adorn the walls. In the entrance hall, an enormous log fire is always burning, and the 17th-century floor was reclaimed from an alpine hut. The bedrooms are extremely light and some have 18th-century fireplaces.
