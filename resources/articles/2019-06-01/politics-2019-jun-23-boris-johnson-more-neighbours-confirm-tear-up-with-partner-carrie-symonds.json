Tom Penn went public on Saturday as the neighbour who had recorded the argument in the early hours of Friday morning. He said he had dialled 999 because he had been \u201cfrightened and concerned for the welfare of those involved\u201d. Penn, who has lived in his south London flat with his wife for just over a year, said he contacted the police only as a last resort after knocking three times at the couple\u2019s front door. The Guardian\u2019s revelation that police were called to the flat following the altercation have has shaken Johnson\u2019s Tory leadership campaign. The frontrunner repeatedly dodged questions about the incident during a televised hustings on Saturday. Symonds can be heard on Penn\u2019s recording telling Johnson, 55, to \u201cget off me\u201d and \u201cget out of my flat\u201d. Another neighbour who heard the row, Earl McDermott, was reported as saying: \u201cIt was a proper tear-up. Glasses being smashed, screaming and a lot of arguing. I thought someone was being murdered.\u201d Nursery worker Fatimah, also a neighbour, backed up Penn\u2019s account. \u201cThere was a lot of shouting, a lady was screaming and I could hear glasses or plates being thrown quite a few times,\u201d she said. \u201cThe man was shouting back. I could hear it through my walls. It was obvious the lady was angry. She was screaming hysterically.\u201d Fatimah had earlier told another newspaper she had considered calling the police herself before officers arrived at the scene. Her husband, Imran, added that his wife had been frightened by the incident. The Times reported that Johnson\u2019s 1995 Toyota Previa people carrier, which had three parking tickets and a mocking flyer on its windscreen, had been parked outside the flat before being driven away. Another neighbour told the newspaper: \u201cIt\u2019s got loads of parking tickets on it. He just leaves it here. He doesn\u2019t care.\u201d Some Sunday newspapers have sought to paint Penn and his wife as \u201cleftwing neighbours\u201d. The Mail on Sunday highlighted the \u00a3720,000 cost of the \u201cremain-backing\u201d couple\u2019s \u201cluxurious\u201d flat. In a statement released on Saturday night, Penn explained the extent of his involvement in politics was voting remain in the EU referendum, and that he had acted out of concern for \u201cthe welfare and safety of our neighbours\u201d. Penn said: \u201cOnce clear that no one was harmed, I contacted the Guardian, as I felt it was of important public interest. I believe it is reasonable for someone who is likely to become our next prime minister to be held accountable for all of their words, actions and behaviours. \u201cI, along with a lot of my neighbours all across London, voted to remain within the EU. That is the extent of my involvement in politics. \u201cThe unpleasant things being said about myself and my partner, and some quite frankly bizarre and fictitious allegations, have been upsetting for not only us, but also for family, friends and fellow Camberwell neighbours, who are being harangued by the media. I would ask that you leave private citizens alone and focus instead on those who have chosen to run for power within the public eye. \u201cThe attempts from some areas of the press to instead focus their stories on us, and in particular my wife, have been eye-opening, and very alarming. I would encourage anyone to record any instances where they feel concerned for another person\u2019s safety.\u201d Penn also explained that he had overheard the row when he took delivery of a takeaway at his flat. \u201cOn the way back into my flat, it became clear that the shouting was coming from a neighbour\u2019s flat. It was loud enough and angry enough that I felt frightened and concerned for the welfare of those involved, so I went inside my own home, closed the door, and pressed record on the voice memos app on my phone. \u201cAfter a loud scream and banging, followed by silence, I ran upstairs, and with my wife agreed that we should check on our neighbours. I knocked three times at their front door, but there was no response. I went back upstairs into my flat, and we agreed that we should call the police.\u201d Scotland Yard said in a statement: \u201cAt 00.24 on Friday 21 June, police responded to a call from a local resident in [south London]. The caller was concerned for the welfare of a female neighbour. \u201cPolice attended and spoke to all occupants of the address, who were all safe and well. There were no offences or concerns apparent to the officers and there was no cause for police action.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
