Even if the commission cannot support every case, it will give preliminary advice to everyone who applies for help. The commission's complaints officers are not automatically your representatives. Only if and when the commission makes a firm offer of legal assistance, will it act as your representative. It is important to get advice from the commission as soon as possible after the incident you wish to complain about. In general you have only three months in which to complain to an industrial tribunal and six months to complain to a county (or sheriff) court. If you have applied to the commission for assistance you are allowed an extra month to get your complaint in.

The equality commission for Northern Ireland is responsible to the office of the first minister and the deputy first minister of the Northern Ireland assembly. What grounds do you have to complain? The Race Relations Act 1976 (RRA) applies to England, Wales and Scotland, but not Northern Ireland. The Race Relations Act (Northern Ireland), based on the 1976 Act, became law in 1997. The Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 specifically prohibits discrimination by public authorities and the police. The RRA makes it unlawful to discriminate against another person because of their race, colour, nationality, or ethnic or national origin. It recognises that racial discrimination can occur in such areas as employment; education; housing; advertising; and the provision of goods, services and facilities, but does not make it a criminal offence. It gives individuals the right to take legal action either at an industrial tribunal (for employment matters) or at a designated county court (sheriff court, in Scotland) if they think they have been discriminated against. The CRE has statutory powers under the RRA, including the authority to: \u0095 advise or assist people with complaints about racial discrimination, harassment or abuse \u0095 conduct formal investigations of companies and organisations where there is evidence of possible discrimination. If the investigation does find discrimination, CRE can oblige the organisation to change the way it operates \u0095 take legal action against racially discriminatory advertisements, and against organisations that attempt to pressurise or instruct others to discriminate - such as employers instructing employment agencies not to send them applicants from ethnic minorities, or companies instructing their workers to discriminate in the way they provide goods or services Article 14 of The Human Rights Act 1998 also protects freedom from discrimination on the grounds of race. Will you get a fair hearing? The CRE receives a grant from the home office and the home office appoints all of its 15 commissioners (their details are published on the CRE website). However, CRE's work is undertaken independently of government. The CRE will advise and/or represent you, but has no power to rule on whether discrimination has occurred - this is for the employment tribunal or court to decide. What will happen if you are successful? Employment tribunal cases If you win, the tribunal can order compensation to be paid to you. The amount may include a sum for lost earnings and benefits and a sum for injury to feelings. There is no ceiling to the amount a tribunal can award, although it will normally follow guidelines and precedents from previous cases. If you win, the tribunal can also recommend that your employer take certain steps to enable you to work without further discrimination. County court and sheriff court cases If you win, the court can order compensation to be paid to you. The amount may include a sum to compensate you for any losses and a sum for injury to feelings. There is no ceiling to the compensation that a court can award, but awards tend to be lower than those made by tribunals. What else can you do? You or the employer can appeal against an employment tribunal's decision to the employment appeal tribunal, but only on a point of law. You have 42 days to lodge an appeal. Appeal cases are eligible for legal aid.

Very occasionally the EOC will be able to represent you in court, and pay your costs. Once you have decided to take legal action, don't delay. There are various time limits - sometimes as little as three months from the date of the incident you want to complain about - within which you must make your complaint. Sexual harrassment at work may amount to sex discrimination, in which case you will be able to complain to an industrial tribunal. Serious sexual harassment may constitute unlawful assault; indecent assault in particular is a serious criminal offence. What grounds do you have for complaint? The Sex Discrimination Act 1975 makes it unlawful for a member of one sex to be treated less favourably than a member of the other simply because of their sex. The act recognises that sex discrimination can occur in such areas as employment; education; housing; advertising; goods, services and facilities, but does not make it a criminal offence. It gives individuals the right to take legal action either at an industrial tribunal (for employment matters) or at a designated county court (sheriff court, in Scotland) if they think they have been discriminated against. Under the Equal Pay Act 1970, women are entitled to equal pay with men (and vice versa) when doing work that is the same or broadly similar and, under the amended act, to equal pay for work of equal value. Will you get a fair hearing? The EOC does not adjudicate on discrimination cases, but offers advice and occasionally legal aid. What will happen if you are successful? You may get an apology and/or financial compensation. What else can you do? Contact Liberty for legal advice: 21 Tabard Street, London SE1 4LAX (Tel: 020 7378 8659) Email: Info@liberty-human-rights.org.uk (see above). If you experience discrimination at work, redress can be sought through an employment tribunal. You must make your case within three months of the discrimination having taken place.

Working in partnership with existing bodies, its functions include: \u0095 acting as a central source of advice on the rights of disabled people \u0095 helping disabled people secure their rights and eliminating discrimination \u0095 promoting equalisation of opportunities for disabled people with those of non-disabled people \u0095 promoting good practice and working effectively with business, the public and voluntary sectors Assistance may take the form of legal advice and/or representation, efforts to settle the dispute, negotiation on your behalf, or any other assistance that the DRC thinks appropriate. If you experience discrimination at work you can take the case to an employment tribunal, provided you do this within three months of the incident. There are no restrictions based on length of service and there is no limit to the amount of compensation. What grounds do you have to complain? The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 makes it unlawful for someone to be discriminated against on the grounds of disability in the field of employment. It also enshrines the right of disabled access to goods and services, including premises. The government has set minimum access criteria for new public transport vehicles, and requires schools, colleges and universities to provide information to disabled people about the accessibility of their facilities. More details of your rights under the act are available from the DRC . The employment section of the act and the goods and services provisions came into operation in December 1996. The remaining areas will come into force over a 10-year period. Will you get a fair hearing? The DRC consists of 15 commissioners, appointed by the secretary of state through a process involving independent assessment. Ten of the commissioners are disabled. They represent a wide range of interests within the disabled and wider community. Details are available from the DRC What will happen if you are successful? Redress depends on the nature of the initial dispute. The issue may be resolved through conciliation, resolution of the problem or a financial award. What else can you do? For discrimination in the workplace, the advisory, conciliation and arbitration service (ACAS) (or in Northern Ireland the labour relations agency) has a nation-wide network of public enquiry points which answer queries on employment law and related issues. ACAS can arrange for a conciliation officer to help you and your employer settle any potential or actual tribunal claim. The telephone numbers of all ACAS offices are in the telephone directory. The employment tribunal service (ETS) can provide information about tribunal publications, how the tribunal system works and answer general queries about tribunal matters (Tel: 0345 959 775). Contact your local Citizens Advice Bureau, law centre or solicitor for help and advice on your legal rights. Useful Links Disability rights Disability rights commission Links for disabled people The ACAS Discrimination on other grounds Article 14 of the Article 14 of The Human Rights Act 1998 makes it illegal for you to be discriminated against on the basis of: sex, race, colour, language, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with national minority, property, birth, other status (this includes, for example sexuality, marital status, illegitimacy, trade union membership, military status and conscientious objection). Age discrimination There is currently no legislation in the UK to protect older workers from employer prejudice. However, some cases have been brought against individual employers under the headings of \"human rights\" and \"unfair dismissal\" and under the legislative rules of the equal opportunities commission. Almost all of these have been settled out of court.
