Both sides created chances in the first half, but Reading stepped it up in the second and deserved their win. It was a scruffy goal, and ironic that out of all the chances they created they scored with one of their worst. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Brian Howard pulled the strings on his return to Oakwell. Our best player was goalkeeper Luke Steele, with an uncharacteristic mistake from Nathan Doyle gifting Reading their goal. Adam Brammer, Observer reader Bristol City 2-0 Burnley Was it a good match? This was a very good win. Burnley have proved themselves in the last few weeks to not be a bad side, so it's very nice to get the three points. Particularly in the second half we came out and dominated, playing really well. I was expecting more from Burnley because Eddie Howe's teams generally play good football, but they seemed to lack ambition today. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Albert Adomah was unplayable at times, especially in creating the first goal. A howler from Clarke Carlisle gave us the second goal. Their best player was probably Jack Cork, but he was taken off after an hour. Rich Brown, OTIB.co.uk Crystal Palace 2-2 Derby County Was it a good match? Glad to get a draw in the end, especially after teams below us picked up points too. At one stage it looked liked we'd lose 2-1 but Darren Ambrose converted a penalty two minutes from the end for the equaliser. We created our best opportunities in the first half. Derby aren't one of the best teams to have visited Selhurst this season. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Defender Dean Moxey, playing against his old club, did well and scored a great goal. James Vaughan is always tenacious, while fellow midfielder Neil Danns was involved in most of our best moves. Peter Guntrip, Holmesdale.net Doncaster Rovers 0-1 QPR Was it a good match? This was a real anticlimax. I was expecting a skilful game between these teams but both were low in quality. You could tell that both sides wanted to play some football but neither were able to. One piece of quality from QPR led to the goal but they were disappointing on the whole. Their fans were very impressive though. I still think we need a few more points to make doubly sure of avoiding the drop. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Franck Moussa looked busy and always wanted the ball, but James Coppinger had a rare bad day. For QPR Wayne Routledge was full of endeavour and was good to watch. Chris Rumley, Observer reader Hull City 1-1 Norwich City Was it a good match? Hull had the best of the first half and Norwich shaded the second, which was a bit topsy-turvy as they scored in the opening period while we scored in the second half. We created most of the chances. Norwich didn't seem to be adventurous once a goal up, which was surprising given how well they had played before they scored. I don't think we'll make the play-offs. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Liam Rosenior is easily the best signing anyone has made this season \u2013and he cost nothing . Rick Skelton, HullCityOnline.com Ipswich Town 2-0 Scunthorpe United Was it a good match? The chance of a record fourth home defeat on the trot was easily avoided as we outclassed Scunthorpe. We almost scored in the second minute and continued to dominate from then. Scunthorpe didn't look very special and I can see why they're down in the relegation zone, but they kept going and didn't look downhearted. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Jimmy Bullard and Lee Martin linked up really well for us on the right. The referee had an appalling game, he was totally inconsistent and out of his depth. Luckily the result wasn't affected by him, though. Julian Watkins, TractorBoys.com Leicester City 0-1 Portsmouth Was it a good match? Pompey had little difficulty in doing the double against a labouring City side who were lucky to concede only one goal, Joel Ward missing an absolute sitter in the closing minutes. The Portsmouth goal \u2013 a failure by the Leicester keeper and centre backs to clear a long throw \u2013 illustrated our lack of aerial power and physicality in general. All talk of making the play-offs is simply hot air. Who played well/who had a nightmare? The spine of the Pompey team was very solid and it was easy to see how they've kept seven clean sheets in eight games. David's Nugent and Kitson were streets ahead of their City counterparts. Eddie Blount, Observer reader Middlesbrough 2-1 Watford Was it a good match? Everybody came to the game thinking Danny Graham was going to score against his old club and he didn't disappoint, scoring his 25th goal of the season. But Boro hit back to win a game that we totally dominated, the winner coming from our own 'ex-man' Andrew Taylor who had been on loan at Watford this season. Boro were clearly dominant and we can now feel happy going into the international break with a nine-point gap clear of the relegation zone. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Malky Mackay was banished to the stands for kicking the ball on the pitch. Robert Nichols, FMTTM.com Millwall 3-3 Cardiff City Was it a good match? The second half was probably the most entertaining I've seen this season. The opening 45 minutes was dominated by Cardiff and we never really got the ball out of our own half. But we improved considerably after the interval, even through it came at the expense of our ability to defend. At times we looked clumsy. I'm surprised the game ended in a draw as, with their front line, they always look dangerous. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Chris Burke and Craig Bellamy were extremely impressive for the visitors. Stephen Bywater was shocking. Hameur Bouazza had a good game off the bench for Millwall. Charlie Mahoney, Observer reader Preston North End 2-1 Coventry City Was it a good match? Preston have started to play much better and got on top for the first half hour. We scored on 24 minutes after a good team move to take a 1-0 lead into half-time. The second half we reverted to bad habits, though, and allowed Coventry to equalise. It looked as though it would end in a disappointing 1-1 draw, but up popped Nathan Ellington to flick in a volley from just inside the penalty area on 90 minutes. An unstoppable shot. It's a shame Phil Brown wasn't here a few weeks earlier. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Iain Hume for his running and goal was my MOTM. Geoff Ollerton, PSG.me.uk Sheffield United 2-0 Leeds United Was it a good match? It was a great win from United who dominated throughout with very little reply from Leeds. Obviously we hope that the result helps our form to get us out of the bottom three. It was also positive to see goals being scored from open play \u2013 even though one was an own goal. Considering their league position the visitors were very disappointing \u2013 I expected them to come out all guns blazing. Who played well/who had a nightmare? The whole team played well but I'd give the MOTM award to defender Matt Lowton. Mention also goes to Sam Vokes whose loan spell has ended. Paul Holland, Blades-Mad.co.uk Swansea City 3-2 Nottingham Forest Was it a good match? A vital win. The Swans started really brightly and scored two early goals, which was pleasing because our recent performances have been disappointing. I think Scott Sinclair went passed at least five players for the first goal. Forest are a strong side and made it difficult for us but we battled well and held on at the end. We should have had the game won before then. Who played well/who had a nightmare? Two former Chelsea forwards, namely Sinclair and the on -loan Fabio Borini, were outstanding.
