Combat is predominantly at close quarters, with improvised weapons giving out midway through scraps, lending its running battles a claustrophobic, panicky edge that's only temporarily dispelled by a powerful weapon. Co-op mode is marred by minor irritants, which is a shame given its ability to help you seem slightly less alone on a mostly brain-hungry Banoi Island. Deep Silver, \u00a337.90-\u00a344.95 El Shaddai: Ascension Of The Metatron, Xbox &amp; PS3 With an indecipherable plot based on the biblical Book of Enoch and continually changing, often psychedelic graphics, El Shaddai looks like no other game, even if playing it feels a bit more familiar. If you were being curmudgeonly, you could say it boils down to wandering between button-mashing fights, trying to avoid holes and enjoying soup\u00e7ons of insane dialogue. What elevates it is the constant spectacle, shifting between 2D and 3D; a moving Japanese painting one minute and a Tron-style, neon re-imagining of tribal artworks the next. It's a constant delight and stokes the impetus to discover the next staggering vista. Konami, \u00a334.99-\u00a344.95 Bodycount, Xbox &amp; PS3 You're a nameless asset working for the Network, pitted against baddies referred to as the Target, on missions that involve finding someone by way of a slew of henchmen and killing them, thereby dismissing all pretence at plot or characterisation. That leaves the action, the majority of which takes place in the dusty confines of shanty towns, replete with shacks to blow up using convenient explosive barrels. The legions of armed militia there prove to be an excitable foe, keeping battles dynamic by trying to flush you out with volleys of grenades. Guns feel heavy and randomly destructive, adding to the sense of chaos in the hectic, often 360-degree firefights. Codemasters, \u00a327.99-\u00a344.95 Games news This year's Eurogamer Expo (Earls Court, SW5, Thu to 25 Sep) promises to be the biggest by some margin. Along with tournaments, a games career fair and the retro zone, you can also have a go at forthcoming games including: space opera Mass Effect 3; Battlefield 3's spectacular multiplayer shooting action; more mildly deviant survival horror in Silent Hill: Downpour; and Dark Souls, a contender for hardest game of all time \u2026 In an unlikely literary videogame tie-in, Rage the novel is now available, although you'll have to wait until next month to play the game itself \u2026 Other games out now include Avatar Kinect, which lets you create real-time gesture-controlled puppet shows; Rock Of Ages, where you splatter swathes of human history under a large boulder; and Warhammer 40000: Space Marine which controversially turns the famous tabletop strategy game into an action-heavy third person hack and shoot 'em-up."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
