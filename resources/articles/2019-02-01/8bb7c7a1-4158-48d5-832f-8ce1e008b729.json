The League Two side outclassed Middlesbrough, 56 places above them in the football pyramid, to reach the fifth round for the first time since 1948-49 and earn another payday, with Flynn admitting that Cup success over the past two years has made his hometown club more than \u00a32m, revenue that will help secure the club\u2019s future. Newport, who started this season\u2019s Cup run against Metropolitan Police FC, overcame Leicester in the previous round and took Tottenham to a fourth-round replay after beating Leeds last season. \u201cWe have had Mauricio Pochettino, Claude Puel, Thomas Christiansen, they are all fantastic managers but this is the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me,\u201d Flynn said. \u201cHe [Pep] is a master, somebody that I just idolise and probably the best in the business, along with J\u00fcrgen Klopp, because I am a Liverpool fan. \u201cI\u2019ve been very nervous about this, not because of the game because I knew what it meant for the whole football club, the whole city. These supporters deserve everything because these supporters have been through the mill. It\u2019s a club that I love. What this means to this football club is absolutely huge.\u201d Flynn, who did his Uefa pro licence with Mikel Arteta, said the City assistant was among those to get in touch after the victory. \u201cMikel has just messaged me good luck and said: \u2018See you soon.\u2019 Knowing how good Pep is, I\u2019m sure they will cope with that pitch. That\u2019s something for them to worry about. I know we try and play football in the right way. We passed the ball a lot in tough conditions and they will do the same. \u201cI should have gone to a kids\u2019 party on Sunday but I decided to watch Manchester City and Arsenal. But I wish I hadn\u2019t because they were absolutely breathtaking. We are going to have to be prepared \u2013 I might play nine at the back.\u201d Of the financial implications, he added: \u201cWe have to stick to our budgets and things like that but this secures the financial future for the next few years.\u201d Tony Pulis, meanwhile, criticised his side\u2019s poor performance on his return to south Wales. \u201cThey were the better team, they ran all over us,\u201d the Middlesbrough manager said. \u201cIt was men against boys. Forget the conditions, you have to match people and that\u2019s the real disappointment. \u201cI\u2019m desperately disappointed for us and for the club but you have to give them a lot of credit and they get a great game now against Manchester City. I think Pep [Guardiola] will be hoping and praying the conditions are not like this [raining] when they turn up.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
