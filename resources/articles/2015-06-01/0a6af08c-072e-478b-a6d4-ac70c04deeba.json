My introduction to Chris Judd, though sadly less poetic, was equally vivid. We attended the same school and his reputation preceded him. The ear benders, coat tuggers and clipboard wielders were unanimous \u2013 this kid was in a different orbit. And indeed he was, playing out of the goal-square with two, then three and finally four opponents hanging off him. The teenage Judd was the biggest of fish in the smallest of ponds. Conserving energy and avoiding injury seemed to be his priorities. Occasionally, he deigned to get out of second gear. But when the ball hit the ground in his vicinity, the mouthguard flashed and the eyeballs whitened. You heard the authoritative thump of ball on boot and you saw the future. If you were willing to overlook the wallpapered shoulders, everything about him screamed professional footballer. Draft prospects rarely come so ready-made. Even the most iridescent talents tend to be half-formed. They\u2019re barrel-chested but chicken-legged. They have all the tricks but eschew hard work. They can read the game but drift in and out of it. They sprout muscles in all the wrong places, cultivating physiques for Schoolies Week, rather than centre-square stoppages. Another member of that side was truer to type. Brendan Goddard looked like a primary schooler \u2013 mop-headed, all arms and legs, hurl and burl. He would chastise himself, backchat umpires and blow his top at team-mates. He would chase the ball like it owed him cash. The skills were there. The poise would come later. Some champions \u2013 Brereton, Ditterich and Coleman spring to mind \u2013 swing into league football on a chandelier. Thirty minutes into his career, Judd resembled a 100-gamer. Coaching against him, Mick Malthouse knew he\u2019d seen something special. \u201cThey\u2019ve unearthed another one haven\u2019t they?\u201d he said. \u201cJesus\u2026.\u201d Every decade or so, a player emerges who represents a seismic shift in the game. Anthony Koutofides, with his video-game athleticism, was one. Judd immediately typified an era that merged total professionalism with unprecedented media saturation. We knew everything and gleaned nothing. We knew his Tertiary Entrance Rank, his vertical leap and his favourite Sopranos character. We added a Y to his surname. But he never stood revealed. His newspaper columns were suitably left of centre but offered few clues. At night, Rebecca Judd told us whether to take an umbrella to work. Yet her husband remained elusive. In his footballing autumn, he was as unknowable as ever. When his coach broached the subject of his retirement last year, there was a curious lack of warmth, perhaps befitting the era, perhaps the coach, perhaps the player. Few footballers were more admired. But we didn\u2019t get mushy about Chris Judd. There were no \u201cWe Love Juddy\u201d t-shirts at his retirement press conference. Perhaps he was too perfect, too aloof. He\u2019s never seemed sufficiently enamoured with being a footballer, a treasonable offence in these parts. There was an urgency to removing the halo, to shrivelling him to mortal proportions. There had to be a Cousins or a Carey lurking in there, surely. Whether chicken winging or allegedly eye gouging he found himself an unlikely figure of opprobrium. To his eternal credit, he looked like he couldn\u2019t give seven stuffs what we thought of him. He remains a strangely hard sell. If you took a footy neophyte from say, Antwerp, and sought to explain the appeal of the modern generation of superstars, the careers of Franklin, Ablett and Goodes would be easy to summarise. Judd is trickier. It\u2019s a career of two distinct yet equally fruitful halves \u2013 pre and post groin injury; with hair and without; east and west of the Nullarbor. For a player of sustained excellence, he is perhaps best explained in terms of short bursts. When it came to imposing himself on a game \u2013 a half here, 10 minutes of monstering there \u2013 few midfielders in football history can touch him. You think of his five first-half goals at the Gabba, where shots came out of packs like arrows from a bow, laying waste to some of the most flint-hearted defenders in the game. There\u2019s the opening quarter of the 2005 grand final, the free-for-all with Adam Goodes in the 2006 qualifying final, the third quarter of the 2010 final at the SCG, the second half of the 2013 elimination final against Richmond. He was blessed with that rare ability to play on a slow burn, yet turn up the wick and tilt things his team\u2019s way when the situation demanded it. It didn\u2019t look particularly easy in the end. He no longer slalomed past opponents. The crisp, 400-metre runner didn\u2019t make the trip east. He became a heavy haulage player. The grimace was more pronounced. When he won possession, he gripped the ball like he was rescuing it from a fire. Even at rest, he stalked the boundary line, sucking in exaggerated breaths, sipping from a water bottle in each hand, preparing to reload. For a man who was nauseous before big games, he still cut a figure of the utmost self-belief. In many ways, the Carlton theme song provided the perfect musical accompaniment \u2013 a slow build, a whiff of arrogance. Indeed, his was always an aristocratic game. It\u2019s impossible to imagine him running around in the lower grades. It would be like Baryshnikov bobbing up at Dracula\u2019s Theatre Restaurant. He\u2019ll never be dragooned into coaching. It would be insulting for him to be crammed into the commentary box. It\u2019s probably for the best. We sometimes expect them to be secular saints, fonts of all wisdom, mountains of magnificence. But ultimately, they are what they do. And few, in our lifetime, did it better than Judd."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
