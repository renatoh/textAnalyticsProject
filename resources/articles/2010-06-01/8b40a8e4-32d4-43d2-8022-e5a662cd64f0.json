But it's early days, and old habits die hard. We are doing away with the government cars, said the PM with a flourish, yet there was Caroline Spelman caught swanning around in an official car on her way to a tennis match. And who was that being dropped off from a swish limmo on Monday at the Institute for Civil Engineers for the Liberty summer party? None other than Dominic Grieve, the attorney general. Maybe he was rushing from another appointment. Perhaps his bike had a puncture. But the venue was 10 minutes' walk from parliament. Doesn't look good. \u2022 Yes, they start with good intentions, and one such was transparency. But in its embrace of the new politics, the taxpayer-owned international development fund CDC, formerly the Commonwealth Development Corporation, last night drew inspiration from the old ways to deal with criticism from Private Eye and its journalist Richard Brooks. Can't have him ruining our annual development review launch event, they said. And so they banned him from attending. He planned to go anyway, and hand out copies of his own scathing annual review of the CDC to the invited worthies. Hope it didn't put them off their nibbles. \u2022 There has been shock and then anger. Now we see from the Labour leadership debates that it is proving quite cathartic for former colleagues to get stuck into Gordon Brown. I didn't agree with him on the Iraq war, they say. I didn't agree with him on tax. And we see the latest to avail himself of this particular therapy is Bob Ainsworth, the former defence secretary. Gordon was \"difficult to work with. Impossible really,\" he tells the Birmingham Post. But we must put this context because he, too, is suffering. \"He reckons to have typically worked 17-hour days when running the country's armed forces, and now finds the things that most of us would take for granted bemusing,\" the paper says. \"He has accepted an invitation to promote Coventry's defence-related industries at Farnborough, but without a ministerial backup team on hand to sort out the travel arrangements, he hasn't a clue how to get there.\" Farnborough is close to the M3, apparently. But how to find the M3? \u2022 Yes shock and then anger, and it is particularly acute among those MPs who feel they were swept out of their seats on a tide of Ashcroft money. We hear too little about Lord Ashcroft these days. Now his placeman is prime minister, to what extent does he hold sway? An aggrieved correspondent tells us he has wondered about this and therefore rang the BBC to find out what has happened to the Panorama investigation into the peer that was said to have been postponed until after the election. This is after the election, our correspondent pointed out. Where is it? What's the plan? There is no plan, he was told, certainly nothing in the schedule, but then it is worth remembering that they never did specify which election the programme would follow. There's another in five years. \u2022 Ex-ministers have problems; broadcasters have problems. We all have problems. Blogging, as he does prolifically, Alastair Campbell shares his. \"When I tweeted that the annoyance at the vuvuzela was becoming more annoying than the annoyance caused by the vuvuzela, I was castigated by the anti-vuvuzelans as a pro-vuvuzelan crusader who therefore deserved to have them played outside my bedroom window as I tried to sleep.\" For all that, forces loyal to the vuvuzela do seem to having the better of things. With Alastair now handling the media for the pro-vuvuzelians, can anyone doubt that they'll win? \u2022 Finally, it was clear that the World Cup clash between North Korea and Brazil was much more than a game. The Brazilians needed the points to justify their status as favourites. And anyone who saw the North Korean player weeping at the outset will have recognised that his team was playing for the highest of stakes. As they fell behind, the comedian and writer David Schneider observed on Twitter that \"the only way North Korea can win this now is to go nuclear.\" Thankfully Kim Jong-il elected to lose with good grace."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
