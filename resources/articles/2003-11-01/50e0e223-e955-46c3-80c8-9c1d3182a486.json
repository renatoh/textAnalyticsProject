Ms Kevill, who is currently heading the BBC's political initiative, will take up her new BBC World job on Monday. The year-long politics review led to flagship Sunday programme On the Record being replaced by The Politics Show, fronted by Jeremy Vine. BBC2's Westminster politics show Despatch box was also dropped in favour of new BBC1 format The Week. The BBC attempted to attract a younger audience with Weekend, a Saturday morning BBC2 show fronted by Rod Liddle that was axed after one series. A new BBC2 Saturday current affairs and politics show, The Sharp End with Clive Anderson, produced by Bob Geldof's company Ten Alps, is now on air. \u00b7 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email editor@mediatheguardian.com or phone 020 7239 9857"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
