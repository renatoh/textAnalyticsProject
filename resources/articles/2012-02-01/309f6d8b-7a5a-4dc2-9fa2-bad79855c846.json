The Marx Brothers? Their fraternity wasn't part of the shtick. The Chuckle Brothers? Let's not go there. It's a huge gap in the market \u2013 into which sisters Sarah and Lizzie Daykin have stepped, with an act that reaps cinder-black humour from the currents of love and abuse that flow between siblings. It's all hilariously inappropriate, and you can't help wondering about the real-life relationship that produced it. Are true words being spoken in this malicious jest? The answer is yes \u2013 but to what extent? Sarah and Lizzie may not be the right people to ask. Sarah, 27, is a drama graduate whose career was flatlining until this sibling double act, called Toby, was formed. (The name derived from a game the sisters played, in which it was decided that if Lizzie were a boy, she'd be called Toby.) At the same time, Lizzie, three years her junior, was \"actually not doing anything with my life\". Having grown up in Kent, they were living together in London and both working full-time in a call centre (they still do). \"We literally had no point to our lives,\" says Sarah. \"We had hit rock bottom.\" A trip to a sketch-comedy night prompted the pair to form Toby. \"We had no idea what we were doing,\" says Sarah. \"The stuff we started writing was a lot more gross than we expected,\" adds Lizzie. Their act lays bare the mutual resentments of both the traditional double-act dynamic, and of siblings generally. The conceit is that Sarah is a stagestruck ego-on-legs, a mummy-and-daddy's girl desperate to be \"the name on everybody's lips\". Lizzie is her near-mute doormat-cum-carer, a reluctant performer bullied into chaperoning big sis toward stardom. In their current show, Lucky, they deploy the tools of reality comedy \u2013 video interviews with their actual parents, home-movie footage, a deadpan documentary style \u2013 to create a morbidly funny portrait of two sisters trying to perform sketches, and inadvertently letting their emotional wounds bleed all over the stage. \"Obviously,\" says Sarah, \"our on-stage relationship is \u2013\" Lizzie butts in: \"Heightened.\" Lizzie is nothing like the wallflower she plays on stage, apparently, and Sarah is no diva. \"But we have been utterly horrible to each other in the past,\" admits the latter. \"We spent half our childhood beating each other up. The other half would [involve] playing, going into character for hours and living in fantasy identities.\" Their show draws on those infant experiences and on others that started as tragedy and are staged as farce. In Toby's first show, says Sarah, \"we had a sketch where we acted out our parents' divorce\". Their family, it seems, have an ambivalent relationship with their act. \"Mum's always trying to get us to remove certain lines,\" says Sarah. \"She finds it too sad to watch.\" Their know-it-all uncle, who sought to discredit the nursery rhyme Little Miss Muffet, on the basis that the starches required to create curds and whey didn't exist at the time, may likewise not have enjoyed seeing himself lampooned on stage. And when their dad's new wife saw the show, says Sarah, \"she said, 'I didn't find it funny, because I know that lots of it was real. You were such unhappy kids, and it felt like you were playing it out again.'\" Sarah pulls an incredulous face. \"We were like: really?\" So the jury's out. Their act is either psychological damage as entertainment, or an off-colour windup by two fans of The League of Gentlemen and Julia Davis's sitcom Nighty Night. \"The best moments in comedy,\" says Lizzie, \"are those where you think, 'I feel upset but I also want to laugh really loudly at the same time.'\" Not everyone gets it, though. \"Some people just go, 'Where's the joke?'\" says Sarah. \"We had performances [in Edinburgh] where we did it to complete and utter silence.\" That may be why the sisters are still working in a call centre, while less exciting comedians are millionaires. But that should soon change: the Daykins are adapting Toby for TV, and stage their highest-profile London run this week. There's an audience for on-the-knuckle tragicomedy, and Toby seem set to find it. And if they don't make that connection? \"Usually the sister thing wins through anyway,\" says Lizzie. \"Most people can go, 'Yes, I've got a sibling.' They always recognise something.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
