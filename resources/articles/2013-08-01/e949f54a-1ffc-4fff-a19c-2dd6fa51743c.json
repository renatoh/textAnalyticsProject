Apparently nothing", "bodyText": "It has never been easier to contact your local member of parliament; a message to the prime minister is just a tweet away. Politicians and political parties have never been more connected to young people, a group of voters who have largely been seen, perhaps unfairly, as despondent and disinterested in politics. Young Australians are the biggest consumers of social media in the world. Over 80% of Australians between the ages of 18 and 24 are daily Facebook users \u2013 a fact that has clearly not gone unnoticed by political parties judging by the daily deluge of infographics. Armies of young supporters continuously circulate them, ensuring the \"message\" goes beyond the party faithful. As the second week of the official election campaign comes to an end, it\u2019s interesting to reflect upon the progress of the election campaign in terms of the youth agenda. While undoubtedly issues around marriage equality, climate change and asylum seekers are important to younger voters, there appears to be few policy initiatives that target young people as a specific voting bloc. There was of course the obligatory \"skills package\" announced by the Australian Labor party this week. The following day, an infographic with the words \u201cskillz pay the billz\u201d beamed from the party\u2019s Facebook page. The infographic was a clever way of making sure that the party\u2019s Step into Skills policy announcement a day earlier reached its intended audience, despite its questionable use of \"hip\" vocabulary. This announcement is not something that the Labor Party should be overly proud about. A skills package is par for the course in Australian election campaigns. In many ways, it has become the de facto policy announcement for young Australians during the campaigning period. But at least the ALP has something. The other major parties appear to have just as little on offer in terms of policy initiatives targeting young Australians. On the other end of the political spectrum, the Coalition Liberal-Nationals\u2019 youth-targeted policy can be found in a small paragraph contained in its \u201cPlan for Real Action\u201d, promising to resurrect the Colombo Plan. Is a recycled policy from the Cold War the type of \"hope, reward and opportunity\" young voters can expect from Tony Abbott as prime minister? As for the Australian Greens, they want to embroil young Australians in the mess that is the national parliament through the establishment of a youth parliament. There would be very few young Australians who would put themselves through Question Time after three years of watching politicians go to combat in the minority parliament. These initiatives are neither very imaginative, nor are they attractive to younger voters. This is the paradox of this year\u2019s election for younger voters. Politicians and political parties have finally found a way to connect to the youth vote. Young people are receiving their messages\u2014on Facebook, Twitter and even Instagram, but neither the politicians nor the parties have much to say to the specific needs of young people. And if they do, it\u2019s not very interesting or enticing. There are many issues facing young Australians aside from skills and training, such as housing affordability, the cost of tertiary education and access to health care to name but a few. Judging from the policy announcements so far, the channels of communication appear to be one-way. Perhaps politicians are okay with this as long as young voters continue to push the parties\u2019 main messages like carrier pigeons sharing and retweeting announcements, slogans and infographics to the world. The risk is that younger Australians become tired of all of this\u2013politicking and social media\u2013and choose to block out the messages. Some, no doubt, already have. This would be a wasted opportunity for politicians and political parties to reach beyond their bases, much less engage with the younger people. Whatever happens during this election campaign, politicians should look beyond the \u2018\"likes\", tweets and shameless selfies and engage with their younger followers using social media in a more meaningful way. \u2022 Are you a first time voter?
