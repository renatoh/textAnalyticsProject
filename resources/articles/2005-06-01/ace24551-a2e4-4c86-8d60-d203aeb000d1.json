The US-based company, which was spun out of oil exploration group Melrose Resources three years ago, has raised \u00a37m in a placing with institutions at 69p a share by Bell Lawrie valuing the business at \u00a318.2m. The shares start trading on Friday. Renova, which made profits of $718,000 (\u00a3395,000) last year on sales of $13.1m, intends to use the cash to build a new factory at its existing site in Torrington, Wyoming, increasing its production capacity from 5m gallons a year to 12m by next summer. The ethanol industry has ballooned in America with production increasing 150% over five years as states across the country have ruled that it must be included in gasoline to reduce emissions. Made from corn or grain, ethanol has also been seized on by America's midwestern farmers as an obvious use of their produce, while gasoline retailers want it as its inclusion improves their margins on selling fuel. The US guzzles about 140bn gallons of gasoline a year but ethanol production runs at just 3.7bn gallons a year, less than 3% of the market. There are more than 85 ethanol plants in America, mainly in the midwest. In contrast, Renova's production and distribution is concentrated in the Rocky Mountain states of Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Nebraska and South Dakota, further west. Chris Thomas, the chairman, reckons the company has carved itself a very profitable niche as the major midwestern producers are likely to move into the west coast and bypass the Rockies. \"We have carved out a pretty large niche for a company of our size,\" he said. \"Our customers want as much ethanol as they can get their hands on.\" By 2010 the company hopes to be able to make 100m gallons a year. It intends to pay out its cash profits in dividends and fund the company's growth with further fundraisings. There is also the possibility of acquisitions, said Mr Thomas. \"Inevitably with an industry that has grown so fast, the next step is consolidation and there could be some great opportunities in the market.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
