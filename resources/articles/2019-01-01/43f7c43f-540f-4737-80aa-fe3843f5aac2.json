Hopefully this will salvage what has been something of an anticlimactic two days of football. This, however, marks the end of my liveblogging duties for this afternoon. Stay tuned, however, for further NFL Playoff coverage here at the Guardian over the next few weeks. Thanks to everybody who followed along with me and especially those who helped contribute. Ciao! Email from Justin Kavanagh So I\u2019m picturing a big truck backing into the players\u2019 entrance and Patriots employees rolling out a huge sheet of bubble wrap, with which they\u2019ll swathe Tom Brady any minute now, like a mummy. Then they\u2019ll feel him chicken soup with added vitamins until the Chiefs game. How long can they keep him alive and flinging footballs? Well that\u2019s the question. This could be Brady\u2019s last real shot at a Super Bowl. Meanwhile, this is Kansas City quarterback Patrick Mahomes\u2019s first postseason. It\u2019s part of what makes the AFC Championship Game so intriguing. The Patriots won their regular season matchup, but it came down to the last play. It should be exciting. In other words, it should be the exact opposite of whatever this game was. The New England Patriots will be going to Arrowhead Stadium to face the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game! Chargers 28-41 Patriots, FINAL The onside kick fails and the Patriots go in victory formation. The New England Patriots win! Chargers 28-41 Patriots, :59, 4th quarter Philip Rivers wants a holding penalty on an incomplete pass. He is throwing a Trumperian-sized tantrum. He gets a call on the next play, a legit roughing the passer call. It\u2019s 1st and goal, and the Chargers are going for it. He throws a pass to the Gates for the final touchdown of the game and possibly in Gates\u2019s career. The two-point conversion fails. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 1:23, 4th quarter Rivers keeps getting first-downs and Chargers fans everywhere are going \u201coh, now you\u2019re doing this?\u201d They get the ball to the New England 25, looking for that sweet, sweet garbage time touchdown. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 2:00, 4th quarter Right after the two-minute warning, the Patriots call a timeout. Bill Belichick is now officially just trolling me. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 2:00, 4th quarter Rivers actually converts on a 4th and 10. Gates gets to the Chargers 34. Time for some postseason stat padding! Or nope, Rivers gets sacked for a five yard loss right before the two minute warning. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 2:46, 4th quarter For most of this quarter, Rivers looks like he\u2019s in pain. Yes, I know, he always kinda looks like that, but even moreso. This whole thing has felt like he\u2019s in a \u201cThey Shoot Horses, Don\u2019t They?\u201d situation. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 2:59, 4th quarter Patriots get hit with a delay of game penalty before the punt. Yeah, definitely think this is entirely on purpose now. Allen punts at the Chargers 39. It goes into the end zone for a touchback, cruelly forcing the Chargers to play even more offense before this game ends. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 3:53, 4th quarter Another play, another timeout. The guys on CBS are officially calling it. I\u2019m pretty sure we\u2019re not going to get a Red Sox/Mets Game 6 situation here. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 4:01, 4th quarter Chargers call a timeout here. Discussing vacation plans, I\u2019m guessing. Meat Loaf is singing \u201cI can see paradise by the dashboard light\u201d through the PA. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 4:12, 4th quarter The Chargers are still out there playing because they have no other choice. At this point, the drama is all in watching the clock rather than Rivers throwing desperate pointless passes. On 3rd &amp; 10 at their own 14, Rivers throws an interception to Stephon Gilmore at the Chargers 33. That\u2019s that, really. Email from Christopher Walton Patriots v Chargers is the most depressing game I\u2019ve ever seen. Please tell me football will be good again. Chris Walton It will. Chiefs/Patriots in the AFC Championship Game. If it\u2019s anything like their regular season meeting, this is going to a treat. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 5:04, 4th quarter The Patriots drive falters at the LA 40. The Patriots go to punt\u2026 and there\u2019s a false start penalty. That\u2019s another five yards but they might prefer to take the time off the clock. Allen\u2019s punt puts the Chargers at their own 2. That\u2019s the nail in the coffin there. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 7:38, 4th quarter Have to think that there\u2019s an onside kick coming from the Chargers. There is and it goes nine yards, Nick Ebner makes the catch at the Chargers 44. That might do it. Chargers 22-41 Patriots, 7:38, 4th quarter Rivers finds Virgil Green for an easy touchdown. The Chargers go for a two-point conversion, because they need way more points. They convert it. Chargers 14-41 Patriots, 7:46, 4th quarter The ruling on the field is that It is a catch just short of the goal line. It\u2019ll be first and goal at the 1 yard line for the Chargers. Chargers 14-41 Patriots, 7:51, 4th quarter Chargers are going no huddle, which means it starts to become tricky to follow them. They start creeping into new England territory, getting to the 33 where, on third down, Rivers throws what looks like a touchdown pass to Allen that\u2019s ruled incomplete. That looks like not the right call. The Chargers challenge and it\u2019s looking like they\u2019re going to win it. Chargers 14-41 Patriots, 9:02, 4th quarter Rivers throws to Ty Williams to the Chargers 49. Impressive throw under pressure. Rivers\u2019s next throw is to Williams, it\u2019s incomplete, but there\u2019s a flag on Jackson. Defensive pass interference. That\u2019s 12 yards and an automatic first down. A nice statistic. Chargers 14-41 Patriots, 9:39, 4th quarter The announcers are talking about the Patriots taking out Brady. It\u2019s not going to happen until it\u2019 like 1:37 left on the clock. The Patriots drive stalls out relatively quickly here, Sony Michel can\u2019t quite run the ball on 3rd and 1 so it\u2019s a rare three and out. The Chargers needed to get those a lot earlier in the game. Ryan Allen punts it to the end zone for a touchback after the Patriots burn some clock. THERE IS NO WAY THAT \u201cGOD FRIENDED ME\u201d IS A THING. Chargers 14-41 Patriots, 11:47, 4th quarter There\u2019s a running into the kicker charge on Jones. The Chargers decline. On the punt, Edelman ran it from the 43 to the New England 48. Chargers 14-41 Patriots, 11:47, 4th quarter 1st and 20. Rivers throws incomplete to Allen. Rivers hasn\u2019t been the main problem for the Chargers here, but he hasn\u2019t\u2026 been not a problem. 2nd &amp; 20. Rivers has plenty of time to throw to Hunter Henry (nice name) and it\u2019s *almost* picked off here by Kyle Van Noy. Rivers throws again, this time to Williams, surrounded by Patriots. It\u2019s 4th and 20. The Chargers punt\u2026 and there\u2019s a penalty on the Patriots. Chargers 14-41 Patriots, 12:18, 4th quarter Gostkowski\u2019s kickoff gets returned by King to the Charger 24. On 1st down, Rivers throws incomplete BUT there\u2019s a flag. Oh, it\u2019s on the Chargers. A holding penalty backs them up 10 yards. We\u2019re spoiled here in New England Chargers 14-41 Patriots, 12:23, 4th quarter Patriots are at the Chargers 16. Brady\u2019s 1st down throw is incomplete, thanks to pressure by the Chiefs. 2nd and 10. Brady throws to Edelman, but somehow doesn\u2019t connect. 3rd and 10. Brady connects with Hogan who gets wrapped up at the 12. Gostkowski comes for a 30 yard field goal attempt which is good and that\u2019s another score and, more importantly, the drive takes a few more precious minutes off the clock. Chargers 14-38 Patriots, 13:49, 4th quarter A Patterson first down gets wiped away by a holding penalty on Edelman. That\u2019s instead a ten yard penalty. It\u2019s 1st and 20 at the Chargers 39, Brady finds White\u2026 who runs for a 23 yard gain. So it didn\u2019t really matter. The Patriots\u2019 Shaq Mason is hurt on the play Chargers 14-38 Patriots, 14:10, 4th quarter Oh man. Brady throws deep to Edelman who takes it to the Chargers 29. A 35 yard pickup. Chargers need like a pick-six and they need it like 12 minutes ago. Chargers 14-38 Patriots, end of the 3rd quarter Brady throws to Edelman, which is something that\u2019s been working pretty well this game. It\u2019s a nine yard game. On the next pass, Devellin gets a first down and extra and that will be the end of the third quarter. The Patriots are 15 minutes away from a date with the Chiefs in Arrowhead. Chargers 14-38 Patriots, 1:16, 3rd quarter What the Patriots have to do now is\u2026 not be stupid. No turnovers, bleed the clock, avoid 3-and-outs. Another score or two wouldn\u2019t hurt either. The Chargers kickoff goes into the end zone for a touchback so they will be starting at their own 25. Chargers 14-38 Patriots, 1:16, 3rd quarter On 1st and 10, Gordon takes a huge hit. He gets up and carries the ball on 2nd and goal and this time he\u2019s in. The Chargers get their desperately needed second touchdown of the game. The extra point is good. That\u2019s great. The thing is they have 16 minutes left in the game and the Patriots running game has been dominant. Chargers 7-38 Patriots, 2:01, 3rd quarter Chargers have a 1st &amp; 10 on the New England 15, Rivers throws to Gates who makes the catch and is stuffed by Chung for a three yard loss. Man the Patriots defense is not letting up here. Or not. On 2nd &amp; 13, Rivers has his best throw of the last two quarters , hitting Williams at the Patriots one yard line. It\u2019s 1st &amp; goal\u2026 and the Chargers take a timeout to avoid a delay of game penalty. Chargers 7-38 Patriots, 3:29, 3rd quarter 2nd &amp; 13. Rivers goes for the big play here, but the receiver can\u2019t quite make the play. 3rd &amp; 13. Rivers tries for the end zone again. No dice, but there\u2019s a flag here. It\u2019s defensive holding, that\u2019s a five yard penalty and an automatic first down. Chargers 7-38 Patriots, 3:34, 3rd quarter The call stands as there\u2019s no evidence that the Patriots made the fumble recovery. So that\u2019s a lost timeout for Patriots. On the next play, Gordon gets stuffed for a three-yard loss. It looks like Williams has it no matter what, but we\u2019ll see. Chargers 7-38 Patriots, 4:40, 3rd quarter Chargers go shotgun. Rivers\u2019 completion gets them 20 yards, they\u2019re on the New England 37. He throws to Williams for an additional five yards. 2nd &amp; 5. This is their second best drive of the game already. Rivers throws and he gets Williams for a first down. They\u2019re at the Patriots 17\u2026 but the ball looks like it might be out. The play is being challenged by the Patriots. Chargers 7-38 Patriots, 5:52, 3rd quarter 1st and 10 and\u2026 you\u2019ll never guess what happens: Rivers throws it away. Granted, there\u2019s no real choice here but to air it out and hope for the best at this point. 2nd &amp; 10, Flowers takes down Rivers but that\u2019s probably an illegal hit from Flowers. Roughing the passer penalty leads to a first down and an additional 15 yards. The Chargers will take whatever they can get. Chargers 7-38 Patriots, 6:23, 3rd quarter Patriots kick it off again. A touchdown for a return maybe would be great here. Well, King manages to go off, but Matthew Slater manages to take him down on the Chargers 28. I would be okay with this. Wait, let me check with my editor to see if I get paid the same rate. Email from Ben Dunn: The Patriots don\u2019t do easing off. This, as ugly as it already is for the Chargers, could become monumentally humiliating. I know most want a contest, and this isn\u2019t one, but watching the Patriots beat up on a team is like the best of Barcelona in the Champions league when they humiliate other best-in-their-country teams. Chargers 7-38 Patriots, 6:31, 3rd quarter Michel gets stuffed on 2st down. On 2nd &amp; goal, Brady connects with White, who also gets stuffed for a loss. At least we\u2019re seeing something from the Chargers defense. Unfortunately, time is running out here. Just by extending the possession, they won. And Brady almost ends this thing with a pass to Hogan that he can\u2019t corral. Here comes Gostkowski for a 28 yard field goal that\u2019s good. That\u2019s a 7:22 possession. Chargers 7-35 Patriots, 7:59, 3rd quarter Chargers get to Brady on first down. On second down, Burkhead gets to the 17. It\u2019s 3rd &amp; 3 and Brady\u2019s pass to White only leads to a single yard. On 4th and 2, the Patriots decide they want to put this one away early. They hand off the ball to Michel\u2026 and he has that first down and more! It\u2019s first and goal at the 9. Chargers 7-35 Patriots, 10:02, 3rd quarter Michel picks up five yards, that\u2019s his 17th carry. He gets to the Chargers 27. On 2nd &amp; 5, Brady connects with White who is a yard short of a first down. 3rd &amp; 1. At this point a field goal will be a moral victory for L.A. Instead, James Devellin gets the first down. Chargers 7-35 Patriots, 12:33, 3rd quarter Edelman picks up 7 yards on 1st down. On 2nd &amp; 3, the Chargers stuff Burkhead for the loss of a yard. And THERE IS GRONK. I knew he\u2019d show up. Brady throws to Gronkowski for a 22 yard gain, barreling through defenders to get to the Chargers 36. Chargers 7-35 Patriots, 13:53, 3rd quarter On 1st down, Rivers throws it very high over Allen. On 2nd &amp; 10, he throws\u2026 incomplete again after being pressured by Adam Butler. 3rd &amp; 10, Rivers actually makes a throw to Williams who gets three yards. The Chargers will punt. That was the opposite of what they had to do. Donnie Jones comes out punts to the 32 where Edelman takes it a yard. Chargers 7-35 Patriots, 15:00, 3rd quarter King takes the kickoff to the Chargers 31 to start the second half. If they start the half with a touchdown, they\u2019ve got an outside shot. If they falter here, I think it\u2019s done. There should have been more drama. It\u2019s a pity, especially for my readership numbers this game. I\u2019m flattered but I am completely faking it. As far as Eagles/Saints, I am a huge believer in Brees, so I have the Saints beating the Eagles by a few touchdowns, but I\u2019ve bet against Nick Foles every single Eagles postseason game and he\u2019s won every single one so who knows. Emails from Ben Dunn The Patriots are just annoyingly good. The Chargers went all obscurely wild with their defensive strategy to stop the run-only offence of the Ravens in the previous round. The Patriots, as Belichick tends to do, took this as a challenge and has his RB Michel having a career day. Rivers looks flustered and losing his cool. The Patriots have schemed the life out of the Chargers. And it is not quite half-time. And a follow up: The voting for the league MVP ended last week. Can you imagine if Rivers had actually beaten out Mahomes? Chargers are being spanked. Drew Brees is his only real competition, I think but he\u2019s gonna win. Email from Justin Kavanagh Well it looks like rumors of Tom Brady\u2019s injury have been overinflated! LA need a half-time recharge! Sorry, I\u2019ll be here all week! I see what you did there. Well that looked like it was going to be a shootout after the two teams traded touchdowns in their first possessions but\u2026 well only the Patriots shot after that. It\u2019s not impossible for the Chargers to come back, not with their offense, but they\u2019re going to need stops too and their defense looks winded. Chargers 7-35 Patriots, end of the first half. Edelman takes the punt to the New England 48. Patriots in the shotgun. On 2nd &amp; 10, Edelman gets to the 40. Patriots take another timeout. They pick up four yards. On 3rd &amp; 6, the Patriots take a timeout. The goal here is obviously to get into field goal range. And they don\u2019t, Brady throws to Dorsett for six yards but he doesn\u2019t get out of bounds and that\u2019s the end of the half. The Chargers can\u2019t stop Tom Brady it seems, only the clock. Chargers 7-35 Patriots, 1:00, 2nd quarter And Rivers gets sacked by Trey Flowers for a loss of ten yards. That\u2019s\u2026 Oh man. It\u2019s 2nd &amp; 20 now, on their own 15. Patriots call a timeout. On the next drive, Rivers finds Gates for a ten yard gain. That\u2019s 3rd &amp; 10. Rivers throws, and it\u2019s knocked away by Jackson. Rivers wants a flag, he ain\u2019t getting one. The Chargers punt again. So much for the \u201chaving the ball\u201d idea. Chargers 7-35 Patriots, 1:43, 2nd quarter Well the good news (?) for the Chargers is that they have the ball to end the half and they will have it to begin the second half. So they have a shot to score twice before the Patriots get the ball back. The bad news: they have to score. They will start at their own 25 after the touchback. Chargers 7-35 Patriots, 1:43, 2nd quarter Okay, 2nd &amp; on the Chargers 18. Brady\u2019s pass to Dorsett for a first down. It\u2019s 1st &amp; goal now for New England. Chargers take a timeout. Whatever they talk about doesn\u2019t help. Michel runs into the end zone and that will be his third touchdown of the half. The extra point is good. What a coming out party for the rookie running back. Chargers 7-28 Patriots, 2:00, 2nd quarter On 1st &amp; 10, Brady hits Edelman for a gain of 16 yards. Patriots are on the 19 yard line. It\u2019s 1st &amp; 10. Michel picks up two yards. It\u2019s 2nd &amp; 8 and we hit the two minute warning. Chargers 7-28 Patriots, 3:22, 2nd quarter The Patriots have challenged the ruling on the field that the ball was out of bounds (and thus would remain Chargers ball). And it\u2019s ruled a Patriots recovery. It\u2019s going to be 1st and 10, New England at the Chargers 35! Chargers 7-28 Patriots, 3:22, 2nd quarter And King fumbles on the punt return, it looks like the Patriots might have recovered. This is one is going to review. It looks real close. Chargers 7-28 Patriots, 3:22, 2nd quarter Brady throws from the pocket\u2026 and it\u2019s in-between two receivers and far away from both of them. 2nd &amp; 10. On 2nd &amp; 10, Michel gets tripped up for a three yard gain. On 3rd &amp; 7, Brady gets hit and throws incomplete. Well so much for my prediction of a long drive. Oh hey, it\u2019s Ryan Allen to punt. Chargers 7-28 Patriots, 4:16, 2nd quarter 3rd &amp; 10. Rivers throws under pressure to Gordon, who is busted up by Dont\u2019a Hightower. And that\u2019s another Chargers punt. Edelman fields the punt and gets it to the New England 21. Look for the Patriots to try to have a real long possession here and shorten the half. Chargers 7-28 Patriots, 4:33, 2nd quarter Gordon goes off for no gain. 2nd &amp; 10. Rivers tries another deep throw, but no dice here. 3rd &amp; 10 at their own 47. Rivers is showing his trademark Extremely Upset Body Language here, but when doesn\u2019t he? On 3rd and 10... the Chargers call a timeout with one second left on the play clock. Chargers 7-28 Patriots, 5:22, 2nd quarter King receives the kickoff and gets it to the Chargers 21. Rivers fires deep on the very first play, aiming for Ty Williams for a 26 yard gain. Rivers is gonna have to make big throws like that if they want to get back in this thing. I feel really bad about dismissing those \u201cthe key to this game is going to be the running backs\u201d takes. Chargers 7-28 Patriots, 6:04, 2nd quarter And on this play, Michel gets 40 yards and reaches the Chargers 6 before being taken down. This is becoming a disaster for the Chargers. He\u2019s up to 95 yards on the half. On 1st down, Rex Burkhead gets 3 yards. On 2nd\u2026 he gets in. Another drive, another touchdown! The extra point is good and the Chargers are in trouble early. Chargers 7-21 Patriots, 7:20, 2nd quarter Michel only gets 2 yards on 2nd down. It\u2019s 3rd and 2. LA could make a key stop here. Brady is in the pocket and throws long and it\u2019s incomplete. There is a flag on the play. Holding on the defense, on King. Five yard penalty and an automatic first down. Well. Chargers 7-21 Patriots, 8:40, 2nd quarter If the Patriots score a touchdown on this drive, the Chargers might be in trouble. Brady throws to White on 1st down, he keeps running and picks up 25 yards. Jeez. Patriots are at their own 38. Michel gets six on 1st &amp; 10. Chargers 7-21 Patriots, 9:12, 2nd quarter Chargers at their own 49. Gordon gets wrapped up for no gain. 2nd &amp; 10. Rivers throws under pressure to avoid a sack. 3rd &amp; 10. The Gillette crowd gets loud. Rivers throws to Antonio Gates, but McCourty bats it away. The Chargers have to punt again. That\u2019s not ideal. Edelman makes a fair catch of the punt at the New England 13. Chargers 7-21 Patriots, 10:14, 2nd quarter 3rd &amp; 2. Big play here for both sides. Rivers decides to throw long\u2026 but it\u2019s a free play. There\u2019s a flag on the play, it\u2019s a delay of game on the offense (surprisingly). That\u2019s a five yard penalty which gives the Patriots defense a tad more breathing room. On 3rd and 7, Rivers finds Williams and\u2026 they complete it anyways, nice catch in heavy traffic. Chargers 7-21 Patriots, 10:55, 2nd quarter Rivers finds Gordon for a first down. He gets to about the 36. 1st &amp; 10. Gordon gets a carry and picks up 8. This is a good start, they\u2019re at their own 44 already. 2nd &amp; 2\u2026. Rivers airs it out to Williams and that\u2019s incomplete. Chargers 7-21 Patriots, 12:17, 2nd quarter The Chargers offense can make up large deficits quick but\u2026 They should try to start that now rather than later. Gostkowski\u2019s kick goes to the end zone for a touchdown, they\u2019ll start at their own 25. Okay my expert analysis is that the Chargers defense needs to play better. Chargers 7-21 Patriots, 12:17, 2nd quarter On 2nd &amp; 6, Brady finds Hogan who gets taken down just short of a 1st down. On 3rd &amp; 1, Brady hands off to Michel. But it\u2019s a false start for the firsts penalty on the Patriots. That will make it 3rd &amp; 6. No matter, Brady finds Dorsett for their third touchdown of the game. That\u2019s one on every drive. And the extra point is good. Chargers 7-14 Patriots, 13:49, 2nd quarter On 2nd &amp; 10, Brady finds Phillip Dorsett for the first time of the game and he picks up a first down that brings the Patriots to the Chargers 19. On the next play, Brady hands off to Michel who picks up 4 yards. Chargers 7-14 Patriots, 15:00, 2nd quarter Brady finds Edelman again, that\u2019s a 17 yard gain that takes the Patriots to the Chargers 30. That moves him to second on the all-time postseason receptions list. Chargers 7-14 Patriots, end of the 1st quarter On 1st &amp; 10, Brady\u2019s pass is tipped by Melvin Ingram, but it falls incomplete. Brady throws to Edelman and that\u2019s another first down conversion as the first quarter comes to an end. Chargers 7-14 Patriots, :42, 1st quarter Edelman fields the punt and carries it 6 yards to the New England 36 and we have a brief commercial break. Chargers 7-14 Patriots, :42, 1st quarter Prop bet: when are we gonna see our first punt? It won\u2019t be here, the kickoff goes to Desmond King who gets to the Chargers 25. On 1st &amp; 10, Gordon picks up a yard. 2nd &amp; 9. Rivers throws long again and\u2026 it falls into no man\u2019s land. 3rd &amp; 9, the Pats defense gets on Rivers who scrambles and throws it away. I guess now we\u2019ll see our first punt. Random note: I refuse to believe \u201cGod Friended Me\u201d is a real show. Chargers 7-14 Patriots, 1:42, 1st quarter Michel picks up 2 yards on first down. He\u2019s getting a lot of carries. On 2nd &amp; 8, Brady finds Edelman again who gets it all the way to the Chargers 14. That\u2019s a 28 yard gain! On the very next play, Michel runs it all the way into the end zone. Touchdown! This is going to be a fun one folks! Oh and the extra point is good. Chargers 7-7 Patriots, 2:55, 1st quarter Phillips is back on the field for the Chargers, good news for them. Brady finds White, who gets taken for a loss by Jahleel Addae. On 2nd &amp; 13, Brady finds old reliable Edelman who manages to slip defenders and pick up a first down. Chargers 7-7 Patriots, 4:49, 1st quarter I\u2019m not sure exactly what the Pats defense was doing right there, but, then again, Allen is really that good. The Chargers kick it off and Cordarrelle Patterson takes it to the Patriots 33. On 1st &amp; 10, Brady throws incomplete. On 2nd &amp; 10, Michel gets it to the New England 45. Chargers 7-7 Patriots, 4:56, 1st quarter Williams is on the sidelines, trying to \u201cwalk off\u201d a leg injury. Chargers are at their own 46 with a fresh set of downs. Ausitn Ekeler picks up three yards. 2nd &amp; 7, Williams is already back in the game. Melvin Gordon gets the ball next and he picks up eight yards to the New England 43. And Rivers has enough of these short gains, he finds a completely alone Keenan Allen for a touchdown! Wow! The extra point ties this game up. This might be that quarterback battle we were hoping for. Chargers 0-7 Patriots, 6:52, 1st quarter Gostkowski\u2019s pooch kick goes to the 17 yard line, Justin Jackson takes it to the Chargers 33. On 1st down, Melvin Gordon gets stuffed for no gain. 2nd &amp; 10 for the Chargers. Rivers launches one deep, aiming for Mike Williams, who ALMOST makes the catch. Oh man that was painful. 3rd and 10\u2026 there\u2019s a flag on the play. Delay of game on the Chargers, that\u2019s a five yard penalty. So now it\u2019s 3rd &amp; 15. This is not a great start for them. Rivers throws deep\u2026 and Mike Williams catches it this time, that\u2019s an 18 yard gain and a first down. He looks shaken up on the field though. Twitter message from Dean Wyles: Just started taking an interest in NFL. Why do people not like Brady? Is it because he is successful or as a result of the deflate-gate? Great live coverage. Thanks. Dean Wyles Those are all part of it. There\u2019s a lot more, to be honest but those are big ones. Chargers 0-7 Patriots, 7:52, 1st quarter Michel goes up the middle and scored. Stephen Gostkowsksi\u2019s extra point is good and just like that the Patriots have the lead. Maybe receiving was the right choice. Chargers 0-0 Patriots, 7:52, 1st quarter Brady throws incomplete, finally. It\u2019s a 3rd and 5, Brady throws throws to James White for a first down conversion. They\u2019re at the Chargers 13 now. On 1st &amp; 10, there\u2019s no gain by Michel. 2nd &amp; 10, Brady hits White again. Four yard gain. Yet another 3rd down conversion here for the Patriots, LA *has* to hold them to a field goal here. On 3rd &amp; 6, Brady throws incomplete to the end zone\u2026 but there\u2019s a flag. Pass Interference. Defense! The ball will be on the one yard line and an automatic first down. Chargers 0-0 Patriots, 9:54, 1st quarter Phillips is out, big blow for Chargers. Michel gets the ball again, he goes 11 yards to the Chargers and then 5 more yards on the next carry. Patriots are at the Chargers 19. Chargers 0-0 Patriots, 11:20, 1st quarter White gets into Chargers territory on a 17 yard gain. Brady has been hitting everybody so far. Chargers cornerback Adrian Phillips gets injured on the play. Chargers 0-0 Patriots, 11:33 1st quarter On 3rd and 3, Brady finds Edelman for an easy gain to get a first down at the Patriots 30. On first down, Michel gets stuffed again. Okay, not so great for the run game so far. On 2nd &amp; 11, Michel picks up 9. 3rd and 2. Brady hits James White who picks up ten yards for another first down conversion. Chargers 0-0 Patriots, 14:16, 1st quarter Brady finds James White who takes it to the 24. Sony Michel goes off for a run, and then gets stuffed for the loss of a yard on 2nd and 2. Chargers 0-0 Patriots, 15:00, 1st quarter Patriots win the toss and\u2026 THEY RECEIVE? They always defer. I hate this, this is the reason they\u2019re gonna lose. The Patriots will start from inside their 20. A feature on Tom Brady vs Philip Rivers. Fun fact, this is the oldest quarterback battle in NFL playoff history. It\u2019s possible that the temperature could make this not the offensive, pass-heavy game that some of us might have hoped. This could come down to the running game. The players are coming to the field now, kickoff is coming. Email from David George Hi Hunter, Despite his record, I\u2019ve never been a fan of Brady and I really, really want the Chargers to win. However, with the best will in the world, I think your prediction of 28-31 to the Pats is being generous to the Chargers. I just can\u2019t see the Chargers getting that close to the Pats. Next Sunday in Kansas will be a very different proposition, though. In the meantime, here\u2019s hoping I\u2019m wrong. Enjoy doing the blog tonight. Regards, David George I will say this: you are very not alone in hating Tom Brady. Also: I think the Chiefs handle whoever wins this game. I got some heat on picking Rob Gronkowski for the player to watch this game but it was partly an emotional pick. He\u2019s been banged up this season and I fully expect him to retire at the end of the season. If so, win or lose, this would be his last home game as the Chiefs will be hosting the AFC Championship Game. I\u2019m hoping that he has a few more memorable plays in him. I\u2019ve already made my predictions, I\u2019ve got the Patriots by a field goal, but I\u2019ve been super-duper wrong so far during these playoffs. If you have any, feel free to send them here either via email (to hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or tweet them to @HunterFelt. I am upset that the Chargers are now in Los Angeles because it makes the Greatest Theme Song In NFL History completely irrelevant. The fun thing is that there will now be \u201cBeat LA\u201d chants from the fans in the crowd. The anti-Los Angeles chant comes from the Boston Celtics/Los Angeles Lakers rivalry in the NBA BUT not from an actual Lakers/Celtics game. Fans began the chant to implore the Philadelphia 76ers, who had just beat the Celtics, to go out and beat their West Coast enemies because if they couldn\u2019t win at least maybe the Lakers could lose. The good news for the warm-weather Chargers is that it\u2019s warmed up at Foxboro. Right now it\u2019s a warm 24 degrees Fahrenheit. So, uh, yeah. Speaking as someone who is coming to you from Somerville MA with a furnace that keeps going out, I can assure you that it makes for not ideal conditions. It should favor the Patriots, as New England receiver Julian Edelman points out via Twitter. In their existence, the Chargers have played in one Super Bowl, back in 1995 as the San Diego Chargers, where they lost to the San Francisco 49ers. The New England Patriots have appeared in 10 and have won five, all of them with Tom Brady as quarterback and Bill Belichick as head coach. Today\u2019s game would appear to be a mismatch. Of course, despite being the lower seed, the Chargers had a better regular season record (12-4) than the Patriots (11-5). Listen, nobody said the NFL Playoffs made sense. The Patriots have had one of their less impressive regular seasons, with signs that Brady is finally showing signs of slipping. This could be Philip Rivers and the Chargers\u2019 best chance to notch their win against the quarterback. The Chargers are fresh off a 23-17 win over the Baltimore Ravens while the Patriots were relaxing on their bye. That mean\u2019s today\u2019s playoff game will be yet another referendum of rest vs. rust. The winner of today\u2019s game will face the Kansas City Chiefs in the AFC Championship Game after the Chiefs tore through the Indianapolis Colts 31-13. Either way, we\u2019re going to get another fantastic quarterback matchup, with either Brady or Rivers playing against Kansas City\u2019s Patrick Mahomes. Meanwhile, in the NFC, the Los Angeles Rams defeated the Dallas Cowboys 30-22. After today\u2019s game, the Philadelphia Eagles will try to keep Nick Foles Magic going against Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints. If you want to contribute to this liveblog, you can either email us (at hunter.felt.freelance@theguardian.com) or tweet us at (@HunterFelt) throughout today\u2019s game with your questions, concerns, predictions, smack-talk and other such commentary. Kickoff is scheduled at 1:05pm EST, but we\u2019ll be back well before then. It\u2019s the Los Angeles Chargers vs the New England Patriots at Gillette Stadium! Hunter will be here shortly, in the meantime here\u2019s his rundown of today\u2019s game: What the Chargers need to do to win: Get to the quarterback. While he ended the season with one of his finest efforts of the season, Tom Brady has looked human of late and more vulnerable to pressure. Meanwhile, the Chargers may have the best all-around defense of the teams remaining in the playoffs. What the Patriots need to do to win: Keep doing what they\u2019re doing at home. The Patriots have a perfect 8-0 record at Gillette Stadium this season and no team will have benefitted more from the bye week, what with Brady showing some surprising signs of age. Oh, and Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers has never won a game against Brady. Key player: Rob Gronkowski, TE, Patriots. The Patriots\u2019 playoff success has depended on the health of Gronkowski, maybe the greatest tight end in NFLhistory. Expect Brady to look for him when his team need to pick up big-time yardage, even though Gronkowski has not had a vintage season by his standards. Prediction: Chargers 28-31 Patriots"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
