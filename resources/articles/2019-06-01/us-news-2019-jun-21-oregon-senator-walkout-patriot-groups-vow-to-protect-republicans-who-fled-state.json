The move by the state senators \u2013 some of whom are believed to have fled to neighboring Idaho \u2013 was aimed at denying Democrats a quorum for passing landmark climate legislation. The proposed new Oregon law resembles California\u2019s sweeping new \u201ccap and trade\u201d legislation. After Oregon\u2019s governor authorized state police to bring the 11 Republican senators back to the state house rightwing groups have said they will rally to their defense \u2013 raising the prospect of a potentially dangerous confrontation. Figures aligned with the \u201cpatriot movement\u201d group of organizations offered assistance to the rogue senators, though it was not immediately clear if this cooperation was welcomed by them. On Facebook, Paul Luhrs, who claimed to be the Linn County lead for the Oregon III%, a patriot movement group, announced that the organization has \u201cvowed to provide security, transportation and refuge for those senators in need\u201d. Luhrs added, \u201cIt has come to our knowledge that nearly all senators are currently safe in Idaho with no chance of extradition.\u201d Asked via Facebook messenger whether the group was in touch with any senators, Luhr responded, \u201cme personally, no\u201d. Asked if the III% was in touch with any senators, Luhrs declined further comment. A Facebook event called \u201cRally to Take the Capitol\u201d promised an all-weekend rally outside the state house. The event used a threat by Republican state senator Brian Boquist to resist police as a rallying cry for the event. Some 150 people had indicated they would attend at the time of writing. One of the main organizers, John Parker Jr, is a longtime patriot movement activist, and is a former Republican party official in Marion county. On the event page, Parker described Oregon as a \u201cfascist dictatorship\u201d, said he was \u201cholding hands and saying how angry we are at an empty building on a weekend\u201d, and claimed to be in direct contact with at least one Oregon senator. Parker did not immediately respond to requests for a comment about the event. A senate Republican spokesperson said that \u201cthe senators are not with militias and are not accepting their help\u201d. However, Oregon Republicans have previously courted elements of the patriot movement. In 2017, Multnomah county Republican chair, James Buchal, raised the prospect of having members of the Oath Keepers and the III% provide security for Republican events. Multnomah Republicans later voted to use such groups for security. The Republicans have so far defied requests to return to their jobs. Boquist told reporters the police should \u201csend bachelors and come heavily armed. I\u2019m not going to be a political prisoner in the state of Oregon. It\u2019s just that simple.\u201d Boquist did not immediately respond to requests for a comment. A Republican spokesperson would not comment on Boquist\u2019s remarks, but did confirm senators had left Oregon. On the governor\u2019s deployment of police, the spokesperson said, \u201cTrue to their word, Oregon Democrats are following through with their continued threats on Oregon senate Republicans\u201d. The spokesperson argued that the cap and trade scheme should be put to a ballot, saying, \u201cOregonians should have a right to vote on this legislation that will put Oregon jobs and businesses at serious risk with significant fuel cost increases.\u201d Oregon state police meanwhile emphasized a non-confrontational approach to resolving the impasse. In a statement, OSP said it \u201cis utilizing established relationships to have polite communication with these senators\u201d. The statement continued: \u201cWhile we obviously have many tools at our disposal, patience and communication is, and always will be, our first, and preferred, option.\u201d Republicans in Oregon are faced with Democrat supermajorities in both houses and have repeatedly deployed a tactic of absenting themselves from the senate, thereby denying Democrats the necessary 20 senators for voting on legislation, including a business tax for public schools, laws tightening vaccine exemptions and gun laws. In a statement announcing the deployment of state police, Oregon governor Kate Brown said, \u201cIt is absolutely unacceptable that the senate Republicans would turn their back on their constituents who they are honor-bound to represent here in this building.\u201d At a news conference on Thursday, Brown said, \u201cSenate Republicans failed to show up, and failed to do their jobs.\u201d A spokesperson for the governor told the Guardian that the decision to deploy police \u201cis unusual, but the request is unusual\u201d. Oregon\u2019s constitution says that lawmakers can be \u201ccompelled\u201d to attend the house, and a statute allows the legislature, together with the governor, to call upon police to enforce criminal laws."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
