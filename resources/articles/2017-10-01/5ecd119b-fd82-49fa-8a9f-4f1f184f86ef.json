The promo opens with Amy Adams\u2019s Lois Lane dreaming of Clark Kent, as we see the other members of the Justice League (Batman, the Flash, Wonder Woman and Cyborg) going head to head with Steppenwolf and his army of invading Parademons. The only problem here is that Justice League\u2019s battle scenes look an awful lot like the ones directed by Zack Snyder in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. Why is it that every time the Earth comes under attack in these movies, all semblance of realism goes out the window and our heroes are imported wholesale into what appears to be Hades: The Video Game? The painful cover version of David Bowie\u2019s Heroes that plays throughout certainly sounds like the kind of tune that probably plays on loop in hell. Wonder Woman\u2019s creator seems to have mostly empowered himself Wonder Woman may have taken 80 years to get to the big screen, but she\u2019s certainly making up for lost time. The final trailer for Angela Robinson\u2019s Professor Marston and the Wonder Women, which tells the story of the superhero\u2019s unorthodox creation, serves up more Wonder Woman fare after Patty Jenkins\u2019 blockbuster. The psychologist William Moulton Marston is widely considered to have created Diana of Themyscira in order to satisfy his own bondage fetishism, as much as to advance the cause of his own particularly idiosyncratic vision of feminism. But he seems to get off rather lightly here, with the trailer striking something of an elegiac tone. By casting the handsome and affable Luke Evans as Marston, alongside the captivating Rebecca Hall (as Elizabeth Holloway Marston), Robinson seems to be painting her subject as a harmless, rather charming goon, rather than a creepy jerk. Michelle Yeoh\u2019s Captain Georgiou will return to Star Trek: Discovery Saturday\u2019s panel for CBS All Access\u2019s slick and spiky revival of the long-running space saga was notable for the revelation that the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon actor might not have fired her final phaser. Georgiou was killed off in the second episode of the first season following the mutinous actions of Sonequa Martin-Green\u2019s Michael Burnham, but Yeoh seemed pretty determined that we haven\u2019t seen the last of her, telling the crowd: \u201cI\u2019m not going to let them kill me, okay?\u201d Showrunner Gretchen J Berg later confirmed that Georgiou will be back, and those who caught last night\u2019s fourth episode will probably have a good idea how (spoiler alert). Will this be anything more than a temporary return? John Boyega follows in Idris Elba\u2019s footsteps for Pacific Rim 2 When it comes to giant robot movies, give me Guillermo Del Toro\u2019s Pacific Rim over Michael Bay\u2019s meatheaded Transformers franchise any day of the week. The Mexican director\u2019s bonkers 2013 kaiju flick came wrapped up in a huge bubble of joy, with Del Toro clearly having the time of his life imagining the most preposterous kaiju possible and sending them hurtling through the void to take on mankind\u2019s equally cool mega-machine defence systems. The only problem with Pacific Rim: Uprising, the debut trailer for which hit NYCC on Friday, is that Del Toro isn\u2019t actually directing, and most of the cast we care about have also neglected to return. So in place of Charlie Hunnam\u2019s Raleigh Becket, we have John Boyega\u2019s Jake Pentecost, son of Idris Elba\u2019s rousing Gen Pentecost in the original movie. Is Boyega as good at winding up the troops as his dad (brilliant sample line: \u201cToday we are cancelling the apocalypse!\u201d)? In short: no. But at least the young Star Wars actor gets to do his own accent for the first time sinceAttack the Block. The Punisher\u2019s gun fetish causes controversy One of NYCC\u2019s biggest talking points was the cancellation of Marvel\u2019s panel for The Punisher, its forthcoming Netflix show about the vigilante antihero (played by Jon Bernthal). The studio decided to act in the wake of the horrific Las Vegas attack in which a lone gunman killed 58 people and injured countless more last week. The thinking here seems to be that a show about a hero whose only superpowers are hatred and skill with military-grade weaponry isn\u2019t the sort of thing to be celebrating in the wake of America\u2019s deadliest mass shooting in modern history. It\u2019s a fair point, and one those who turn their nose up at more traditional superheroes might do well to remember. However ridiculous Superman, Wonder Woman and their ornately costumed friends might be on the face of it, at least they do not need semi-automatic weapons to help them win the day. The X-Files\u2019 Cigarette Smoking Man gets an origin story At Sunday\u2019s X-Files panel for the sci-fi show\u2019s upcoming 11th season, its creator, Chris Carter, revealed we\u2019ll be getting another look at the past of Mulder and Scully\u2019s greatest nemesis, William B Davis\u2019s nefarious Cigarette Smoking Man. Given the show\u2019s fourth season revealed that the sinister, chain-smoking government conspiracist was responsible for the assassinations of both John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Hr \u2013 only for the key episode\u2019s denouement to reveal it may have been little more than smoke and mirrors \u2013 viewers might have to decide for themselves if they can trust the narrative this time around. An even greater danger in season 11 might be our heroic duo\u2019s son, William, who according to Scully must be stopped \u201cbefore he releases hell on Earth\u201d. The Stephen Kingnaissance ain\u2019t over yet The first trailer for Hulu\u2019s series Castle Rock, which debuted during Saturday\u2019s NYCC panel for the show, is one of those teasers that doesn\u2019t give much away at all. But there are Easter eggs galore, from the casting of Carrie\u2019s Sissy Spacek to a shot of a vehicle marked \u201cShawshank State Prison\u201d sinking into a lake. The title is a reference to the fictional Maine town featured in many of the suspense icon\u2019s books. Spacek described the JJ Abrams series as \u201can homage to Stephen King\u201d. We\u2019ll have to wait and see which characters appear, but would it be too much to hope for a cameo from Pennywise the clown, given Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd has also joined the cast?"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
