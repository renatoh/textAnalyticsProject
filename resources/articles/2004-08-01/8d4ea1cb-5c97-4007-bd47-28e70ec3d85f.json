Compared with the activities of Max Clifford on behalf of Faria Alam this week, however, that man was running a clean-up campaign. For English football, the bad sight of the year has turned out to be not the puff of sand under David Beckham's right boot as his penalty flew over the bar in Lisbon but the kiss exchanged by Clifford and Alam outside the publicist's offices yesterday and caught by the Sky News cameras. That embrace ensured that whatever the result of the FA board's deliberations yesterday, the nightmare is only just beginning. At the end of their meeting, the FA's 12-strong board declined to comment on Alam's position. \"It is not appropriate to make any statement,\" they said. Soon afterwards Clifford announced his client's resignation from the job of personal assistant to the association's executive director, David Davies. Almost in the same breath, he announced the sale of Alam's story to two Sunday newspapers for a six-figure sum believed to be not unadjacent to half a million quid. Once again the FA's leadership has been wrong-footed. Probably lacking the grounds on which to dismiss her with out risking a legal action, now they face the intimate details of the daily life of Soho Square being laid bare for the nation's amusement. You or I would probably imagine that revelations concerning the FA's daily life might not exactly constitute riveting entertainment. But anyone's daily life, examined through an unfriendly lens, can hold the attention of the prurient and even the idly curious. For proof, just look at the success of Big Brother. And Alam will have the assistance of tabloid journalism's most artful practitioners as she turns peccadilloes and irritating personal habits into front-page news. For Sven-Goran Eriksson, who has already endured the story of his built-up shoes out side Ulrika Jonsson's bedroom, there may be much worse embarrassment to come. Luckily, there is every reason to suppose that he is capable to handling it with a proper disdain. Depending on your point of view, Max Clifford - the man who invented Freddie Starr's hamster-munching and put David Mellor in a Chelsea strip with Antonia De Sancha - is either a bringer of justice to the exploited or a carbuncle on England's arse. The carbuncle gets my vote. No one matches his understanding of the rules by which the game is played. And now he appears regularly on television news bulletins, called to give his opinion on issues of the day, as though he were some sort of moral philosopher rather than a showbiz publicist who found a way to get rich by exploiting human weakness. His involvement in the world of football reached its previous nadir a couple of years ago, when he was handling the publicity for the woman who claimed that she had been subjected to sexual assault at the hands of Neil Hamilton, the disgraced Tory MP, and his wife Christine. At Old Trafford one Saturday afternoon in his part-time capacity as Fulham's media consultant, Clifford used Manchester United's press conference theatre to give a television interview on the subject of his client's claims - which turned out, of course, to be a pack of lies. You didn't even have to believe in the legend of the Theatre of Dreams to be disgusted by the abuse of the club's premises. \"Max, thank you for your time,\" the Sky News anchor said at the conclusion of last night's cosy interview on the subject of Alam. Sky News is owned by News International, proprietors of one of the Sunday papers in which Alam's revelations will appear. It will hardly be a surprise if Sky turns out to be channel on which Faria Alam presents her doe-eyed description of how she was duped by the powerful men into whose world she arrived as a helpless innocent. Clifford will be standing nearby, counting his percentage and trying to keep a straight face. What the anchor should have said, of course, was \"Max, thank you for allowing us to help you make even more money\". Clifford really must think he is the only sane man on a ship of fools. In fact he is floating merrily in a sea of sewage, while the survivors of the wreck of English football swim desperately for the shore. The power brokers Roger Burden \"I have retired from work and I spend all my time at the FA now,\" said Roger Burden last week. His enthusiasm was last night rewarded with a supporting role to the FA's chairman Geoff Thompson. A former chairman of the building society turned Lloyds TSB subsidiary Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, Burden's rise through the ranks of the FA council to be elected to its main board has been on a fast track. Having been a member of the FA's compliance committee as recently as three years ago, he joined and then became chairman of the influential national game board. He sided with the right people in the process that led to the former FA chief executive Adam Crozier's resignation late in 2002. professional game board. It appears his payback has been realised. While Thompson has been sidelined to concentrate on overseas concerns, domestic considerations will now become his remit, alongside his professional game board counterpart Dave Richards. Dave Richards Regarded as one of the game's best administrators, that the former Sheffield Wednesday chairman retained his post within the Premier League executive despite the club's plummet through the leagues is a testament to his survival instincts. Though Eriksson was exonerated, Richards's appointment to the back-up role to the FA chairman Geoffrey Thompson may further isolate the England coach. He has apparently been unimpressed by the Swede's failure to deliver a significant return on his \u00a34m salary and did not shy away from putting his thoughts on the record when the current scandal broke. \"The board will want explanations. When you start telling lies it is very serious,\" Richards said last week. Prior to his nine years as chairman of Wednesday, from which position he was instrumental in the inception in 1993 of the Premier League. No soft touch, he was seen as one of the key movers in the developments in 2002 that led to Crozier's exit."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
