Hence the paralysis consuming the forces of humanity down under as we wallow in our despair at the re-election of our conservatives into office. It\u2019s time for us to face up to the fact that a significant number of Australians big enough to swing an election result the wrong way are, to quote Younge, \u201cracist, xenophobic and discriminatory\u201d. We must concentrate on educating voters \u2013 most of whom are decent and fair-minded citizens \u2013 out of a regressive frame of mind to rise above their insecurities in support of a genuine fair go for all, regardless of their colour, creed, race or gender. It\u2019s a matter of finding much better ways of getting the message across than were in play in that last lot of dismal electioneering. It won\u2019t be easy. But it must be done if good is to triumph over evil in this land of plenty. Terry Hewton Adelaide, South Australia Northern Canada is not a space for colonisation What Gaia Vince calls \u201ccooperating as never before to radically reorganise our world\u201d is a colonialist fantasy (A 4C rise, 31 May). Northern Canada is not an empty space where English planning regulations can be arbitrarily applied. Rather, it is the traditional lands of the Inuit, the Innu, the Dene and other First Nations. It includes the territory of Nunavut, whose consensus form of government upholds Inuit values. Did Vince consider whether Canada\u2019s First Nations want \u201ccompact, efficient, high-rise cities with reflective roofs\u201d and billions of settlers on their traditional lands? The environmental crisis shows that those who ignore Indigenous culture do so to the detriment of all. Grand Chief John P Kelly seized the irony of the situation back in 1977 in his presentation to the Royal Commission on the Northern Environment. He said: \u201cYour leaders are telling you to prepare for a less wasteful and more natural existence, while at the same time destroying my people\u2019s efficient and non-destructive lifestyle.\u201d Xander I Selene Outremont, Qu\u00e9bec, Canada \u2022 In view of the climate emergency eloquently delineated in your story, much of the rest of the news looks totally absurd. Billionaires flying to the moon. Nasa flying to the moon. Unscrupulous, tech-savvy populists undermining democracy by duping millions. A queue of people waiting to summit Everest. Abortion bans. Brexit. A gaggle of deluded hopefuls wanting to succeed Theresa May. All insanities, distractions. Nero fiddling while Rome burned. Edward Butterworth Victoria, British Columbia, Canada European-minded people must start to organise In his article We mobile citizens deserve to be heard in the European Union (10 May), Alberto Alemanno gets to the crux of the matter. Those who are most European in mindset have very little political clout. National interests hold sway to the detriment of EU understanding and co-operation. Brexit is a clear example of the dangers of this trend. We are also a European family, born in one country, working in another, while having residence and retirement in another. We suggest that we all find a way through social media to politically mobilise other open-minded Europhiles. Thanks for bringing this crucial question to light. Let\u2019s work on it together. Katrina Osborn Montrej\u00e9au, France Why do so many mediocre men rise to the top? Isn\u2019t it just a case of the Peter Principle, enunciated some 50 years ago, where people get promoted till they reach their natural level of incompetence? (Oliver Burkeman, Why do so many mediocre men rise to the top? It\u2019s more than sexism, 24 May). After all, we\u2019re all probably mediocre at some level, and women may just be more perceptive of this than men. Malcolm Faddy Maleny, Queensland, Australia Prepare for the future \u2013 or get ready for a dunking Thank you for the early sea-level rise warning of The Damned Village (24 May). I spent my childhood close to sea-level near the village of Saltmarsh, East Yorkshire, which through global heating will eventually return to being salt marsh. Yet, as with Brexit, I\u2019m astonished at the lack of British preparedness for future problems. A stop-gap solution might be the hiring of King Canute and a little Dutch boy able to put his finger in the dyke. Douglas Porteous Victoria, British Columbia, Canada"}, "isHosted": false}}}
