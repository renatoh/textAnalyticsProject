After almost 30 years of teaching us how to cook, Smith is retiring from food to concentrate on Norwich City, the football club she owns. Smith's shock announcement that she is \"reciped out\" will come as a blow to the BBC, where her shows enjoy a loyal following. Her last series, How to Cook Part 3, averaged 3.8 million viewers on BBC2 - almost four times as many as Nigella Lawson's latest cookery programme on Channel 4. \"I just cannot think of any more recipes right now. I've been doing it for 30 years and I've had enough. I'm 60 and I've decided to do something else with my life,\" she told the London Evening Standard. \"No more television or books. This football club and these people are my life and I'm having fun and I'm devoting myself to Norwich football club and that's it!\" Smith, who first began broadcasting cookery programmes in 1974, said people's attitudes to cooking have changed immeasurably over the past 30 years with many more men interested. But she lamented the demise of traditional cooking and warned that the current obsession with trendy TV chefs could not last. \"What's happened to the amateur cook in the country house? Or that lady down the pub who only the locals knew about and who cooked up a storm? Now everyone wants to be on TV. The bubble will burst. I know it will,\" she predicted. Smith's cookery books and programmes have made her a multimillionaire and she is easily the most successful of the current generation of TV chefs. Her Christian name even made an appearance in Collins' dictionary thanks to the phrase \"doing a Delia\". But despite her schoolmarmish image [Egon Ronay described her approach as the \"missionary position\" of cookery], Smith is no stranger to controversy. She caused a storm two years ago when she spoke out against her BBC colleagues, saying she \"hated\" Gary Rhodes' programmes and describing Food and Drink host Anthony Worrall Thompson as \"dreadful, just repulsive\". The tactic backfired when Worrall Thompson responded by describing her as the Volvo of cookery and calling her rude, cold, scripted and lacking in personality. Now Smith, who turned down a peerage from Tony Blair, appears to have put old rivalries behind her. \"I got into a lot of trouble over that,\" she said today. \"I was caught out. I think Anthony is fun. And now I have a Volvo outside! It was given to me. I feel very relaxed about it.\""}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
