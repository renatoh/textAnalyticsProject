One group of supporters, who wish to remain anonymous, told the Guardian that a set of Cameroon fans had been allowed to move from their allocated seats and gather near them. Initially the atmosphere was good. \u201cCameroon fans next to us were in full voice, creating a great atmosphere,\u201d they said. \u201cThere were a few issues with the stewards early on because they were in the wrong seats but they continued to sing and cheer.\u201d Usually the lack of segregation of fans is not a problem in women\u2019s football but, as tensions rose on the pitch, Cameroonian frustration at VAR decisions was reflected in the stands. \u201cOnce the VAR decisions happened, the atmosphere soured off the pitch as much as on the pitch,\u201d reported the England supporters. \u201cSome fans became quite aggressive with stewards, one or two pushed stewards and were led out. There was also verbal abuse aimed at anybody in Fifa gear on the pitch at half-time. \u201cJust as people calmed down, the second-half disallowed goal kicked it all off again. It didn\u2019t help that Fifa kept showing the replays on screen. A couple of people threw cups on to the pitch at one point. We felt safe, just very uncomfortable. \u201cThe aggression and hostility was very much aimed at Fifa but I think not knowing what was going to happen on the pitch and how that could impact the fans was a little nervy. It\u2019s not something we\u2019ve ever experienced before at a game. Security lined the steps between our stand and theirs and officials escorted us out of the stadium through the VIP area.\u201d Fifa said in a statement: \u201cThe post-match debrief highlighted that a number of Cameroon fans had moved to the seats behind the team benches during the match in order to create a \u2018fan block\u2019. \u201c This required management by stadium stewards who, in the interests of all spectators, moved other ticket holders into hospitality seating. Although there was some verbal exchange between Cameroon supporters and stewards, there has been no report of any physical confrontation.\u201d Fifa is expected to comment further on events around the match, which included Cameroon players twice engulfing the referee and refusing to restart the game following the intervention of VAR. The president of the women\u2019s football committee at the Confederation of African Football, Isha Johansen, who is president of the Sierra Leone FA, said: \u201cWhilst remaining proud of our African teams that participated in the Fifa Women\u2019s World Cup, yesterday\u2019s match between England and Cameroon reflected badly, not only on African women\u2019s football, but African football on the whole. \u201cIt is an issue which will be addressed and dealt with, at the appropriate levels of governance.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
