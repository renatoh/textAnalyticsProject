Barcelona: Bonano, Christanval, Andersson, de Boer, Coco, Luis Enrique, Gabri, Xavi, Cocu, Rivaldo, Kluivert. 1 Welcome to Anfield where Liverpool begin their quest to escape from the so-called \"Group of Death\" against Barcelona. Liverpool kick off, with three Owen and Heskey re-united up front. 3 Danny Murphy breaks down the right past Cocu and finds Heskey in the box, but the big man's touch deserts him. 4 Barcelona win a free-kick within Rivaldo range after a foul by Johan Arne Riise. Sure enough the Brazilian takes it and finds the target, but Jerzy Dudek makes a comfortable save. 8 Great move by Liverpool, again instigated by Murphy. The England midfielder finds Vladimir Simcer on the right, who crosses first time to Heskey in the penalty area. Heskey just connects, but shoots straight at goalkeeper Bonano. 11 Liverpool are looking comfortable against their illustrious visitors, with Murphy and Gary McAllister winning plenty of possession in midfield and Heskey finding space behind the channels. 15 Barcelona down to ten men as Luis Enrique hobbles off. 17 Substitution: Overmars for Luis Enrique A blow for Barcelona with the enforced withdrawal of their captain Luis Enrique with a recurrence of an injury to his left hamstring. 19 McAllister takes a free-kick for Liverpool which he floats into the penalty area and Heskey heads wide. 22 A free-kick to Liverpool on the edge of the penalty area after Frank de Boer pulled back Heskey when the last man. De Boer is booked. Riise, with the crowd chanting his name, strikes the ball straight into the wall. 25 Barcelona enjoy their first dominant period of possession, but Liverpool remain patient and the attack breaks down. 27 GOAL A great finish by Michael Owen with almost his first touch of the game, typical of the little man. Owen, playing on the last man, timed his run onto an angled Smicer throughball from the left to perfection, and deposited it in the bottom left-hand corner with one clean, clinical touch. A wonderful goal from a great playing operating at his peak - it is his eighteenth of the season. 31 Liverpool continue to press despite holding the advantage, as Barcelona seem a little shellshocked. 35 Steveb Gerrard shoots past Barcelona's right-hand upright. 39 A probing run by Owen from deep puts Barcelona under more pressure. Owen beat Cocu in the box, causing a scramble, and Heskey nearly finds Murphy six yards out. 41 GOAL Barcelona equalise against the run of play courtesy of another piece of world class finishing. Overmars found Rivaldo on the edge of the box, who diverted the ball to Patrick Kluivert, allowing the big Dutchman to finish first time with a right-foot volley. 1-1. 44 Barcelona are ending the half the stronger, and Liverpool need half-time. One minute of added time. 46 Dudek makes a good save from Overmars Barcelona look to turn the screw. Half-time: 1-1 A fair score at the interval, with Barcelona having most of the possession but Liverpool appearing to carry the greater threat, at least until the final five minutes. The pace of Owen and Heskey is causing Barcelona problems at the back, but the home side need to be wary of the danger caused by Kluivert, Overmars and Rivaldo at the other end. 47 Heskey, playing his best game for some time, is again in the thick of things, winning a tbrow-in near the right byline. 48 Liverpool win a free-kick, but McAlliester's delivery is poor. 49 Barcelona again demonstrate their potency on the break, with Dudek forced to make a good save with his feet from Kluivert after he was played in by Overmars. The Dutchmen are causing Liverpool problems. 55 Barcelona are controlling the game, with Gabri and Xavi keeping possession effortlessly in midfield. The Anfield crowd has gone quiet. 58 Substitution: Rochemback for Gabri Barcelona throw on the 19-year-old Brazilian international signed for \u00a311m in the summer. 59 Riise breaks down the left, but fails to find Heskey in the box. 60 A great chance for Liverpool and that rarest of events, a missed opportunity by Owen. Riise's left foot is again the source, but after beating his man Owen drags the bouncing ball across the face of goal. A difficult chance. 64 Liverpool's confidence has returned and they are going at Barcelona as the game opens up. 65 GOAL A great finish to a wonderful move from Barcelona, with the substitute Rochemback crisply hitting the ball home from 25 yards after being fed by Kluivert. An excellent strike. 66 Substitution: Fowler for Heskey With Liverpool a goal down and struggling to win possession, the Reds need some divine inspiration from the man the fans call God. 69 Substitution: Patrick Berger for McAllister The Czech international moves alongside Murphy and Gerrard into a three-man midfield, with Smicer moving up just behind the front two. 72 Murphy strikes the ball over the Barcelona wall, but over the bar as well after winning a free-kick. 76 Rivaldo launches a speculative effort from 40 yards, but it drifts harmlessly pasty Dudek. Barcelona look comfortable however, and are controlling possession with Liverpool unable to muster a threat. 79 A scramble in the Barcelona penalty area following another Riise cross, but Murphy is held off by de Boer. 80 Substitution: Jari Litmanen for Smicer The Finnish international comes on against his former club, as Liverpool search desperately for am equaliser. 83 Barcelona are playing keep ball, as Liverpool struggle to even get a touch. 84 GOAL Another great goal from the Catalan giants, and the final chapter in the footballing lesson Liverpool have been given. Overmars is released down the middle, and once away he is never caught, rounding Dudek and calmly side-footing into an empty net. 87 The crowd start to leave Anfield, unwilling to watch the conclusion to their team's first defeat under caretaker manager Phil Thompson. 89 Subsitution: Michael Reizieger for Kluivert 90 Two minutes to be added as Barcelona look to play out time. Full time: Liverpool 1 - Barcelona 3 A sobering night for Liverpool, as an excellent second-half performance from Barcelona condemned them to only their second defeat in the European Cup at Anfield. Barcelona's passing, movement and finishing was superior from the moment Patrick Kluivert cancelled out Michael Owen's opener in the 41st minute, and their fluid, yet controlled, football was a joy to watch. Phil Thompson will soon be picking up the phone to call Gerard Houllier, and he could be kept on the line for some time."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
