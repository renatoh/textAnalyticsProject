Mamadou Sakho took a seat in an executive box on Saturday and, worryingly for Klopp before the Europa League semi-final, he will remain nothing more than a formidable distraction for the foreseeable future. The threat of a lengthy ban hangs over Sakho for failing a drug test submitted after Liverpool\u2019s Europa League game at Manchester United on 17 March. A fat-burning substance is reportedly what contravened Uefa\u2019s rules \u2013 if confirmed, a six- to 12-month suspension is likely \u2013 and it is believed Brendan Rodgers dropped the \u00a319m defender against Stoke City and Bournemouth at the start of the season for being overweight. Sakho has until Tuesday to request that his B sample is tested and provide an explanation to Uefa. Only then will Klopp, who decided with the club\u2019s hierarchy not to consider Sakho for selection while Uefa investigates, comment on the controversy. It is the last thing the Liverpool manager needs with Villarreal on Thursday and three more key players \u2013 Divock Origi, Emre Can and the captain Jordan Henderson \u2013 sidelined through injury. Blowing a two-goal lead against relegation-threatened Newcastle United was in keeping with Klopp\u2019s day. \u201cWe cannot change it,\u201d he said of Liverpool\u2019s injury list. \u201cThe whole season was very intensive, we never gave up, so it was not a case of being too intensive. We are close. In exactly the same season, with not a second of better football, Sunderland, Southampton, and now Newcastle. Seven points more and we are challenging for something. You have to accept it. \u201cThe players are not injured because they are tired. In a moment, it happens. Hendo was different to Emre. Divock was a senseless challenge, he [Ramiro Funes Mori] didn\u2019t need to do it. It happened. But the momentum is not about having the best squad ready to play. Momentum is to be ready to fight. Villarreal also have had a lot of games, they have to fight in the league, they play after our game against Real Sociedad and have a little fight for the Champions League. We need to be prepared. It isn\u2019t about always having the best players but being perfectly prepared for our next game. Then, we can go on.\u201d While Klopp called for fight from Liverpool, Rafael Ben\u00edtez appealed for belief and passion from Newcastle. The two managers have different objectives for the rest of the season but as one runs out of options and the other out of games, both believe character will determine whether they are achieved. Hope is growing around Ben\u00edtez\u2019s team, in tandem with form, team cohesion and their results, but with only Crystal Palace, Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur to play it may have arrived too late. Just like their manager, who received a rapturous reception from both sets of supporters at Anfield. Liverpool cruised to a two-goal lead at the interval as Daniel Sturridge punished weak marking with a fine goal and Adam Lallana ended a flowing move with an outstanding finish into the top corner from 20 yards. Newcastle\u2019s initial approach betrayed the lack of belief in a team that had lost their past nine away league matches. But then Simon Mignolet flapped at Vurnon Anita\u2019s cross, Papiss Ciss\u00e9 headed in, and the visitors were rejuvenated. Jack Colback\u2019s deflected finish after another cross from the right caused panic in the Sakho-less Liverpool rearguard delivered their first point on the road since 13 December. \u201cWe talked at half-time about having nothing to lose,\u201d Ben\u00edtez said. \u201cI think the reaction of the players was fine. I\u2019m pleased we have the point. The first half was concerning about the mistakes we were making but the reaction is the main positive thing we can take from this game. \u201cThere are three important games to play and if we can play like we did in the second half then fine. I know we have to improve on the ball but if we have the same spirit we can keep the momentum. \u201cThe players have belief. They know we can change things and it is easier for me to change the positions of the players when we have to \u2013 to press here, press there \u2013 maybe play counterattack. They have a better idea but you need time.\u201d Man of the match Vurnon Anita (Newcastle United)"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/sport", "pillarName": "Sport"}}}
