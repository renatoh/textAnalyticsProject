Addressing a rally in Manchester alongside Corbyn to coincide with the Conservative party conference, Terry Pullinger, deputy general secretary of Communication Workers\u2019 Union (CWU), said Corbynmania \u201calmost makes you want to celebrate the fact Labour lost the election\u201d. His comments were immediately greeted with dismay by Corbyn\u2019s Labour party colleagues. \u201cHow depressing,\u201d tweeted Rachel Reeves, former shadow work and pensions secretary, who refused to serve with Corbyn. Wes Streeting, the new MP for Ilford North wrote on Twitter: \u201cTell that to woman who wept in my surgery last week because of tax credit cuts. My words aren\u2019t suitable for Twitter.\u201d Addressing a CWU-organised rally at Manchester cathedral that was so oversubscribed that thousands spilled out in front of a second stage outside, Pullinger told those inside the church: \u201cIt\u2019s unacceptable that the political debate has got so narrow. \u201cSince Thatcher, that conventional wisdom says it has to be the free market, there has to be competition and there\u2019s no other way \u2013 and anyone who says different is barmy, or non intelligent. \u201cWe\u2019ve been desperate to see that conventional wisdom blown apart and we have by Jeremy Corbyn.\u201d He added: \u201cActually now it makes you want to celebrate the fact that Labour lost the election.\u201d Speaking to the overspill group, former postman Pullinger suggested the general election loss was good because it \u201cwidened the political debate\u201d. He added: \u201cIt has blown it wide open and is one of the greatest things I have seen in all my years in a trade union.\u201d He was followed by Corbyn, who was greeted with wild applause as he insisted he was determined to beat the Conservatives. \u201cOur party is committed to doing things in a very different way. I want us to win an election as soon as it comes. We may have to wait until 2020 to do that but I\u2019ll tell you this, the election victory of 2020 won\u2019t be won in the three or four weeks leading up to that election date itself. It will be won by winning the ideas, the imagination, the hope, the optimism, the brains, the hearts and minds of every ordinary person in this country,\u201d he said, prompting whoops and loud applause. \u201cLook around you, here outside the cathedral in Manchester. We are all basically normal, decent, ordinary human beings who want to see a society and a world that actually does care for all. That is the fundamental principle of what the Labour party is all about.\u201d He added: \u201cIt\u2019s my pride and pleasure to be able to work with you in this campaign. Because every campaign excites more people, more people get involved, more people open their eyes to the possibility of the kind of world we can live in. We are going to win on this one, I know that. We\u2019re going to be strong on this one. We\u2019re going to be brave on this one.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
