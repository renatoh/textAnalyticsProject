Greek officials insist, however, that Greece does \"not have to access the market any time soon\". Petros Christodoulou, head of the country's public debt management office, told the Guardian: \"This allows us to access it when conditions are favourable for the benefit of the Hellenic republic and our investors.\" Greece had planned to raise \u20ac5bn, as it needs to refinance \u20ac20bn before the end of May, but changed its mind after reports of German resistance to any potential bailout. The Greek prime minister, George Papandreou, is to meet Germany's Angela Merkel on Friday, hoping to gain more support from Europe's largest economy. \"It's likely they will wait until after the Merkel meeting,\" said Elisabeth Afseth, a credit analyst at Evolution Securities. \"It might be a bit suspicious if they came tomorrow saying they were raising money, just before a big announcement.\" Unconfirmed reports that the European Union is working on a \u20ac25bn plan to help Greece if needed helped Greek debt markets improve today, when the premium for Greek 10-year bonds over German debt narrowed to 311 basis points (3.11 percentage points), the lowest since 15 February, according to Bloomberg. The price that investors pay to protect themselves against a potential Greek default also plunged by 28.5 basis points to 335.5, the lowest since 27 January, according to CMA DataVision. Investors are still likely to demand rates of interest of as much as 7% or 8% to compensate for any risks. Bondholders are also wary about delays as Greece needs to refinance some debt in two months. \"European countries will have to recognise they will have to pay for the amounts they have to borrow \u2013 offering yields of 8% or 9% perhaps,\" said Shah, of London &amp; Capital Asset Management. That level of interest is almost twice as much as the yield on UK 10-year bonds, and almost three times that of Germany's. Competition between governments needing to raise billions of pounds this year may also force them to offer juicier returns, investors said. \"There will be indigestion with all that supply \u2013 you just have to wait for this indigestion before increasing your exposure,\" Shah said."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
