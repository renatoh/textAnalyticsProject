Barbara Vavalidis is suing Dr Peter Wheeler, a society doctor in London who was Princess Diana\u2019s personal physician, over the death of her husband, Stefanos, from liver failure in 2016. She claims Wheeler, who has treated other members of the royal family as well as celebrities, displayed \u201carrogance, prolonged carelessness and negligence\u201d in the care he provided to her husband. Her legal action centres on Wheeler\u2019s alleged lack of supervision of her Greek banker husband\u2019s use of methotrexate, a highly toxic drug usually used to treat cancer which he was taking for psoriasis. Speaking for the first time about her loss and the lawsuit, Vavalidis said the case should act as a warning to people thinking about paying for a private GP rather than using an NHS one. \u201cI would have thought that the person using a private GP practice thinks that it\u2019s at least as safe as the NHS, if not safer. Our case is a tragic one and illustrates that that\u2019s not true,\u201d she told the Guardian. Wheeler, who has been a doctor for 42 years, has admitted making a series of crucial mistakes in his care of Vavalidis before he died. They include failing to arrange for his patient to undergo blood tests between 2006 and 2013 to ensure that the drug was not damaging his health and not investigating when Vavalidis was found to have a low platelet count in 2013-14. The doctor, who identified Diana\u2019s body after she died in Paris in August 1997, has admitted that his patient would have lived for another 18 months if he had not made the series of errors. Wheeler has worked for the last 36 years as a family doctor at the Sloane Street Surgery in Knightsbridge, central London, where consultations cost from \u00a3160 upwards. It says: \u201cOur philosophy is to provide the highest standards of professional medical care whilst giving a very personal service to our clients.\u201d His actions involving Vavalidis are being looked into by the General Medical Council, which regulates doctors, and also the Metropolitan police\u2019s special casework investigation team to see whether it should launch a criminal inquiry. \u201cMy husband took methotrexate once a week without fail. But he suffered an almost insidious build-up of health problems like colds and poor sleep. That was the nature of being poisoned \u2013 drip by drip by drip \u2013 over this very long period \u201cThe duty of a doctor is to protect patients from harm. That\u2019s not what we got,\u201d said Barbara Vavalidis. She and her sons Alex and Philip say they do not understand why the GMC has taken no action, despite Wheeler\u2019s admissions and Alex complaining about the doctor\u2019s conduct in May 2016. The GMC refused to comment. They are also concerned why Care Quality Commission inspectors were positive about the quality of care at Sloane Street Surgery when they inspected it in 2011 and 2013. The family are also frustrated at the practice\u2019s failure for many of the years during which the banker was taking methotrexate to have software that would have forced Wheeler to order blood tests on him before prescribing him further doses of the drug. That shows that private medical care is not necessarily as safe as that from NHS GPs, they say. The practice has since installed the software, which is standard in NHS GP surgeries. Wheeler declined to comment, on the advice of the Medical Defence Union, his legal representatives. The surgery said it could not comment either. Russell Levy, the family\u2019s solicitor, said: \u201cThe case matters first, of course, because it demonstrates persistent repeated neglect by a general practitioner in the care of his patient over a period of 13 years. \u201cSo the wider question is, why wasn\u2019t that picked up? If you put that into the context of the surgery being a highly regarded private surgery, people will tend to assume that the care patients receive from the doctors there is likely to be better than the care patients receive from any ordinary NHS GP practice,\u201d said Levy, a lawyer at Leigh Day solicitors."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
