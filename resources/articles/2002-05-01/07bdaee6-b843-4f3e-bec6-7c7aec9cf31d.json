Barring a two-day monsoon one of them will achieve it, in a game where individual batting enterprise and enthusiastic early-season bowling have tipped the balance from one side to the other. At the close, Yorkshire led by 261 runs with one second-innings wicket in hand. The first day was frenetic - 399 heady runs and 16 wickets. Yesterday was cooler and steadier as the two top sides in last year's championship jostled for advantage. At first Yorkshire threatened to bat Somerset out of the game but late-afternoon wickets hauled the hosts back into contention. For Yorkshire, Michael Lumb took full advantage of the opportunity offered by the nasty facial injury to Matthew Wood in the B&amp;H Cup with his second decent knock of the game. He is an efficient and demonstrative player, but having made his second sixty he scuffed a full-length delivery from the medium-paced wobbler Keith Parsons on to his stumps. He was fourth man out, leaving Anthony McGrath to bat on and post a testing target. Michael Vaughan left to a glorious tumbling catch in the slips by Peter Bowler, Craig White feathered a Simon Francis delivery and Darren Lehmann fell to Ian Blackwell's first ball of the innings. In the morning Blackwell's commanding three-figure knock had ended in anti-climax when he pulled a Bryan Sidebottom long-hop to Lehmann at mid-on, but he gained his revenge when Lehmann shuffled across his stumps to an innocuous full-length ball. Of the centrally contracted players in this game Andy Caddick has shone, while Marcus Trescothick, Vaughan and Matthew Hoggard have yet to fire. Darren Gough, meanwhile, is waiting for his troublesome knee to heal. \"It's unrealistic to say I'll be at Lord's,\" he says. \"I'm playing in a second-team game, bowling five or six overs a spell. If something dramatic happens and I feel a million dollars I might bowl a bit more.\" In his absence, though, a needle match has taken shape in Taunton. \u00b7 You've read the piece, now have your say.
