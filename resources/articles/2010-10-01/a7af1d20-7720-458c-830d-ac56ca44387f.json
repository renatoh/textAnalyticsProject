The Finnish company got into the electronics business in the 60s and for the first 17 years did not make any profit at all. Not a measly markka. Likewise, Toyota is now the world's number one automaker, but as Cambridge economist Ha-Joon Chang points out that success rests upon \"40 years of protection and government subsidies\" to the vehicle industry. Indeed, look across the biggest and most respected companies from Japan and Korea, and you find many examples of investment for the long-term and a willingness to forgo an immediate return. Then you have what Vince Cable calls City \"short-termism\", in which the overwhelming focus is on next quarter's profits and the long view is so much away-day speak rather than boardroom reality. So today's launch by the business secretary of a probe into City practices \u2013 of everything from golden parachutes for company directors to the rules around hedge fund behaviour \u2013 could influence behaviour far outside the Square Mile. Sounds fanciful? Those are certainly not terms Mr Cable is shying away from, with his talk about how his probe is \"vital to the health of the UK economy\". But the emphasis here is on the ifs and coulds. Mr Cable is not the first government minister to rail against the \"spivs and gamblers\" in the business world \u2013 even if he is among the first to have such a beady eye for a glittering phrase. From John Major to Tony Blair to Gordon Brown, prime ministers have carped about City short-termism, and from Adrian Cadbury to Derek Higgs to David Walker, the great and the good have chaired reviews into how companies should be better governed. And Cadbury is still snapped up by a hostile American bidder for just short off \u00a311bn. Nor do last week's proposals from the Takeover Panel give much hope that the tide has turned. Always an insiders' club comprised largely of employees of City banks and law firms taking time off from the office, the panel's big recommendation to stop corporate predators was \u2013 gasp! \u2013 greater transparency and other such tweakery. Let us hope Mr Cable lives up to his previous comments and goes further. He should be considering giving shareholders more voting rights only when they have held stock for a year or so. He should certainly make predatory companies ask their own shareholders before launching any bid. And it would not be a bad idea to stop directors claiming a payout if their companies are bought by another. Such a rule might have made the board at Cadbury pause before selling out to Kraft. The City is one of those places where a change of regime most definitely is required. Mr Cable should bring one in."}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/opinion", "pillarName": "Opinion"}}}
