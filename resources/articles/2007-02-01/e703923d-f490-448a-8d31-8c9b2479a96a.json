Bullies forced me out of the closet. Homophobia in schools in the 1970s was not recognised as such, and there was absolutely no support for me and my gay peers. Wandering around an east London school only recently, I heard the word \"gay\" bandied around as an insult - \"Your trainers are gay\", or \"What have you done to your hair? It's gay\". But in many ways, things have changed for the better. Young gays and lesbians seem to be coming out while still at school - which is a real shift from QBoy's days. Now 28, QBoy is the UK's first openly gay hip hop artist. Known as Marcos Brito to his family and friends, he was the victim of homophobic bullying at school, which he left 12 years ago. As part of a Channel 4 documentary on being gay at school, Coming Out to Class, he talked to schoolchildren about homophobia. One of them was Jamie, now 16, who came out three years ago. \"I have bad memories of school,\" says Jamie. \"I was called Batty Boy, and they used to run their fingers across their throats, threatening to cut me.\" Jamie suffered a fractured skull after he was thrown down the stairs. His parents regularly complained to the school, but little was done. \"Mum used to say to me: 'Can't I have a normal son?'\" \"The problem for gay teenagers,\" says Brito, \"is that if they don't have support at school, and are experiencing homophobia, they often can't talk to their parents about it either, which means they are totally alone.\" And what about gay teachers? Schools Out has been campaigning for lesbian and gay equality in education since 1974. It estimates there are more than 25,000 lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) teachers in the UK, but almost all are too scared to come out, despite research showing that two-thirds of families would be happy for their children to be taught by lesbian or gay teachers. Safe places for staff Sue Sanders, co-chair of Schools Out, believes that, although it is developing work on homophobic bullying in schools, the government has yet to make it clear that all schools should be safe spaces for staff to come out to their students. Nigel Tart is a secondary school maths teacher. During his five years as a supply teacher, he found himself coming out to pupils and staff \"countless times\". \"The kids I can handle,\" he says. \"It's the school management I feel let down by.\" Tart believes that the reason so many headteachers shy away from tackling homophobia towards teachers is a fear of adverse reactions from parents. \"I think some of them dread homophobic parents demanding to know why their children are being taught by a gay man,\" he says. \"But in my experience, very few object.\" For young people, homophobia left unchecked can mean a matter of life and death. One gay organisation estimates that more than a quarter of young gay people have attempted suicide and one-third have self-harmed. Thirteen-year-old Nathan was subjected to such abuse at school that he contemplated taking his own life. At one stage, he would not dare to leave the house because the kids on the corner would scream insults, throw rocks at him or chase him down the road. One night, at his Nan's house, he took a saw to the bathroom to cut himself. \"I thought I couldn't take another day of feeling so alone and isolated, as though no one could ever help me,\" says Nathan. Is the government doing enough? Most people I spoke to think not. The Department for Education and Skills is currently promoting the \"make the difference\" campaign to counter all bullying within schools, and supports the specific guidance on tackling homophobic bullying set out in the National Healthy School Standard publication Stand Up for Us. The department is also preparing comprehensive web-based guidance on preventing and responding to homophobic bullying, according to a spokesperson. But, says Tart: \"The police are light-years ahead of the DfES in dealing with homophobia. And yet, education should be the most progressive institution.\" Different for girls Lucy (not her real name) is 14 and considering coming out as a lesbian at school. She is currently receiving support and advice from a gay helpline, and feels that unless she tells her school friends soon, she will lose the courage to do so. \"I think my friends will be OK,\" she says, \"because there is a gay lad at the school, and he is seen as quite cool now.\" She fears, however, that lesbians might not be as accepted as gays. The consequences for lesbian and gay children of not being supported in school are far-reaching. Beatbullying, a national charity, found that almost two-thirds of lesbian and gay young people who have experienced bullying feign illness or truant from school to escape the impact of homophobia. More than 90% say the reason for not coming out to school friends is because they fear bullying. Some parents of gay children are taking action. Jamie's father, Declan Pratt, is appalled at his son's treatment by the bullies, and the apparent complacency of the teaching staff. When Pratt complained to the head, he was told that Jamie \"made himself the centre of attention\". \"No child should have to put up with what Jamie did,\" says Pratt. \"It is not their fault they are picked on, and it's high time the schools stopped homophobia altogether.\" \"Rightly, government and independent funding organisations have begun to seriously address the issue of bullying in our schools,\" says Emma-Jane Cross, chief executive of Beatbullying. \"But no one will actually fund the prevention work with young people, providing them with the tools and support they so desperately need. No one, it seems, will help the victims of homophobic bullying.\" In recent years, youth groups dedicated to the LGBT community have begun cropping up. The Metro Centre, based in Greenwich, London, offers one-to-one counselling and support, social activities, and discussion groups on social issues, including healthcare and self-esteem. \"LGB young people want what we all are entitled to as human beings,\" says Joel Korn, youth and statutory school liaison officer at the Metro Centre, \"which is to feel safe from violence in the community they live in; to feel looked after by their parents or carers; to have validation for their sexual orientation from those that they love.\" For Tart, the only way forward is for headteachers to take the lead in tackling homophobia, with consistent support from the government. \"At the moment, most of the good practice in schools is led by individual LGBT teachers. That should not be expected,\" says Tart. \"We would not leave tackling racism to only black teachers.\" Jamie is now happy, and feels proud of his sexuality. \"I wouldn't want to be straight,\" he says, \"but the teachers need to do something to stop homophobia. Unless I shouted out, 'Don't call me queer', the teachers didn't even notice.\" \u00b7 Coming Out to Class begins on Channel 4, 10.30-11.30am on February 26"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/news", "pillarName": "News"}}}
