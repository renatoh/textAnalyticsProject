Jobs &amp; Money research shows that billions invested in supposedly minimal risk \"high income bonds\" is now in jeopardy. These bonds depend on stock indices or shares staying above a \"safety zone\". Many have now dropped to dangerous levels. We looked at 80 bonds, mostly underpinned by futures and options traded on highly volatile exchanges such as the Chicago Board of Trade. Our research, based on data from specialist analysts Future Value Consultants looked at bonds promising a guaranteed income, issued between June 1999 and June 2001. Sales of these bonds net millions for high volume mailshot brokers who rarely gave advice on suitability. Virtually all the high income bonds are now in a high loss zone - except for a few linked to the Halifax housing index. Some investors now need share prices to increase by a third to a half over the next 18 months to two years. And in at least one case, values must double before March 2003 to ensure a full capital return. The bonds guarantee a high income for a fixed period, typically 10%, often with tax benefits. But while the guaranteed income is invariably highlighted in a huge typeface, risks to capital are relegated to small print. Bond firms counter warnings with statis tics showing events needed to trigger losses had previously never happened. Now, thanks to falling stock markets, the risk is real. The safety nets are full of holes. Once breached, protection is often lost forever, and then capital losses can mount up faster than falls in shares. The Canada Life high income bond linked to the Eurostoxx 50 index, launched in July 1999, paying 10%. But the index has fallen 20%. If this remains unchanged by July 2002, savers will get back 40% of their capital. The Zurich five-year Extra Income Bond started in September 1999 paying 8.5%. It is based on the Swiss Market Index which must grow 5% a year to repay capital in full. The SMI is 20% down. Canada Life launched a 10.5% bond linked to US hi- tech index Nasdaq in March 2000 with a 20% safety net. With the Nasdaq index down by two-thirds, and with the bond having a gearing of 3.33 to one, investors have lost all their money unless Nasdaq recovers. Nasdaq must double to ensure a full capital return by the time the bond matures in 18 months' time. Scottish Life International 10.5% Income &amp; Growth, launched in March 2000 and based on the Eurostoxx 50 has a 27% safety net. But the index has fallen 39%. Some investors are now around 70% down. Scottish Mutual offered a 10% bond for three years based on Nasdaq in November 2000. The index has fallen some 50%. Scottish Widows offered four Extra Income &amp; Growth plans between October 2000 and May 2001 netting almost \u00a31bn. These depend on 30 individual stocks. The first two bonds have a 20% safety net for each stock. These include hi-tech and telecom disasters such as ARM Holdings, BT, CMG, Cable &amp; Wireless, Logica, Marconi, Misys and Vodafone. Without a substantial recovery in each falling share, investors will have lost around a third. Losses in the more recent bonds are lower. Jobs &amp; Money highlighted the danger in some of the Scottish Widows bonds last November. \"I wouldn't touch them with a bargepole,\" said IFA Brian Dennehy of Dennehy, Weller, at the time. Lesley Dunbar at Scottish Widows defends the funds. \"All equity funds will have fallen. This is higher risk and we have never tried to get around this,\" she says. Canada Life has now given up issuing the bonds. \"We stopped them a year ago after our Nasdaq-based Platinum bond proved unattractive although it seemed a good idea at the time,\" says Stephen Tsu at Canada Life. \"We think the risks should be in big letters and not hidden. We would rather not sell these things than have disappointed customers,\" he adds. \u0095 Do you have concerns about your high income bond?
