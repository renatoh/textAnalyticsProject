She will be the first woman to serve in the position, established more than 300 years ago. Speaking to the Guardian after the announcement, Oswald said that after a \u201cdistinctly unsettling process\u201d she was \u201cvery pleased, daunted, grateful to my nominators\u201d. \u201cI look forward to thinking about all forms of poetry,\u201d she said, \u201cbut particularly the fugitive airborne forms.\u201d Celebrated for their exploration of nature and myth, Oswald\u2019s nine books of poetry have already brought her prizes including the TS Eliot, Griffin and Costa poetry awards. The former poet laureate Carol Ann Duffy has hailed her as \u201cthe best UK poet now writing, bar none\u201d, while Jeanette Winterson has called her Ted Hughes\u2019s \u201crightful heir\u201d, a poet not \u201cof footpaths and theme parks, but the open space and untamed life that waits for us to find it again\u201d. Oswald\u2019s dreamlike visions of the countryside are rooted in acute observation of animals, plants and the landscape, while her reworkings of ancient stories are filled with humanity and compassion. Born in 1966, she studied classics at Oxford, working as a gardener alongside her burgeoning career as a poet. Her debut, The Thing in the Gap-Stone Stile, won the Forward first collection prize in 1996, and her polyphonic evocation of a river, Dart, took the TS Eliot award in 2002. She teamed up with the illustrator Jessica Greenman for Weeds and Wild Flowers, which won the Ted Hughes prize in 2010, and examined war and death in 2011 with her filleting of Homer\u2019s Iliad, Memorial. Oswald withdrew from the TS Eliot award that year in protest at the private investment management company sponsoring the prize, then took the Costa award and the Griffin prize with her 2016 collection, Falling Awake. The former poet laureate Andrew Motion, who was one of the 167 people to nominate Oswald, declared himself \u201cextremely pleased\u201d. \u201cPleased because she\u2019s one of the best poets writing at the moment and richly deserves the honour of the position,\u201d Motion said, \u201cbecause it\u2019s beyond high time that the post was taken by a woman, and because she has some very interesting and energetic ideas for the role.\u201d Established in 1708, the Oxford position is one of the UK\u2019s top accolades for poetry, with former professors including Seamus Heaney, Robert Graves and WH Auden. Candidates must win the support of at least 50 Oxford graduates and be \u201cof sufficient distinction to be able to fulfil the duties of the post\u201d, which include one lecture a term during an appointment lasting four years. The poets Andrew McMillan and Todd Swift also appeared on the shortlist. Oswald received 1,046 of the votes cast, with McMillan taking 210 and Swift trailing with 58. The contest was marred by controversy surrounding Swift, who founded the independent poetry imprint Eyewear Publishing in 2012. Last year the Bookseller reported that the firm\u2019s contracts included clauses forbidding authors from contacting the Society of Authors, with the imprint\u2019s behaviour on social media also attracting criticism. The poets Claire Trevien and Aaron Kent wrote to Oxford University suggesting Swift should be removed from the contest, arguing that he was \u201cunsuitable for the role of Oxford professor of poetry, and the level of prestige it offers\u201d. This year\u2019s election was not the first to become embroiled in scandal. The poet Ruth Padel became the first woman ever elected to the position in 2009, but was forced to resign within two weeks after it emerged she had contacted journalists with allegations of sexual misconduct surrounding fellow shortlistee Derek Walcott. Oswald now promises to create a stir of a quite different kind, focusing on spoken poetry and expanding the role to embrace the city of Oxford as well as the university. Writing in a statement to support her candidacy, the poet outlined plans for \u201cExtreme Poetry Events\u201d including all-night readings, a carnival of translations and a poem circus modelled on John Cage\u2019s anarchic community piece Musicircus. \u201cA book is a wonderfully quiet place,\u201d she wrote, \u201cbut I\u2019ve always thought that poetry, if offered the right occasions, will rise to meet them and that one of our tasks as poets is to invent such occasions for ourselves and for others. I\u2019d be delighted if I could tempt schoolchildren to take part in some of these.\u201d Poetry is \u201can ancient memory system\u201d, Oswald continued, that \u201casks to be heard out loud or at least read in the manner of a musical score\u201d and \u201cpromotes imaginative over rational understanding\u201d, but the medium is currently undergoing radical change. \u201cI see no reason why Instagram poems shouldn\u2019t prove as rewarding as Concrete poems or the visual poems of classical Chinese,\u201d she wrote, \u201cand I\u2019d welcome the chance to invite young poets to engage in discussion about what poetry has been and is becoming.\u201d"}, "isHosted": false, "pillarId": "pillar/arts", "pillarName": "Arts"}}}
