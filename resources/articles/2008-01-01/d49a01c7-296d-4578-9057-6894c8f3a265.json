The 30-year-old came up with the tongue-in-cheek name during her ceramics and glass degree at Buckinghamshire. 'All the work I was doing was about myself. Spending time doing something I love is so self-indulgent, the name makes fun of that.' Gallup's designs have been on the Mighty Boosh, one of her favourite television programmes. 'Two of the characters were decked out in my jewellery. It was exciting, especially as I didn't know they were going to wear it.' She admits to having a mild obsession with tacky ornaments. 'I've always liked things that I know are disgusting. In my work, I take these objects and turn them into something beautiful.' She used to make figurative pieces, but finds jewellery more accessible. 'The sculptures were emotionally cathartic to make but dark and intense; people prefer pretty, decorative things.' Gallup is always absorbed in her work. 'I get carried away. I have to be creative - I get bored so quickly with anything else.'
